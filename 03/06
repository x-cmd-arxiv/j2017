The sensitivity model is particularly appealing since\nrecent strong conditional lower bounds ruled out fast algorithms for many\ndynamic problems, such as shortest paths, reachability, or subgraph\nconnectivity.\n  In this paper we prove conditional lower bounds for sensitivity problems. For\nexample, we show that under the Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture\ncombinatorial algorithms cannot compute the (4/3 - {\\epsilon})-approximate\ndiameter of an undirected unweighted dense graph with truly subcubic\npreprocessing time and truly subquadratic update/query time. This result is\nsurprising since in the static setting it is not clear whether a reduction from\nBMM to diameter is possible. We further show under the BMM conjecture that many\nproblems, such as reachability or approximate shortest paths, cannot be solved\nfaster than by recomputation from scratch even after only one or two edge\ninsertions. We give more lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis and the All Pairs Shortest Paths Conjecture. Many of our lower\nbounds also hold for static oracle data structures where no sensitivity is\nrequired. Finally, we give the first algorithm for the (1 +\n{\\epsilon})-approximate radius, diameter, and eccentricity problems in directed\nor undirected unweighted graphs in case of single edges failures. The algorithm\nhas a truly subcubic running time for graphs with a truly subquadratic number\nof edges; it is tight w.r.t. the conditional lower bounds we obtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 18:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

We prove that DIAMETER-TREE is para-NP-hard for\nany combination of two of these three parameters, and that it is FPT\nparameterized by the three of them. We also prove that the problem can be\nsolved in polynomial time on cactus graphs. This result is somehow surprising\nsince we prove DIAMETER-TREE to be NP-hard on graphs of treewidth two, which is\nbest possible as the problem can be trivially solved on forests. When the\nreload costs satisfy the triangle inequality, Wirth and Steffan (2001) proved\nthat the problem can be solved in polynomial time on graphs with $\\Delta = 3$,\nand Galbiati (2008) proved that it is NP-hard if $\\Delta = 4$. Our results\nshow, in particular, that without the requirement of the triangle inequality,\nthe problem is NP-hard if $\\Delta = 3$, which is also best possible. Finally,\nin the case where the reload costs are polynomially bounded by the size of the\ninput graph, we prove that DIAMETER-TREE is in XP and W[1]-hard parameterized\nby the treewidth plus $\\Delta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 23:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

These protocols\nare based on a combinatorial object that we call Affectance-selective Families.\nOur approach combines an engineering solution with theoretical guarantees. That\nis, we provide a method to characterize the network with a global measure of\naffectance based on measurements of interference in the specific deployment\narea. Then, our protocols distributedly produce an ad-hoc transmissions\nschedule for dissemination. In the randomized protocol only the network\ncharacterization is needed, whereas the deterministic protocol requires full\nknowledge of affectance. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on\nschedule length. We also present simulations of a real network-deployment area\ncontrasting the performance of our randomized protocol, which takes into\naccount affectance, against previous work for interference models that ignore\nsome physical constraints. The striking improvement in performance shown by our\nsimulations show the importance of utilizing a more physically-accurate model\nof interference that takes into account other effects beyond distance to\ntransmitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 02:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

The wavefunctions of\nlow-lying states are constructed as a superposition of a set of relativistic\nmean-field states with different values of quadrupole deformation parameter.\nThe projections onto both particle number and angular momentum are\nconsidered.[Results] The $\\Lambda$ binding energies in both ND and SD states of\n$^{37}_{\\Lambda}$Ar are studied in the case of the $\\Lambda$ hyperon occupying\n$s, p$, or $d$ state in the spherical limit, respectively. For comparison, four\nsets of nucleon-hyperon point-coupling interactions are used respectively.\nMoreover, the spectra of low-lying states in $^{36}$Ar and\n$^{37}_{\\Lambda_s}$Ar are calculated based on the same nuclear energy density\nfunctional.

A DDW is a data\nframework that accommodates data source changes easily to allow seamless\nquerying to users. Materialized Views (MV) are proven to be an effective\nmethodology to enhance the process of retrieving data from a DDW as results are\npre-computed and stored in it. However, due to the static nature of\nmaterialized views, the level of dynamicity that can be provided at the MV\naccess layer is restricted. As a result, the collection of materialized views\nis not compatible with ever-changing reporting requirements. It is important\nthat the MV collection is consistent with current and upcoming queries. The\nsolution to the above problem must consider the following aspects: (a) MV must\nbe matched against an OLAP query in order to recognize whether the MV can\nanswer the query, (b) enable scalability in the MV collection, an intuitive\nmechanism to prune it and retrieve closely matching MVs must be incorporated,\n(c) MV collection must be able to evolve in correspondence to the regularly\nchanging user query patterns.

One of our approximations\nresults in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the\n$k$-step learning progress.

The in-plane\nstiffness and bulk modulus for $s$-triazine sheet are found to be less than\nthat of heptazine. The reduction can be related to the nature of the covalent\nbonds connecting the adjacent sheets and the number of atoms per unit cell. The\nPoisson's ratio of $s$-triazine is half the value to that of graphene.\nAdditionally, the calculated values of the two critical strains (elastic and\nyielding points) of $s$-triazine sheet are in the same order of magnitude to\nthat for heptazine which was calculated using MD simulations in the literature.\nIt is also demonstrated that $s$-triazine sheet can withstand larger tension in\nthe plastic region.

Towards this problem, we propose a novel Correlative Denoising\nAutoencoder (CoDAE) method by taking correlations between users with multiple\nroles into account to learn robust representations from sparse inputs of\nratings and social networks for recommendation. We develop the CoDAE model by\nutilizing three separated autoencoders to learn user features with roles of\nrater, truster and trustee, respectively. Especially, on account of that each\ninput unit of user vectors with roles of truster and trustee is corresponding\nto a particular user, we propose to utilize shared parameters to learn common\ninformation of the units that corresponding to same users. Moreover, we propose\na related regularization term to learn correlations between user features that\nlearnt by the three subnetworks of CoDAE model. We further conduct a series of\nexperiments to evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets for Top-N\nrecommendation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on rank-sensitive metrics of MAP\nand NDCG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 08:35:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 02:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 06:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

Upcoming weak lensing surveys such as Euclid will provide an\nunprecedented opportunity to quantify the geometry and topology of the cosmic\nweb, in particular in the vicinity of lensing clusters. Aims. Understanding the\nconnectivity of the cosmic web with unbiased mass tracers, such as weak\nlensing, is of prime importance to probe the underlying cosmology, seek\ndynamical signatures of dark matter, and quantify environmental effects on\ngalaxy formation. Methods. Mock catalogues of galaxy clusters are extracted\nfrom the N-body PLUS simulation. For each cluster, the aperture multipolar\nmoments of the convergence are calculated in two annuli (inside and outside the\nvirial radius). By stacking their modulus, a statistical estimator is built to\ncharacterise the angular mass distribution around clusters. The moments are\ncompared to predictions from perturbation theory and spherical collapse.\nResults. The main weakly chromatic excess of multipolar power on large scales\nis understood as arising from the contraction of the primordial cosmic web\ndriven by the growing potential well of the cluster. Besides this boost, the\nquadrupole prevails in the cluster (ellipsoidal) core, while at the outskirts,\nharmonic distortions are spread on small angular modes, and trace the\nnon-linear sharpening of the filamentary structures. Predictions for the signal\namplitude as a function of the cluster-centric distance, mass, and redshift are\npresented.

This motivates\nthat in this paper we consider a mixed Poisson arrival process with arrival\nrates that are resampled every $N^{a}$ time units, where $a> 0$ and $N$ a\nscaling parameter.

Results. From the high-resolution data, we\nfind that the difference of the Ca II H+K lines in- and out-of-transit is only\n0.67 +/- 0.22%, and determine a magnetic filling factor of about 10-15%. From\nthe low-resolution data, we present the first optical transmission spectrum in\nthe 435-755 nm band, which shows a slope consistent with Rayleigh scattering.\nConclusions. After exploring the potential impacts of stellar activity in our\nobservations, we confirm that Rayleigh scattering in an extended\nhydrogen/helium atmosphere is currently the best explanation. Further\nhigh-precision observations that simultaneously cover optical and infrared\nbands are required to answer whether or not clouds and hazes exist at\nhigh-altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 11:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Since the 1980s,\nmany potential clinical applications have arisen using inexpensive portable EIT\ndevices. EIT acquires multiple trans-impedance measurements across the body\nfrom an array of surface electrodes around a chosen imaging slice. The\nconductivity image reconstruction from the measured data is a fundamentally\nill-posed inverse problem notoriously vulnerable to measurement noise and\nartifacts. Most available methods invert the ill-conditioned sensitivity or\nJacobian matrix using a regularized least-squares data-fitting technique. Their\nperformances rely on the regularization parameter, which controls the trade-off\nbetween fidelity and robustness. For clinical applications of EIT, it would be\ndesirable to develop a method achieving consistent performance over various\nuncertain data, regardless of the choice of the regularization parameter. Based\non the analysis of the structure of the Jacobian matrix, we propose a\nfidelity-embedded regularization (FER) method and a motion artifact removal\nfilter. Incorporating the Jacobian matrix in the regularization process, the\nnew FER method with the motion artifact removal filter offers stable\nreconstructions of high-fidelity images from noisy data by taking a very large\nregularization parameter value.

All particles are assumed to have the same mass. The\ntwo-body interactions are repulsive and are assumed to have equal strength in\nboth the Bose-Bose and the Fermi-Boson channels. The particles are confined\nexternally by a harmonic oscillator one-body potential. For the case of four\nparticles, two identical fermions and two identical bosons, we focus on the\nstrongly interacting regime and analyze the system using both an analytical\napproach and DMRG calculations using a discrete version of the underlying\ncontinuum Hamiltonian. This provides us with insight into both the ground state\nand the manifold of excited states that are almost degenerate for large\ninteraction strength. Our results show great variation in the density profiles\nfor bosons and fermions in different states for strongly interacting mixtures.\nBy moving to slightly larger systems, we find that the ground state of balanced\nmixtures of four to six particles tends to separate bosons and fermions for\nstrong (repulsive) interactions. On the other hand, in imbalanced Bose-Fermi\nmixtures we find pronounced odd-even effects in systems of five particles.\nThese few-body results suggest that question of phase separation in\none-dimensional confined mixtures are very sensitive to system composition,\nboth for the ground state and the excited states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 12:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

Since photic interactions are strongly\nwavelength-dependent, a significant effort is being devoted to assess the\nrelative merits of the spectra of the different types of light sources\navailable for use at home and in the workplace. The spectral content of the\nlight reaching the observer eyes in indoor spaces, however, does not depend\nexclusively on the sources: it is partially modulated by the spectral\nreflectance of the walls and surrounding surfaces, through the multiple\nreflections of the light beams along all possible paths from the source to the\nobserver. This modulation can modify significantly the non-visual photic inputs\nthat would be produced by the lamps alone, and opens the way for controlling\n-to a certain extent- the subject's exposure to different regions of the\noptical spectrum.

The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

Indeed the natural way of translating the\nunperturbed momentum by the laser vector potential is no longer possible since\na bound state does not exhibit a plane wave form including explicitely a\nmomentum. The use of a fractal space permits to naturally define a momentum for\na bound wave function. Within this framework, it is shown how the derivation of\nlaser-dressed bound states can be performed.

Extensive experimental results on the\nbenchmark indicate that the new algorithm is able to obtain solutions with\ncompetitive quality and it can be employed on instances with largescale. Work\nof this paper not only proposes a new efficient heuristic, but also provides a\npromising method to improve the efficiency of beam search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 14:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Different sizes of mutant libraries of an antibiotic resistance\ngene, TEM-1 $\\beta$-lactamase in Escherichia coli, were subjected to different\nantibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or\nsurvived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The\ndistribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries- generated by\nerror-prone PCR- followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be\nexplained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial\nmutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles\ncontaining at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present.\nThese genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to\ndescribe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations.\nHence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational\nfitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear\ntrends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all\nmutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were\nconsidered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in\ncontrast to expectations. Furthermore, we show experimentally that alleles\ncarrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher\nresistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation,\nsuggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple\nmutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library\nsizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 14:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We first convert a\ndeep neural network trained in software to a spiking network on the BrainScaleS\nwafer-scale neuromorphic system, thereby enabling an acceleration factor of 10\n000 compared to the biological time domain. This mapping is followed by the\nin-the-loop training, where in each training step, the network activity is\nfirst recorded in hardware and then used to compute the parameter updates in\nsoftware via backpropagation. An essential finding is that the parameter\nupdates do not have to be precise, but only need to approximately follow the\ncorrect gradient, which simplifies the computation of updates. Using this\napproach, after only several tens of iterations, the spiking network shows an\naccuracy close to the ideal software-emulated prototype.

Traditionally,\ntwo ways of handling the problem are used. The first class of methods employs a\ndistance measure on time series (e.g. Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping) and a\nclustering technique (e.g. k-means, k-medoids, hierarchical clustering) to find\nnatural groups in the dataset. It is, however, often not clear whether these\ndistance measures effectively take into account the specific temporal\ncorrelations in these time series. The second class of methods uses the\ninput/output data to identify a dynamic system using an identification scheme,\nand then applies a model norm-based distance (e.g. H2, H-infinity) to find out\nwhich systems are similar. This, however, can be very time consuming for large\namounts of long time series data.

We introduce an online,\ndistributed, supervisor-directed transfer technique for constructing high-level\ncharacterizations of an agent's dynamic learning environment---called\ncontexts---which are used to identify groups of agents operating under\napproximately similar dynamics within a short temporal window. A set of\nsupervisory agents computes contextual information for groups of subordinate\nagents, thereby identifying candidates for experience sharing.

Some mathematical techniques are\nborrowed from quantum mathematics. Generally, belief and action are two parts\nin a decision making process. The uncertainty in belief part is represented by\na superposition of certain states. The uncertainty in actions is represented as\nan extra uncertainty state. The interference effect is produced due to the\nentanglement between beliefs and actions. Basic probability assignment (BPA) of\ndecisions is generated by quantum dynamic modelling. Then BPA of the extra\nuncertain state and an entanglement degree defined by an entropy function named\nDeng entropy are used to measure the interference effect.

The derivations follow the Kaluza Klein theory,\nbut with the constraints required for connections on a U(1) bundle rather than\nfive spacetime dimensions. The non time orientability is seen to justify and\nconstrain Kaluza Klein theories exactly as required to unify gravitation with\nelectromagnetism. Unlike any other schemes, apparent net electric charges arise\nnaturally because the direction of the electric field reverses along a time\nreversing path. The boundary of a time reversing region can therefore have a\nnet electric flux and appear exactly as a region containing an electric charge.\nThe treatment is purely classical, but motivated by links between acausal\nstructures and quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 12:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Furthermore, a theoretical framework parallel to\nmolecular kinetic theory is developed for the systematic description of the\nfinancial market from microscopic dynamics of HFTs. We report first on a\nmicroscopic empirical law of traders' trend-following behavior by tracking the\ntrajectories of all individuals, which quantifies the collective motion of HFTs\nbut has not been captured in conventional order-book models. We next introduce\nthe corresponding microscopic model of HFTs and present its theoretical\nsolution paralleling molecular kinetic theory: Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like\nequations are derived from the microscopic dynamics via the\nBogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. Our model is the first\nmicroscopic model that has been directly validated through data analysis of the\nmicroscopic dynamics, exhibiting quantitative agreements with mesoscopic and\nmacroscopic empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 06:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 14:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

Here, by\nincorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on\na continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and\nlyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent,\nimprovable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond\napproaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we\nfind that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960's to the\nmid 1990's while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of\nblogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and\nfall with blogger age and distance from the equator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 15:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

When the\nperturbation by a WPS modulated with the noise is optimum, the UJT-RO has been\nobserved to produce regular dynamics that mimics the WPS maximum, which is\ntermed as stochastic resonance (SR). Interestingly, when the noise component is\nreplaced by a HFS, the system shows the same SR kind of behavior, which is\ncalled vibrational resonance (VR). Here the system produces the dynamics that\nmimics the WPS resembling the SR assisted by the optimum level of HFS. Both SR\nand VR have been confirmed through PSPICE simulation. The results show that the\nregular dynamics that mimics the WPS in case of HFS modulation is better than\nthe noise perturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 05:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}
