It is thus crucial to understand how initially identical\nsingle cells start to behave differently while assembling in these tight\ncommunities.

When\npassive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesters are present in the network, the\ntransmissions are constrained by both the transmit power limits and the energy\nharvesting requirements. A passive RF energy harvester collects the radiated\nenergy from nearby wireless information transmitters instead of using a\ndedicated wireless power source. It needs multiple transmitters to concentrate\ntheir RF radiation on it because typical electric field strengths are weak. In\nthis paper, strategic games are proposed for the multi-user transmissions.\nFirst, in a non-cooperative game, each transmitter has a best-response strategy\nfor the transmit covariance matrix that follows a multi-level water-filling\nsolution. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists. Secondly, in a cooperative\ngame, there is no need to estimate the proportion of the harvested energy from\neach transmitter. Rather, the transmitters bargain over the unit-reward of the\nenergy contribution. An approximation of the information rate is used in\nconstructing the individual utility such that the problem of network utility\nmaximization can be decomposed and the bargaining process can be implemented\ndistributively. The bargaining solution gives a point of rates that is superior\nto the Nash equilibria and close to the Pareto front. Simulation results verify\nthe algorithms that provide good communication performance while satisfying the\nRF energy-harvesting requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 17:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 17:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

Its active surface will allow us to observe at frequencies of\nup to 116 GHz. At the moment, three receivers, one per focal position, have\nbeen installed and tested. The SRT was officially opened in October 2013, upon\ncompletion of its technical commissioning phase. In this paper, we provide an\noverview of the main science drivers for the SRT, describe the main outcomes\nfrom the scientific commissioning of the telescope, and discuss a set of\nobservations demonstrating the SRT's scientific capabilities. One of the main\nobjectives of scientific commissioning was the identification of deficiencies\nin the instrumentation and/or in the telescope sub-systems for further\noptimization. As a result, the overall telescope performance has been\nsignificantly improved. As part of the scientific commissioning activities,\ndifferent observing modes were tested and validated, and first astronomical\nobservations were carried out to demonstrate the science capabilities of the\nSRT. In addition, we developed astronomer-oriented software tools, to support\nfuture observers on-site. The astronomical validation activities were\nprioritized based on technical readiness and scientific impact. The highest\npriority was to make the SRT available for joint observations as part of\nEuropean networks. As a result, the SRT started to participate (in shared-risk\nmode) in EVN (European VLBI Network) and LEAP (Large European Array for\nPulsars) observing sessions in early 2014. The validation of single-dish\noperations for the suite of SRT first light receivers and backends continued in\nthe following years, and was concluded with the first call for\nshared-risk/early-science observations issued at the end of 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 17:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Its phenomenological property is\nstrongly affected by the gaugino fraction in the Higgsino-like state. If this\nis sizable, in other words, if gaugino masses are less than ${\\cal O}(10)$ TeV,\nwe may probe the Higgsino dark matter in future non-accelerator experiments\nsuch as dark matter direct searches and measurements of electric dipole\nmoments. On the other hand, if gauginos are much heavier, then it is hard to\nsearch for Higgsino in these experiments. In this case, due to a lack of\ngaugino components, the mass difference between the neutral and charged\nHiggsinos is uniquely determined by electroweak interactions to be around $350$\nMeV, which makes the heavier charged state rather long-lived, with a decay\nlength of about $1$ cm.

We present iPTF13z, a SN IIn\ndiscovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and\ncharacterised by several bumps in its light curve. We analyse this peculiar\nbehaviour trying to infer the properties of the CSM and of the SN explosion, as\nwell as the nature of its progenitor star.

Snowlines impose major\nchemical gradients and possibly foster grain growth. The aim of this paper is\nto understand how disc midplane temperature changes with gas and dust\nevolution, and identify trends that may influence planet formation or allow to\nconstrain disc evolution observationally. We calculate disc temperature,\nhydrostatic equilibrium and dust settling in a mutually consistent way from a\ngrid of disc models at different stages of gas loss, grain growth and hole\nopening. We find that the CO snowline location depends very strongly on disc\nproperties. The CO snowline location migrates closer to the star for increasing\ndegrees of gas dispersal and dust growth. Around a typical A type star, the\nsnowline can be anywhere between several tens and a few hundred au, depending\non the disc properties such as gas mass and grain size. In fact, gas loss is as\nefficient as dust evolution in settling discs, and flat discs may be gas-poor\ncounterparts of flared discs. Our results, in the context of different pre-main\nsequence evolution of the luminosity in low- and intermediate-mass stars\nsuggests very different thermal (and hence chemical) histories in these two\ntypes of discs. Discs of T Tauri stars settle and cool down while discs of\nHerbig Ae stars may remain rather warm throughout the pre-main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

The clouds form through gravitational fragmentation of\nthe gas, leading to average values for mass, radii and velocity dispersion in\ngood agreement with observations of Milky Way clouds. The driving parameter (b)\nfor the turbulence within each cloud is characterised by the ratio of the\ndensity contrast (sigma_rho) to the average Mach number (Mach) within the\ncloud, b = sigma_rho/Mach. As shown in previous works, b ~ 1/3 indicates\nsolenoidal (divergence-free) driving and b ~ 1 indicates compressive\n(curl-free) driving.

In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process\nmodeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly\nwith the size of the dataset.

The method exploits\nstructure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture\nof complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or\nuniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a\nmixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a\nphysical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also\ndemonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases.

We\nconstructed a sample of moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (HLAGN) via\nspectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition combined with standard X-ray\nand mid-infrared diagnostics. Within the remainder of the sample we further\nidentified low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN (MLAGN) via excess in radio\nemission relative to the star formation rates in their host galaxies. We show\nthat AGN power in HLAGN occurs predominantly in radiative form, while MLAGN\ndisplay a substantial mechanical AGN luminosity component. We found significant\ndifferences in the host properties of the two AGN classes, as a function of\nredshift. At z$<$1.5, MLAGN appear to reside in significantly more massive and\nless star-forming galaxies compared to HLAGN. At z$>$1.5, we observed a\nreversal in the behaviour of the stellar mass distributions with the HLAGN\npopulating the higher stellar mass tail. We interpret this finding as a\npossible hint of the downsizing of galaxies hosting HLAGN, with the most\nmassive galaxies triggering AGN activity earlier than less massive galaxies,\nand then fading to MLAGN at lower redshifts. Our conclusion is that HLAGN and\nMLAGN samples trace two distinct galaxy and AGN populations in a wide range of\nredshifts, possibly resembling the radio AGN types often referred to as\nradiative- and jet-mode (or high- and low-excitation), respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 15:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

In comparison to the 1D model, the 2D calculation predicts a less\nextensive expansion of the atmosphere by orders of magnitude at the\nparsec/sub-parsec scale, but the new scale-height $h$ may still exceed the\nradial distance $R$ for various physical conditions. A total of 192 NSD models\nare computed across the input parameter space in order to predict distributions\nof a line of sight column density $N_H$. Assuming a random distribution of\ninput parameters, the statistics yield 56% of Type 1, 23% of Compton-thin Type\n2s (CN), and 21% of Compton-thick (CK) AGNs. Depending on a viewing angle\n($\\theta$) of a particular NSD (fixed physical conditions), any central AGN can\nappear to be Type 1, CN, or CK which is consistent with the basic unification\ntheory of AGNs. Our results show that $\\log[N_H(\\text{cm}^{-2})]\\in$ [23,25.5]\ncan be oriented at any $\\theta$ from 0$^\\circ$ to $\\approx$80$^\\circ$ due to\nthe degeneracy in the input parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 18:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

Recent advances in our understanding of ring and satellite\nformation and destruction suggest that these processes are interconnected, so\nthat rings and satellites may be two aspects of the same geological system.\nHowever, no single theory seems able to explain the origin of the different\nplanetary rings known in our Solar System, and it now seems evident that rings\nmay result from a variety of processes like giant collisions, tidal stripping\nof comets or satellites, as well as planet formation itself.\n  In order to build any theory of ring formation it is important to specify\nphysical processes that affect the long-term evolution of rings, as well as to\ndescribe the different observations that any ring formation model should\nexplain.

However, the high\ncomputation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on\nresource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that\napproximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those\nworks directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations\n(LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs,\nhowever, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose\nForce Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to\ncoordinate more weight information into lower-rank space. We mathematically and\nempirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can\nreconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The\neffectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet,\nand GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2x speedup\non modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4.05x speedup on CPU by paying small\naccuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the\nlow-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher\naccuracy.

It has an important role for\norganizations, governments and our society due to its valuable resources on\ncomputer networks. Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable to detect\nnew and unknown intrusion. Besides, anomaly detection in network security is\naim to distinguish between illegal or malicious events and normal behavior of\nnetwork systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a classification\nproblem where it builds models of normal network behavior, which it uses to\ndetect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model. Most of the cur-\nrent research on anomaly detection is based on the learning of normally and\nanomaly behaviors. They do not take into account the previous, re- cent events\nto detect the new incoming one. In this paper, we propose a real time\ncollective anomaly detection model based on neural network learning and feature\noperating.

In our approach, a LSTM RNN is trained with\nnormal time series data before performing a live prediction for each time step.\nInstead of considering each time step separately, the observation of prediction\nerrors from a certain number of time steps is now proposed as a new idea for\ndetecting collective anomalies. The prediction errors from a number of the\nlatest time steps above a threshold will indicate a collective anomaly. The\nmodel is built on a time series version of the KDD 1999 dataset. The\nexperiments demonstrate that it is possible to offer reliable and efficient for\ncollective anomaly detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 19:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

Gate error\nstems from a combination of control errors and random single qubit errors from\ninteraction with the environment. While great strides have been made in\nmitigating control errors, intrinsic qubit error remains a serious problem that\nsets the primary limit for gate fidelity in modern superconducting qubit\narchitectures. Simultaneously, recent developments of small error-corrected\nlogical qubit devices promise significant increases in logical state lifetime,\nbut translating those improvements into increases in gate fidelity is a complex\nchallenge. In this Letter, we propose a new formalism for implementing gates on\nand between small logical qubit devices which inherit the parent device's\ntolerance to single qubit errors which occur at any time before or during the\ngate. Using a standard phenomenological noise model for superconducting qubits,\nwe demonstrate a universal one- and two-qubit gate set with error rates an\norder of magnitude lower than those for equivalent operations on single qubits\nor pairs of qubits, running for the same total duration. The effective logical\ngate error rate in these models displays superlinear error reduction with\nlinear increases in single qubit lifetime, proving that passive error\ncorrection is capable of increasing gate fidelity. These developments further\nsuggest that incorporating small logical qubits into a measurement based code\ncould substantially improve code performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 19:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

An\ninterference graph is employed to illustrate the partially-coupled cost\nfunctions and the asymmetric information requirements. For a given interference\ngraph, network communication between players is considered to be limited. A\ngeneralized communication graph is designed so that players exchange only their\nrequired information. An algorithm is designed whereby players, with possibly\npartially-coupled cost functions, make decisions based on the estimates of\nother players' actions obtained from local neighbors. It is shown that this\nchoice of communication graph guarantees that all players' information is\nexchanged after sufficiently many iterations. Using a set of standard\nassumptions on the cost functions, the interference and the communication\ngraphs, almost sure convergence to a Nash equilibrium is proved for diminishing\nstep sizes. Moreover, the case when the cost functions are not known by the\nplayers is investigated and a convergence proof is presented for diminishing\nstep sizes.

This leads to our question: can the\nhuman-consensus structure of a procedure be learned from a large set of long,\nunconstrained videos (e.g., instructional videos from YouTube) with only visual\nevidence? To answer this question, we introduce the problem of procedure\nsegmentation--to segment a video procedure into category-independent procedure\nsegments. Given that no large-scale dataset is available for this problem, we\ncollect a large-scale procedure segmentation dataset with procedure segments\ntemporally localized and described; we use cooking videos and name the dataset\nYouCook2. We propose a segment-level recurrent network for generating procedure\nsegments by modeling the dependencies across segments. The generated segments\ncan be used as pre-processing for other tasks, such as dense video captioning\nand event parsing. We show in our experiments that the proposed model\noutperforms competitive baselines in procedure segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 20:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 12:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 20:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

This makes the inversion of the fuzzy model much\neasier than the inversion of the fuzzy model based on the TSK of order 0. Based\non simulation results, the proposed fuzzy TILC seems able to give a very good\ninitial guess as to the heater temperature setpoints, making it possible to\nhave almost no wastage of plastic sheets.

In some of the more popular\ncomparative methods, researchers compare observed epidemiological data from\nearly stages of an outbreak with the output of proposed models to forecast the\nfuture trend and prevalence of the pandemic. A significant problem in this area\nis the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best\nalgorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible\nconfiguration for a particular algorithm.\n  Results: In this paper, we present an evaluation framework which allows for\ncombining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate\nforecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to\ncharacterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error\nmeasures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with\nrespect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than\nshort-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by\nevaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United\nStates. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different\nrankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show\nthat no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features, when\nevaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various\nconsensus ranking schema that summarizes individual rankings, thus accounting\nfor different error measures. We believe that a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational\nepidemiology community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

Applying to\nquantum-mechanical signals, however, they face fundamental challenges arising\nfrom the multimode nature of the interacting electromagnetic fields, such as\nphase noises and Raman scattering. Quantum Zeno blockade allows strong\ninteraction of light waves without them physically overlapping, thus providing\na viable solution for those challenges, as indicated in recent bulk-optics\nexperiments. Here, we report on the observation of quantum Zeno blockade on\nchip, where a light wave is modulated by another in a distinct\n\"interaction-free\" manner. For quantum applications, we also verify its\noperations on a single-photon level.

In this paper, we investigate the\npossible bounds which could be placed on the Brans-Dicke gravity using GW\ndetection from inspiralling compact binaries with the proposed Einstein\nTelescope, a third-generation GW detector. We first calculate in details the\nwaveforms of gravitational radiation in the lowest post-Newtonian\napproximation, including the tensor and scalar fields, which can be divided\ninto the three polarization modes, i.e. \"plus mode\", \"cross mode\" and\n\"breathing mode\". Applying the stationary phase approximation, we obtain their\nFourier transforms, and derive the correction terms in amplitude, phase and\npolarization of GWs, relative to the corresponding results in General\nRelativity. Imposing the noise level of Einstein Telescope, we find that the GW\ndetection from inspiralling compact binaries, composed of a neutron star and a\nblack hole, can place stringent constraints on the Brans-Dicke gravity.

The idea behind LiangYi is to promote the\npopulation-based solver by training it (with the training module) to improve\nits performance on those instances (discovered by the sampling module) on which\nit performs badly, while keeping the good performances obtained by it on\nprevious instances. An instantiation of LiangYi on the Travelling Salesman\nProblem is also proposed. Empirical results on a huge testing set containing\n10000 instances showed LiangYi could train solvers that perform significantly\nbetter than the solvers trained by other state-of-the-art training method.\nMoreover, empirical investigation of the behaviours of LiangYi confirmed it was\nable to continuously improve the solver through training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 02:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The flare onset mechanism is a\ncritical but less understood problem, insights into which could be gained from\nsmall-scale energy releases known as precursors, which are observed as small\npre-flare brightenings in various wavelengths, and also from certain\nsmall-scale magnetic configurations such as the opposite polarity fluxes, where\nmagnetic orientation of small bipoles is opposite to that of the ambient main\npolarities. However, high-resolution observations of flare precursors together\nwith the associated photospheric magnetic field dynamics are lacking. Here we\nstudy precursors of a flare using unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of\nthe 1.6 m New Solar Telescope, complemented by novel microwave data. Two\nepisodes of precursor brightenings are initiated at a small-scale magnetic\nchannel (a form of opposite polarity fluxes) with multiple polarity inversions\nand enhanced magnetic fluxes and currents, lying near the footpoints of sheared\nmagnetic loops. The low-atmospheric origin of these precursor emissions is\ncorroborated by microwave spectra. We propose that the emerging magnetic\nchannel field interacts with the sheared arcades to cause precursor\nbrightenings at the main flare core region. These high-resolution results\nprovide evidence of low-atmospheric small-scale energy release and possible\nrelationship to the onset of the main flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 02:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

Combined with the slow\npropagation speed of light in a CPT medium, a coherent state passing through an\natomic ensemble with a high optical density (OD) can evolve into a highly\nsqueezed state even in a single passage. Our study reveals that noise squeezing\nof more than $10$ dB can be achieved with an OD of 1,000, which is currently\navailable in experiments. A larger OD can further increase the degree of\nsqueezing. As the light intensity and two-photon detuning are key factors in\nthe CPT interaction, we also demonstrate that the minimum variance at a given\nOD can be reached for a wide range of these two factors, showing the proposed\nscheme is flexible and robust. Furthermore, there is no need to consider the\nphase-matching condition in the CPT scheme.

MOBS first applies a Bayesian\nmixture model to the marginal distribution of the response, obtaining posterior\nsamples of mixture weights, cluster-specific parameters, and cluster\nallocations for each subject. Hypothesis tests are then introduced,\ncorresponding to whether or not to include a given predictor, with posterior\nprobabilities for each hypothesis available analytically conditionally on\nunknowns sampled in the first stage and tuning parameters controlling borrowing\nof information across tests. By marginalizing over the first stage posterior\nsamples, we avoid under-estimation of uncertainty typical of two-stage methods.\nWe greatly simplify the model specification and reduce computational complexity\nby using {\\em modularization}. We provide basic theoretical support for this\napproach, and illustrate excellent performance relative to competitors in\nsimulation studies and the ability to capture complex shifts beyond simple\ndifferences in means.

The\ncylindrical containers are axially unbounded and penetrated by magnetic\nbackground fields with axial and/or azimuthal components. The influence of the\nmagnetic Prandtl number $Pm$ on the onset of the instabilities is shown to be\nsubstantial. The potential flow subject to axial fields becomes unstable\nagainst axisymmetric perturbations for a certain supercritical value of the\naveraged Reynolds number $\\overline{Rm}=\\sqrt{Re\\cdot Rm}$ (with $Re$ the\nReynolds number of rotation, $Rm$ its magnetic Reynolds number).

Proving compiler\nfull-abstraction is, however, rather complicated. A common proof technique is\nbased on the back-translation of target-level program contexts to\nbehaviourally-equivalent source-level contexts. However, constructing such a\nback- translation is problematic when the source language is not strong enough\nto embed an encoding of the target language. For instance, when compiling from\nSTLC to ULC, the lack of recursive types in the former prevents such a\nback-translation.\n  We propose a general and elegant solution for this problem. The key insight\nis that it suffices to construct an approximate back-translation. The\napproximation is only accurate up to a certain number of steps and conservative\nbeyond that, in the sense that the context generated by the back-translation\nmay diverge when the original would not, but not vice versa. Based on this\ninsight, we describe a general technique for proving compiler full-abstraction\nand demonstrate it on a compiler from STLC to ULC. The proof uses asymmetric\ncross-language logical relations and makes innovative use of step-indexing to\nexpress the relation between a context and its approximate back-translation.\nThe proof extends easily to common compiler patterns such as modular\ncompilation and it, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first compiler full\nabstraction proof to have been fully mechanised in Coq.

For a long time, it was believed that the\nbasic level had advantage over two others; a claim that has been challenged\nrecently. Here we used a series of psychophysics experiments, based on a rapid\npresentation paradigm, as well as two computational models, with bandpass\nfiltered images to study the processing order of the categorization levels. In\nthese experiments, we investigated the type of visual information required for\ncategorizing objects in each level by varying the spatial frequency bands of\nthe input image. The results of our psychophysics experiments and computational\nmodels are consistent. They indicate that the different spatial frequency\ninformation had different effects on object categorization in each level. In\nthe absence of high frequency information, subordinate and basic level\ncategorization are performed inaccurately, while superordinate level is\nperformed well. This means that, low frequency information is sufficient for\nsuperordinate level, but not for the basic and subordinate levels. These finer\nlevels require high frequency information, which appears to take longer to be\nprocessed, leading to longer reaction times. Finally, to avoid the ceiling\neffect, we evaluated the robustness of the results by adding different amounts\nof noise to the input images and repeating the experiments. As expected, the\ncategorization accuracy decreased and the reaction time increased\nsignificantly, but the trends were the same.This shows that our results are not\ndue to a ceiling effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 12:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

The high probability of cyclisation on the stage of the\norganometallic phase results from the reversibility of the C-Ag bond. The case\nis different from that in solution, in which cyclisation typically occurs on\nthe stage of covalently bonded open-chain precursor. This difference in the\ncyclisation mechanism on a surface compared to that in solution stems mainly\nfrom the 2D confinement exerted by the surface template, which to a large\nextent prevents the flipping of chain segments necessary for cyclisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 13:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

To make the above statement\nprecise, one has to specify what a \"set of information\" is and what \"fast\"\nshould mean. Kawamura and Cook use polynomial-time computability in the sense\nof second-order complexity theory to define what \"fast\" means but do not use\nthe most general \"sets of information\" this framework is able to handle.\nInstead they require codes to be length-monotone. This paper removes the\nadditional premise of length-monotonicity, and instead imposes further\nconditions on the speed of the evaluation: The operation should now be\ncomputable in \"hyper-linear\" time. This means that the running time can not\ncontain any iterations of the length function and, while an arbitrary\npolynomial may be applied to its value, on the argument side at most a shift by\na constant is allowed. This is a very restrictive notion, but one can check\nthat the Kawamura and Cook representation allows for hyper-linear time\nevaluation. The paper proves that it is not minimal with this property by\nproviding the minimal set of information necessary for hyper-linear evaluation\nand proving that it is not polynomial-time equivalent to any encoding using\nonly length-monotone names. Ultimatively, this is due to a failure of\npolynomial-time computability of an upper bound to a modulus of continuity.\nIndeed this failure seems to reflect the behavior of software based on the\nideas of computable analysis appropriately and was one of the reasons for a\ncloser investigation in the first place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 14:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 16:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

In this work, we construct a model involving two scalar\nfields (a canonical field and a non-canonical ghost field) to drive the\nsymmetric matter bounce and study the evolution of the scalar perturbations in\nthe model. If we consider the scale associated with the bounce to be of the\norder of the Planck scale, the model is completely described in terms of only\none parameter, viz the value of the scale factor at the bounce. We evolve the\nscalar perturbations numerically across the bounce and evaluate the scalar\npower spectra after the bounce.

Doping and hydrogenating graphene is an experimentally realised\nmethod of changing its surface chemistry, but there is still a great deal to be\nunderstood on how doping impacts on the adsorption of molecules. Developing\nthis understanding is key to unlocking the potential applications of these\nmaterials. High throughput screening methods can provide particularly effective\nways to explore vast chemical compositions of materials. Here, alchemical\nderivatives are used as a method to screen the dissociative adsorption energy\nof water molecules on various BN doped topologies of hydrogenated graphene. The\npredictions from alchemical derivatives are assessed by comparison to density\nfunctional theory. This screening method is found to predict dissociative\nadsorption energies that span a range of more than 2 eV, with a mean absolute\nerror $<0.1$ eV. In addition, we show that the quality of such predictions can\nbe readily assessed by examination of the Kohn-Sham highest occupied molecular\norbital in the initial states.

If a sensor detects an abnormality, it injects into the medium a\nnumber of molecules which is proportional to the sensed value. Two transmission\nschemes for releasing molecules into the medium are considered. In the first\nscheme, referred to as DTM, each sensor releases a different type of molecule,\nwhereas in the second scheme, referred to as STM, all sensors release the same\ntype of molecule. The molecules released by the sensors propagate through the\nMC channel and some may reach the FC where the final decision regarding whether\nor not an abnormality has occurred is made. We derive the optimal decision\nrules for both DTM and STM. However, the optimal detectors entail high\ncomputational complexity as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) have to be computed.\nTo overcome this issue, we show that the optimal decision rule for STM can be\ntransformed into an equivalent low-complexity decision rule. Since a similar\ntransformation is not possible for DTM, we propose simple low-complexity\nsub-optimal detectors based on different approximations of the LLR. The\nproposed low-complexity detectors are more suitable for practical MC systems\nthan the original complex optimal decision rule, particularly when the FC is a\nnano-machine with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe performance of the proposed detectors in terms of their false alarm and\nmissed detection probabilities. Simulation results verify our analytical\nderivations and reveal interesting insights regarding the trade-off between\ncomplexity and performance of the proposed detectors and the considered DTM and\nSTM schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 15:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

As an illustration, we\nroutinely construct two unlocking mappings for the predicate \"be\nnon-anticipating mapping\" and then on this base we provide the expression for\nthe greatest non-anticipating selection of a given multifunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

However, the numerical simulation of these processes\nrequires the adoption of coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis,\nusing temperature-dependent material models. The numerical description of the\nthermo-mechanical behaviour can require a large set of experimental tests.\nThese experimental tests should be performed under conditions identical to the\nones observed in the forming process. In this study, the warm deep drawing of a\ncylindrical cup is analysed, including the split-ring test to assess the\ntemperature effect on the springback. Based on the analysis of the forming\nprocess conditions, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the AA5086 aluminium\nalloy is described by a rate-independent thermo-elasto-plastic material model.\nThe hardening law adopted is temperature-dependent while the yield function is\ntemperature-independent.

In fact, the model\nassumes that the temperature of the tools is uniform and constant, adopting a\nvariable interfacial heat transfer coefficient. The accuracy of the proposed\nfinite element model is assessed by comparing numerical and experimental\nresults. The predicted punch force, thickness distribution and earing profile\nare in very good agreement with the experimental measurements, when the\nanisotropic behaviour of the blank is accurately described.

The molecular emission\ncan be traced in multiple physical components such as infalling envelopes,\noutflows and protoplanetary discs. To compare with the observations, a precise\nand complex radiative transfer modelling of these regions is needed. We present\nGASS (Generator of Astrophysical Sources Structure), a code that allows us to\ngenerate the three-dimensional (3D) physical structure model of astrophysical\nsources. From the GASS graphical interface, the user easily creates different\ncomponents such as spherical envelopes, outflows and discs. The physical\nproperties of these components are modelled thanks to dedicated graphical\ninterfaces that display various figures in order to help the user and\nfacilitate the modelling task. For each component, the code randomly generates\npoints in a 3D grid with a sample probability weighted by the molecular\ndensity. The created models can be used as the physical structure input for 3D\nradiative transfer codes to predict the molecular line or continuum emission.\nAn analysis of the output hyper-spectral cube given by such radiative transfer\ncode can be made directly in GASS using the various post-treatment options\nimplemented, such as calculation of moments or convolution with a beam. This\nmakes GASS well suited to model and analyse both interferometric and\nsingle-dish data.
