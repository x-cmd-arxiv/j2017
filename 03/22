In light of this, we have adapted a\nmethod described by Vaughan (2005) to aid with the search for QPPs in flare\ntime series data. The method identifies statistically significant periodic\nsignals in power spectra, and properly accounts for red noise as well as the\nuncertainties associated with the data. We show how the method can be further\ndeveloped to be used with rebinned power spectra, allowing us to detect QPPs\nwhose signal is spread over more than one frequency bin. An advantage of these\nmethods is that there is no need to detrend the data prior to creating the\npower spectrum. Examples are given where the methods have been applied to\nsynthetic data, as well as real flare time series data with candidate QPPs from\nthe Nobeyama Radioheliograph. These show that, despite the transient nature of\nQPPs, peaks corresponding to the QPPs can be seen at a significant level in the\npower spectrum without any form of detrending or other processing of the\noriginal time series data, providing the background trends are not too steep.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

The\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the spin current mechanism were\nearlier invoked to account for the electric polarisation in this system.\nHowever, the DM interaction is found to be absent, spin current mechanism is\nnot valid in the helical spiral state and there is no electric polarisation\nthereof. These results are in good agreement with the recent single-crystal\ndata. We also investigate the magnetic transitions in\nYBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuFeO$_5$ for the entire range $0\\le x\\le 1$ of doping. The\nexchange interactions are estimated as a function of doping and a quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) calculation on an effective spin Hamiltonian shows that the\nparamagnetic to commensurate phase transition temperature increases with doping\ntill $x=0.5$ and decreases beyond. Our observations are consistent with\nexperimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 11:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

As a\nresult, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a\ncomplex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that\npredicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of\ncases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic\nequipment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both\nthe science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the\npresence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the\nquestion of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to\nforecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy\nas a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability\nof a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, chlamydia, dengue,\ngonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, and whooping\ncough--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time\nseries forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to\nprediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks. We also\nfind that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both\nshifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely\nmechanisms for the observed differences across contagions. Our results\nhighlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing\ndynamic modeling approaches, and suggest challenges for performing model\nselection across long time series. We further anticipate that our findings will\ncontribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may\nrelate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 12:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 17:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 17:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 17:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

The structure of the inner parts of Be star disks (20 stellar radii)\nis well explained by the viscous decretion disk (VDD) model, which is able to\nreproduce the observable properties of most of the objects studied so far.

This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a\nsignificant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots\nshould be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and\ninstantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring\ntask-specific engineering. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework\nfor achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation learning.\n  Specifically, we consider the setting where there is a very large set of\ntasks, and each task has many instantiations. For example, a task could be to\nstack all blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be to place\nall blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc. In each case, different\ninstances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different\ninitial states. At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of\ndemonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained that takes as\ninput one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial\nstate of the other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with the\ngoal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as\npossible with the second demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a\nsingle instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is expected to\nperform well on new instances of this new task.

While moving objects are readily\nrejected via image pairs separated by $\\sim$1 hr, stellar flares represent a\nchallenging foreground that significantly outnumber rapidly-evolving\nexplosions. Identifying stellar sources close to and fainter than the transient\ndetection limit can eliminate these false positives. Here, we present a method\nto reliably identify stars in deep co-adds of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)\nimaging. Our machine-learning methodology utilizes the random forest (RF)\nalgorithm, which is trained using $> 3\\times{10}^6$ sources with Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) spectra. When evaluated on an independent test set, the PTF\nRF model outperforms the SExtractor star classifier by $\\sim$4%. For faint\nsources ($r'\\ge{21}$ mag), which dominate the field population, the PTF RF\nmodel produces a $\\sim$19% improvement over SExtractor.

To leverage its superior image quality, we\nadditionally create an SDSS point-source catalog, which is also tuned to have a\ngalaxy misclassification rate = 0.005. These catalogs have been incorporated\ninto the PTF real-time pipelines to automatically reject stellar sources as\nnon-extragalactic transients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

We run N-body simulations of\nisolated self-gravitating systems, using three simulation codes: NBODY-6\n(direct summation without softening), NBODY-2 (direct summation with softening)\nand GADGET-2 (tree code with softening), for different numbers of particles and\ninitial conditions. At each snapshot, we estimate the Shannon entropy of the\ndistribution function with three different techniques: Kernel, Nearest Neighbor\nand EnBiD.

During violent relaxation, the\nentropy has a fast increase followed by damping oscillations, indicating that\nviolent relaxation must be described by a kinetic equation other than the\nVlasov-Poisson, even for N as large as that of astronomical structures. This\nindicates that violent relaxation cannot be described by a time-reversible\nequation, shedding some light on the so-called \"fundamental paradox of stellar\ndynamics\".

Recent simulations predict that a\nBrightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) inside a cored galaxy cluster will exhibit\nresidual wobbling due to previous major mergers, long after the relaxation of\nthe overall cluster. This phenomenon is absent with standard cold dark matter\nwhere a cuspy density profile keeps a BCG tightly bound at the centre. We test\nthis hypothesis using cosmological simulations and deep observations of 10\ngalaxy clusters acting as strong gravitational lenses. Modelling the BCG wobble\nas a simple harmonic oscillator, we measure the wobble amplitude, $A_w$, in the\nBAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding an upper\nlimit for the CDM paradigm of $A_w < 2$kpc at the 95% confidence limit. We\ncarry out the same test on the data finding a non-zero amplitude of\n$A_w=11.82^{+7.3}_{-3.0}$kpc, with the observations dis-favouring $A_w = 0$ at\nthe 3$\\sigma$ confidence level. This detection of BCG wobbling is evidence for\na dark matter core at the heart of galaxy clusters. It also shows that strong\nlensing models of clusters cannot assume that the BCG is exactly coincident\nwith the large scale halo. While our small sample of galaxy clusters already\nindicates a non-zero $A_w$, with larger surveys, e.g. Euclid, we will be able\nto not only to confirm the effect but also to use it to determine whether or\nnot the wobbling finds its origin in new fundamental physics or astrophysical\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 12:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

In recent years, several related\nstructures have been used to study maps on data, including Reeb spaces, mappers\nand multiscale mappers. The construction of these structures also relies on the\nso-called \\emph{nerve} of a cover of the domain.\n  In this paper, we aim to analyze the topological information encoded in these\nstructures in order to provide better understanding of these structures and\nfacilitate their practical usage.\n  More specifically, we show that the one-dimensional homology of the nerve\ncomplex $N(\\mathcal{U})$ of a path-connected cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of a domain\n$X$ cannot be richer than that of the domain $X$ itself. Intuitively, this\nresult means that no new $H_1$-homology class can be \"created\" under a natural\nmap from $X$ to the nerve complex $N(\\mathcal{U})$. Equipping $X$ with a\npseudometric $d$, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of\n$H_1(X)$ that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of \\emph{size}\nof the covering elements in $\\mathcal{U}$. These fundamental results about\nnerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the $H_1$-homology of Reeb spaces,\nmappers and multiscale mappers.\n  The analysis of $H_1$-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher\ndimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a\nGromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and\ninterleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology\ngroups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

We demonstrate a novel method, based on\nlearning deep networks, to model the global landscapes of optimization\nproblems. To represent the search space concisely and accurately, the deep\nnetworks must encode information about the underlying parameter interactions\nand their contributions to the quality of the solution. Once the networks are\ntrained, the networks are probed to reveal parameter combinations with high\nexpected performance with respect to the optimization task.

Although camera-traps are\nconvenient in application, there remain both theoretical complications such as\nspatial autocorrelation or false negative problem and practical difficulties,\nfor example, laborious random sampling. In the article we propose an\nalternative way to bypass the mentioned problems.\n  In the proposed approach, the raw video information collected from the\ncamera-traps situated at the spots of natural attraction is turned into the\nfrequency of visits, and the latter is transformed into the desired abundance\nestimate. The key for such a transformation is the application of the\ncorrection coefficients, computed for each particular observation environment\nusing the Bayesian approach and the massive database (DB) of observations under\nvarious conditions.\n  The main result of the article is a new method of census based on video-data\nfrom camera-traps at the spots of natural attraction and information from a\nspecial community-driven database.\n  The proposed method is based on automated video-capturing at a moderate\nnumber of easy to reach spots, so in the long term many laborious census works\nmay be conducted easier, cheaper and cause less disturbance for the wild life.\nInformation post-processing is strictly formalized, which leaves little chance\nfor subjective alterations. However, the method heavily relies on the volume\nand quality of the DB, which in its turn heavily relies on the efforts of the\ncommunity. There is realistic hope that the community of zoologists and\nenvironment specialists could create and maintain a DB similar to the proposed\none. Such a rich DB of visits might benefit not only censuses, but also many\nbehavioral studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 19:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

The algorithm's\nability to automatically segment tagged shearing motion was evaluated in a\nnumerical simulation and in vivo. A typical shearing deformation was simulated\nin a Shepp-Logan phantom allowing for quantitative evaluation of the\nalgorithm's success rate as a function of both SNR and the amount of\ndeformation.

Our algorithm runs in $O( (D/\\epsilon) \\log n)$ rounds in the\n$\\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model and finds a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal\nLP solution for any $0 < \\epsilon \\leq 1$, where $D$ is the largest distance\nconstraint. While solving linear programs in a distributed setting is\ninteresting in its own right, this class of convex programs is particularly\nimportant because solving them is often a crucial step when designing\napproximation algorithms. Hence we almost immediately obtain new and improved\ndistributed approximation algorithms for a variety of network design problems,\nincluding Basic $3$- and $4$-Spanner, Directed $k$-Spanner, Lowest Degree\n$k$-Spanner, and Shallow-Light Steiner Network Design with a spanning demand\ngraph. Our algorithms do not require any \"heavy\" computation and essentially\nmatch the best-known centralized approximation algorithms, while previous\napproaches which do not use heavy computation give approximations which are\nworse than the best-known centralized bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 20:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 18:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 19:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Standard approaches to\ncrowdsourcing view the process of acquiring labeled data separately from the\nprocess of learning a classifier from the gathered data. This can give rise to\ncomputational and statistical challenges. For example, in most cases there are\nno known computationally efficient learning algorithms that are robust to the\nhigh level of noise that exists in crowdsourced data, and efforts to eliminate\nnoise through voting often require a large number of queries per example.\n  In this paper, we show how by interleaving the process of labeling and\nlearning, we can attain computational efficiency with much less overhead in the\nlabeling cost. In particular, we consider the realizable setting where there\nexists a true target function in $\\mathcal{F}$ and consider a pool of labelers.\nWhen a noticeable fraction of the labelers are perfect, and the rest behave\narbitrarily, we show that any $\\mathcal{F}$ that can be efficiently learned in\nthe traditional realizable PAC model can be learned in a computationally\nefficient manner by querying the crowd, despite high amounts of noise in the\nresponses. Moreover, we show that this can be done while each labeler only\nlabels a constant number of examples and the number of labels requested per\nexample, on average, is a constant. When no perfect labelers exist, a related\ntask is to find a set of the labelers which are good but not perfect. We show\nthat we can identify all good labelers, when at least the majority of labelers\nare good.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 21:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of\nvariable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92%\naccuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous\nbest neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a\ncomparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate\nthat the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric\nand end-user application.

In order to treat the two\nweaknesses, we traced the origin of differential privacy to Dalenius' goal, a\nmore rigorous privacy measure. We formalized Dalenius' goal by using Shannon's\nperfect secrecy and tried to achieve Dalenius' goal with better utility. Our\nfirst result is that, if the independence assumption is true, then differential\nprivacy is equivalent to Dalenius' goal, where the independence assumption\nassumes that each adversary has no knowledge of the correlation among different\nindividuals' data in the dataset. This implies that the security of\ndifferential privacy is based on the independence assumption. Since the\nindependence assumption is impractical, we introduced a new practical\nassumption, which assumes that each adversary is unknown to some data of the\ndataset if the dataset is large enough.

Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since\nthe general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these\nstars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at\nbirth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 01:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 18:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Through\nthis work, a shift of the globule, which is driven mainly by the asymmetric\ninterfacial curvature, not by the outer drag, is disclosed. The asymmetric\nlayout of the daughter droplet leads to the asymmetric drags from the\ncontinuous phase and the asymmetric deformation of the globule with different\ninterface curvatures. As the inner droplet has both enhancing and suppressing\neffect on the globule deformation, the interface curvatures will vary when\nchanging the relative size and location of the inner droplet. This curvature\ndifference results in the asymmetric pressure distribution and circulation\ninside the globule. Eventually, the interaction of the inner driving force\n(pressure differences) and the outer drags causes the oriented shift and\ninverse of the globule.

This paper develops a method to design\nLuenberger-type observers for nonlinear systems which guarantee the largest\npossible domain of attraction for the state estimation error regardless of the\ninitialization of the system. The observer design procedure is posed as a two\nstep problem. In the the first step, the error dynamics are abstractly\nrepresented as a linear equation on the space of Radon measures. Thereafter,\nthe problem of identifying the largest set of initial errors that can be driven\nto within the user-specified error target set in finite-time for all possible\ninitial states, and the corresponding observer gains, is formulated as an\ninfinite-dimensional linear program on measures. This optimization problem is\nsolved, using Lasserre's relaxations via a sequence of semidefinite programs\nwith vanishing conservatism. By post-processing the solution of step one, the\nset of gains that maximize the size of tolerable initial errors is identified\nin step two.

Given the critical role of ICs in the\ncontrol and operation of vehicular systems and other modern engineering\ndesigns, such offshore outsourcing has led to serious security threats due to\nthe potential of insertion of hardware trojans - malicious designs that, when\nactivated, can lead to highly detrimental consequences. In this paper, a novel\ngame-theoretic framework is proposed to analyze the interactions between a\nhardware manufacturer, acting as attacker, and an IC testing facility, acting\nas defender. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game in which the\nattacker must decide on the type of trojan that it inserts while taking into\naccount the detection penalty as well as the damage caused by the trojan.\nMeanwhile, the resource-constrained defender must decide on the best testing\nstrategy that allows optimizing its overall utility which accounts for both\ndamages and the fines. The proposed game is based on the robust behavioral\nframework of prospect theory (PT) which allows capturing the potential\nuncertainty, risk, and irrational behavior in the decision making of both the\nattacker and defender. For both, the standard rational expected utility (EUT)\ncase and the PT case, a novel algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed\nand shown to converge to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For an illustrative\ncase study, thorough analytical results are derived for both EUT and PT to\nstudy the properties of the reached equilibrium as well as the impact of key\nsystem parameters such as the defender-set fine. Simulation results assess the\nperformance of the proposed framework under both EUT and PT and show that the\nuse of PT will provide invaluable insights on the outcomes of the proposed\nhardware trojan game, in particular, and system security, in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 02:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

A central\nmotivation toward this direction is that antiferromagnetic spin dynamics is\nexpected to be much faster than ferromagnetic counterpart because\nantiferromagnets have higher resonance frequencies than ferromagnets. Recent\ntheories indeed predicted faster dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls\n(DWs) than ferromagnetic DWs. However, experimental investigations of\nantiferromagnetic spin dynamics have remained unexplored mainly because of the\nimmunity of antiferromagnets to magnetic fields.

These campaigns contribute to the\nshaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign,\nsome may be deployed for nefarious purposes. It is therefore important to be\nable to detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment\nit becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and\nposes numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on\ndiscriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by\nmeans of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of\nattention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed\na machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as\ntrending on Twitter.After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity\ndata. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more\nchallenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is\navailable prior to trending.Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds\nof time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns,\ncontent and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We\nexplore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using millions of\ntweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75% AUC score for early\ndetection, increasing to above 95% after trending. We evaluate the robustness\nof the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time\nseries. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide\nconsistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early\ndetection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 04:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

The problem of image classification is often much\nmore challenging than text classification. On one hand, labeled text data is\nmore widely available than the labeled images for classification tasks. On the\nother hand, text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability, and they\nare often more directly related to class labels. On the contrary, the image\nfeatures are not directly related to concepts inherent in class labels. One of\nour goals in this paper is to develop a model for revealing the functional\nrelationships between text and image features as to directly transfer\nintermodal and intramodal labels to annotate the images. This is implemented by\nlearning a transfer function as a bridge to propagate the labels between two\nmultimodal spaces. However, the intermodal label transfers could be undermined\nby blindly transferring the labels of noisy texts to annotate images. To\nmitigate this problem, we present an intramodal label transfer process, which\ncomplements the intermodal label transfer by transferring the image labels\ninstead when relevant text is absent from the source corpus. In addition, we\ngeneralize the inter-modal label transfer to zero-shot learning scenario where\nthere are only text examples available to label unseen classes of images\nwithout any positive image examples.

Discrete choice models are widely studied in\neconomics and computational social sciences. As digital social networking\nfacilitates information flow and spread of influence between individuals, new\nadvances in modeling are needed to incorporate social information into these\nmodels in addition to characteristic features affecting individual choices. In\nthis paper, we propose two novel models with scalable training algorithms:\nlocal logistics graph regularization (LLGR) and latent class graph\nregularization (LCGR) models. We add social regularization to represent\nsimilarity between friends, and we introduce latent classes to account for\npossible preference discrepancies between different social groups. Training of\nthe LLGR model is performed using alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM), and training of the LCGR model is performed using a specialized Monte\nCarlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Scalability to large graphs is\nachieved by parallelizing computation in both the expectation and the\nmaximization steps. The LCGR model is the first latent class classification\nmodel that incorporates social relationships among individuals represented by a\ngiven graph. To evaluate our two models, we consider three classes of data to\nillustrate a typical large-scale use case in internet and social media\napplications.

This paper considers the stochastic control problem of deciding how much\nwater to store each day in the system, as well as deciding when to completely\nempty the water system, in order to tradeoff: the financial costs of the water,\nthe health costs implicit in long durations of storing the same water, the\npotential for a shortfall in the quantity of stored versus demanded water, and\nwater wastage from emptying the system. To solve this problem, we develop a new\nBinary Dynamic Search (BiDS) algorithm that is able to use binary search in one\ndimension to compute the value function of stochastic optimal control problems\nwith controlled resets to a single state and with constraints on the maximum\ntime span in between resets of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 04:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 18:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Hexagonal-type structures\nbased on low-energy modifications of MoN and TaN are the most stable ones over\nthe whole composition range. Despite being metastable, disordered cubic\npolymorphs are energetically significantly preferred over their ordered\ncounterparts. An in-depth analysis of atomic environments in terms of bond\nlengths and angles reveals that the chemical disorder results in (partially)\nbroken symmetry, i.e., the disordered cubic structure relaxes towards a\nhexagonal NiAs-type phase, the ground state of MoN. Surprisingly, also the\nsuperlattice architecture is clearly favored over the ordered cubic solid\nsolution.

To\nanalyse the effects of spatial heterogeneity of the signalling processes, along\nwith spatially-homogeneous ODE models we derive coupled PDE-ODE systems\nmodelling the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in the\nsignalling pathways. The values of the parameters in the model for the BR\nsignalling pathway are determined using experimental data on the gene\nexpression of BR biosynthetic enzymes. The stability of steady state solutions\nof our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters, can be related\nto the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the\ninteraction between transcription factors BZR and DELLA exerts more influence\non the dynamics of the signalling pathways than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of\nGA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription factors may\nconstitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA\nsignalling pathways. In general, perturbations in the GA signalling pathway\nhave larger effects on the dynamics of components of the BR signalling pathway\nthan perturbations in the BR signalling pathway on the dynamics of the GA\npathway. The perturbation in the crosstalk mechanism also has a larger effect\non the dynamics of the BR pathway than of the GA pathway. Large changes in the\ndynamics of the GA signalling processes can be observed only in the case where\nthere are disturbances in both the BR signalling pathway and the crosstalk\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 09:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 16:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

This technique has been used to detect\nionized and neutral species in exoplanet atmospheres by comparing the observed\nstellar lines in and out of transit. The centre-to-limb variation (CLV) of the\nstellar lines across the stellar disk is an important effect for transmission\nspectroscopy, since it results in a change of stellar line depth when the\nplanet transits different parts of the stellar disk. We reanalyse the transit\ndata of HD 189733b taken with the HARPS spectrograph to study the CLV effect\nduring transit. The transmission light curve of the Na i D line so obtained\nshows a clear imprint of the CLV effect. We use a one-dimensional non-LTE\nstellar spectral model to simulate the CLV effect. After applying the\ncorrection, the measurement of the Na i absorption in the atmosphere of HD\n189733b becomes better determined. We compare the CLV effect of HD 189733b to\nthat of HD 209458b. The CLV effects are different for these two benchmark\nplanetary systems and this is attributed to their different stellar effective\ntemperatures and transit impact parameters. We then explore the general CLV\neffect that occurs during exoplanet transits. Normally, a star with a lower\neffective temperature exhibits a stronger CLV effect and its CLV feature\nextends over a relatively broad wavelength range. The transit impact parameter\n(b) describes the transit trajectory on the stellar disk and thus determines\nthe actual manifestation of the CLV effect. We introduce a b-diagram which\ndescribes the behavior of the CLV effect as the function of different impact\nparameters. With improving observational precision, a careful modeling and\ncorrection of the CLV effect is necessary for exoplanet atmosphere\ncharacterisation using transit spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 09:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

The main computational effort is often spent on computing the\nsearch directions, which in MPC corresponds to solving unconstrained\nfinite-time optimal control (UFTOC) problems. This is commonly performed using\nRiccati recursions or generic sparsity exploiting algorithms. In this work the\nfocus is efficient search direction computations for active-set (AS) type\nmethods. The system of equations to be solved at each AS iteration is changed\nonly by a low-rank modification of the previous one, and exploiting this\nstructured change is important for the performance of AS type solvers. In this\npaper, theory for how to exploit these low-rank changes by modifying the\nRiccati factorization between AS iterations in a structured way is presented. A\nnumerical evaluation of the proposed algorithm shows that the computation time\ncan be significantly reduced by modifying, instead of re-computing, the Riccati\nfactorization.

Further, by measuring directly the reversibility of slow protocols, we\ncan distinguish unambiguously between protocols that can and cannot reach the\nexpected thermodynamic bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 11:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 21:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

In this paper, we aim at exploring the impact of\nproactive caching on an important metric for future generation networks,\nnamely, energy efficiency (EE). We argue that, exploiting the correlation in\nuser content popularity profiles in addition to the spatial repartitions of\nusers with comparable request patterns, can result in considerably improving\nthe achievable energy efficiency of the network. In this paper, the problem of\noptimizing EE is decoupled into two related subproblems. The first one\naddresses the issue of content popularity modeling. While most existing works\nassume similar popularity profiles for all users in the network, we consider an\nalternative caching framework in which, users are clustered according to their\ncontent popularity profiles. In order to showcase the utility of the proposed\nclustering scheme, we use a statistical model selection criterion, namely\nAkaike information criterion (AIC). Using stochastic geometry, we derive a\nclosed-form expression of the achievable EE and we find the optimal active\nsmall cell density vector that maximizes it. The second subproblem investigates\nthe impact of exploiting the spatial repartitions of users with comparable\nrequest patterns. After considering a snapshot of the network, we formulate a\ncombinatorial optimization problem that enables to optimize content placement\nsuch that the used transmission power is minimized. Numerical results show that\nthe clustering scheme enable to considerably improve the cache hit probability\nand consequently the EE compared with an unclustered approach. Simulations also\nshow that the small base station allocation algorithm results in improving the\nenergy efficiency and hit probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 13:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 09:05:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 14:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

Immediately after sample placement,\nthe diffusion coefficient of EA (D) increased by a factor of 2, while the\ntransverse NMR relaxation of NH3 protons decreased by factors of up to 22 in\ncomparison with bulk EAN, according to previously published data. Further\nexposure to the magnetic field leads to gradual changes of D, T1 and T2 with a\ntime constant of 70 min and a total equilibration time of longer than 4 hours.\nThis process does not depend on the orientation of the glass plates relative to\nthe magnetic field.

A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was applied to describe the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution. IC 310 showed an extraordinary TeV\nflare at the beginning of the campaign, followed by a low, but still detectable\nTeV flux. Compared to previous measurements, the spectral shape was found to be\nsteeper during the low emission state. Simultaneous observations in the soft\nX-ray band showed an enhanced energy flux state and a harder-when-brighter\nspectral shape behaviour. No strong correlated flux variability was found in\nother frequency regimes. The broad-band spectral energy distribution obtained\nfrom these observations supports the hypothesis of a double-hump structure. The\nharder-when-brighter trend in the X-ray and VHE emission is consistent with the\nbehaviour expected from a synchrotron self-Compton scenario.

The introduction of additional differential\nforms (DF) that form pairs with the original ones permits the splitting of the\nequations into topological momentum and continuity equations and\nmetric-dependent closure equations that apply the Hodge-star operator. Our\ndiscretization framework conserves this geometrical structure and provides for\nall DFs proper FE spaces such that the differential operators hold in strong\nform. We introduce lowest possible order discretizations of the split 1D wave\nequations, in which the discrete momentum and continuity equations follow by\ntrivial projections onto piecewise constant FE spaces, omitting partial\nintegrations. Approximating the Hodge-star by nontrivial Galerkin projections\n(GP), the two discrete metric equations follow by projections onto either the\npiecewise constant (GP0) or piecewise linear (GP1) space.\n  Our framework gives us three schemes with significantly different behavior.\nThe split scheme using twice GP1 is unstable and shares the dispersion relation\nwith the P1-P1 FE scheme that approximates both variables by piecewise linear\nspaces (P1). The split schemes that apply a mixture of GP1 and GP0 share the\ndispersion relation with the stable P1-P0 FE scheme that applies piecewise\nlinear and piecewise constant (P0) spaces.

The\nconservation of the number of particles constrains the minimizers to lie on a\nmanifold corresponding to the unit $L^2$ norm. The idea developed here is to\ntransform the original constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained\nproblem on this (spherical) Riemannian manifold, so that fast minimization\nalgorithms can be applied as alternatives to more standard constrained\nformulations. First, we obtain Sobolev gradients using an equivalent definition\nof an $H^1$ inner product which takes into account rotation. Then, the\nRiemannian gradient (RG) steepest descent method is derived based on projected\ngradients and retraction of an intermediate solution back to the constraint\nmanifold. Finally, we use the concept of the Riemannian vector transport to\npropose a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for this problem. It is\nderived at the continuous level based on the \"optimize-then-discretize\"\nparadigm instead of the usual \"discretize-then-optimize\" approach, as this\nensures robustness of the method when adaptive mesh refinement is performed in\ncomputations. We evaluate various design choices inherent in the formulation of\nthe method and conclude with recommendations concerning selection of the best\noptions.

Experimental results show that neural networks\nconsistently achieve better performance than feature-based approaches, and that\nour attention-based model significantly outperforms non-attention neural\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 17:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

The flow is assumed to be\npotential and is modeled by the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Actuation\nhas the form of blowing and suction localized on the main plate and is\nrepresented in terms of a sink-source singularity, whereas measurement of\npressure across the plate serves as system output. We focus on point-vortex\nequilibria forming a one-parameter family with locus approaching the trailing\nedge of the main plate and show that these equilibria are either unstable or\nneutrally stable. Using methods of linear control theory we find that the\nsystem dynamics linearised around these equilibria are both controllable and\nobservable for almost all actuator and sensor locations. The design of the\nfeedback control is based on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) compensator.\nComputational results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control and the key\nfinding is that Kasper Wing configurations are in general more controllable\nthan their single plate counterparts and also exhibit larger basins of\nattraction under LQG feedback control. The feedback control is then applied to\nsystems with additional perturbations added to the flow in the form of random\nfluctuations of the angle of attack and a vorticity shedding mechanism. Another\nimportant observation is that, in the presence of these additional\nperturbations, the control remains robust, provided the system does not deviate\ntoo far from its original state. Furthermore, introducing a vorticity shedding\nmechanism tends to enhance the effectiveness of the control. Physical\ninterpretation is provided for the results of the controllability and\nobservability analysis as well as the response of the feedback control to\ndifferent perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 02:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Due to poor underground\nwireless channel quality and long-range communication requirements, high\ntransmission power is typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data\nstreams; posing challenges for long term sustainable monitoring. In this paper,\nwe develop the first sustainable water sensing system, exploiting energy\nharvesting opportunities from water flows. Our system does this by scheduling\nthe transmission of a subset of the data streams, while other correlated\nstreams are estimated using auto-regressive models based on the sound-velocity\npropagation of pressure signals inside water networks. To compute the optimal\nscheduling policy, we formalize a stochastic optimization problem to maximize\nthe estimation reliability, while ensuring the system's sustainable operation\nunder dynamic conditions. We develop Data Transmission Scheduling (DTS), an\nasymptotically optimal scheme; and FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm\nthat can adapt to arbitrary energy and correlation dynamics. Using over 170\ndays of real data from our smart water system deployment and conducting\nin-vitro experiments to our small-scale testbed; our evaluation demonstrates\nthat Fast-DTS significantly outperforms three alternatives, considering data\nreliability, energy utilization, and sustainable operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 12:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}
