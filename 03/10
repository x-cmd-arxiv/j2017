Taking jump\nfunctions and the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm as the simplest example, we\nobserve that larger mutation rates give significantly better runtimes. For the\n$\\jump_{m,n}$ function, any mutation rate between $2/n$ and $m/n$ leads to a\nspeed-up at least exponential in $m$ compared to the standard choice.\n  The asymptotically best runtime, obtained from using the mutation rate $m/n$\nand leading to a speed-up super-exponential in $m$, is very sensitive to small\nchanges of the mutation rate. Any deviation by a small $(1 \\pm \\eps)$ factor\nleads to a slow-down exponential in $m$.

This includes the jackknife\nand bootstrap methods as estimators for the full survey area, and subsampling\nas an estimator of the covariance of subsamples. The limitations of the\njackknife covariance have been previously presented in the literature because\nit is effectively a rescaling of the covariance of the subsample area. However\nwe point out that subsampling is also biased, but for a different reason: the\nsubsamples are not independent, and the corresponding lack of power results in\nSSC underprediction. We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts\nthat allows the bias of each covariance estimator to be exactly predicted. We\nfind significant effects for a small-scale area or when a low number of\nsubsamples is used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for\nsubsampling and from 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates. The\ncross-redshift covariance is even more affected; biases range from 8% to 25%\nfor subsampling and from 50% to 90% for jackknife. Owing to the redshift\nevolution of the probe, the covariances cannot be debiased by a simple\nrescaling factor, and an exact debiasing has the same requirements as the full\nSSC prediction. These results thus disfavour the use of internal covariance\nestimators on data itself or a single simulation, leaving analytical prediction\nand simulations suites as possible SSC predictors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 16:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 10:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

These proper motions allow us to directly compare each star's\nmotion to the orientation of its candidate bow shock. Although these stars are\nsaturated in our imaging, we assess their motion by the shifts required to\nminimize residuals in their Airy rings. The results limit the direction of each\nstar's motion to sectors less than 90 degrees wide. None of the five stars are\nmoving away from the Carina Nebula's central clusters as runaway stars would\nbe, confirming that a candidate bow shock is not necessarily indicative of a\nrunaway star. Two of the five stars are moving tangentially relative to the\norientation of their candidate bow shocks, both of which point at the OB\ncluster Trumpler 14. In these cases, the large-scale flow of the interstellar\nmedium, powered by feedback from the cluster, appears to dominate over the\nmotion of the star in producing the observed candidate bow shock.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all\noptical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously\nradiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired\nchannels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage\nerror that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously\nknown bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Loyal communities have denser\nuser-user interaction networks and lower rates of triadic closure, suggesting\nthat community-level loyalty is associated with more cohesive interactions and\nless fragmentation into subgroups. We exploit these general patterns to predict\nfuture rates of loyalty. Our results show that a user's propensity to become\nloyal is apparent from their first interactions with a community, suggesting\nthat some users are intrinsically loyal from the very beginning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 01:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 14:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

The relevant figure of merit is the maximal ratio\n(called data hiding ratio) between the distinguishability norms associated with\nthe two sets of measurements we are comparing, typically all measurements vs\nLOCC protocols. For a bipartite $n\\times n$ quantum system, it is known that\nthe data hiding ratio scales as $n$, i.e. the square root of the real dimension\nof the local state space of density matrices. We show that for bipartite\n$n_A\\times n_B$ systems the maximum data hiding ratio against LOCC protocols is\n$\\Theta\\left(\\min\\{n_A,n_B\\}\\right)$. This scaling is better than the\npreviously obtained upper bounds $O\\left(\\sqrt{n_A n_B}\\right)$ and\n$\\min\\{n_A^2, n_B^2\\}$, and moreover our intuitive argument yields constants\nclose to optimal. In this paper, we investigate data hiding in the more general\ncontext of general probabilistic theories (GPTs), an axiomatic framework for\nphysical theories encompassing only the most basic requirements about the\npredictive power of the theory. The main result of the paper is the\ndetermination of the maximal data hiding ratio obtainable in an arbitrary GPT,\nwhich is shown to scale linearly in the minimum of the local dimensions. We\nexhibit an explicit model achieving this bound up to additive constants,\nfinding that the quantum mechanical data hiding ratio is only of the order of\nthe square root of the maximal one. Our proof rests crucially on an unexpected\nlink between data hiding and the theory of projective and injective tensor\nproducts of Banach spaces. Finally, we develop a body of techniques to compute\ndata hiding ratios for a variety of restricted classes of GPTs that support\nfurther symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

To facilitate this use, we also\npresent a variant of LIGER designed for large-volume simulations with low mass\nresolution. In this case, the galaxy distribution on large scales is obtained\nby biasing the matter-density field. Finally, we present two sample\napplications of LIGER.

If\npredominantly collisionally ionized, as we argue is most probable, the OVI\nobservations require that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $L_*$ galaxies\nholds nearly all the associated baryons within a virial radius ($\\sim\n10^{11}M_\\odot$) and hosts massive flows of cooling gas with\n$\\approx30[nT/30{\\rm~cm^{-3}K}]~M_\\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, which must be largely\nprevented from accreting onto the host galaxy. Cooling and feedback energetics\nconsiderations require $10 <\\langle nT\\rangle<100{\\rm~cm^{-3}K}$ for the warm\nand hot halo gases. We argue that virialized gas, boundary layers, hot winds,\nand shocks are unlikely to directly account for the bulk of the OVI.\nFurthermore, we show that there is a robust constraint on the number density of\nmany of the photoionized $\\sim10^4$K absorption systems that yields upper\nbounds in the range $n<(0.1-3)\\times10^{-3}(Z/0.3)$cm$^{-3}$, where $Z$ is the\nmetallicity, suggestive that the dominant pressure in some photoionized clouds\nis nonthermal. This constraint, which requires minimal ionization modeling, is\nin accord with the low densities inferred from more complex photoionization\nmodeling. The large amount of cooling gas that is inferred could re-form these\nclouds in a fraction of the halo dynamical time, as some arguments require, and\nit requires much of the feedback energy available from supernovae and stellar\nwinds to be dissipated in the CGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 19:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 02:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 06:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

It is therefore customary to\nstudy small-scale magnetic plasma turbulence by assuming a strong background\nmagnetic field relative to the turbulent fluctuations. This is done, for\nexample, in reduced models of plasmas, such as reduced MHD, reduced-dimension\nkinetic models, gyrokinetics, etc., which make theoretical calculations easier\nand numerical computations cheaper.

Next, we give a new\nalgorithm, UCB-GT, that exploits historical data and is adapted to time-varying\nfeedback graphs.

The DNS\nflows live in a compact space and they are not isotropic in their large scales.\nThe investigation of important phenomena of isotropic turbulence, such as\nanomalous scaling, through the DNS is affected by large scale effects. In this\nwork we put isotropic turbulence - or better, the associated formal theory - in\na 'box', through imposing periodicity at the level of the correlations\nfunctions. We offer a framework where one may investigate isotropic\ntheories/models through the data of DNS in a formally consistent manner. We\nwork at the level of the Karman-Howarth equation.

One important research interest in this\narea is content prefetching, which predicts and accurately fetches contents\nahead of users' requests to shift the traffic away during peak periods.\nHowever, in practice, the different video watching patterns among users, and\nthe varying network connection status lead to the time-varying server load,\nwhich eventually makes the content prefetching problem challenging. To\nunderstand this challenge, this paper first performs a large-scale measurement\nstudy on users' AP connection and TV series watching patterns using\nreal-traces. Then, based on the obtained insights, we formulate the content\nprefetching problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Therefore, communication should be realized comprehensively together\nwith its purpose and other functions.\n  The recent successful results in end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) show\nthe importance of comprehensive learning and the usefulness of end-to-end RL.\nAlthough little is known, we have shown that a variety of communications emerge\nthrough RL using a (recurrent) neural network (NN).

After\nlearning, each agent made an appropriate final decision after negotiation for\nany combination of 4 agents. Differentiation of individuality among the agents\nalso could be seen.\n  The 2nd one focused on discretization of communication signal. A sender agent\nperceives the receiver's location and generates a continuous signal twice by\nits RNN. A receiver agent receives them sequentially, and moves according to\nits RNN's output to reach the sender's location. When noises were added to the\nsignal, it was binarized through learning and 2-bit communication was\nestablished.\n  The 3rd one focused on end-to-end comprehensive communication.

When, as in\nintermediate polars (IP), the accreting white dwarf is magnetized, the disc is\ntruncated at the magnetospheric radius, but for mass-transfer rates\ncorresponding to the thermal-viscous instability such systems should still\nexhibit dwarf-nova outbursts. Yet, the majority of intermediate polars in which\nthe magnetic field is not large enough to completely disrupt the accretion\ndisc, seem to be stable, and the rare observed outbursts, in particular in\nsystems with long orbital periods, are much shorter than normal dwarf-nova\noutbursts. We investigate the predictions of the disc instability model for\nintermediate polars in order to determine which of the observed properties of\nthese systems can be explained by the DIM. We use our numerical code for the\ntime evolution of accretion discs, modified to include the effects of the\nmagnetic field, with constant or variable mass transfer from the secondary\nstar.

We show that the infrequent and short outbursts observed in\nlong period systems, such as e.g., TV Col, cannot be attributed to the\nthermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, but instead have to be\ntriggered by an enhanced mass-transfer from the secondary, or, more likely, by\nsome instability coupling the white dwarf magnetic field with that generated by\nthe magnetorotational instability operating in the accretion disc.

Building on the works of\nIzumi, Longo, Popa [ILP98] and Fidaleo, Isola [FI99], we consider generalized\nQ-systems (of intertwiners) for a semidiscrete inclusion of properly infinite\nvon Neumann algebras, which generalize ordinary Q-systems introduced by Longo\n[Lon94] to the infinite index case. We characterize inclusions which admit\ngeneralized Q-systems of intertwiners and define a braided product among the\nlatter, hence we construct examples of QFTs with defects (phase boundaries) of\ninfinite index, extending the family of boundaries in the grasp of [BKLR16].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 10:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

We predict the radio\nemission from V830 Tau b, the youngest (2 Myr) detected exoplanet to date. We\nmodel the host star wind using 3DMHD simulations that take into account its\nsurface magnetism. With this, we constrain the local conditions around V830 Tau\nb that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio\nflux densities of 6 to 24mJy, depending on the assumed radius of the planet\n(one or two Rjupiter). These radio fluxes are present peaks that are up to\ntwice the average values. We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent\n(a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100G),\nopposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to\n240MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By\ncomparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we\nconstrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values\nbetween ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the\nradio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of\n275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,\ncould be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically\nthick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. Planetary emission can only\npropagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission\nexceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency. For that, we find that for planetary\nradio emission to propagate through the host star wind, planetary magnetic\nfield strengths larger than ~1.3 to 13 G are required. The V830 Tau system is a\nvery interesting system for conducting radio observations from both the\nperspective of radio emission from the planet as well as from the host star's\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 11:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

One promising solution to\naddress this challenge is to adopt the low-resolution analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC) architecture. However, the practical implementation of such\narchitecture is challenging due to the required complex signal processing to\ncompensate the coarse quantization caused by low-resolution ADCs. Therefore,\nfew high-resolution ADCs are reserved in the recently proposed mixed-ADC\narchitecture to enable low-complexity transceiver algorithms. In contrast to\nprevious works over Rayleigh fading channels, we investigate the performance of\nmixed-ADC massive MIMO systems over the Rician fading channel, which is more\ngeneral for the 5G scenarios like Internet of Things (IoT). Specially, novel\nclosed-form approximate expressions for the uplink achievable rate are derived\nfor both cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). With\nthe increasing Rician $K$-factor, the derived results show that the achievable\nrate will converge to a fixed value. We also obtain the power-scaling law that\nthe transmit power of each user can be scaled down proportionally to the\ninverse of the number of base station (BS) antennas for both perfect and\nimperfect CSI. Moreover, we reveal the trade-off between the achievable rate\nand energy efficiency with respect to key system parameters including the\nquantization bits, number of BS antennas, Rician $K$-factor, user transmit\npower, and CSI quality. Finally, numerical results are provided to show that\nthe mixed-ADC architecture can achieve a better energy-rate trade-off compared\nwith the ideal infinite-resolution and low-resolution ADC architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 12:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

Although these networks\nare shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal\nsecurity to protect against malicious components or adversaries who breach the\nnetwork perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating\ncomponents must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be\nallowed to send and receive messages. This is achieved using an authentication\nframework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties\nand provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication).\nHowever, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict\nthe types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used.

We then evaluate the resulting knots\nusing a given invariant. A skein invariant can be computed on each link solely\nby the use of skein relations and a set of initial conditions. The new\nprocedure, remarkably, leads to generalizations of the known skein invariants.\nWe make skein invariants of classical links, $H[R]$, $K[Q]$ and $D[T]$, based\non the invariants of knots, $R$, $Q$ and $T$, denoting the regular isotopy\nversion of the Homflypt polynomial, the Kauffman polynomial and the Dubrovnik\npolynomial. We provide skein theoretic proofs of the well-definedness of these\ninvariants. These invariants are also reformulated into summations of the\ngenerating invariants ($R$, $Q$, $T$) on sublinks of a given link $L$, obtained\nby partitioning $L$ into collections of sublinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 12:38:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 14:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 22:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 10:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 20:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

For this purpose, experimental techniques such as Hi-C detecting\nchromosomal contacts are used to probe the three-dimensional genomic structure.\nThese experiments yield topological information, consistently showing a\nhierarchical subdivision of the genome into self-interacting domains across\nmany organisms. Current methods for detecting these domains using the Hi-C\ncontact matrix, i.e. a doubly-stochastic matrix, are mostly based on the\nassumption that the domains are distinct, thus non-overlapping. For overcoming\nthis simplification and for being able to unravel a possible nested domain\nstructure, we developed a probabilistic graphical model that makes no a priori\nassumptions on the domain structure. Within this approach, the Hi-C contact\nmatrix is analyzed using an Ising like probabilistic graphical model whose\ncoupling constant is proportional to each lattice point (entry in the contact\nmatrix). The results show clear boundaries between identified domains and the\nbackground. These domain boundaries are dependent on the coupling constant, so\nthat one matrix yields several clusters of different sizes, which show the\nself-interaction of the genome on different scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 12:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 17:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA\n(Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) are used in the most recent ISO 26262\napplications to identify component failures, errors and faults that lead to\nspecific hazards (in the presence of faults). However, these methods are based\non reliability theory, and they are not adequate to address new hazards caused\nby dysfunctional component interactions, software failure or human error. A\nholistic approach was developed called STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process\nAnalysis) which addresses more types of hazards and treats safety as a dynamic\ncontrol problem rather than an individual component failure. STPA also\naddresses types of hazardous causes in the absence of failure. Accordingly,\nthere is a need for investigating hazard analysis techniques like STPA. In this\npaper, we present a concept on how to use STPA to extend the safety scope of\nISO 26262 and support the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA) process.\nWe applied the proposed concept to a current project of a fully automated\nvehicle at Continental. As a result, we identified 24 system- level accidents,\n176 hazards, 27 unsafe control actions, and 129 unsafe scenarios. We conclude\nthat STPA is an effective and efficient approach to derive detailed safety\nconstraints. STPA can support the functional safety engineers to evaluate the\narchitectural design of fully automated vehicles and build the functional\nsafety concept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 12:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

In this paper, we validate a recently developed\nmethod for obtaining sensitivity functions (kernels) for travel-time\nmeasurements to solar interior flows using the Born approximation in spherical\ngeometry, which is expected to be more accurate than the classical ray\napproximation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical approach to efficiently\ncompute a large number of kernels based on the separability of the\neigenfunctions into their horizontal and radial dependence. The validation is\nperformed using a hydrodynamic simulation of linear wave propagation in the\nSun, which includes a standard single-cell meridional flow profile.

In order to closely match the model to\nobservations, we show that it is beneficial to use mode frequencies and damping\nrates which were extracted from the measured power spectrum. Furthermore, the\ncontribution of the radial flow to the total travel time is found to reach 20%\nof the contribution of the horizontal flow at travel distances over $40^\\circ$.\nUsing the Born kernels and a 2D SOLA inversion of travel times, we can recover\nmost features of the input meridional flow profile.

The mid-IR\nlight curves, which reveal the first detection of mid-IR variability from a\nULX, is determined to arise primarily from dust emission rather than from a jet\nor an accretion disk outflow. We derived the evolution of the dust temperature\n($T_\\mathrm{d}\\sim600 - 800$ K), IR luminosity ($L_\\mathrm{IR}\\sim3\\times10^4$\n$\\mathrm{L}_\\odot$), mass ($M_\\mathrm{d}\\sim1-3\\times10^{-6}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), and equilibrium temperature radius\n($R_\\mathrm{eq}\\sim10-20$ AU). A comparison of X-1 with a sample\nspectroscopically identified massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud on a\nmid-IR color-magnitude diagram suggests that the mass donor in X-1 is a\nsupergiant (sg) B[e]-star. The sgB[e]-interpretation is consistent with the\nderived dust properties and the presence of the [Fe II] ($\\lambda=1.644$\n$\\mu$m) emission line revealed from previous near-IR studies of X-1. We\nattribute the mid-IR variability of X-1 to increased heating of dust located in\na circumbinary torus. It is unclear what physical processes are responsible for\nthe increased dust heating; however, it does not appear to be associated with\nthe X-ray flux from the ULX given the constant X-ray luminosities provided by\nserendipitous, near-contemporaneous X-ray observations around the first mid-IR\nvariability event in 2014. Our results highlight the importance of mid-IR\nobservations of luminous X-ray sources traditionally studied at X-ray and radio\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 19:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

For this, the SM effective action in flat\nspacetime is adapted to curved spacetime via not only the general covariance\nbut also the gauge invariance. For the latter, gauge field hard masses, induced\nby loops at the UV scale $\\Lambda$, are dispelled by construing $\\Lambda$ as\nthe constant value assigned to curvature. This gives way to an unprecedented\nmechanism for incorporating gravity into the SM in that the hierarchy problem\nis solved by transmutation of the Higgs boson $\\Lambda^2$--mass into the\nHiggs-curvature coupling, and the cosmological constant problem is alleviated\nby metamorphosis of the vacuum $\\Lambda^4$--energy into the Einstein-Hilbert\nterm. Gravity emerges correctly if the SM is accompanied by a secluded dark\nsector sourcing non-interacting dark matter, dark energy and dark radiation.\nPhysics beyond the SM, containing Higgs-phobic scalars that resolve the strong\nCP problem, flavor problem, baryogenesis and inflation, respects the hierarchy.\nMajorana neutrinos are naturally incorporated if $\\Lambda$ lies at the see-saw\nscale.

In the complex octonion space, the precessional equilibrium\nequation infers the angular velocity of precession. The external\nelectromagnetic strength may induce a new precessional motion, generating a new\nterm of angular momentum, even if the orbital angular momentum is zero. This\nnew term of angular momentum can be regarded as the spin angular momentum, and\nits angular velocity of precession is different from the angular velocity of\nrevolution.
