Peleg and Rubinovich (FOCS'99)\nshowed a lower bound of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(D + \\sqrt{n})$ for this problem, where\n$D$ is the hop-diameter of $G$.\n  Whether or not this problem can be solved in $o(n)$ time when $D$ is\nrelatively small is a major notorious open question. Despite intensive research\n\\cite{LP13,N14,HKN15,EN16,BKKL16} that yielded near-optimal algorithms for the\napproximate variant of this problem, no progress was reported for the original\nproblem.\n  In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative. We devise an\nalgorithm that requires $O((n \\log n)^{5/6})$ time, for $D = O(\\sqrt{n \\log\nn})$, and $O(D^{1/3} \\cdot (n \\log n)^{2/3})$ time, for larger $D$. This\nrunning time is sublinear in $n$ in almost the entire range of parameters,\nspecifically, for $D = o(n/\\log^2 n)$. For the all-pairs shortest paths\nproblem, our algorithm requires $O(n^{5/3} \\log^{2/3} n)$ time, regardless of\nthe value of $D$.\n  We also devise the first algorithm with non-trivial complexity guarantees for\ncomputing exact shortest paths in the multipass semi-streaming model of\ncomputation.\n  From the technical viewpoint, our algorithm computes a hopset $G\"$ of a\nskeleton graph $G'$ of $G$ without first computing $G'$ itself. We then conduct\na Bellman-Ford exploration in $G' \\cup G\"$, while computing the required edges\nof $G'$ on the fly. As a result, our algorithm computes exactly those edges of\n$G'$ that it really needs, rather than computing approximately the entire $G'$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 16:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 14:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 08:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

Commonly practiced image-based\nrock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place\na scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D\nimages. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire\nreal-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results;\nhowever, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale\nobjects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is\nplanar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves\nour UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without\nplacement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is\nachieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images,\ntaking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking\n2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step\ntowards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a\nrock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and\nwithout using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects,\na point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale.\nComparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based\nmethod enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy\n(within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 16:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 16:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 15:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

However,\ncurrent social sensing services depend on Internet connectivity since the\nservices are deployed on central Cloud platforms. In many circumstances,\nInternet connectivity is constrained, for instance when a natural disaster\ncauses Internet outages or when people do not have Internet access due to\neconomical reasons. In this paper, we propose the emerging Fog Computing\ninfrastructure to become a key-enabler of social sensing services in situations\nof constrained Internet connectivity. To this end, we develop a generic\narchitecture and API of Fog-enabled social sensing services. We exemplify the\nusage of the proposed social sensing architecture on a number of concrete use\ncases from two different scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 17:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Since protected search was introduced in 2000, the area has grown\nrapidly; systems are offered by academia, start-ups, and established companies.\n  However, there is no best protected search system or set of techniques.\nDesign of such systems is a balancing act between security, functionality,\nperformance, and usability. This challenge is made more difficult by ongoing\ndatabase specialization, as some users will want the functionality of SQL,\nNoSQL, or NewSQL databases. This database evolution will continue, and the\nprotected search community should be able to quickly provide functionality\nconsistent with newly invented databases.\n  At the same time, the community must accurately and clearly characterize the\ntradeoffs between different approaches. To address these challenges, we provide\nthe following contributions:\n  1) An identification of the important primitive operations across database\nparadigms. We find there are a small number of base operations that can be used\nand combined to support a large number of database paradigms.\n  2) An evaluation of the current state of protected search systems in\nimplementing these base operations. This evaluation describes the main\napproaches and tradeoffs for each base operation. Furthermore, it puts\nprotected search in the context of unprotected search, identifying key gaps in\nfunctionality.\n  3) An analysis of attacks against protected search for different base\nqueries.\n  4) A roadmap and tools for transforming a protected search system into a\nprotected database, including an open-source performance evaluation platform\nand initial user opinions of protected search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 18:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 17:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

To be credible an\nobservational study that tests many causal hypotheses must demonstrate that its\nconclusions are neither artifacts of multiple testing nor of small biases from\nnonrandom treatment assignment. In a sense that needs to be defined carefully,\nhidden within a sensitivity analysis for nonrandom assignment is an enormous\ncorrection for multiple testing: in the absence of bias, it is extremely\nimprobable that multiple testing alone would create an association insensitive\nto moderate biases. We propose a new strategy called \"cross-screening\",\ndifferent from but motivated by recent work of Bogomolov and Heller on\nreplicability. Cross-screening splits the data in half at random, uses the\nfirst half to plan a study carried out on the second half, then uses the second\nhalf to plan a study carried out on the first half, and reports the more\nfavorable conclusions of the two studies correcting using the Bonferroni\ninequality for having done two studies. If the two studies happen to concur,\nthen they achieve Bogomolov-Heller replicability; however, importantly,\nreplicability is not required for strong control of the family-wise error rate,\nand either study alone suffices for firm conclusions. In randomized studies\nwith a few hypotheses, cross-split screening is not an attractive method when\ncompared with conventional methods of multiplicity control, but it can become\nattractive when hundreds or thousands of hypotheses are subjected to\nsensitivity analyses in an observational study.

In this paper, some new insights and approaches are\nprovided on these subjects. In the literature, the \"de-aliasing\" of aliased\neffects is deemed to be impossible. We argue that this \"impossibility\" can\nindeed be resolved by employing a new approach which consists of\nreparametrization of effects and exploitation of effect non-orthogonality. This\napproach is successfully applied to three classes of designs: regular and\nnonregular two-level fractional factorial designs, and three-level fractional\nfactorial designs. For reparametrization, the notion of conditional main\neffects (cme's) is employed for two-level regular designs, while the\nlinear-quadratic system is used for three-level designs.

Recent approaches to MOD systems have focused on environments\nwhere customers can only request rides through an app or by waiting at a\nstation. This paper develops MOD fleet management approaches for ride hailing,\nwhere customers may instead request rides simply by hailing a passing vehicle,\nan approach of particular importance for campus MOD systems. The challenge for\nride hailing is that customer demand is not explicitly provided as it would be\nwith an app, but rather customers are only served if a vehicle happens to be\nlocated at the arrival location. This work focuses on maximizing the number of\nserved hailing customers in an MOD system by learning and utilizing customer\ndemand. A Bayesian framework is used to define a novel customer demand model\nwhich incorporates observed pedestrian traffic to estimate customer arrival\nlocations with a quantification of uncertainty. An exploration planner is\nproposed which routes MOD vehicles in order to reduce arrival rate uncertainty.\nA robust ride hailing fleet management planner is proposed which routes\nvehicles under the presence of uncertainty using a chance-constrained\nformulation. Simulation of a real-world MOD system on MIT's campus demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of the planners.

Stochastic encryption is employed as a counter measure that flips\nthe quantization bits at each sensor according to certain probabilities, and\nthe flipping probabilities are only known to the legitimate fusion center (LFC)\nbut not the eavesdropping fusion center (EFC). As a result, the LFC employs the\noptimal sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for sequential detection\nwhereas the EFC employs a mismatched SPRT (MSPRT). We characterize the\nasymptotic performance of the MSPRT in terms of the expected sample size as a\nfunction of the vanishing error probabilities. We show that when the detection\nerror probabilities are set to be the same at the LFC and EFC, every symmetric\nstochastic encryption is ineffective in the sense that it leads to the same\nexpected sample size at the LFC and EFC. Next, in the asymptotic regime of\nsmall detection error probabilities, we show that every stochastic encryption\ndegrades the performance of the quantized sequential detection at the LFC by\nincreasing the expected sample size, and the expected sample size required at\nthe EFC is no fewer than that is required at the LFC.

Although this\noptimization problem is nonconvex, we show that if the acceptable tolerance of\nthe increase in the expected sample size at the LFC induced by the stochastic\nencryption is small enough, then the globally optimal stochastic encryption can\nbe analytically obtained; and moreover, the optimal scheme only flips one type\nof quantized bits (i.e., 1 or 0) and keeps the other type unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 22:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The proposed system performs speech\nenhancement in an end-to-end (i.e., waveform-in and waveform-out) manner, which\ndif-fers from most existing denoising methods that process the magnitude\nspectrum (e.g., log power spectrum (LPS)) only. Because the fully connected\nlayers, which are involved in deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional\nneural networks (CNN), may not accurately characterize the local information of\nspeech signals, particularly with high frequency components, we employed fully\nconvolutional layers to model the waveform. More specifically, FCN consists of\nonly convolutional layers and thus the local temporal structures of speech\nsignals can be efficiently and effectively preserved with relatively few\nweights. Experimental results show that DNN- and CNN-based models have limited\ncapability to restore high frequency components of waveforms, thus leading to\ndecreased intelligibility of enhanced speech. By contrast, the proposed FCN\nmodel can not only effectively recover the waveforms but also outperform the\nLPS-based DNN baseline in terms of short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)\nand perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). In addition, the number of\nmodel parameters in FCN is approximately only 0.2% compared with that in both\nDNN and CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 04:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 09:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 11:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

Since this model\nassumes that turbulent motions are restricted to only radial and tangential\ndirections, it has a special broadening function with notably narrow width due\nto the projection effect, the validity of which has not yet been confirmed in\npractice. With an aim to check whether this RTM model adequately represents the\nactual solar photospheric velocity field, we carried out an extensive study on\nthe non-thermal velocity dispersion along the line-of-sight (V_los) by\nanalyzing spectral lines at various points of the solar disk based on\nlocally-averaged as well as high spatial-resolution spectra, and found the\nfollowing results. First, the center-to-limb run of V_los derived from\nground-based low-resolution spectra is simply monotonic with a slightly\nincreasing tendency, which contradicts the specific trend (an appreciable peak\nat theta~45 deg) predicted from RTM. Second, the V_los values derived from a\nlarge number of spectra based on high-resolution space observation revealed to\nfollow a nearly normal distribution, without any sign of peculiar distribution\nexpected for the RTM case. These two observational facts indicate that the\nactual solar velocity field is not such simply dichotomous as assumed in RTM,\nbut directionally more chaotic. We thus conclude that RTM is not an adequate\nmodel at least for solar-type stars, which would significantly overestimate the\nturbulent velocity dispersion by a factor of ~2. The classical Gaussian\nmacroturbulence model should be more reasonable in this respect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 06:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Their structure and characteristics\ndetermine efficiency and effectiveness. Two fundamental building blocks or\ngenerating functions (GFs) for invariants are discovered, which are dot product\nand vector product of point vectors in Euclidean space. The primitive\ninvariants (PIs) can be derived by carefully selecting different products of\nGFs and calculating the corresponding multiple integrals, which translates\npolynomials of coordinates of point vectors into geometric moments. Then the\ninvariants themselves are expressed in the form of product of moments. This\nprocedure is just like DNA encoding proteins. All GMIs available in the\nliterature can be decomposed into linear combinations of PIs. This paper shows\nthat Hu's seven well known GMIs in computer vision have a more deep structure,\nwhich can be further divided into combination of simpler PIs. In practical\nuses, low order independent GMIs are of particular interest. In this paper, a\nset of PIs for similarity transformation and affine transformation in 2D are\npresented, which are simpler to use, and some of which are newly reported.

This paper\ncomparatively evaluates malware classification using both closed set and open\nset protocols for intrusion recognition on the KDDCUP'99 dataset.

We find that the W-SVM\noffers superior performance under the open set regime, particularly as the cost\nof misclassifying unknown classes at query time (i.e., classes not present in\nthe training set) increases. Results of performance tradeoff with respect to\ncost of unknown as well as discussion of the ramifications of these findings in\nan operational setting are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 07:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Such excitation measures result from the 2nd law of thermodynamics\nand turn out to be L\\'{e}vy measures. As compared to the Drude\n(Lorentz--Sommerfeld) model, widely used in Physics, the quantum many-body\nproblem studied here predicts a much smaller AC-conductivity at large\nfrequencies. This indicates (in accordance with experimental results) that the\nrelaxation time of the Drude model, seen as an effective parameter for the\nconductivity, should be highly frequency-dependent. We conclude by proposing an\nalternative effective description - using L\\'{e}vy Processes in Fourier space -\nof the phenomenon of electrical conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 08:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

To tackle this problem, either enlarging the\ntransfer power or changing the infrastructure of WPT system could be an\nintuitively proposed way. However, the drastically important issue on the user\nexposure of electromagnetic radiation is rarely considered while we try to\nimprove the efficiency of WPT. In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power\nBeacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed\non a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation\nlevel (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be\nanswered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at\nthe users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of\nWPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain\nthan the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of\nDA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation\npower density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL\npublished by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the\nclosed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user\nin the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order\nto maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed\nantennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the\ntypical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a\nbenchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is\nshown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power\nthan CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 08:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We first consider the\npossibility that the material of the ring originated in the disruption of a\nsatellite that had reached a critical distance from the centaur. We discuss the\nconditions for the putative satellite to approach the centaur as a consequence\nof tidal interaction. A three-body encounter is also considered as a transport\nmechanism. In addition, we study the case in which the ring is formed by the\nejecta of a cratering collision on the centaur and we constrain the collision\nparameters and the size of the resulting crater of the event. Finally, we\nconsider that the ring material originates from a catastrophic collision\nbetween a background object and a satellite located at a distance corresponding\nto the the current location of the ring. We compute the typical timescales for\nthese scenarios. We estimate that in order to be tidally disrupted a satellite\nwould have had to be larger than approximately 6.5 km at the location of the\nrings. However the tidal interaction is rather weak for objects of the size of\nouter solar system bodies at the ring location, therefore we considered other\nmore effective mechanisms by which a satellite migt have approached the\ncentaur.

The presence of noise in\nobserved images makes deconvolution a nontrivial task that necessitates the use\nof regularisation. This task is particularly difficult when the PSF varies\nspatially as is the case for the Euclid telescope. New surveys will provide\nimages containing thousand of galaxies and the deconvolution regularisation\nproblem can be considered from a completely new perspective. In fact, one can\nassume that galaxies belong to a low-rank dimensional space. This work\nintroduces the use of the low-rank matrix approximation as a regularisation\nprior for galaxy image deconvolution and compares its performance with a\nstandard sparse regularisation technique. This new approach leads to a natural\nway to handle a space variant PSF. Deconvolution is performed using a Python\ncode that implements a primal-dual splitting algorithm. The data set considered\nis a sample of 10 000 space-based galaxy images convolved with a known\nspatially varying Euclid-like PSF and including various levels of Gaussian\nadditive noise. Performance is assessed by examining the deconvolved galaxy\nimage pixels and shapes. The results demonstrate that for small samples of\ngalaxies sparsity performs better in terms of pixel and shape recovery, while\nfor larger samples of galaxies it is possible to obtain more accurate estimates\nof the galaxy shapes using the low-rank approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 10:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The analytical approach is at the continuum scale, based on Darcy's\nlaw and Therzaghi's effective stress principle.

In the analogy with the development of homological\nalgebra for abelian categories the present paper should be viewed as the\nanalogue of the development of homological algebra for abelian groups. Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis. Second, there is a far\nreaching analogy between Bmod^s and the category of operators in Hilbert space,\nand in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms.\nThe third fundamental result is that, even for finite objects of Bmod^s the\nresulting homological algebra is non-trivial and gives rise to a computable Ext\nfunctor.

The node stores the\nharvested energy in an energy buffer and uses the stored energy to transmit\ndata to the AP in the uplink (UL). We investigate two simple online\ntransmission policies for the EH node, namely a best-effort policy and an\non-off policy, which do not require knowledge of the EH profile nor channel\nknowledge. In particular, for both policies, the EH node transmits in each time\nslot with a constant desired power if sufficient energy is available in its\nenergy buffer. Otherwise, the node transmits with the maximum possible power in\nthe best-effort policy and remains silent in the on-off policy. For both\npolicies, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to\nanalyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and\ninfinite-size energy buffers. We provide this limiting distribution in closed\nform for a Nakagami-m fading DL channel and analyze the outage probability for\na Nakagami-m fading UL channel. All derived analytical results are not limited\nto EH via RF WPT but are applicable for any independent and identically\ndistributed EH process, originating from e.g. solar and wind energy. Our\nresults reveal that, for low outage probabilities, the best-effort policy is\nsuperior to the on-off policy and the optimal constant UL transmit power of the\nEH node that minimizes the outage probability is always less than the average\nharvested power but increases with the capacity of the energy buffer.

Among the numerous possible scenarios suggested to explain its\nradial confinement, one hypothesis is based on Maxwell stresses that are\nexerted by the cyclic dynamo magnetic field of the Sun penetrating over a skin\ndepth below the turbulent convection zone. Our goal is to assess under which\nconditions (turbulence level in the tachocline, strength of the\ndynamo-generated field, spreading mechanism) this scenario can be realized in\nthe solar tachocline. We develop a simplified 1D model of the upper tachocline\nunder the influence of an oscillating magnetic field imposed from above. The\nturbulent transport is parametrized with enhanced turbulent diffusion (or\nanti-diffusion) coefficients. Two main processes that thicken the tachocline\nare considered; either turbulent viscous spreading or radiative spreading. An\nextensive parameter study is carried out to establish the physical parameter\nregimes under which magnetic confinement of the tachocline that is due to a\nsurface dynamo field can be realized. We have explored a large range of\nmagnetic field amplitudes, viscosities, ohmic diffusivities and thermal\ndiffusivities. We find that, for large but still realistic magnetic field\nstrengths, the differential rotation can be suppressed in the upper radiative\nzone (and hence the tachocline confined) if weak turbulence is present (with an\nenhanced ohmic diffusivity of $\\eta > 10^{7-8} \\, cm^2/s$), even in the\npresence of radiative spreading.

The relativistic particles can interact with different fields\n(magnetic or radiation) in the colliding-wind region and produce non-thermal\nemission. In many cases, non-thermal synchrotron radiation might be observable\nand thus constitute an indicator of the existence of a relativistic particle\npopulation in these multiple systems. To date, the catalogue of PACWBs includes\nabout 40 objects spread over many stellar types and evolutionary stages, with\nno clear trend pointing to privileged subclasses of objects likely to\naccelerate particles. This paper aims at discussing critically some criteria\nfor selecting new candidates among massive binaries. The subsequent search for\nnon-thermal radiation in these objects is expected to lead to new detections of\nparticle accelerators. On the basis of this discussion, some broad ideas for\nobservation strategies are formulated. At this stage of the investigation of\nPACWBs, there is no clear reason to consider particle acceleration in massive\nbinaries as an anomaly or even as a rare phenomenon. We therefore consider that\nseveral PACWBs will be detected in the forthcoming years, essentially using\nsensitive radio interferometers which are capable of measuring synchrotron\nemission from colliding-wind binaries. Prospects for high-energy detections are\nalso briefly addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 14:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Red giant branch (RGB) stars are very bright objects in galaxies and\nare often used as standard candles. Interferometry is the ideal tool to\ncharacterize the dynamics and morphology of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim at\nprecisely characterising the surface dynamics of a sample of RGB stars.\nMethods. We obtained interferometric observations for three RGB stars with the\nMIRC instrument mounted at the CHARA interfer- ometer. We looked for\nasymmetries on the stellar surfaces using limb-darkening models. Results. We\nmeasured the apparent diameters of HD197989 (Epsilon Cyg) = 4.61+-0.02 mas,\nHD189276 (HR7633) = 2.95+-0.01 mas, and HD161096 (Beta Oph) = 4.43+-0.01 mas.\nWe detected departures from the centrosymmetric case for all three stars with\nthe tendency of a greater effect for lower logg of the sample. We explored the\ncauses of this signal and conclude that a possible explanation to the\ninterferometric signal is the convection-related and/or the magnetic-related\nsurface activity. However, it is necessary to monitor these stars with new\nobservations, possibly coupled with spectroscopy, in order to firmly establish\nthe cause.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 14:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Methods - We modelled a standing kink wave in a density-enhanced loop\nwith the three dimensional (3-D), resistive magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d.\nWe conducted a parameter study on the viscosity and resistivity coefficients to\nexamine the effects of dissipation on the KHI. Results - Enhancing the\nviscosity and resistivity acts to suppress the KHI. Larger values delay the\nformation of the instability and, in some cases, prevent the onset completely.\nThis leads to the earlier onset of heating for smaller values of the transport\ncoefficients. We note that viscosity has a greater effect on the development of\nthe KHI than resistivity. Furthermore, when using anomalous resistivity, the\nOhmic heating rate associated with the KHI may be greater than that associated\nwith the phase mixing that occurs in an instability-suppressed regime (using\nuniform resistivity). Conclusions - From our study, it is clear that the\nheating rate crucially depends on the formation of small length scales\n(influenced by the numerical resolution) as well as the values of resistivity\nand viscosity. As larger values of the transport coefficients suppress the KHI,\nthe onset of heating is delayed but the heating rate is larger.

The performance of the Kalman\nfilter (KF) can deteriorate in such applications because of the close relation\nto the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, this paper describes the use of\nStudent's t distribution to develop robust, scalable, and simple filtering and\nsmoothing algorithms.\n  After a discussion of Student's t distribution, exact filtering in linear\nstate-space models with t noise is analyzed. Intermediate approximation steps\nare used to arrive at filtering and smoothing algorithms that closely resemble\nthe KF and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother except for a nonlinear\nmeasurement-dependent matrix update. The required approximations are discussed\nand an undesirable behavior of moment matching for t densities is revealed. A\nfavorable approximation based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence is presented. Because of its relation to the KF, some properties and\nalgorithmic extensions are inherited by the t filter. Instructive simulation\nexamples demonstrate the performance and robustness of the novel algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 15:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

In this paper we\nstudy synchronization of phase oscillators on the most basic example of such a\nnetwork, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each site of the lattice carries an\noscillator that is subject to noise. Pairs of oscillators interact with each\nother at a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a\nsequence of interaction parameters. We look at block averages of the\noscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which we think of as block\ncommunities. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to\ninfinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a\nseparation of time scales, i.e., each block community behaves like a single\noscillator evolving on its own time scale. We argue that the evolution of the\nblock communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto\nequation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale\nof the block community. We find three universality classes for the\nsynchronization levels on successive hierarchical scales, characterized in\nterms of the sequence of interaction parameters.\n  What makes our model specifically challenging is the non-linearity of the\ninteraction betweenthe oscillators. The main results of our paper therefore\ncome in three parts: (I) a conjecture about the nature of the renormalisation\ntransformation connecting successive hierarchical scales; (II) a truncation\napproximation that leads to a simplified renormalization transformation; (III)\na rigorous analysis of the simplified renormalization transformation.

It is though surprisingly difficult\nand costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to\nthe variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in\nfull. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of\nlabels can thus be seen as prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to\ndetect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from\nnetwork sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while\nrelying on only minimal human input in model training phase. We propose a\ndiscriminative model that makes decisions based on all computer's traffic\nobserved during predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is\ntrained on collected traffic samples over equally sized time window per large\nnumber of computers, where the only labels needed are human verdicts about the\ncomputer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training\nthe model itself recognizes discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to\nindividual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of\nthem. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, while the\nlearned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. In the\nfollowing we implement the discriminative model as a neural network with\nspecial structure reflecting two stacked multi-instance problems. The main\nadvantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and\nability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types\n(together with their detectors) which are typically visited by infected\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 06:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-09"}

This\nstudy proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of\nexisting AGB map (Vieilledent's AGB map) by using a map of correction factors\ngenerated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.\nThe Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,\nwith parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic\nvariables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data\nwere used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)\nestimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density\nof 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the\nVieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was\ncalculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were\nobtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking\ninto account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to\nprovide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the\ncorrection factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The\nresults showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of\nVieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the\nRMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =\n0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids\nunderestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to\n550 t/ha with the first approach).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 10:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

For\ndesigning functional devices, it is important to determine the spin diffusion\nlength with sufficient accuracy from experimental results. An inaccurate\nestimation of spin diffusion length also affects the estimation of other\nparameters (e.g., spin mixing conductance, spin Hall angle) concomitantly. The\nspin diffusion length for platinum (Pt) has been reported in literature in a\nwide range of 0.5 - 14 nm, and particularly it is a constant value independent\nof Pt's thickness. Here, the key reasonings behind such wide range of reported\nvalues of spin diffusion length have been identified comprehensively.\nParticularly, it is shown here that a thickness-dependent conductivity and spin\ndiffusion length is necessary to simultaneously match the experimental results\nof effective spin mixing conductance and inverse spin Hall voltage due to spin\npumping. Such thickness-dependent spin diffusion length is tantamount to\nElliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, which bodes well for transitional\nmetals. This conclusion is not altered even when there is significant\ninterfacial spin memory loss. Furthermore, the variations in the estimated\nparameters are also studied, which is important for technological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 20:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 13:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}
