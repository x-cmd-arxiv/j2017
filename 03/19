These types of maneuvers\nare frequently utilized in missions such as rendezvous and docking, satellite\ninspection and formation flight where exclusion zones representing spacecraft\nor other obstacles must be avoided. The presence of these exclusion zones leads\nto non-linear and non-convex constraints which must be satisfied. In this\npaper, a novel approach to spacecraft relative motion planning with obstacle\navoidance and thrust constraints is developed. This approach is based on a\ngraph search applied to a virtual net of closed (periodic) natural motion\ntrajectories, where the natural motion trajectories represent virtual net nodes\n(vertices), and adjacency and connection information is determined by\nconditions defined in terms of safe, positively-invariant tubes built around\neach trajectory. These conditions guarantee that transitions from one natural\nmotion trajectory to another natural motion trajectory can be completed without\nconstraint violations. The proposed approach improves the flexibility of a\nprevious approach based on the use of forced equilibria, and has other\nadvantages in terms of reduced fuel consumption and passive safety. The\nresulting maneuvers, if planned on-board, can be executed directly or, if\nplanned off board, can be used to warm start trajectory optimizers to generate\nfurther improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 16:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

This contribution summarizes our theoretical work on the\npossibility to determine the electron neutrino mass by electron capture. One\nexpects the largest influence of the neutrino mass on this decay for a small Q\n= 2.8 keV for electron capture in Holmium. The energy of the Q value is\ndistributed to the emitted neutrino and the excitation of the Dy atom. Thus the\nenergy difference between the Q value and the upper end of the deexcitation\nspectrum is the electron neutrino mass.

A large sector\nof this theory that allows for scalarization, however, has been shown to be in\nconflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the cosmological\nevolution of the scalar field. We here study an extension of this theory by\nendowing the scalar field with a mass to determine whether this allows the\ntheory to pass Solar System constraints upon cosmological evolution for a\nlarger sector of coupling parameter space. We show that the cosmological scalar\nfield goes first through a quiescent phase, similar to the behavior of a\nmassless field, but then it enters an oscillatory phase, with an amplitude (and\nfrequency) that decays (and grows) exponentially. We further show that after\nthe field enters the oscillatory phase, its effective energy density and\npressure are approximately those of dust, as expected from previous\ncosmological studies. Due to these oscillations, we show that the scalar field\ncannot be treated as static today on astrophysical scales, and so we use\ntime-dependent perturbation theory to compute the scalar-field-induced\nmodifications to Solar System observables. We find that these modifications are\nsuppressed when the mass of the scalar field and the coupling parameter of the\ntheory are in a wide range, allowing the theory to pass Solar System\nconstraints, while in principle possibly still allowing for scalarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 19:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 14:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

A novel phenomenological consequence characteristic of this\nconstruction, potentially relevant for cosmological observations, is the\nexistence of an energy scale below which effects associated with the\nnon-integrability of spacetime distances, and an effective mass for the\nelectromagnetic field, appear simultaneously (as dual manifestations of the use\nof Weyl connections).

Increased Na\ncomposition on the substrate's surface and decreased growth temperature were\nboth found to favor Cu1-xKxInSe2 (CKIS) alloy formation, relative to\nmixed-phase CuInSe2 + KInSe2 formation. Structures from X-ray diffraction\n(XRD), band gaps, resistivities, minority carrier lifetimes and carrier\nconcentrations from time-resolved photoluminescence were in agreement with\nprevious reports, where low K/(K+Cu) composition films exhibited properties\npromising for photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Films grown at 400-500 C were then\nannealed to 600 C under Se, which caused K loss by evaporation in proportion to\ninitial K/(K+Cu) composition. Similar to growth temperature, annealing drove\nCKIS alloy consumption and CuInSe2 + KInSe2 production, as evidenced by high\ntemperature XRD. Annealing also decomposed KInSe2 and formed K2In12Se19. At\nhigh temperature the KInSe2 crystal lattice gradually contracted as temperature\nand time increased, as well as just time. Evaporative loss of K during\nannealing could accompany the generation of vacancies on K lattice sites, and\nmay explain the KInSe2 lattice contraction.

Here, the thermoelectric\nproperties of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are systematically investigated,\nbased on semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. It is found that spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) has important effects on electronic transport coefficients in\np-type doping, but neglectful influences on n-type ones. The room-temperature\nsheet thermal conductance is 14.2 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for SbTeI and 12.6\n$\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for BiTeI, which are lower than one of most well-known 2D\nmaterials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide, group IV-VI, group-VA and\ngroup-IV monolayers. By analyzing group velocities and phonon lifetimes, the\nvery low sheet thermal conductance of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers is mainly\ndue to small group velocities. It is found that the high-frequency optical\nbranches contribute significantly to the total thermal conductivity, being\nobviously different from usual picture with little contribution from optical\nbranches. According to cumulative lattice thermal conductivity with respect to\nphonon mean free path (MFP), it is difficulty to further reduce lattice thermal\nconductivity by nanostructures. Finally, possible thermoelectric figure of\nmerit $ZT$ of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are calculated. It is found that\nthe p-type doping has more excellent thermoelectric properties than n-type\ndoping, and at room temperature, the peak $ZT$ can reach 1.11 for SbTeI and\n0.87 for BiTeI, respectively. These results make us believe that ATeI (A=Sb and\nBi) monolayers may be potential 2D thermoelectric materials, and can stimulate\nfurther experimental works to synthesize these monolayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 09:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The extent to which the\nX-ray temperature jump is diluted by cooler unshocked gas projected through the\ncluster currently lacks quantification. Thus, here we apply our self-consistent\nN-body/hydro-dynamical code (based on FLASH) to model this binary cluster\nencounter. We can account for the location of the shock front and also the\nelongated X-ray emission by tidal stretching of the gas and dark matter between\nthe two cluster centers. The required total mass is $8.9 \\times 10^{14}$ Msun\nwith a 1.3:1 mass ratio favoring the southern cluster component. The relative\nvelocity we derive is $\\simeq 2500$ km/s initially between the two main cluster\ncomponents, with an impact parameter of 120 kpc. This solution implies that the\nshock temperature jump derived from the low angular resolution X-ray satellite\nSUZAKU is underestimated by a factor of two, due to cool gas in projection,\nbringing the observed X-ray and radio estimates into agreement. We propose that\nthe complex southern relics in CIZA J2242.8+5301, have been broken up as the\nsoutherly moving \"back\" shocked gas impacts the gas still falling in along the\ncollision axis. Finally, we use our model to generate Compton-y maps to\nestimate the reduction in radio flux caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(SZ) effect.

The model with no PrEP is calibrated with\nthe cumulative cases of infection by HIV and AIDS reported in Cape Verde from\n1987 to 2014, showing that it predicts well such reality. An optimal control\nproblem with a mixed state control constraint is then proposed and analyzed,\nwhere the control function represents the PrEP strategy and the mixed\nconstraint models the fact that, due to PrEP costs, epidemic context and\nprogram coverage, the number of individuals under PrEP is limited at each\ninstant of time. The objective is to determine the PrEP strategy that satisfies\nthe mixed state control constraint and minimizes the number of individuals with\npre-AIDS HIV-infection as well as the costs associated with PrEP. The optimal\ncontrol problem is studied analytically.

Solvation force\noscillations are found to be associated with the layering transition of liquid\nfilm and unstable jumps of AFM tip position. Detailed structural analyses and\nmolecular animations show that the local permeation of chain molecules and the\nsqueeze out of molecules near the edge of contact promote the layering\ntransition under compression. The confinement-induced slow down dynamics is\nmanifested by the decrease in diffusivity and increase in rotational relaxation\ntimes. However, the persistent diffusive behavior of dodecane chain molecules\neven in the single-monolayer film is attributed to the chain sliding motions,\ngiven the fact that substantial vacancy space exists in the film due to thermal\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 03:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

First, the effect of distributing K throughout bulk Cu1-xKxInSe2\nabsorbers at low K/(K+Cu) compositions (0 <= x <= 0.30) was studied.\nEfficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were greatly\nenhanced for x ~ 0.07, resulting in an officially-measured 15.0%-efficient\nsolar cell, matching to the world record CuInSe2 efficiency. The improvements\nwere a result of reduced interface and bulk recombination, relative to CuInSe2\n(x ~ 0). However, higher x compositions had reduced efficiency, short-circuit\ncurrent density (JSC), and FF due to greatly increased interface recombination,\nrelative to the x ~ 0 baseline. Next, the effect of confining K at the\nabsorber/buffer interface at high K/(K+Cu) compositions (0.30 <= x <= 0.92) was\nresearched. Previous work showed that these surface layer growth conditions\nproduced CuInSe2 with a large phase fraction of KInSe2. After optimization (75\nnm surface layer with x ~ 0.41), these KInSe2 surface samples exhibited\nincreased efficiency (officially 14.9%), VOC, and FF as a result of decreased\ninterface recombination. The KInSe2 surfaces had features similar to previous\nreports for KF post-deposition treatments (PDTs) used in world record CIGS\nsolar cells-taken as indirect evidence that KInSe2 can form during these PDTs.\nBoth the bulk and surface growth processes greatly reduced interface\nrecombination. However, the KInSe2 surface had higher K levels near the\nsurface, greater lifetimes, and increased inversion near the buffer interface,\nrelative to the champion bulk CKIS absorber. These characteristics demonstrate\nthat K may benefit PV performance by different mechanisms at the surface and in\nthe absorber bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 23:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

For the Ga-free case,\nincreased temperature improved PV performance in the KInSe2 surface absorbers,\nbut not in the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers.
