While direct simulations have made large strides toward understanding\ngeophysical systems, such models still inhabit modest ranges of the governing\nparameters that are difficult to extrapolate to planetary settings. The\ncanonical problem of rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection provides an\nalternate approach - isolating the fundamental physics in a reduced setting.\nTheoretical studies and asymptotically-reduced simulations in rotating\nconvection have unveiled a variety of flow behaviors likely relevant to natural\nsystems, but still inaccessible to direct simulation. In lieu of this, several\nnew large-scale rotating convection devices have been designed to characterize\nsuch behaviors. It is essential to predict how this potential influx of new\ndata will mesh with existing results. Surprisingly, a coherent framework of\npredictions for extreme rotating convection has not yet been elucidated. In\nthis study, we combine asymptotic predictions, laboratory and numerical\nresults, and experimental constraints to build a heuristic framework for\ncross-comparison between a broad range of rotating convection studies. We\ncategorize the diverse field of existing predictions in the context of\nasymptotic flow regimes. We then consider the physical constraints that\ndetermine the points of intersection between flow behavior predictions and\nexperimental accessibility. Applying this framework to several upcoming devices\ndemonstrates that laboratory studies may soon be able to characterize\ngeophysically-relevant flow regimes.

Each class can be topologically nontrivial if Andreev bound states are\nformed at the edges of the superconductor. Non-magnetic impurities in the\nsuperconductor affect the formation of Andreev bound states and can drastically\nchange the tunneling spectra for small voltages. Here, we investigate the mean\ncurrent and its fluctuations for two-dimensional tunnel junctions between a\nnormal-metal and unconventional superconductors by solving the quasi-classical\nEilenberger equation self-consistently, including the presence of non-magnetic\nimpurities in the superconductor. As the impurity strength increases, we find\nthat superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since (i)\nat zero applied bias, the effective transferred charge calculated from the\nnoise-current ratio tends to the electron charge $e$ and (ii) for finite bias,\nthe current-voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction.\nThere are notable exceptions to this trend. First, gapful nontrivial (chiral)\nsuperconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear\ndispersion relation of their surface Andreev bound states. Second, for nodal\nnontrivial superconductors, only p_x-wave pairing is almost immune to the\npresence of impurities due to the emergence of odd-frequency s-wave Cooper\npairs near the interface. Owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave\nvector, impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the\nrest of nodal superconductors. All these behaviors are neatly captured by the\nnoise-current ratio, providing a useful guide to find experimental signatures\nfor unconventional superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 16:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

We use a custom\nbuilt confocal rheoscope to image the particle configurations of a colloidal\nsuspension while simultaneously measuring the viscosity.

As the gap decreases below 15 particle\ndiameters, the viscosity first decreases from its bulk value, shows\nfluctuations with the gap, and then sharply increases for gaps below three\nparticle diameters. Further, we compare our experimental results to two\nsimulations techniques that enables us to determine the relative contributions\nof hydrodynamic and short range repulsive stresses.

Dropout variational\ninference (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical\napplications, but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty.\nAlpha-divergences are alternative divergences to VI's KL objective, which are\nable to avoid VI's uncertainty underestimation. But these are hard to use in\npractice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating\ndistributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of\nlimited use for practitioners. We propose a re-parametrisation of the\nalpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which,\ntogether with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply\nchanging the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates\nand accuracy compared to VI in dropout networks.

Hence, such an outflow environment is the perfect for\nour study. Methodes: We present synthetic polarisation maps in the infrared and\nmillimeter regime of protostellar outflows performed with the newly developed\nRT and polarisation code POLARIS. The code, as the first, includes a\nself-consistent description of various alignement mechanism like the imperfect\nDavis-Greenstein (IDG) and the radiative torque (RAT) alignment. We investigate\nfor which effects the grain size distribution, and applied alignement mechanism\nhave. Results: We find that the IDG mechanism cannot produce any measurable\npolarization degree (< 1 %) whereas RAT alignment produced polarization degrees\nof a few 1 %. Furthermore, we developed a method to identify the origin of the\npolarization. We show that the helical magnetic field in the outflow can only\nbe observed close to the outflow axis and at its tip, whereas in the\nsurrounding regions the hourglass field in the foreground dominates the\npolarization. Furthermore, the polarization degree in the outflow lobe is lower\nthan in the surroundings in agreement with observations. We also find that the\norientation of the polarization vector flips around a few 100 micron due to the\ntransition from dichroic extinction to thermal re-emission. Hence, in order to\navoid ambiguities when interpreting polarization data, we suggest to observed\nin the far-infrared and mm regime.

Whereas synchronization algorithms\nfor identical agents have been thoroughly studied, synchronization of\nheterogeneous networks still remains a challenging problem. The existing\nalgorithms primarily use the internal model principle, assigning to each agent\na local copy of some dynamical system (internal model). Synchronization of\nheterogeneous agents thus reduces to global synchronization of identical\ngenerators and local synchronization between the agents and their internal\nmodels. The internal model approach imposes a number of restrictions and leads\nto sophisticated dynamical (and, in general, nonlinear) controllers. At the\nsame time, passive heterogeneous agents can be synchronized by a very simple\nlinear protocol, which is used for consensus of first-order integrators. A\nnatural question arises whether analogous algorithms are applicable to\nsynchronization of agents that do not satisfy the passivity condition. In this\npaper, we study the synchronization problem for heterogeneous agents that are\nnot passive but satisfy a weaker input feedforward passivity (IFP) condition.\nWe show that such agents can also be synchronized by a simple linear protocol,\nprovided that the interaction graph is strongly connected and the couplings are\nsufficiently weak.

I propose that condensations form in the\nwarm, radiation pressure driven, accretion disk wind of quasars creating the\nBEL clouds and uniting them with the other two manifestations of cool, 10,000\nK, gas in quasars, the low ionization phase of the warm absorbers (WAs) and the\nclouds causing X-ray eclipses. The cool clouds will condense quickly (days to\nyears), before the WA outflows reach escape velocity (which takes months to\ncenturies). Cool clouds form in equilibrium with the warm phase of the wind\nbecause the rapidly varying X-ray quasar continuum changes the force\nmultiplier, causing pressure waves to move gas into stable locations in\npressure-temperature space. The narrow range of 2-phase equilibrium densities\nmay explain the scaling of the BELR size with the square root of luminosity,\nwhile the scaling of cloud formation timescales could produce the Baldwin\neffect. These dense clouds have force multipliers of order unity and so cannot\nbe accelerated to escape velocity. They fall back on a dynamical timescale\n(months to centuries), producing an inflow that rains down toward the central\nblack hole. As they soon move at Mach ~40 with respect to the WA outflow, these\n'raindrops' will be rapidly destroyed within months. This rain of clouds may\nproduce the elliptical BELR orbits implied by velocity resolved reverberation\nmapping in some objects, and can explain the opening angle and destruction\ntimescale of the narrow 'cometary' tails of the clouds seen in X-ray eclipse\nobservations. Some consequences and challenges of this 'quasar rain' model are\npresented along with several avenues for theoretical investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 18:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

We have identified 23 Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE)\ncandidates at $z$ = 6.9 in the central 2-deg$^2$ region, where DECam and public\nCOSMOS multi-band images exist. The resulting luminosity function can be\ndescribed as a Schechter function modified by a significant excess at the\nbright end (4 galaxies with $L_{Ly\\alpha} \\sim $ 10$^{43.4\\pm0.2}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$). The number density at $L_{Ly\\alpha}\\sim$ 10$^{43.4\\pm0.2}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ is little changed from z= 6.6, while at fainter $L_{Ly\\alpha}$ it is\nsubstantially reduced. Overall, we see a fourfold reduction in Ly$\\alpha$\nluminosity density from $z$ = 5.7 to 6.9. Combined with a more modest evolution\nof the continuum UV luminosity density, this suggests a factor of $\\sim 3$\nsuppression of Ly$\\alpha$ by radiative transfer through the $z \\sim$ 7\nintergalactic medium (IGM). It indicates an IGM neutral fraction $x_{HI}$\n$\\sim$ 0.4--0.6 (assuming Ly$\\alpha$ velocity offsets of 100-200 km s$^{-1}$).\nThe changing shape of the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity function between $z\\lesssim\n6.6$ and $z=6.9$ supports the hypothesis of ionized bubbles in a patchy\nreionization at $z\\sim$ 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 05:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 13:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

It aims to image 1500\nsquare degrees in four filters (ugri). The core science driver is mapping the\nlarge-scale matter distribution in the Universe, using weak lensing shear and\nphotometric redshift measurements. Further science cases include galaxy\nevolution, Milky Way structure, detection of high-redshift clusters, and\nfinding rare sources such as strong lenses and quasars. Here we present the\nthird public data release (DR3) and several associated data products, adding\nfurther area, homogenized photometric calibration, photometric redshifts and\nweak lensing shear measurements to the first two releases. A dedicated pipeline\nembedded in the Astro-WISE information system is used for the production of the\nmain release. Modifications with respect to earlier releases are described in\ndetail. Photometric redshifts have been derived using both Bayesian template\nfitting, and machine-learning techniques. For the weak lensing measurements,\noptimized procedures based on the THELI data reduction and lensfit shear\nmeasurement packages are used. In DR3 stacked ugri images, weight maps, masks,\nand source lists for 292 new survey tiles (~300 sq.deg) are made available.

However,\ncurrent and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes\npresent complex pupil geometries, including secondary mirror central\nobscurations, that prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources\nentirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized\npupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited\nthroughput for vortex charges $>2$. We present a family of pupil plane\napodizations that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric\ncentral obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors for charge 2, 4, and 6\nvector vortex coronagraphs. These apodizations are derived analytically and\nallow the vortex coronagraph to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the\npresence of central obscurations. For a charge 4 vortex, we design polynomial\napodization functions assuming a greyscale apodizing filter that represent a\nsubstantial gain in throughput over the ring-apodized vortex coronagraph\ndesign, while for a charge 6 vortex, we design polynomial apodized vortex\ncoronagraphs that have $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ total energy throughput for the entire\nrange of central obscuration sizes studied.

This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic\nblockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of\nwhich are specific parameterizations of the generalized random product graph\nmodel defined in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to first sample the\nnumber of edges $m$ and then sample each edge.

The framework emphasises control intermittency, and extends on existing\nmodels by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control\nusing a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes\nof motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is\nshown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent\ncontrol context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a\nsuperposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically\nobserved corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows\nstraightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing\none-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological\npsychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide\nsupport for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering\ncontrol, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better\ndescribed as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as\ncontinuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering\nadjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering\nerror, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue\nis affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to\nexplain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and\nadjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold\nmechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 20:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Instead of learning LSTM models over the pre-fixed\nstructures, we propose to further learn the intermediate interpretable\nmulti-level graph structures in a progressive and stochastic way from data\nduring the LSTM network optimization. We thus call this model the\nstructure-evolving LSTM. In particular, starting with an initial element-level\ngraph representation where each node is a small data element, the\nstructure-evolving LSTM gradually evolves the multi-level graph representations\nby stochastically merging the graph nodes with high compatibilities along the\nstacked LSTM layers. In each LSTM layer, we estimate the compatibility of two\nconnected nodes from their corresponding LSTM gate outputs, which is used to\ngenerate a merging probability. The candidate graph structures are accordingly\ngenerated where the nodes are grouped into cliques with their merging\nprobabilities. We then produce the new graph structure with a\nMetropolis-Hasting algorithm, which alleviates the risk of getting stuck in\nlocal optimums by stochastic sampling with an acceptance probability. Once a\ngraph structure is accepted, a higher-level graph is then constructed by taking\nthe partitioned cliques as its nodes. During the evolving process,\nrepresentation becomes more abstracted in higher-levels where redundant\ninformation is filtered out, allowing more efficient propagation of long-range\ndata dependencies. We evaluate the effectiveness of structure-evolving LSTM in\nthe application of semantic object parsing and demonstrate its advantage over\nstate-of-the-art LSTM models on standard benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 22:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Upon resampling, a random\npositive fraction of the population in a block of colonies inherits the type of\na random single individual in that block, which is why we refer to our system\nas the hierarchical Cannings process.\n  In the present paper, we study a version of the hierarchical Cannings process\nin random environment, namely, the resampling measures controlling the change\nof type of individuals in different blocks are chosen randomly with a given\nmean and are kept fixed in time (= the quenched setting).

Our results\nreveal a bimodal, spatiotemporally-complex stress response. During sunrise,\nstresses occur in the boulders' interiors that are associated with large-scale\ntemperature gradients developed due to overnight cooling. During sunset,\nstresses occur at the boulders' exteriors due to the cooling and contraction of\nthe surface. Both kinds of stresses are on the order of 10 MPa in 1 m boulders\nand decrease for smaller diameters, suggesting that larger boulders break down\nmore quickly. Boulders <30 cm exhibit a weak response to thermal forcing,\nsuggesting a threshold below which crack propagation may not occur. Boulders of\nany size buried by regolith are shielded from thermal breakdown. As boulders\nincrease in size (>1 m), stresses increase to several 10s of MPa as the\nbehavior of their surfaces approaches that of an infinite halfspace. As the\nthermal wave loses contact with the boulder interior, stresses become limited\nto the near-surface. This suggests that the survival time of a boulder is not\nonly controlled by the amplitude of induced stress, but also by its diameter as\ncompared to the diurnal skin depth. While stresses on the order of 10 MPa are\nenough to drive crack propagation in terrestrial environments, crack\npropagation rates in vacuum are not well constrained. We explore the\nrelationship between boulder size, stress, and the direction of crack\npropagation, and discuss the implications for the relative breakdown rates and\nestimated lifetimes of boulders on airless body surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 00:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

This is commonly referred to as making the local equilibrium\nassumption. Assuming local equilibrium (LE), Eulerian textbook treatments\nderive the retarded ADE, ostensibly exactly. However, other authors have\npresented rigorous mathematical derivations of the dispersive effect of mass\ntransfer, applicable even in the case of arbitrarily fast mass transfer. First,\nwe resolve the apparent contradiction between these seemingly exact derivations\nby adopting a Lagrangian point of view. We show that LE constrains the expected\ntime immobile, whereas the retarded ADE actually embeds a stronger,\nnonphysical, constraint: that all particles spend the same amount of every time\nincrement immobile. Eulerian derivations of the retarded ADE thus silently\ncommit the gambler's fallacy, leading them to ignore dispersion due to mass\ntransfer that is correctly modeled by other approaches. Second, we present a\nnumerical particle tracking study of transport in a heterogeneous aquifer\nsubject to first-order MIMT. Transport is modeled (a) exactly, and then (b)\napproximated with the retarded ADE. Strikingly different results are obtained,\neven though quasi-LE is maintained at all times by the exact MIMT simulation.\nWe thus observe that use of the phrase local equilibrium assumption to refer to\nADE validity is not correct. We highlight that solute remobilization rate is\nthe true control on retarded ADE validity, and note that classic \"local\nequilibrium assumption\" (i.e., ADE validity) criteria actually test for\ninsignificance of MIMT-driven dispersion relative to hydrodynamic dispersion,\nrather than for local equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 00:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

In particular, we use the\nfact that, the fluctuations of intensity of thin channel maps are mostly\naffected by the turbulent velocity, while the thick maps are dominated by\ndensity variations. We study how contributions of the fundamental MHD modes\naffect the Velocity Channel Gradients (VChGs) and demonstrate that the VChGs\narising from Alfven and slow modes are aligned perpendicular to the local\ndirection of magnetic field, while the VChGs produced by the fast mode are\naligned parallel to the magnetic field. The dominance of the Alfven and slow\nmodes in the interstellar media will therefore allow a reliable magnetic field\ntracing using the VChGs.

DA-MCMC samples tend\nto become highly autocorrelated in large data samples, due to a miscalibration\nproblem in which conditional posterior distributions given augmented data are\ntoo concentrated.

At day 14, about 50% of\nthe cells in pellets cultured in either serum type differentiated into\nhypertrophic dark chondrocytes and the proportion of paralysed cells was\nmarkedly decreased. After 21 days in each culture, more than 70% of the cells\nwere hypertrophic dark chondrocytes and no paralysed chondrocytes could be\nobserved. The paralysed chondrocytes may be not dying and they likely to be an\nimmature form of hypertrophic dark chondrocytes. It is better to use the term\nimmature dark chondrocytes instead of paralysed cells. This culture system will\nbe useful for further molecular studies on paralysed chondrocytes and to\nexplore the functions of these cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 04:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

The key\nconstraint in the optimal selection is a convex quadratic constraint that\nensures genetic diversity, therefore, the optimal selection can be cast as a\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Yamashita et al. (2015) exploits\nthe structural sparsity of the quadratic constraints and reduces the\ncomputation time drastically while attaining the same optimal solution.\n  This paper is concerned with the special case of equal deployment (ED), in\nwhich we solve the optimal selection problem with the constraint that\ncontribution of genotypes must either be a fixed size or zero. This involves a\nnature of combinatorial optimization, and the ED problem can be described as a\nmixed-integer SOCP problem.\n  In this paper, we discuss conic relaxation approaches for the ED problem\nbased on LP (linear programming), SOCP, and SDP (semidefinite programming).

The width of the gap is assumed\nto be the diameter of the brown dwarf Hill sphere.

The SED of a protostellar disc with\na massive fragment might have a similar double peaked profile to the SED of a\nmore evolved disc that contains a gap.

Among these systems, the iron selenides hold the\nrecord for highest superconducting transition temperature and pose especially\nstriking puzzles regarding the nature of superconductivity. The pairing state\nof the alkaline iron selenides appears to be of $d$-wave type based on the\nobservation of a resonance mode in neutron scattering, while it seems to be of\n$s$-wave type from the nodeless gaps observed everywhere on the Fermi surface\n(FS). Here we propose an orbital-selective pairing state, dubbed $s \\tau_{3}$,\nas a natural explanation of these disparate properties. The pairing function,\ncontaining a matrix $\\tau_{3}$ in the basis of $3d$-electron orbitals, does not\ncommute with the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian. This dictates the existence\nof both intraband and interband pairing terms in the band basis. A spin\nresonance arises from a $d$-wave-type sign change in the intraband pairing\ncomponent whereas the quasiparticle excitation is fully gapped on the FS due to\nan $s$-wave-like form factor associated with the addition in quadrature of the\nintraband and interband pairing terms. We demonstrate that this pairing state\nis energetically favored when the electron correlation effects are orbitally\nselective. More generally, our results illustrate how the multiband nature of\ncorrelated electrons affords unusual types of superconducting states, thereby\nshedding new light not only on the iron-based materials but also on a broad\nrange of other unconventional superconductors such as heavy fermion and organic\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 08:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

We find that, due to its unique electronic structure, the\nsituation of the TLG is drastically different from that of the monolayer\ngraphene. Firstly, the adatom on rhombohedral stacked TLG (r-TLG) can have a\nFano-shaped impurity spectral density, instead of the normal Lorentzian-like\none, when the impurity level is around the Fermi level. Secondly, the impurity\nlevel of the adatom on r-TLG can be tuned into an in-gap state by an external\nelectric field, which strongly depends on the direction of the applied electric\nfield and can significantly affect the local magnetic moment formation.\nFinally, we systematically calculate the impurity magnetic phase diagrams,\nconsidering various stacking orders, adsorption sites, doping and electric\nfield. We show that, because of the in-gap state, the impurity magnetic phase\nof r-TLG will obviously depend on the direction of the applied electric field\nas well. All our theoretical results can be readily tested in experiment, and\nmay give a comprehensive understanding about the local magnetic moment of\nadatom on TLG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 08:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Due to the weak interlayer couplings, the\nband structures of the individual 2D crystals are largely preserved upon\nformation of the heterostructure. However, regardless of the details of the\ninterlayer hybridisation, the size of the 2D crystal band gaps are always\nreduced due to the enhanced dielectric screening provided by the surrounding\nlayers. The effect can be on the order of electron volts, but its precise\nmagnitude is non-trivial to predict because of the non-local nature of the\nscreening in quasi-2D materials, and it is not captured by effective\nsingle-particle methods such as density functional theory. Here we present an\nefficient and general method for calculating the band gap renormalization of a\n2D material embedded in an arbitrary vdWH. The method evaluates the change in\nthe GW self-energy of the 2D material from the change in the screened Coulomb\ninteraction. The latter is obtained using the quantum-electrostatic\nheterostructure (QEH) model. We benchmark the G$\\Delta$W method against full\nfirst-principles GW calculations and use it to unravel the importance of\nscreening-induced band structure renormalisation in various vdWHs. A main\nresult is the observation that the size of the band gap reduction of a given 2D\nmaterial when inserted into a heterostructure scales inversely with the\npolarisability of the 2D material. Our work demonstrates that dielectric\nengineering \\emph{via} van der Waals heterostructuring represents a promising\nstrategy for tailoring the band structure of 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 09:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

In this paper, we focus on the robustness of {\\em maximal independent\nsets} (MIS).

We study the influence of the boron\ncontent in MgO / FeCoB /Ta systems alloys on their Gilbert damping after\ncrystallization annealing. Increasing the boron content from 20 to 30\\%\nincreases the crystallization temperature, thereby postponing the onset of\nelemental diffusion within the free layer. This reduction of the interdiffusion\nof the Ta atoms helps maintaining the Gilbert damping at a low level of 0.009\nwithout any penalty on the anisotropy and the magneto-transport properties up\nto the 400$^\\circ$C annealing required in CMOS back-end of line processing. In\naddition, we show that dual MgO free layers of composition\nMgO/FeCoB/Ta/FeCoB/MgO have a substantially lower damping than their\nMgO/FeCoB/Ta counterparts, reaching damping parameters as low as 0.0039 for a 3\n\\r{A} thick Tantalum spacer. This confirms that the dominant channel of damping\nis the presence of Ta impurities within the FeCoB alloy. On optimized tunnel\njunctions, we then study the duration of the switching events induced by\nspin-transfer-torque. We focus on the sub-threshold thermally activated\nswitching in optimal applied field conditions. From the electrical signatures\nof the switching, we infer that once the nucleation has occurred, the reversal\nproceeds by a domain wall sweeping though the device at a few 10 m/s. The\nsmaller the device, the faster its switching. We present an analytical model to\naccount for our findings. The domain wall velocity is predicted to scale\nlinearly with the current for devices much larger than the wall width. The wall\nvelocity depends on the Bloch domain wall width, such that the devices with the\nlowest exchange stiffness will be the ones that host the domain walls with the\nslowest mobilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 09:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 08:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In zero field, SrDy2O4 lacks long-range\nmagnetic order down to temperatures as low as 60 mK, and the observed powder\nneutron diffraction (PND) patterns are dominated by very broad diffuse\nscattering peaks. Single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the\nzero-field magnetic structure consists of a collection of antiferromagnetic\nchains running along the c axis and that there is very little correlation\nbetween the chains in the ab plane. In an applied magnetic field, the broad\ndiffuse scattering features in PND are gradually replaced by much sharper\npeaks, however, the pattern remains rather complex, reflecting the highly\nanisotropic nature of SrDy2O4.

We\ninvestigated these effects for the close O-star binary LSS 3074 (O4 f + O6-7\n:(f):), which is a good candidate for a past Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) episode\nbecause of its very short orbital period, P = 2.185 days, and the luminosity\nclasses of both components.

A strategy profile is said to\nbe envy-proof if each player cannot gain a competitive edge with respect to the\nchange in utility over the other players by deviation. Together with Nash\nequilibrium and another stability notion called immunity, we show how these\nseparate notions are related to each other, whether they exist in games, and\nwhether and when a strategy profile satisfying these notions can be efficiently\nfound. We answer these questions by starting with the general two player game\nand extend the discussion for the approximate stability and for the\ncorresponding fault-tolerance notions in multi-player games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 13:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Critical\ntemperatures for the spin glass and ferromagnetic transitions are evaluated for\nthe layers in the form of random Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graphs or heterogeneous\nscale-free networks using the replica method, from the replica symmetric\nsolution. For the Ising model on multiplex networks with scale-free layers it\nis shown that the critical temperature is finite if the distributions of the\ndegrees of nodes within both layers have a finite second moment, and that\ndepending on the model parameters the transition can be to the ferromagnetic or\nspin glass phase. It is also shown that the correlation between the degrees of\nnodes within different layers significantly influences the critical\ntemperatures for both transitions and thus the phase diagram.

The ellipticity-dependent 3D-PMD measurements revealed an\nunexpected sharp, thin line-shaped ridge structure in the polarization plane\nfor low momentum photoelectrons. With classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)\nsimulations and analytical methods we identified the associated ionization\ndynamics for this sharp ridge to be due to Coulomb focusing of slow\nrecollisions of electrons with a momentum approaching zero. This ridge is\nanother example of the many different ways how the Coulomb field of the parent\nion influences the different parts of the momentum space of the ionized\nelectron wave packet. Building on this new understanding of the PMD, we extend\nour studies on the role played by the magnetic field component of the laser\nbeam when operating beyond the long-wavelength limit of the dipole\napproximation.

Memento TimeMaps\nprovide a format to list mementos (URI-Ms) for captures along with brief\nmetadata, like Memento-Datetime, for each URI-M. However, when some URI-Ms are\ndereferenced, they simply provide a redirect to a different URI-M (instead of a\nunique representation at the datetime), often also present in the TimeMap. This\ninfers that confidently obtaining an accurate count quantifying the number of\nnon-forwarding captures for a URI-R is not possible using a TimeMap alone and\nthat the magnitude of a TimeMap is not equivalent to the number of\nrepresentations it identifies. In this work we discuss this particular\nphenomena in depth. We also perform a breakdown of the dynamics of counting\nmementos for a particular URI-R (google.com) and quantify the prevalence of the\nvarious canonicalization patterns that exacerbate attempts at counting using\nonly a TimeMap. For google.com we found that 84.9% of the URI-Ms result in an\nHTTP redirect when dereferenced. We expand on and apply this metric to TimeMaps\nfor seven other URI-Rs of large Web sites and thirteen academic institutions.\nUsing a ratio metric DI for the number of URI-Ms without redirects to those\nrequiring a redirect when dereferenced, five of the eight large web sites' and\ntwo of the thirteen academic institutions' TimeMaps had a ratio of ratio less\nthan one, indicating that more than half of the URI-Ms in these TimeMaps result\nin redirects when dereferenced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 15:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

By doing this we can prove that:\n  1. The external inertial forces, felt by an accelerating body, are inductive\neffects of the entire Universe while the internal inertial forces depend on the\ninternal structure of the body. When a body moves freely in a gravitational\nfield, its internal structure plays no role and the body feels only the\nexternal inertial forces.

The reverse (N-S) transition is the Meissner\neffect. This implies in particular that the kinetic energy of the supercurrent\nis not dissipated as Joule heat in the process where the superconductor becomes\nnormal and the supercurrent stops. In this paper we analyze the entropy\ngeneration and the momentum transfer between the supercurrent and the body in\nthe S-N transition and the N-S transition as described by the conventional\ntheory of superconductivity. We find that it is impossible to explain the\ntransition in a way that is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics unless\nthe momentum transfer between the supercurrent and the body occurs with zero\nentropy generation, for which the conventional theory of superconductivity\nprovides no mechanism. Instead, we point out that the alternative theory of\nhole superconductivity does not encounter such difficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 07:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 18:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 23:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 01:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}
