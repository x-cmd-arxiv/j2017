But not every curved space-time can be simulated in\nsuch a way, because one does not only need a condensed matter system that\ngenerates the desired metric tensor, but that system then also has to obey its\nown equations of motion. And specifying the metric tensor that one wishes to\nrealize usually overdetermines the underlying condensed matter system, such\nthat its equations of motion are in general not fulfilled, in which case the\ndesired metric does not have an analogue.\n  Here, we show that the class of metrics that have an analogue is bigger than\nwhat a first cursory consideration might suggest. This is due to the analogue\nmetric only being defined up to a choice of parametrization of the perturbation\nin the underlying condensed matter system. In this way, the class of analogue\ngravity models can be vastly expanded. In particular, we demonstrate how this\nfreedom of choice can be used to insert an intermediary conformal factor. Then,\nas a corollary, we find that any metric conformal to a Painlev\\'e--Gullstrand\ntype line element can, potentially, result as an analogue of a perturbation\npropagating in a non-viscous, barotropic fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 16:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 13:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Filaments which experience a weakly turbulent accretion\nflow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation\npattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in\nthe turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the\nfilaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to\nturbulence-dominated fragmentation. The sub-structure formed in the filaments\nis elongated and roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the filament,\nsimilar to the fibres seen in observations of Taurus, and suggests that the\nfray and fragment scenario is a possible mechanism for the production of\nfibres. We show that the formation of these fibre-like structures is linked to\nthe vorticity of the velocity field inside the filament and the filament's\naccretion from an inhomogeneous medium. Moreover, we find that accretion is\nable to drive and sustain roughly sonic levels of turbulence inside the\nfilaments, but is not able to prevent radial collapse once the filaments become\nsupercritical.

We consider an\nisotropic Heisenberg spin-half system with a ferromagnetic in-chain coupling\n$J_1<0$ between nearest neighbors and a frustrating antiferromagnetic\nnext-nearest neighbor in-chain coupling $J_2>0$. We focus on moderate strength\nof frustration $J_2 < |J_1|/4$ such that the in-chain spin-spin correlations\nare predominantly ferromagnetic. We consider two inter-chain couplings (ICs)\n$J_{\\perp,y}$ and $J_{\\perp,z}$, corresponding to the two axis perpendicular to\nthe chain, where ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic ICs are taken into\naccount. We discuss the influence of frustration on the ground-state properties\nfor antiferromagnetic ICs, where the ground state is of quantum nature. The\nmajor part of our study is devoted to the finite-temperature properties. We\ncalculate the critical temperature $T_{c}$ as a function of the competing\nexchange couplings $J_{2},J_{\\perp,y}, J_{\\perp,z}$. We find that for fixed ICs\n$T_c$ monotonically decreases with increasing frustration $J_2$, where as $J_2\n\\to |J_1|/4$ the $T_c(J_2)$-curve drops down rapidly. To characterize the\nmagnetic ordering below and above $T_c$ we calculate the spin-spin correlation\nfunctions $\\langle {\\bf S}_0 {\\bf S}_{\\bf R} \\rangle$, the magnetic order\nparameter $M$, the uniform static susceptibility $\\chi_0$ as well as the\ncorrelation length $\\xi$.

As\n$J_2 \\to |J_1|/4$ some unusual frustration-induced features were found, such as\nan increase of the in-chain spin stiffness (in case of ferromagnetic ICs) or of\nthe in-chain spin-wave velocity (in case of antiferromagnetic ICs) with growing\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 13:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

Aims: This study investigates the effect of\nusing the most recent optimization algorithm called Bees algorithm to specify\nthe optimal choice of MT parameters that fit a dataset and therefore improve\nprediction accuracy. Method: We used MT with optimal parameters identified by\nthe Bees algorithm to construct software effort estimation model.
