Yet gaps remain in\nour theoretical and practical understanding of how to define controversy, how\nit manifests, and how to measure it. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nmeasure we call \"contention\", defined with respect to a topic and a population.\nWe model contention from a mathematical standpoint. We validate our model by\nexamining a diverse set of sources: real-world polling data sets, actual voter\ndata, and Twitter coverage on several topics. In our publicly-released Twitter\ndata set of nearly 100M tweets, we examine several topics such as Brexit, the\n2016 U.S. Elections, and \"The Dress\", and cross-reference them with other\nsources. We demonstrate that the contention measure holds explanatory power for\na wide variety of observed phenomena, such as controversies over climate change\nand other topics that are well within scientific consensus. Finally, we\nre-examine the notion of controversy, and present a theoretical framework that\ndefines it in terms of population. We present preliminary evidence suggesting\nthat contention is one dimension of controversy, along with others, such as\n\"importance\". Our new contention measure, along with the hypothesized model of\ncontroversy, suggest several avenues for future work in this emerging\ninterdisciplinary research area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

The surface\ncharges are quasilocal, explicitly coordinate independent, gauge invariant, and\nbackground independent.

As an alternative, we propose an Image-to-Image\ntranslation network that jointly maps the input image to a depth image and a\nfacial correspondence map. This explicit pixel-based mapping can then be\nutilized to provide high quality reconstructions of diverse faces under extreme\nexpressions, using a purely geometric refinement process. In the spirit of\nrecent approaches, the network is trained only with synthetic data, and is then\nevaluated on in-the-wild facial images. Both qualitative and quantitative\nanalyses demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 10:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

By generalizing a\nstandard framework from the analysis of Markov chains to arbitrary\n(non-stoquastic) Hamiltonians we are naturally led to see that the spectral gap\ncan always be upper bounded by an isoperimetric ratio that depends only on the\nground state probability distribution and the range of the terms in the\nHamiltonian, but not on any other details of the interaction couplings. This\nmeans that for a given probability distribution the inequality constrains the\nspectral gap of any local Hamiltonian with this distribution as its ground\nstate probability distribution in some basis (Eldar and Harrow derived a\nsimilar result in order to characterize the output of low-depth quantum\ncircuits). Going further, we relate the Hilbert space localization properties\nof the ground state to higher energy eigenvalues by showing that the presence\nof k strongly localized ground state modes (i.e. clusters of probability, or\nsubsets with small expansion) in Hilbert space implies the presence of k energy\neigenvalues that are close to the ground state energy. Our results suggest that\nquantum adiabatic optimization using local Hamiltonians will inevitably\nencounter small spectral gaps when attempting to prepare ground states\ncorresponding to multi-modal probability distributions with strongly localized\nmodes, and this problem cannot necessarily be alleviated with the inclusion of\nnon-stoquastic couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 19:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The purpose of this investigation is to characterize the temporal\nevolution of an emerging flux region, the associated photospheric and\nchromospheric flow fields, and the properties of the accompanying arch filament\nsystem. Methods. This study is based on imaging spectroscopy with the\nG\\\"ottingen Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, on 2008\nAugust 7. Cloud model (CM) inversions of line scans in the strong chromospheric\nabsorption H$\\alpha$ line yielded CM parameters, which describe the cool plasma\ncontained in the arch filament system. Results. The observations cover the\ndecay and convergence of two micro-pores with diameters of less than one\narcsecond and provide decay rates for intensity and area. The photospheric\nhorizontal flow speed is suppressed near the two micro-pores indicating that\nthe magnetic field is sufficiently strong to affect the convective energy\ntransport. The micro-pores are accompanied by an arch filament system, where\nsmall-scale loops connect two regions with H$\\alpha$ line-core brightenings\ncontaining an emerging flux region with opposite polarities. The chromospheric\nvelocity of the cloud material is predominantly directed downwards near the\nfootpoints of the loops with velocities of up to 12 km/s, whereas loop tops\nshow upward motions of about 3 km/s. Conclusions. Micro-pores are the smallest\nmagnetic field concentrations leaving a photometric signature in the\nphotosphere. In the observed case, they are accompanied by a miniature arch\nfilament system indicative of newly emerging flux in the form of\n$\\Omega$-loops. Flux emergence and decay take place on a time-scale of about\ntwo days, whereas the photometric decay of the micro-pores is much more rapid\n(a few hours), which is consistent with the incipient submergence of\n$\\Omega$-loops. The results are representative for the smallest emerging flux\nregions still recognizable as such.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 17:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic\nconformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,\nwhen the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in\nreal space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary\ngalaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same\nstellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove\nsatellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in\nGALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is\npartially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a\nsatellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later\ntime in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the\nL-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their\nhost halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary\ngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different\nmasses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In\nthis case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in\nGALFORM models).

Logic locking, a promising solution to mitigate this threat,\nadds extra logic gates (key gates) and inputs (key bits) to the chip so that it\nfunctions correctly only when the correct key, known only to the designer but\nnot the foundry, is applied. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability in\nall existing logic locking schemes. Prior attacks on logic locking have assumed\nthat, in addition to the design of the locked chip, the attacker has access to\na working copy of the chip. Our attack does not require a working copy and yet\nwe successfully recover a significant fraction of key bits from the design of\nthe locked chip only. Empirically, we demonstrate the success of our attack on\neight large benchmark circuits from a benchmark suite that has been tailored\nspecifically for logic synthesis research, for two different logic locking\nschemes. Then, to address this vulnerability, we initiate the study of provably\nsecure logic locking mechanisms. We formalize, for the first time to our\nknowledge, a precise notion of security for logic locking. We establish that\nany locking procedure that is secure under our definition is guaranteed to\ncounter our desynthesis attack, and all other such known attacks. We then\ndevise a new logic locking procedure, Meerkat, that guarantees that the locked\nchip reveals no information about the key or the designer's intended\nfunctionality. A main insight behind Meerkat is that canonical representations\nof boolean functionality via Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs)\ncan be leveraged effectively to provide security. We analyze Meerkat with\nregards to its security properties and the overhead it incurs. As such, our\nwork is a contribution to both the foundations and practice of securing digital\nICs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

Both\ngalaxies have compact dusty star-forming cores with effective radii of Re=1.3\nkpc and Re=1.2 kpc in the 870 um continuum emission. The spatial extent of\nstar-forming molecular gas is also compact with Re=1.9 kpc and Re=2.3 kpc, but\nmore extended than the dust emission. Interpreting the observed\nposition-velocity diagrams with dynamical models, we find the starburst cores\nto be rotation-dominated with the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the\nlocal velocity dispersion of v/sigma=7.0 (v=386 km/s) and v/sigma_0=4.1 (v=391\nkm/s). Given that the descendants of these massive galaxies in the local\nuniverse are likely ellipticals with v/sigma nearly an order of magnitude\nlower, the rapidly rotating galaxies would lose significant net angular\nmomentum in the intervening time. The comparisons among dynamical, stellar,\ngas, and dust mass suggest that the starburst CO-to-H2 conversion factor of\nalpha_CO=0.8 Msun/(K km/s/pc2) is appropriate in the spatially resolved cores.\nThe dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments similar to the\ncentral regions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

In the primary control\nlayer, each generation unit is equipped with a local controller acting on the\ncorresponding voltage-source converter. Following the plug-and-play design\napproach previously proposed by some of the authors, whenever the\naddition/removal of a distributed generation unit is required, feasibility of\nthe operation is automatically checked by designing local controllers through\nconvex optimization. The update of the voltage-control layer, when units plug\n-in/-out, is therefore automatized and stability of the microgrid is always\npreserved. Moreover, local control design is based only on the knowledge of\nparameters of power lines and it does not require to store a global microgrid\nmodel. In this work, we focus on bus-connected microgrid topologies and enhance\nthe primary plug-and-play layer with local virtual impedance loops and\nsecondary coordinated controllers ensuring bus voltage tracking and reactive\npower sharing. In particular, the secondary control architecture is\ndistributed, hence mirroring the modularity of the primary control layer. We\nvalidate primary and secondary controllers by performing experiments with\nbalanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads, on a setup composed of three\nbus-connected distributed generation units. Most importantly, the stability of\nthe microgrid after the addition/removal of distributed generation units is\nassessed. Overall, the experimental results show the feasibility of the\nproposed modular control design framework, where generation units can be\nadded/removed on the fly, thus enabling the deployment of virtual power plants\nthat can be resized over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 20:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

In 2015 Liu et\nal. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an\norbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 micro-arcsec).

Starting from\na random initial node, a random walker hops randomly along directed edges\nbetween adjacent nodes in the network. The path terminates either by the\nretracing scenario, when the walker enters a node which it has already visited\nbefore, or by the trapping scenario, when it becomes trapped in a dead-end node\nfrom which it cannot exit. The path length, namely the number of steps, $d$,\npursued by the random walker from the initial node up to its termination, is\ncalled the first hitting time. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical\nresults for the tail distribution of first hitting times, $P(d>\\ell)$. The\ndistribution $P(d>\\ell)$ can be expressed as a product of an exponential\ndistribution and a Rayleigh distribution. We obtain expressions for the mean,\nmedian and standard deviation of this distribution in terms of the network size\nand its mean degree. We also calculate the distribution of last hitting times,\nnamely the path lengths of self-avoiding walks on directed ER networks, which\ndo not retrace their paths. The last hitting times are found to be much longer\nthan the first hitting times. The results are compared to those obtained for\nundirected ER networks. It is found that the first hitting times of RWs in a\ndirected ER network are much longer than in the corresponding undirected\nnetwork. This is due to the fact that RWs on directed networks do not exhibit\nthe backtracking scenario, which is a dominant termination mechanism of RWs on\nundirected networks. It is shown that our approach also applies to a broader\nclass of networks, referred to as semi-ER networks, in which the distribution\nof in-degrees is Poisson, while the out-degrees may follow any desired\ndistribution with the same mean as the in-degree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 23:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

This belief is based on studies of so-called\nloop quantum cosmology which concerns symmetry-reduced models of quantum\ngravity. In this paper, the problem of singularities is analysed in the context\nof the Bohmian formulation of loop quantum cosmology. In this formulation there\nis an actual metric in addition to the wave function, which evolves\nstochastically (rather than deterministically as the case of the particle\nevolution in non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics).

We show that\nthis is necessary even in undirected unweighted graphs, and even if you allow\nfor a small additive error: If you aim at size $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ for\n$\\epsilon>0$, then the additive error has to be $\\Omega(\\eps f)$. This\nsurprisingly matches known upper bounds in the literature.\n  (3) For weighted graphs, we provide matching upper and lower bounds for the\nsingle pair case. Namely, the size of the preserver is $\\Theta(n^2)$ for $f\\geq\n2$ in both directed and undirected graphs, while for $f=1$ the size is\n$\\Theta(n)$ in undirected graphs. For directed graphs, we have a superlinear\nupper bound and a matching lower bound.\n  Most of our lower bounds extend to the distance oracle setting, where rather\nthan a subgraph we ask for any compact data structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 02:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

Recent studies\nconfirmed the room-temperature stabilization of skyrmions in ultrathin\nferromagnets. However, such ferromagnetic skyrmions show undesirable\ntopological effect, the skyrmion Hall effect, which leads to their\ncurrent-driven motion towards device edges, where skyrmions could easily be\nannihilated by topographic defects. Recent theoretical studies have predicted\nenhanced current-driven behaviour for antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled\nskyrmions. Here we present the stabilization of these skyrmions and their\ncurrent-driven dynamics in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo films. By utilizing\nelement-specific X-ray imaging, we find that the skyrmions in the Gd and FeCo\nsublayers are antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled.

We first determine the associated\nbase flow by solving the long-timescale stretching flow of a flat sheet as a\nfunction of two dimensionless parameters: the normalized stretching velocity\n$\\alpha$, and a dimensionless width of the heating zone $\\beta$. This allows us\nto determine the conditions for the onset of an out-of-plane wrinkling\ninstability stated in terms of an eigenvalue problem for a linear partial\ndifferential equation governing the displacement of the midsurface of the\nsheet. We show the sheet can become unstable in two regions that are upstream\nand downstream of the heating zone where the minimum in-plane stress is\nnegative. This yields the shape and growth rates of the most unstable buckling\nmode in both regions for various values of the stretching velocity and heating\nzone width. A transition from stationary to oscillatory unstable modes is found\nin the upstream region with increasing $\\beta$ while the downstream region is\nalways stationary.

The lower\nbound derived there for general states is expressed as the difference between\ntwo unconditional entropies and its evaluation reduces to an eigenvalue problem\nof two states, which are the entire state and the marginal state of side\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 06:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 04:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 17:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 14:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Side-channel\nattack (SCA) is one of the prominent methods to break the security of an\nencryption system by exploiting the information leaked from the physical\ndevices. Correlational power attack (CPA) is an efficient power side-channel\nattack technique, which analyses the correlation between the estimated and\nmeasured supply current traces to extract the secret key. The existing\ncountermeasures to the power attacks are mainly based on reducing the SNR of\nthe leaked data, or introducing large overhead using techniques like power\nbalancing. This paper presents an attenuated signature AES (AS-AES), which\nresists SCA with minimal noise current overhead. AS-AES uses a shunt\nlow-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by 400x in\nthe supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in\n130 nm CMOS technology.

The resulting algorithm\nconfiguration (AC) problem has attracted much attention from the machine\nlearning community. However, the proper evaluation of new AC procedures is\nhindered by two key hurdles. First, AC benchmarks are hard to set up. Second\nand even more significantly, they are computationally expensive: a single run\nof an AC procedure involves many costly runs of the target algorithm whose\nperformance is to be optimized in a given AC benchmark scenario. One common\nworkaround is to optimize cheap-to-evaluate artificial benchmark functions\n(e.g., Branin) instead of actual algorithms; however, these have different\nproperties than realistic AC problems. Here, we propose an alternative\nbenchmarking approach that is similarly cheap to evaluate but much closer to\nthe original AC problem: replacing expensive benchmarks by surrogate benchmarks\nconstructed from AC benchmarks.

Recent studies\nshow that as much as 20\\% of the references are from online news sources.\nHowever, many entity pages are incomplete even if relevant information is\nalready available in existing news articles. Even for the already present\nreferences, there is often a delay between the news article publication time\nand the reference time. In this work, we therefore look at Wikipedia through\nthe lens of news and propose a novel news-article suggestion task to improve\nnews coverage in Wikipedia, and reduce the lag of newsworthy references. Our\nwork finds direct application, as a precursor, to Wikipedia page generation and\nknowledge-base acceleration tasks that rely on relevant and high quality input\nsources.\n  We propose a two-stage supervised approach for suggesting news articles to\nentity pages for a given state of Wikipedia. First, we suggest news articles to\nWikipedia entities (article-entity placement) relying on a rich set of features\nwhich take into account the \\emph{salience} and \\emph{relative authority} of\nentities, and the \\emph{novelty} of news articles to entity pages. Second, we\ndetermine the exact section in the entity page for the input article\n(article-section placement) guided by class-based section templates. We perform\nan extensive evaluation of our approach based on ground-truth data that is\nextracted from external references in Wikipedia. We achieve a high precision\nvalue of up to 93\\% in the \\emph{article-entity} suggestion stage and upto 84\\%\nfor the \\emph{article-section placement}. Finally, we compare our approach\nagainst competitive baselines and show significant improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 07:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

Here we report the first\nexperimental study on an impact of surface nano-structuring on LLT by using a\nsurface treatment called rubbing, which is the key technology for the\nproduction of liquid crystal displays. We find that such a rubbing treatment\nhas a significant impact on the kinetics of liquid-liquid transition (LLT) of\nan isotropic molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite.

Thus, surface rubbing of\nsubstrates not only changes the ordering behavior, but also accelerates the\nkinetics significantly. This spatio-temporal pattern modulation of LLT can be\nexplained by a wedge filling transition and the resulting drastic reduction of\nthe nucleation barrier. However, this effect completely disappears in the\nunstable (spinodal) regime, indicating the absence of the activation barrier\neven for bulk LLT. This confirms the presence of nucleation-growth-type and\nspinodal-decomposition-type LLT, supporting that LLT is truly a first-order\ntransition with criticality. Our finding also opens up a new way to control the\nkinetics of LLT of a liquid confined in a solid cell by structuring its surface\non a mesoscopic lengthscale, which may contribute to making LLT useful for\nmicro-fluidics and other industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 08:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

To facilitate this evaluation, transdimensional Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) relies on sampling a discrete indexing variable to estimate the\nposterior model probabilities. However, little attention has been paid to the\nprecision of these estimates. If only few switches occur between the models in\nthe transdimensional MCMC output, precision may be low and assessment based on\nthe assumption of independent samples misleading. Here, we propose a new method\nto estimate the precision based on the observed transition matrix of the\nmodel-indexing variable. Assuming a first order Markov model, the method\nsamples from the posterior of the stationary distribution. This allows\nassessment of the uncertainty in the estimated posterior model probabilities,\nmodel ranks, and Bayes factors. Moreover, the method provides an estimate for\nthe effective sample size of the MCMC output. In two model-selection examples,\nwe show that the proposed approach provides a good assessment of the\nuncertainty associated with the estimated posterior model probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 08:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 10:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

For\n$4$-cycles our new bound coincides with Alon et al., while for every $k>2$ our\nbound yields a polynomial improvement in $m$.\n  Yuster and Zwick noted that it is \"plausible to conjecture that $O(n^2)$ is\nthe best possible bound in terms of $n$\". We show \"conditional optimality\": if\nthis hypothesis holds then our $O(m^{2k/(k+1)})$ algorithm is tight as well.\nFurthermore, a folklore reduction implies that no combinatorial algorithm can\ndetermine if a graph contains a $6$-cycle in time $O(m^{3/2-\\epsilon})$ for any\n$\\epsilon>0$ under the widely believed combinatorial BMM conjecture. Coupled\nwith our main result, this gives tight bounds for finding $6$-cycles\ncombinatorially and also separates the complexity of finding $4$- and\n$6$-cycles giving evidence that the exponent of $m$ in the running time should\nindeed increase with $k$.\n  The key ingredient in our algorithm is a new notion of capped $k$-walks,\nwhich are walks of length $k$ that visit only nodes according to a fixed\nordering. Our main technical contribution is an involved analysis proving\nseveral properties of such walks which may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 09:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

We describe the\ninhomogeneities of this field in terms of creation and annihilation variables,\nchosen to admit a unitary evolution if the Dirac fermion were treated as a test\nfield.

The potential of the\nboundary element method (BEM) in dealing with mixed no-slip/perfect-slip\nboundary conditions is exploited to systematically calculate the mobility\ntensor for different particle-to-wall relative positions and for different\nparticle radii. The particle hydrodynamics is characterized by a non trivial\nmobility field which presents a distinct near wall behavior where the wall\npatterning directly affects the particle motion.

To understand the interstellar cycle, which triggers\ngalaxy evolution, it is necessary to describe simultaneously the large-scale\nevolution widely induced by the feedback processes and the details of the gas\ndynamics that controls the star formation process through gravitational\ncollapse. We perform a set of three-dimensional high-resolution numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent, self-gravitating and magnetized interstellar medium\nwithin a $1\\ \\mathrm{kpc}$ stratified box with supernova feedback correlated\nwith star-forming regions. In particular, we focus on the role played by the\nmagnetic field and the feedback on the galactic vertical structure, the star\nformation rate (SFR) and the flow dynamics.

Two main\nfeatures differentiate the behavior of inertial particles in a zero-\npressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer from the more commonly studied case\nof a parallel channel flow. The first is the variation along the streamwise\ndirection of the local dimensionless parameters defining the fluid-particle in-\nteractions. The second is the coexistence of an irrotational free-stream and a\nnear-wall rotational turbulent flow. As concerns the first issue, an inner and\nan outer Stokes number can be defined using inner and outer flow units. The\ninner Stokes number governs the near-wall behavior similarly to the case of\nchannel flow. To understand the effect of a laminar-turbulent interface, we ex-\namine the behavior of particles initially released in the free stream and show\nthat they present a distinct behavior with respect to those directly injected\ninside the boundary layer. A region of minimum concentration occurs inside the\nturbulent boundary layer at about one displacement thickness from the wall. Its\nformation is due to the competition between two transport mecha- nisms: a\nrelatively slow turbulent diffusion towards the buffer layer and a fast\nturbophoretic drift towards the wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 12:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

The MHM methods allow solving highly heterogeneous\nproblems on coarse meshes while providing solutions with high-order precision.\nIt embeds independent local problems which are responsible for upscaling\nunresolved scales into the numerical solution. These local contributions are\nbrought together through a global problem defined on the skeleton of the coarse\npartition. Since the local problems are completely independent, they can be\neasily computed in parallel. In this paper, we present two simulator prototypes\nspecifically crafted for the MHM methods, which adopt two different\nimplementation strategies: (i) a multi-programming language approach, each\nlanguage tackling different simulation issues; and (ii) a classical,\nsingle-programming language approach. Specifically, we use C++ for numerical\ncomputation of the global and local problems in a modular way; for process\ndistribution in the simulator, we adopt the Erlang concurrent language in the\nfirst approach, and the MPI standard in the second approach. The aim of\nexploring these different approaches is twofold: (i) allow for the deployment\nof the simulator both in high-performance computing (with MPI) and in cloud\ncomputing environments (with Erlang); and (ii) pave the way for further\nexploration of quality attributes related to software productivity and\nfault-tolerance, which are key to Exascale systems.

Such\nHVSs are believed to be ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal\ndisruption of a binary by the super-massive black hole (Hills mechanism). The\nHyper-MUCHFUSS survey aims at finding high-velocity potentially unbound hot\nsubdwarf stars. We present the spectroscopic and kinematical analyses of a\nHe-sdO as well as three candidates among the sdB stars using optical Keck/ESI\nand VLT (Xshooter, FORS) spectroscopy. Proper motions are determined by\ncombining positions from early-epoch photographic plates with those derived\nfrom modern digital sky surveys. The Galactic rest frame velocities range from\n203 km\\,s$^{-1}$ to 660 km\\,s$^{-1}$, indicating that most likely all four\nstars are gravitationally bound to the Galaxy.

As for the latter, the\nGC is excluded as a place of origin based on the kinematic analysis. Hence, the\nHills mechanism can be excluded for J2050. The ejection velocity is much more\nmoderate ($385\\pm79$ km\\,s$^{-1}$) than that of US 708 ($998\\pm68$\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$). The binary thermonuclear supernova scenario suggested for US 708\nwould explain the observed properties of J2050 very well without pushing the\nmodel parameters to their extreme limits, as required for US 708. Accordingly,\nthe star would be the surviving donor of a type Ia supernova. Three sdB stars\nalso showed extreme kinematics; one could be a HVS ejected from the GC, whereas\nthe other two could be ejected from the Galactic disk through the binary\nsupernova mechanism. Alternatively, they might be extreme halo stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 13:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

When they are uniformly distributed on a symmetric\ninterval, this may be seen as a random discretization of the Finite Fourier\ntransform, whose spectrum has been extensively studied in relation with\nband-limited functions.

Firstly, by pushing forward\nconcentration inequalities, we find an accurate comparison in $\\ell^2$- norm\nbetween the spectrum of $A^*A$ and the one of an integral operator that can be\ndefined in terms of the two probability laws chosen for the rows and the\ncolumns.

During treatment, a very high dose of radiation is\ndelivered to a very narrow area. Prescribed radiation therapy for brain cancer\nrequires precisely defining the target treatment area, as well as delineating\nvital brain structures which must be spared from radiotoxicity. Nevertheless,\ndelineation task is usually still manually performed, which is inefficient and\noperator-dependent. Several attempts of automatizing this process have\nreported. however, marginal results when analyzing organs in the optic region.\nIn this work we present a deep learning classification scheme based on\naugmented-enhanced features to automatically segment organs at risk (OARs) in\nthe optic region -optic nerves, optic chiasm, pituitary gland and pituitary\nstalk-. Fifteen MR images with various types of brain tumors were\nretrospectively collected to undergo manual and automatic segmentation. Mean\nDice Similarity coefficients around 0.80 were reported. Incorporation of\nproposed features yielded to improvements on the segmentation. Compared with\nsupport vector machines, our method achieved better performance with less\nvariation on the results, as well as a considerably reduction on the\nclassification time. Performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated\nwith respect to manual contours. In this case, results obtained from the\nautomatic contours mostly lie on the variability of the observers, showing no\nsignificant differences with respect to them. These results suggest therefore\nthat the proposed system is more accurate than other presented approaches, up\nto date, to segment these structures.

From different\nexpressions of the NE density matrix, we can identify the terms related to the\nentropy production in the system. We show, for a simple model, that the entropy\nproduction rate is always a positive quantity. Alternative expressions for the\nentropy production are also obtained from the Gibbs-von Neumann conventional\nformula and discussed in detail.

These ONFs offer tight optical mode confinement (less than\nthe wavelength of light) and diffraction-free propagation. The small cross\nsection of the transverse field allows probing of linear and non-linear\nspectroscopic features of atoms with exquisitely low power. The cooperativity\n-- the figure of merit in many quantum optics and quantum information systems\n-- tends to be large even for a single atom in the mode of an ONF, as it is\nproportional to the ratio of the atomic cross section to the electromagnetic\nmode cross section. ONFs offer a natural bus for information and for\ninter-atomic coupling through the tightly-confined modes, which opens the\npossibility of one-dimensional many-body physics and interesting quantum\ninterconnection applications. The presence of the ONF modifies the vacuum\nfield, affecting the spontaneous emission rates of atoms in its vicinity. The\nhigh gradients in the radial intensity naturally provide the potential for\ntrapping atoms around the ONF, allowing the creation of one-dimensional arrays\nof atoms. The same radial gradient in the transverse direction of the field is\nresponsible for the existence of a large longitudinal component that introduces\nthe possibility of spin-orbit coupling of the light and the atom, enabling the\nexploration of chiral quantum optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

V5116 Sgr was observed as a bright and variable\nsupersoft X-ray source by XMM-Newton 610~days after outburst. The light curve\nshowed a periodicity consistent with the orbital period. During one third of\nthe orbit the luminosity was a factor of seven brighter than during the other\ntwo thirds of the orbital period. In the present work we aim to disentangle the\nX-ray spectral components of V5116 Sgr and their variability. We present the\nhigh resolution spectra obtained with XMM-Newton RGS and Chandra LETGS/HRC-S in\nMarch and August 2007. The grating spectrum during the periods of high-flux\nshows a typical hot white dwarf atmosphere dominated by absorption lines of N\nVI and N VII. During the low-flux periods, the spectrum is dominated by an\natmosphere with the same temperature as during the high-flux period, but with\nseveral emission features superimposed. Some of the emission lines are well\nmodeled with an optically thin plasma in collisional equilibrium, rich in C and\nN, which also explains some excess in the spectra of the high-flux period. No\nvelocity shifts are observed in the absorption lines, with an upper limit set\nby the spectral resolution of 500 km/s, consistent with the expectation of a\nnon-expanding atmosphere so late in the evolution of the post-nova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 13:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

It is characterized by three speeds of the\nlong waves, two for the separate chains, and one for the intact strip where the\nchains are connected. Accordingly, there exist three ranges, the subsonic for\nboth chains, the intersonic and the supersonic. The speed in the latter range\nis supersonic for the intact strip and at the same time, it is subsonic for the\nseparate higher-speed chain. This fact allows the splitting wave to propagate\nin the strip supersonically. We derive steady-state analytical solutions and\nfind that the splitting can propagate steadily only in two of these speed\nranges, the subsonic and the supersonic, whereas the intersonic regime is\nforbidden. In the case of considerable difference in the chain stiffness, the\nlowest dynamic threshold corresponds to the supersonic regime. The peculiarity\nof the supersonic mode is that the supersonic energy delivery channel, being\ninitially absent, is opening with the moving splitting point. Based on the\ndiscrete and related continuous models we find which regime can be implemented\ndepending on the structure parameters and loading conditions.

We report the initial\nsteps toward development of a real estate portal in Switzerland. Based on\ncontinuous web crawling of publicly available real estate advertisements and\nusing building data from Open Street Map, we developed a system, where we\nroughly estimate the rental and sale price indexes of 1.7 million buildings\nacross the country. In addition to these rough estimates, we developed a web\nbased API for accurate automated valuation of rental prices of individual\nproperties and spatial sensitivity analysis of rental market. We tested several\nestablished function approximation methods against the test data to check the\nquality of the rental price estimations and based on our experiments, Random\nForest gives very reasonable results with the median absolute relative error of\n6.57 percent, which is comparable with the state of the art in the industry. We\nargue that while recently there have been successful cases of real estate\nportals, which are based on Big Data, majority of the existing solutions are\nexpensive, limited to certain users and mostly with non-transparent underlying\nsystems. As an alternative we discuss, how using the crawled data sets and\nother open data sets provided from different institutes it is easily possible\nto develop data driven services for spatial and temporal sensitivity analysis\nin the real estate market to be used for different stakeholders. We believe\nthat this kind of digital literacy can disrupt many other existing business\nconcepts across many domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 09:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

This trend impacts\nnot only the design of computer architectures, but also the design of programs.\nHowever, developers still lack affordable and accurate technology to measure\nenergy consumption in computing systems. The goal of this paper is to mitigate\nsuch problem. To this end, we introduce JetsonLEAP, a framework that supports\nthe implementation of energy-aware programs. JetsonLEAP consists of an embedded\nhardware, in our case, the Nvidia Tegra TK1 System-on-a-chip device, a circuit\nto control the flow of energy, of our own design, plus a library to instrument\nprogram parts. We discuss two different circuit setups. The most precise setup\nlets us reliably measure the energy spent by 225,000 instructions, the least\nprecise, although more affordable setup, gives us a window of 975,000\ninstructions. To probe the precision of our system, we use it in tandem with a\nhigh-precision, high-cost acquisition system, and show that results do not\ndiffer in any significant way from those that we get using our simpler\napparatus. Our entire infrastructure - board, power meter and both circuits -\ncan be reproduced with about $500.00. To demonstrate the efficacy of our\nframework, we have used it to measure the energy consumed by programs running\non ARM cores, on the GPU, and on a remote server. Furthermore, we have studied\nthe impact of OpenACC directives on the energy efficiency of high-performance\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}
