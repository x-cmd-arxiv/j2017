The large-area\ngrowth of MoS$_2$ has been demonstrated using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\nin a wide range of deposition temperatures from 600 {\\deg}C to 1000 {\\deg}C.\nHowever, a direct comparison of growth parameters and resulting material\nproperties has not been made so far. Here, we present a systematic experimental\nand theoretical investigation of optical properties of monolayer MoS$_2$ grown\nat different temperatures. Micro-Raman and photoluminescence (PL) studies\nreveal observable inhomogeneities in optical properties of the as-grown single\ncrystalline grains of MoS$_2$. Close examination of the Raman and PL features\nclearly indicate that growth-induced strain is the main source of distinct\noptical properties. We carry out density functional theory calculations to\ndescribe the interaction of growing MoS$_2$ layers with the growth substrate as\nthe origin of strain. Our work explains the variation of band gap energies of\nCVD-grown monolayer MoS$_2$, extracted using PL spectroscopy, as a function of\ndeposition temperature. The methodology has general applicability to model and\npredict the influence of growth conditions on strain in 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Furthermore, to\nbound information leakage from the aggregates, they can perturb the input of\nthe aggregation or its output to ensure that these are differentially private.\n  In this paper, we set to evaluate the impact of releasing aggregate location\ntime-series on the privacy of individuals contributing to the aggregation. We\nintroduce a framework allowing us to reason about privacy against an adversary\nattempting to predict users' locations or recover their mobility patterns. We\nformalize these attacks as inference problems, and discuss a few strategies to\nmodel the adversary's prior knowledge based on the information she may have\naccess to. We then use the framework to quantify the privacy loss stemming from\naggregate location data, with and without the protection of differential\nprivacy, using two real-world mobility datasets. We find that aggregates do\nleak information about individuals' punctual locations and mobility profiles.\nThe density of the observations, as well as timing, play important roles, e.g.,\nregular patterns during peak hours are better protected than sporadic\nmovements. Finally, our evaluation shows that both output and input\nperturbation offer little additional protection, unless they introduce large\namounts of noise ultimately destroying the utility of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 14:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 10:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

For those aiming at inferring\ncertain quantities of interest (QoI), it is desirable to explore the dependency\nbetween sensor measurements and QoI. One of the most popular metric for the\ndependency is mutual information which naturally measures how much information\nabout one variable can be obtained given the other. However, computing mutual\ninformation is always challenging, and the result is unreliable in high\ndimension. In this paper, we propose an approach to find an approximate lower\nbound of mutual information and compute it in a lower dimension. Then, sensors\nare placed where highest mutual information (lower bound) is achieved and QoI\nis inferred via Bayes rule given sensor measurements. In addition, Bayesian\noptimization is introduced to provide a continuous mutual information surface\nover the domain and thus reduce the number of evaluations. A chemical release\naccident is simulated where multiple sensors are placed to locate the source of\nthe release. The result shows that the proposed approach is both effective and\nefficient in inferring QoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 16:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Specifically, we take an\ninitial model learnt from a small set of users and retrain it locally using\ndata from a single user. We evaluate on two tasks: one supervised learning\ntask, using a neural network to recognise users' current activity from\naccelerometer traces; and one unsupervised learning task, identifying topics in\na large set of documents. In both cases the accuracy is improved. We also\nanalyse the robustness of our approach against adversarial attacks, as well as\nits feasibility by presenting a performance evaluation on a representative\nresource-constrained device (a Raspberry Pi).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 16:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Major criticisms of neutral theory have\nfocused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological\nequivalence. However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences\nbetween conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many\ncommunities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at\nsimilar stages. These within-species asymmetries have not been fully explored\nin species-neutral models, and it is not known whether demographic stage\nstructure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory. Here we present a\ntwo-stage neutral model where fecundity and mortality change as an individual\ntransitions from one stage to the other. We explore several qualitatively\ndifferent scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance\ndistributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that\nabundance distributions are generally robust to this kind of stage structure,\nbut significant departures from unstructured predictions occur if adults have\nsufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the\ncumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law\nwith a 3/2 exponent, is invariant even when the abundance distribution departs\nfrom unstructured model predictions. Our findings potentially explain power\nlaw-like abundance distributions in organisms with strong demographic\nstructure, such as eusocial insects and humans, and partially rehabilitate\nspecies abundance distributions from past criticisms as to their inability to\ndistinguish between biological mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 17:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 18:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

We find that a $5\\sigma$ sensitivity to\na branching fraction $BR_{\\gamma\\bar{\\gamma}}\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}$ can be\nachieved by combining the two channels with an integrated luminosity of 10\nab$^{-1}$ at a c.m. energy of 240 GeV. This is considerably better than the\ncorresponding sensitivity in alternative channels previously studied at lepton\ncolliders. The analysis is model independent, and its results can be\nstraightforwardly applied to the search of any Higgs two-body decay into a\nphoton plus an undetected light particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 17:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

A Hamiltonian formulation of stochastic inflation\nis presented, where it is shown that the coarse-graining procedure - where\nwavelengths smaller than the Hubble radius are integrated out - preserves the\ncanonical structure of free fields. This means that different sets of canonical\nvariables give rise to the same probability distribution which clarifies the\nliterature with respect to this issue.

Finally, we experimentally tested our optimized spin\ntrajectories with in vivo scans of the human brain.\n  Results: After a nonrecurring inversion segment on the southern hemisphere of\nthe Bloch sphere, all optimized spin trajectories pursue repetitive loops on\nthe northern half of the sphere in which the beginning of the first and the end\nof the last loop deviate from the others.

In this regime, vapor cell memories offer an\nexcellent compromise between storage efficiency, storage time, noise level, and\nexperimental complexity, and atomic collisions have negligible influence on the\noptical coherences. Operation of the memory is demonstrated using attenuated\nlaser pulses on the single photon level. For 50 ns storage time we measure\n$\\eta_{\\textrm{e2e}}^{\\textrm{50ns}} = 3.4(3)\\%$ \\emph{end-to-end efficiency}\nof the fiber-coupled memory, with an \\emph{total intrinsic efficiency}\n$\\eta_{\\textrm{int}} = 17(3)\\%$.

A similar bound holds for $m \\ge 2$, and together\nrecover the results of [12] that show distributional convergence of $W_n$ to\nthe standard Dickman distribution in the asymptotic regime $m=o(n)$.

In particular,\ninterruptions introduce velocity discontinuities, and frequent interruptions\ncan slow down the resulting animation. To solve these problems, we model the\nproblem of animation as a signal processing problem. In our technique,\nanimations are produced by transformations of signals, or functions over time.\nIn particular, an animation is produced by transforming an input signal, a\nfunction from time to target attribute value, into an output signal, a function\nfrom time to displayed attribute value. We show that well-known\nsignal-processing techniques can be applied to produce animations that are free\nfrom velocity discontinuities even when interrupted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 21:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

While the 'traditional' classes of peculiar\nSNe Ia - luminous '91T-like' and faint '91bg-like' objects - have been known\nsince the early 1990s, other classes of even more unusual transients have only\nbeen established 20 years later, fostered by the advent of new wide-field SN\nsurveys such as the Palomar Transient Factory.

We\nanalyse asymptotically the relaxation oscillations of the model by exploiting a\nseparation of timescales. Furthermore, motivated by experimental evidence that\ncells release calcium when mechanically stimulated and that, in turn, calcium\nrelease affects the mechanical behaviour of cells, we propose an extension of\nthe Atri model to a 3D nonlinear ODE mechanochemical model, where the\nadditional equation, derived consistently from a full viscoelastic\n\\emph{ansatz}, models the evolution of cell/tissue dilatation. Furthermore, in\nthe calcium dynamics equation we introduce a new \"stretch-activation\" source\nterm that induces calcium release and which involves a new bifurcation\nparameter, the \"strength\" of the source. Varying the two bifurcation\nparameters, we analyse in detail the interplay of the mechanical and the\nchemical effects, and we find that as the strength of the mechanical stimulus\nis increased, the $IP_3$ parameter range for which oscillations emerge\ndecreases, until oscillations eventually vanish at a critical value.

This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large\nscale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple\npublic datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality\nopen-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular\nfeaturization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open\nsource library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable\nrepresentations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly\noffer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable\nrepresentations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity\nand highly imbalanced classification.

Early detection of\nmelanoma in dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate.\nHowever, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to\nthe following reasons, e.g. low contrast between lesions and skin, visual\nsimilarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable\nautomatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and\nefficiency of pathologists. International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is\na challenge focusing on the automatic analysis of skin lesion. In this paper,\nwe proposed two deep learning methods to address all the three tasks announced\nin ISIC 2017, i.e. lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature\nextraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning\nframework consisting of two fully-convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is\nproposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse\nclassification result.

In this study, we show that the presence of strain gradient\nin non-piezoelectric graphene sheet does not only affect the ionic positions,\nbut also the asymmetric redistribution of the electron density, which induce\nstrong polarization in the graphene sheet. Using quantum mechanics\ncalculations, the resulting axial and normal piezoelectric coefficients of the\ngraphene sheet were determined using two loading conditions: (i) a graphene\nsheet containing non-centrosymmetric pores subjected to an axial load, and (ii)\na pristine graphene sheet subjected to a bending moment. Particular emphases\nwere placed on the role of edge and corner states of pores arising due to the\nfunctionalization. We also investigated the electronic structure of graphene\nsheet under different in-plane strain distributions using quantum mechanics\ncalculations and tight-binding approach. The findings of our work reveal that\nthe respective axial and normal electromechanical couplings in graphene can be\nengineered by changing the size of non-centrosymmetric pores and radii of\ncurvature.

The SLM extends the linear model to high order functional\nspace and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to\nefficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still\nremains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the\nconventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to\nattack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the\nmoment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient\ndescent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no\nlonger the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we\ndesign a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension\nrank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed\nmethod converges globally and linearly, achieves $\\epsilon$ recovery error\nafter retrieving $O[k^{2}d\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\\epsilon)]$ samples.\nFurthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned\non every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a\nso-called $\\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\\tau^{2})$\nsamples where $p$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness\nand kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition\ndiagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability\nof the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the\nsampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 03:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 22:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

In this study, we focus on\nthe evolution of the morphological and viscoelastic properties of molecular\ncloud refractory organic matter. We found that the organic residue,\nexperimentally synthesized at about 10 K from UV-irradiated H2O-CH3OH-NH3 ice,\nchanged significantly in terms of its nanometer- to micrometer-scale morphology\nand viscoelastic properties after UV irradiation at room temperature. The dose\nof this irradiation was equivalent to that experienced after short residence in\ndiffuse clouds (equal or less than 10,000 years) or irradiation in outer\nprotoplanetary disks. The irradiated organic residues became highly porous and\nmore rigid and formed amorphous nanospherules. These nanospherules are\nmorphologically similar to organic nanoglobules observed in the least-altered\nchondrites, chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles, and cometary\nsamples, suggesting that irradiation of refractory organics could be a possible\nformation pathway for such nanoglobules. The storage modulus (elasticity) of\nphoto-irradiated organic residues is about 100 MPa irrespective of vibrational\nfrequency, a value that is lower than the storage moduli of minerals and ice.\nDust grains coated with such irradiated organics would therefore stick together\nefficiently, but growth to larger grains might be suppressed due to an increase\nin aggregate brittleness caused by the strong connections between grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 04:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

If such failure mechanisms are not\nanticipated and corrected, they can not only degrade system reliability and\navailability but also, perhaps even more importantly, open up security\nvulnerabilities: a malicious attacker can exploit the exposed failure mechanism\nto take over the entire system. As such, new failure mechanisms in memory can\nbecome practical and significant threats to system security.\n  In this work, we discuss the RowHammer problem in DRAM, which is a prime (and\nperhaps the first) example of how a circuit-level failure mechanism in DRAM can\ncause a practical and widespread system security vulnerability. RowHammer, as\nit is popularly referred to, is the phenomenon that repeatedly accessing a row\nin a modern DRAM chip causes bit flips in physically-adjacent rows at\nconsistently predictable bit locations.

In the first method we use an input model for the\nexpected 21-cm power spectrum to directly simulate different random\nrealizations of the brightness temperature fluctuations and calculate the\nvisibilities. This method, which models the HI signal entirely as a diffuse\nradiation, is completely oblivious to the discrete nature of the astrophysical\nsources which host the HI. While each discrete source subtends an angle that is\nmuch smaller than the angular resolution of OWFA, the velocity structure of the\nHI inside the individual sources is well within reach of OWFA's frequency\nresolution and this is expected to have an impact on the observed HI signal.\nThe second prescription is based on cosmological N-body simulations. Here we\nidentify each simulation particle with a source that hosts the HI, and we have\nthe freedom to implement any desired line profile for the HI emission from the\nindividual sources. Implementing a simple model for the line profile, we have\ngenerated several random realizations of the complex visibilities.

The available bandwidths of modern wireless networks\nare often unstable, leading to difficulties in delivering smooth, high-quality\nvideo. Streaming service providers such as Netflix and YouTube attempt to adapt\ntheir systems to adjust in response to these bandwidth limitations by changing\nthe video bitrate or, failing that, allowing playback interruptions\n(rebuffering). Being able to predict end user' quality of experience (QoE)\nresulting from these adjustments could lead to perceptually-driven network\nresource allocation strategies that would deliver streaming content of higher\nquality to clients, while being cost effective for providers. Existing\nobjective QoE models only consider the effects on user QoE of video quality\nchanges or playback interruptions. For streaming applications, adaptive network\nstrategies may involve a combination of dynamic bitrate allocation along with\nplayback interruptions when the available bandwidth reaches a very low value.\nTowards effectively predicting user QoE, we propose Video Assessment of\nTemporaL Artifacts and Stalls (Video ATLAS): a machine learning framework where\nwe combine a number of QoE-related features, including objective quality\nfeatures, rebuffering-aware features and memory-driven features to make QoE\npredictions.

What we do know is the\ndifference between two given energies. We resolve this problem by finding a\nreference energy and then finding another energy by examining the data,\nrelative to the reference energy. From the difference between them we can\napproximate the energy distribution for a given energy, and since we know the\nenergy threshold of the reaction (E_threshold for 7Li(p,n)7Be is about\n1880.4-1880.8 (keV)) we can calibrate the beam energy. We then determine the\nenergy which produce the maximum yield derivative as the reference and record\nthe energy whose neutron yield is 5% of the reference energy. The data is\ncollected by simulating this reaction using SimLit. Since this is a simulation\nwe know the real energy distribution so we make a linear fit for energy\ndistribution as function of energy difference. We tested the theory on\nexperimental data for which we approximate the energy distribution by other\nmeans, and found our new method to be accurate and satisfactory for our needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 07:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

Such coherent superposition endows the possibility of\ngenerating true random numbers, realizing parallel computing, and other\nclassically impossible tasks such as quantum Bernoulli factory. Considering a\nsystem that consists of multiple parts, the coherent superposition that exists\nnonlocally on different systems is called entanglement.

We highlight important\ndifferences between gas-poor and gas-rich hosts, and between orbital evolution\ntaking place at high redshift as opposed to low redshift. Two effects have a\nhuge impact and are rather novel in the context of massive black hole binaries.\nThe first is the increase in characteristic density of galactic nuclei of\nmerger remnants as galaxies are more compact at high redshift due to the way\ndark halo collapse depends on redshift. This leads naturally to hardening\ntimescales due to 3-body encounters that should decrease by two orders of\nmagnitude up to $z=4$. It explains naturally the short binary coalescence\ntimescale, $\\sim 10$ Myr, found in novel cosmological simulations that follow\nbinary evolution from galactic to milliparsec scales. The second one is the\ninhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in massive gas-rich disks at high\nredshift. In the latter star forming clumps 1-2 orders of magnitude more\nmassive than local Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) can scatter massive black\nholes out of the disk plane via gravitational perturbations and direct\nencounters. This renders the character of orbital decay inherently stochastic,\noften increasing orbital decay timescales by as much as a Gyr. At low redshift\na similar regime is present at scales of $1-10$ pc inside Circumnuclear Gas\nDisks (CNDs). In CNDs only massive black holes with masses below $10^7\nM_{\\odot}$ can be significantly perturbed. They decay to sub-pc separations in\nup to $\\sim 10^8$ yr rather than the in just a few million years as in a smooth\nCND. Finally implications for building robust forecasts of LISA event rates are\ndiscussed\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 08:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

It is a major open problem\nwhether parity games with perfect information can be solved in PTIME.\nRestricting the structural complexity of the game arenas, however, often leads\nto efficient algorithms for parity games. Such results are known for graph\nclasses of bounded tree-width, DAG-width, directed path-width, and\nentanglement, which we describe in terms of cops and robber games. Conversely,\nthe introduction of imperfect information makes the problem more difficult, it\nbecomes EXPTIME-hard. We analyse the interaction of both approaches.\n  We use a simple method to measure the amount of \"unawareness\"' of a player,\nthe amount of imperfect information. It turns out that if it is unbounded, low\nstructural complexity does not make the problem simpler. It remains\nEXPTIME-hard or PSPACE-hard even on very simple graphs.\n  For games with bounded imperfect information we analyse the powerset\nconstruction, which is commonly used to convert a game of imperfect information\ninto an equivalent game with perfect information. This construction preserves\nboundedness of directed path-width and DAG-width, but not of entanglement or of\ntree-width. Hence, if directed path-width or DAG-width are bounded, parity\ngames with bounded imperfect information can be solved in PTIME. For DAG-width\nwe follow two approaches. One leads to a generalization of the known fact that\nperfect information parity games are in PTIME if DAG-width is bounded. We prove\nthis theorem for non-monotone DAG-width.

This model is equivalent to a linear\ninverted pendulum with variable center-of-mass height, but its equations of\nmotion remain linear.

Since VSDi signals report the\naverage membrane potential, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to\nmodel such signals. Here, we investigate a mean-field model of networks of\nAdaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based\nsynaptic interactions. The AdEx model can capture the spiking response of\ndifferent cell types, such as regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and\nfast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism,\ntogether with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx\nneurons. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated\nnetworks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the\nnetwork, which is well predicted by the mean-field model. Second, we\ninvestigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and\nshow that the mean-field model accurately predicts the response time course of\nthe population. One notable exception was that the \"tail\" of the response at\nlong times was not well predicted, because the mean-field does not include\nadaptation mechanisms. We conclude that the Master Equation formalism can yield\nmean-field models that predict well the behavior of nonlinear networks with\nconductance-based interactions and various electrophysiolgical properties, and\nshould be a good candidate to model VSDi signals where both excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons contribute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 10:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

The plasma is of low density and\nits pressure is negligible compared with the magnetic pressure; the flow of the\nplasma is driven by the Lorentz force and and energy is dissipated primarily by\nthe viscosity of the medium. The axial and toroidal fluxes of magnetic field\nare conserved in the perfect-conductivity limit, as is the mass per unit axial\nlength. The magnetic field relaxes during a rapid initial stage to a force-free\nstate, and then decays slowly, due to the effect of weak resistivity $\\eta$,\nwhile constrained to remain approximately force-free. Interest centres on\nwhether the relaxed field may attain a Taylor state; but under the assumed\nconditions with axial and toroidal flux conserved inside every cylindrical\nLagrangian surface, this is not possible.

On the\nother hand, composite spectra are often not recognized as such even at\nmedium-high spectral resolution and typical signal-to-noise ratios, despite\nmultiplicity among massive stars is widespread. In particular, surveys that\nproduce large amounts of automatically reduced data are prone to oversight of\ndetails that turn hazardous for the analysis with techniques that have been\ndeveloped for a set of standard assumptions applicable to a spectrum of a\nsingle star. Much larger systematic errors than anticipated may therefore\nresult because of the unrecognized true nature of the investigated objects, or\nmuch smaller sample sizes of objects for the analysis than initially planned,\nif recognized.

With the aim of extending\nthe study of magnetic massive stars to nearby galaxies, to better understand\nthe role of metallicity in the formation of their magnetic fields and\nmagnetospheres, and to broaden our knowledge of the role of magnetic fields in\nmassive star evolution, we have carried out spectropolarimetry of five\nextra-Galactic Of?p stars, as well as a couple of dozen neighbouring stars. We\nhave been able to measure magnetic fields with typical error bars from 0.2 to\n1.0 kG, depending on the apparent magnitude and on weather conditions. No\nmagnetic field has been firmly detected in any of our measurements, but we have\nbeen able to estimate upper limits to the field values of our target stars. One\nof our targets, 2dFS 936, exhibited an unexpected strengthening of emission\nlines. We confirm the unusual behaviour of BI 57, which exhibits a 787 d period\nwith two photometric peaks and one spectroscopic maximum. The observed\nstrengthening of the emission lines of 2dFS 936, and the lack of detection of a\nstrong magnetic field in a star with such strong emission lines is at odd with\nexpectations. Together with the unusual periodic behaviour of BI 57, it\nrepresents a challenge for the current models of Of?p stars. The limited\nprecision that we obtained in our field measurements (in most cases as a\nconsequence of poor weather) has led to field-strength upper limits that are\nsubstantially larger than those typically measured in Galactic magnetic O\nstars. Further higher precision observations and monitoring are clearly\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 11:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The different families of cluster galaxies considered here\nhave the pseudo phase-space density profiles Q(r) and Qr(r) consistent with the\nprofiles expected in virialized dark matter halos in $N$-body simulations.

We aim at tracing the radial\ndistributions of abundances of elements produced through different\nnucleosynthetic channels -the alpha-elements O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti, and the\niron-peak elements Fe, Cr, Ni and Sc - by using the Gaia-ESO idr4 results of\nopen clusters and young field stars.

The adopted\nchemo-dynamical model, with the new generation of metallicity-dependent stellar\nyields for massive stars, is able to reproduce the observed spatial\ndistributions of abundance ratios, in particular the abundance ratios of [O/Fe]\nand [Mg/Fe] in the inner disc (5 kpc<RGC <7 kpc), with their differences, that\nwere usually poorly explained by chemical evolution models.

In particular,\nwe show that classical changes induced in the binding site of the enzyme\nspreads the quantum correlations among all of the four hydrogen-bonded atoms\nthanks to the directionality of hydrogen bonds. If the enzyme rapidly returns\nto its initial state after the binding stage, the substrate ends in a new\ntransition state corresponding to a quantum superposition.

Our main results are: (i) most of\nthe training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\\emph compression} of the\ninput to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii)\nThe representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes\nsmall and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift\nto smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion,\nconstrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or\nvery close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps\nfrom the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output\nsatisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise\nmechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks.\n(iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers.\nThus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational.

Our main motivation is the following: for many applications such as\nclustering proteins by function or clustering communities in a social network,\nthere is some unknown target clustering, and the hope is that running a\n$k$-median or $k$-means algorithm will produce clusterings which are close to\nmatching the target clustering. Worst-case results can guarantee constant\nfactor approximations to the optimal $k$-median or $k$-means objective value,\nbut not closeness to the target clustering.\n  Our first result is a distributed algorithm which returns a near-optimal\nclustering assuming a natural notion of stability, namely, approximation\nstability [Balcan et. al 2013], even when a constant fraction of the data are\noutliers. The communication complexity is $\\tilde O(sk+z)$ where $s$ is the\nnumber of machines, $k$ is the number of clusters, and $z$ is the number of\noutliers.\n  Next, we show this amount of communication cannot be improved even in the\nsetting when the input satisfies various non-worst-case assumptions.

At the same\ntime the mass ratio of the two bosonic excitations appears to approach a\nlimiting value depending only on the infrared value of the first ratio, but not\non the microscopic (ultraviolet) coupling values. The observations receive a\ngeneral interpretation by the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point located\nin the symmetric phase.

We will focus our analysis on\ndemand-response policies based on automatic decisions by the so-called smart\nhome appliances. Following the usual design approach, each individual appliance\nhas access to a universal signal (e.g. grid frequency or electricity price)\nthat is believed to indicate the system state. Such information is then used as\nthe basis of the appliances' individual decisions. While each single device has\na negligible impact in the system, the aggregate effect of the distributed\nappliances' reactions is expect to bring improvements in the system efficiency;\nthis effect is the demand-response policy goal. The smartness of such an ideal\nsystem, composed by isolated appliances with their individual decisions, but\nconnected in the same physical grid, may worsen the system stability. This\nfirst-sight undesirable outcome comes as a consequence of synchronization among\nagents that are subject to the same signal. We argue that this effect is in\nfact byproduct of methodological choices, which are many times implicit. To\nsupport this claim, we employ a different approach that understands the\nelectricity system as constituted by physical, informational and regulatory\n(networked and structured) layers that cannot be reduced to only one or two of\nthem, but have to be viewed as an organic whole. By classifying its structure\nunder this lens, more appropriate management tools can be designed by looking\nat the system totality in action. Two examples are provided to illustrate the\nstrength of this modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 05:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

In recent years, laparoscopic\nscene tracking and surface reconstruction has been a focus of investigation to\nprovide rich additional information to aid the surgical process and compensate\nfor the depth perception issue. However, robust 3D surface reconstruction and\naugmented reality with depth perception on the reconstructed scene are yet to\nbe reported. This paper presents our work in this area. First, we adopt a\nstate-of-the-art visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework\n- ORB-SLAM - and extend the algorithm for use in MIS scenes for reliable\nendoscopic camera tracking and salient point mapping. We then develop a robust\nglobal 3D surface reconstruction frame- work based on the sparse point clouds\nextracted from the SLAM framework. Our approach is to combine an outlier\nremoval filter within a Moving Least Squares smoothing algorithm and then\nemploy Poisson surface reconstruction to obtain smooth surfaces from the\nunstructured sparse point cloud. Our proposed method has been quantitatively\nevaluated compared with ground-truth camera trajectories and the organ model\nsurface we used to render the synthetic simulation videos. In vivo laparoscopic\nvideos used in the tests have demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our\nproposed framework on both camera tracking and surface reconstruction,\nillustrating the potential of our algorithm for depth augmentation and\ndepth-corrected augmented reality in MIS with monocular endoscopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 18:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}
