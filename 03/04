Using sequence\ndata as the basis for the inference of Boltzmann distributions from samples of\nmicroscopic configurations or observables, it is possible to extract\ninformation about evolutionary constraints and thus protein function and\nstructure.

In particular, we show that demixed\ndomains are likely to segregate when the variance in the inter-molecular\ninteraction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold.

As a result, only minor\nadjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the\ninter-molecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different\ndomains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust\nmechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this\nfunctionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in\nthe system.

The experimental study of such protein complexes and\ninteractions has been arduous. Theoretical structure prediction methods are an\nattractive alternative. Here, we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by\ntracing residue coevolution via the global statistical Direct Coupling Analysis\n(DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial adjacencies between residues. These\nadjacencies can be included as constraints in structure-prediction techniques\nto predict high-resolution models.

Sequence derived contact information for the subfamilies proves\nsufficient to assemble accurate structural models of the diverse\nprotein-oligomers.

A generalization of binary search, this class of policies attempt at\nany given time to reduce the uncertainty by a given percentage. Among all\npercentile policies, we search for the one with the minimum expected cost. The\nresult of this search is a heuristic policy which we evaluate through numerical\nsimulations. We show that it outperforms the myopic policies and under some\nconditions performs close to the optimal policies. Furthermore, we derive a\nlower bound on the cost of the optimal policy which can be computed with low\ncomplexity and give a measure for how close our heuristic policy is to the\noptimal policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 17:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

For such a goal, it\nis mandatory to reach very low threshold in energy (at or below the keV level),\nvery low radioactive background (at a few counts/keV/kg/day), and high\ndetection mass (at or above the 100 kg scale). One of the most relevant\ntechnical issues is the optimization of the crystal intrinsic scintillation\nlight yield and the efficiency of the light collecting system for large mass\ncrystals. In the frame of the ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators)\ndark matter search project large NaI(Tl) crystals from different providers\ncoupled to two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been tested at the Canfranc\nUnderground Laboratory. In this paper we present the estimates of the NaI(Tl)\nscintillation light collected using full-absorption peaks at very low energy\nfrom external and internal sources emitting gammas/electrons, and\nsingle-photoelectron events populations selected by using very low energy\npulses tails. Outstanding scintillation light collection at the level of\n15~photoelectrons/keV can be reported for the final design and provider chosen\nfor ANAIS detectors. Taking into account the Quantum Efficiency of the PMT\nunits used, the intrinsic scintillation light yield in these NaI(Tl) crystals\nis above 40~photoelectrons/keV for energy depositions in the range from 3 up to\n25~keV. This very high light output of ANAIS crystals allows triggering below\n1~keV, which is very important in order to increase the sensitivity in the\ndirect detection of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 17:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Dryland\necosystems often exhibit patchy vegetation, which has been shown to be an\nimportant factor on the possible regime shifts that occur in arid regions in\nseveral model studies. In particular, both gradual shifts that occur by front\npropagation, and abrupt shifts where patches of vegetation vanish at once, are\na possibility in dryland ecosystems due to their emergent spatial\nheterogeneity. However, recent theoretical work has suggested that the final\nstep of desertification - the transition from spotted vegetation to bare soil -\noccurs only as an abrupt shift, but the generality of this result, and its\nunderlying origin, remain unclear. We investigate two models that detail the\ndynamics of dryland vegetation using a markedly different functional structure,\nand find that in both models the final step of desertification can only be\nabrupt. Using a careful numerical analysis, we show that this behavior is\nassociated with the disappearance of confined spot-pattern domains as\nstationary states, and identify the mathematical origin of this behavior. Our\nfindings show that a gradual desertification to bare soil due to a front\npropagation process can not occur in these and similar models, and opens the\nquestion of whether these dynamics can take place in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 18:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

In this model, independent investors can transfer funds\nto independent projects, in the same way as it works on crowdfunding platforms.\nThe framework protects the investors' single payments from being detected (by\nany other party), only the sums of each investor's payments are revealed.\nLikewise, the projects' single incoming payments are concealed and only the\nfinal sums of the incoming payments for every project are revealed. In this\nway, no other party than the investor (not even the system administration) can\ndetect how much she paid to any single project. Though it is still possible to\nconfidentially exchange any part of an investment between any pair of\ninvestors, such that market liquidity is unaffected by the system. On top, our\nframework allows a privacy-preserving return of a multiple of all the held\ninvestments (e.g. interest payments or dividends) to the indivdual investors\nwhile still revealing nothing else than the sum of all returns for every\ninvestor. We provide reasonable security guarantees for this framework that are\nbased on common notions from the Secure Multi-Party Computation literature.

In edge computing,\nclients interact with an edge-layer of servers that is geographically near; the\nedge-layer in turn interacts with a back-end layer of servers. The edge-layer\nprovides low latency access and temporary storage for client operations, and\nuses the back-end layer for persistent storage. Our algorithm, termed Layered\nData Storage (LDS) algorithm, offers several features suitable for\nedge-computing systems, works under asynchronous message-passing environments,\nsupports multiple readers and writers, and can tolerate $f_1 < n_1/2$ and $f_2\n< n_2/3$ crash failures in the two layers having $n_1$ and $n_2$ servers,\nrespectively. We use a class of erasure codes known as regenerating codes for\nstorage of data in the back-end layer. The choice of regenerating codes,\ninstead of popular choices like Reed-Solomon codes, not only optimizes the cost\nof back-end storage, but also helps in optimizing communication cost of read\noperations, when the value needs to be recreated all the way from the back-end.\nThe two-layer architecture permits a modular implementation of atomicity and\nerasure-code protocols; the implementation of erasure-codes is mostly limited\nto interaction between the two layers. We prove liveness and atomicity of LDS,\nand also compute performance costs associated with read and write operations.\nFurther, in a multi-object system running $N$ independent instances of LDS,\nwhere only a small fraction of the objects undergo concurrent accesses at any\npoint during the execution, the overall storage cost is dominated by that of\npersistent storage in the back-end layer, and is given by $\\Theta(N)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 18:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 22:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

The light curve\nis well fitted with a $t^{-5/3}$ decay, and we constrain the rise-time to peak\nto be $<$49 rest-frame days after disruption, which is roughly consistent with\nthe fallback timescale expected for the $\\sim 5\\times$10$^{6}$ $M_\\odot$ black\nhole inferred from the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. The UV\nand optical spectral energy distribution (SED) is well described by a constant\nblackbody temperature of T$\\sim$ 3$\\times$10$^4$ K over the monitoring period,\nwith an observed peak luminosity of 1.1$\\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The\noptical spectra are characterized by a strong blue continuum and broad HeII and\nH$\\alpha$ lines characteristic of TDEs. We compare the photometric and\nspectroscopic signatures of iPTF16axa with 11 TDE candidates in the literature\nwith well-sampled optical light curves. Based on a single-temperature fit to\nthe optical and near-UV photometry, most of these TDE candidates have peak\nluminosities confined between log(L [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 43.4-44.4, with constant\ntemperatures of a few $\\times 10^{4}$ K during their power-law declines,\nimplying blackbody radii on the order of ten times the tidal disruption radius,\nthat decrease monotonically with time. For TDE candidates with hydrogen and\nhelium emission, the high helium-to-hydrogen ratios suggest that the emission\narises from high-density gas, where nebular arguments break down. We find no\ncorrelation between the peak luminosity and the black hole mass, contrary to\nthe expectations for TDEs to have $\\dot{M} \\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{-1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 21:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

These\nplatforms have, however, been targeting the data center of a single provider,\nwhich is insufficient to support (critical) applications that need to be\ndeployed across multiple trust domains, while enforcing diverse security\nrequirements. This paper addresses this limitation by presenting a novel\nsolution for the central resource allocation problem of network virtualization\n-- the virtual network embedding, which aims to find efficient mappings of\nvirtual network requests onto the substrate network. We improve over the\nstate-of-the-art by considering security as a first-class citizen of virtual\nnetworks, while enhancing the substrate infrastructure with resources from\nmultiple cloud providers. Our solution enables the definition of flexible\npolicies in three core elements: on the virtual links, where alternative\nsecurity compromises can be explored (e.g., encryption); on the virtual\nswitches, supporting various degrees of protection and redundancy if necessary;\nand on the substrate infrastructure, extending it across multiple clouds,\nincluding public and private facilities, with their inherently diverse trust\nlevels associated. We propose an optimal solution to this problem formulated as\na Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The results of our evaluation give\ninsight into the trade-offs associated with the inclusion of security demands\ninto network virtualization. In particular, they provide evidence that\nenhancing the user's virtual networks with security does not preclude high\nacceptance rates and an efficient use of resources, and allows providers to\nincrease their revenues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 19:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 14:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 12:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Recent large\nvolume lattice calculations for these dressing functions indicate that the\ncoupling defined in such a way goes to zero as A(Q^2)~Q^2 when the squared\nmomenta Q^2 go to zero (Q^2<<1 GeV^2). In this work we construct such a QCD\ncoupling A(Q^2) which fulfills also various other physically motivated\nconditions. At high momenta it becomes the underlying perturbative coupling\na(Q^2) to a very high precision. And at intermediate low squared momenta Q^2~1\nGeV^2 it gives results consistent with the data of the semihadronic tau lepton\ndecays as measured by OPAL and ALEPH. The coupling is constructed in a\ndispersive way, resulting as a byproduct in the holomorphic behavior of A(Q^2)\nin the complex Q^2-plane which reflects the holomorphic behavior of the\nspacelike QCD observables.

In addition, in this supplier-driven marketplace, users need to\nproactively adjust their price to make profits. Famous people are unwilling to\nlower their price, which in turn hurts their income and engagement over time.\nFinally, we discuss the key implications to future CQA design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 20:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 01:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

In many applications, for example, deep neural network\n(DNN) models collect public data as the inputs to perform re-training, where\nthe input data can be poisoned. Although poisoning attack against support\nvector machines (SVM) has been extensively studied before, there is still very\nlimited knowledge about how such attack can be implemented on neural networks\n(NN), especially DNNs. In this work, we first examine the possibility of\napplying traditional gradient-based method (named as the direct gradient\nmethod) to generate poisoned data against NNs by leveraging the gradient of the\ntarget model w.r.t. the normal data. We then propose a generative method to\naccelerate the generation rate of the poisoned data: an auto-encoder\n(generator) used to generate poisoned data is updated by a reward function of\nthe loss, and the target NN model (discriminator) receives the poisoned data to\ncalculate the loss w.r.t. the normal data. Our experiment results show that the\ngenerative method can speed up the poisoned data generation rate by up to\n239.38x compared with the direct gradient method, with slightly lower model\naccuracy degradation. A countermeasure is also designed to detect such\npoisoning attack methods by checking the loss of the target model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 21:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

However, the existing recombination-based fingerprinting systems do\nnot provide a convenient solution for collusion resistance, since they require\ndouble-layer fingerprinting codes, making the practical implementation of such\nsystems a challenging task.

However, the biology of QS\nremains incompletely understood in heterogeneous communities, where variant\nbacterial strains possess distinct QS systems that produce chemically unique\nAIs. AI molecules bind to 'cognate' receptors, but also to 'non-cognate'\nreceptors found in other strains, resulting in inter-strain crosstalk.\nUnderstanding these interactions is a prerequisite for deciphering the\nconsequences of crosstalk in real ecosystems, where multiple AIs are regularly\npresent in the same environment. As a step towards this goal, we map crosstalk\nin a heterogeneous community of variant QS strains onto an artificial neural\nnetwork model. This formulation allows us to systematically analyze how\ncrosstalk regulates the community's capacity for flexible decision making, as\nquantified by the Boltzmann entropy of all QS gene expression states of the\nsystem. In a mean-field limit of complete cross-inhibition between variant\nstrains, the model is exactly solvable, allowing for an analytical formula for\nthe number of variants that maximize capacity as a function of signal kinetics\nand activation parameters. An analysis of previous experimental results on the\nStaphylococcus aureus two-component Agr system indicates that the observed\ncombination of variant numbers, gene expression rates and threshold\nconcentrations lies near this critical regime of parameter space where capacity\npeaks. The results are suggestive of a potential evolutionary driving force for\ndiversification in certain QS systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 22:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Many different proof formalisms have been introduced (e.g.\nsequent, nested sequent, labelled sequent formalisms) in order to provide such\ncalculi for the many logics of interest. The nested sequent formalism was\nrecently generalised to indexed nested sequents in order to yield proof calculi\nwith the subformula property for extensions of the modal logic K by\n(Lemmon-Scott) Geach axioms. The proofs of completeness and cut-elimination\ntherein were semantic and intricate. Here we show that derivations in the\nlabelled sequent formalism whose sequents are `almost treelike' correspond\nexactly to indexed nested sequents. This correspondence is exploited to induce\nsyntactic proofs for indexed nested sequent calculi making use of the elegant\nproofs that exist for the labelled sequent calculi. A larger goal of this work\nis to demonstrate how specialising existing proof-theoretic transformations\nalleviate the need for independent proofs in each formalism. Such coercion can\nalso be used to induce new cutfree calculi.

Contrary to the well-known forms\nof these fundamental geometries, that usually correspond to a 1+3 foliation\nwith the 3-space of a constant spatial curvature, the new metrics are adapted\nto a 2+2 foliation, and are warped products of two 2-spaces of constant\ncurvature. This new class of (anti-)de Sitter metrics depends on the value of\ncosmological constant Lambda and two discrete parameters +1,0,-1 related to the\ncurvature of the 2-spaces. The class admits 3 distinct subcases for Lambda>0\nand 8 subcases for Lambda<0. We systematically study all these possibilities.\nIn particular, we explicitly present the corresponding parametrizations of the\n(anti-)de Sitter hyperboloid, visualize the coordinate lines and surfaces\nwithin the global conformal cylinder, investigate their mutual relations,\npresent some closely related forms of the metrics, and give transformations to\nstandard de Sitter and anti-de Sitter metrics. Using these results, we also\nprovide a physical interpretation of B-metrics as exact gravitational fields of\na tachyon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 00:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 16:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

But how do economies learn? And who do they learn\nfrom? The literature on economic geography and economic development has\nemphasized two learning channels: inter-industry learning, which involves\nlearning from related industries; and inter-regional learning, which involves\nlearning from neighboring regions. Here we use 25 years of data describing the\nevolution of China's economy between 1990 and 2015--a period when China\nmultiplied its GDP per capita by a factor of ten--to explore how Chinese\nprovinces diversified their economies. First, we show that the probability that\na province will develop a new industry increases with the number of related\nindustries that are already present in that province, a fact that is suggestive\nof inter-industry learning. Also, we show that the probability that a province\nwill develop an industry increases with the number of neighboring provinces\nthat are developed in that industry, a fact suggestive of inter-regional\nlearning. Moreover, we find that the combination of these two channels exhibit\ndiminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning\nchannels is redundant when the other one is present. Finally, we address\nendogeneity concerns by using the introduction of high-speed rail as an\ninstrument to isolate the effects of inter-regional learning. Our\ndifferences-in-differences (DID) analysis reveals that the introduction of high\nspeed-rail increased the industrial similarity of pairs of provinces connected\nby high-speed rail. Also, industries in provinces that were connected by rail\nincreased their productivity when they were connected by rail to other\nprovinces where that industry was already present. These findings suggest that\ninter-regional and inter-industry learning played a role in China's great\neconomic expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 00:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

The\ndistinctive insight here is to build a statistical model that correlates all\nspecifications hidden inside a corpus with the syntax and observed behavior of\nprograms that implement these specifications. During the analysis of a\nparticular program, this model is conditioned into a posterior distribution\nthat prioritizes specifications that are relevant to this program. This allows\naccurate program analysis even if the corpus is highly heterogeneous. The\nproblem of finding anomalies is now framed quantitatively, as a problem of\ncomputing a distance between a \"reference distribution\" over program behaviors\nthat our model expects from the program, and the distribution over behaviors\nthat the program actually produces.\n  We present a concrete embodiment of our framework that combines a topic model\nand a neural network model to learn specifications, and queries the learned\nmodels to compute anomaly scores.

These results highlight the essential role of controlling\nthe AFM rotation and reveal a facile approach to detect the AFM moment even in\ncurrent-in-plane configurations in FM/AFM bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 07:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 04:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

Then in a global phase space composed of the anisotropy\n$\\lambda$ of the XY interaction and the coupling $\\Delta$ of the\n$\\Delta\\sigma^z\\sigma^z$ interaction we find that the above fixed points remain\nattractive in the two dimesional parameter space.

Indeed, the\ntransiting configuration of these planets with the Jupiter-like size of their\nhost star - named TRAPPIST-1 - makes possible in-depth studies of their\natmospheric properties with current and future astronomical facilities. Here we\nreport the results of an intensive photometric monitoring campaign of that star\nfrom the ground and with the Spitzer Space Telescope.

To\naddress these issues, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nbased method, named Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet), to detect text with\ntighter quadrangle. First, we use quadrilateral sliding windows in several\nspecific intermediate convolutional layers to roughly recall the text with\nhigher overlapping area and then a shared Monte-Carlo method is proposed for\nfast and accurate computing of the polygonal areas. After that, we designed a\nsequential protocol for relative regression which can exactly predict text with\ncompact quadrangle.

At the WoT connecting physical\ndevices such as sensors, RFID tags or any devices that can send data through\nthe Internet using the Web is almost automatic. The WoT shared data can be used\nto build smarter solutions that offer business services in the form of IoT\napplications. In this chapter, we review the main WoT challenges, with\nparticular interest on highlighting those that rely on combining heterogeneous\nIoT data for the design of smarter services and applications and that benefit\nfrom data interoperability. Semantic web technologies help for overcoming with\nsuch challenges by addressing, among other ones the following objectives: 1)\nsemantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, 2) enriching semantic\nWoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and 3) providing an analysis of\ndata by means of reasoning mechanisms to infer meaningful information. To\novercome the challenge of building interoperable semantics-based IoT\napplications, the Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) semantic engine has been\ndesigned to semantically annotate WoT data, build the logic of smarter services\nand deduce meaningful knowledge by linking it to the external knowledge graphs\navailable on the web.

The pasta geometries\ndepend on the average baryon density, proton fraction and temperature and are\ncritically important in the determination of many transport properties of\nmatter in supernovae and the crust of neutron stars. Using a set of\nself-consistent microscopic nuclear energy density functionals we present the\nfirst results of large scale quantum simulations of pasta phases at baryon\ndensities $0.03 \\leq \\rho \\leq 0.10$ fm$^{-3}$, proton fractions $0.05 \\leq Y_p\n\\leq 0.40$, and zero temperature. The full quantum simulations, in particular,\nallow us to thoroughly investigate the role and impact of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy on pasta configurations. We use the Sky3D code that solves the Skyrme\nHartree-Fock equations on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. For the nuclear\ninteraction we use the state of the art UNEDF1 parametrization, which was\nintroduced to study largely deformed nuclei, hence is suitable for studies of\nthe nuclear pasta. Density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is\nsimulated by tuning two purely isovector observables that are insensitive to\nthe current available experimental data. We find that a minimum total number of\nnucleons $A=2000$ is necessary to prevent the results from containing spurious\nshell effects and to minimize finite size effects.

Recent studies on Kappa distribution functions invoked in space\nplasma applications have emphasized two alternative approaches which may assume\nthe temperature parameter either dependent or independent of the power-index\n$\\kappa$. Each of them can obtain justification in different scenarios\ninvolving Kappa-distributed plasmas, but direct evidences supporting any of\nthese two alternatives with measurements from laboratory or natural plasmas are\nnot available yet. Aims. This paper aims to provide more facts on this\nintriguing issue from direct fitting measurements of suprathermal electron\npopulations present in the solar wind, as well as from their destabilizing\neffects predicted by these two alternating approaches. Methods. Two fitting\nmodels are contrasted, namely, the global Kappa and the dual Maxwellian-Kappa\nmodels, which are currently invoked in theory and observations. The\ndestabilizing effects of suprathermal electrons are characterized on the basis\nof a kinetic approach which accounts for the microscopic details of the\nvelocity distribution. Results. In order to be relevant, the model is chosen to\naccurately reproduce the observed distributions and this is achieved by a dual\nMaxwellian-Kappa distribution function. A statistical survey indicates a\n$\\kappa$-dependent temperature of the suprathermal (halo) electrons for any\nheliocentric distance. Only for this approach the instabilities driven by the\ntemperature anisotropy are found to be systematically stimulated by the\nabundance of suprathermal populations, i.e., lowering the values of\n$\\kappa$-index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 14:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

The theory that induced us to introduce this novel concept is\nbased on the Born-Huang expansion as applied to the Schroedinger equation that\ndescribes the interaction of a molecular system with an external electric\nfield. Assuming the molecular system is made up of two coupled adiabatic states\nthe theory leads from a single spatial Curl Equation, two space-time Curl\nequations and one single space-time Divergent equation to a pair of decoupled\nWave Equations usually encountered within the theory of fields. In the present\nstudy the Wave Equations are derived for an external field having two features:\n(a) its intensity is high enough; (b) its duration is short enough. For this\nsituation the study reveals that the just described interaction creates two\nfields that coexist within a molecule: one is a novel vectorial field formed\nvia the interaction of the external field with the Born-Huang non-adiabatic\ncoupling terms (NACT) and the other is an ordinary, scalar, electric field\nessentially identical to the original external field. Part of the present study\nis devoted to the visualization of the outcomes via two intersecting\nJahn-Teller cones which contain NACTs that become singular at their\nintersection point, also known as the point of Conical Intersection. This\ndescription is reminiscent of a metaphoric cosmic Black-Hole which swallows one\ntype of an electric field and creates a new type. Finally, the fact that\neventually we are facing a kind of a cosmic situation may bring us to speculate\nthat singular NACTs are a result of cosmic phenomena. Thus, if indeed this\nsingularity is somehow connected to reality then, like other singularities in\nphysics, it is formed at (or immediately after) the Big Bang (and because of\nthat, eventually the ability to form molecules).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 14:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 21:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 06:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 12:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In this paper we show that the source code programming\nlanguage identification task can be fully automated using machine learning\ntechniques. We first define the criteria that a production-level automatic\nprogramming language identification solution should meet. Our criteria include\naccuracy, programming language coverage, extensibility and performance. We then\ndescribe our approach: How training files are preprocessed for extracting\nfeatures that mimic grammar productions, and then how these extracted grammar\nproductions are used for the training and testing of our classifier. We achieve\na 99 percent accuracy rate while classifying 29 of the most popular programming\nlanguages with a Maximum Entropy classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 10:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}
