The model is based on a $SU(4)$ gauge group\nwith global flavour symmetry breaking $SU(5) \\to SO(5)$, giving rise to pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons in addition to the Higgs doublet. This includes a real\nand a complex electroweak triplet with exotic electric charges. Including\nthese, as well as constraints on other exotic states, we show that LHC\nmeasurements are not yet sensitive enough to significantly constrain the\nmodel's low energy constants. The Higgs potential is described by two\nparameters which are on the one hand constrained by the LHC measurement of the\nHiggs mass and Higgs decay channels and on the other hand can be computed from\ncorrelation functions in the UV-complete theory. Hence to exclude the model at\nleast one constant needs to be determined and to validate the Higgs potential\nboth constants need to be reproduced by the UV-theory. Due to its\nUV-formulation, a certain number of low energy constants can be computed from\nfirst principle numerical simulations of the theory formulated on a lattice,\nwhich can help in establishing the validity of this model.

Unfortunately, in many real-world environments, the ability to\nsample specific individual rows or columns of the matrix is limited by either\nsystem constraints or cost. In this paper, we consider matrix approximation by\nsampling predefined \\emph{blocks} of columns (or rows) from the matrix. We\npresent an algorithm for sampling useful column blocks and provide novel\nguarantees for the quality of the approximation. This algorithm has application\nin problems as diverse as biometric data analysis to distributed computing. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the\nBlock CUR decomposition of large matrices in a distributed setting with\nmultiple nodes in a compute cluster, where such blocks correspond to columns\n(or rows) of the matrix stored on the same node, which can be retrieved with\nmuch less overhead than retrieving individual columns stored across different\nnodes. In the biometric setting, the rows correspond to different users and\ncolumns correspond to users' biometric reaction to external stimuli, {\\em\ne.g.,}~watching video content, at a particular time instant. There is\nsignificant cost in acquiring each user's reaction to lengthy content so we\nsample a few important scenes to approximate the biometric response. An\nindividual time sample in this use case cannot be queried in isolation due to\nthe lack of context that caused that biometric reaction. Instead, collections\nof time segments ({\\em i.e.,} blocks) must be presented to the user.

In practice, data often present\ncomplex structures, such as clustering, which make propensity score modeling\nand estimation challenging. In addition, for clustered data, there may be\nunmeasured cluster-specific variables that are related to both the treatment\nassignment and the outcome. When such unmeasured cluster-specific confounders\nexist and are omitted in the propensity score model, the subsequent propensity\nscore adjustment may be biased. In this article, we propose a calibration\ntechnique for propensity score estimation under the latent ignorable treatment\nassignment mechanism, i.e., the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded\ngiven the observed covariates and the latent cluster effects. We then provide a\nconsistent propensity score weighting estimator of the average treatment effect\nwhen the propensity score and outcome follow generalized linear mixed effects\nmodels. The proposed propensity score weighting estimator is attractive,\nbecause it does not require specification of functional forms of the propensity\nscore and outcome models, and therefore is robust to model misspecification.\nThe proposed weighting method can be combined with sampling weights for an\nintegrated solution to handle confounding and sampling designs for causal\ninference with clustered survey data.

The dynamical accelerations\nat the half-light radii, found by Genzel et al., are rather high compared with\nthe MOND acceleration constant, as measured in the nearby Universe:\n$g(R_{1/2})= (3-11)a_0$. MOND then predicts fractions of `phantom matter' at\n$R_{1/2}$ of at most a few tens of percents, which, galaxy by galaxy, agree\nwell with what Genzel et al. find. b.

Recently, it has been shown that many ecosystems can be\ncast into mutualistic networks, and that nestedness reduces effective\ninter-species competition, thus facilitating mutually beneficial interactions\nand increasing the number of coexisting species or the biodiversity. However,\ncurrent approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by\nadopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive\ninteractions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of\nmultilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and\ncompetition. Hence, we abandon the mean field hypothesis and show, through a\ndynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an\nintricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, we show\nthat when all interactions are taken into account, mutualism does not have the\nsame consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species. This\nleads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of\ncompetition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous\nconsideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our\nunderstanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in\necosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical\necology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of\nmutualistic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

Both algorithms use a block coordinate\ndescent strategy and terminate once the optimality gap falls below the desired\ntolerance. While the first algorithm is conceptually simpler and more\nefficient, it is not guaranteed to converge for objective functions that are\nnot strictly convex. This shortcoming is overcome in the second algorithm,\nwhich uses an additional outer proximal iteration, and, which is proven to\nconverge under mild assumptions. Two examples are given to demonstrate the\ntheoretical usefulness of the optimality conditions as well as the high\nefficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 17:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 12:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The\ntoroidal symmetry of ITER will be broken by the finite number of toroidal field\ncoils and by test blanket modules (TBMs). The addition of ferritic inserts\n(FIs) will decrease the magnitude of the toroidal field ripple. 3D magnetic\nequilibria with toroidal field ripple and ferromagnetic structures are\ncalculated for an ITER steady-state scenario using the Variational Moments\nEquilibrium Code (VMEC).

These calculations fully account for\n$E_r$, flux surface shaping, multiple species, magnitude of ripple, and\ncollisionality rather than applying approximate analytic NTV formulae. As NTV\nis a complicated nonlinear function of $E_r$, we study its behavior over a\nplausible range of $E_r$.

The\ncomputed NTV torque without ferritic components is comparable in magnitude to\nthe NBI and intrinsic turbulent torques and will likely damp rotation, but the\nNTV torque is significantly reduced by the planned ferritic inserts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 21:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

By\nproviding multiple channels, they improve the efficiency and reliability of\nwireless communication. However, the heterogeneous nature of cognitive radio\nnetworks also brings new challenges to the design and analysis of distributed\nalgorithms.\n  In this paper, we focus on two fundamental problems in cognitive radio\nnetworks: neighbor discovery, and global broadcast. We consider a network\ncontaining $n$ nodes, each of which has access to $c$ channels.

CSeek is flexible and robust,\nwhich allows us to use it as a generic \"filter\" to find \"well-connected\"\nneighbors with an even shorter running time.

CGCast uses\nCSeek to achieve communication among neighbors, and uses edge coloring to\nestablish an efficient schedule for fast message dissemination.\n  Towards the end of the paper, we give lower bounds for solving the two\nproblems.

(iii) Currently available data on the mass density profiles\nof very massive galaxies (Mstar>1e12 Msun), with Mhalo>3e14 Msun, favor instead\nmodels with a stellar profile flatter than a S\\'{e}rsic one in the very inner\nregions (r<3-5 kpc), and a cored NFW or Einasto dark matter profile with median\nhalo concentration a factor of ~2 or <1.3, respectively, higher than those\ntypically predicted by N-body numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

It is located in Subcluster B and has an unusually blue, metal-poor\nouter halo. Planetary nebulae (PNe) are excellent tracers of diffuse galaxy and\nintragroup light. We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B. PNe were identified based on their\nbright [OIII]5007 \\AA\\ emission and absence of a broad-band continuum. We\nidentify 738 PNe out to a radius of 155 kpc from M49's centre from which we\ndefine a complete sample of 624 PNe within a limiting magnitude of m_5007=28.8.\nComparing the PN number density to the broad-band stellar surface brightness\nprofile, we find a variation of the PN-specific frequency (alpha-parameter)\nwith radius. The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher\nalpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to\ncontribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae\nLuminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.\nIts slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the\ninner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,\nindicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion\nevent, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249. We also determined a\ndistance modulus of mu = 31.29+/-0.08 for M49, corresponding to a physical\ndistance of 18.1+/-0.6 Mpc, which agrees with a recent surface-brightness\nfluctuations distance. The PN populations in the outer halo of M49 are\nconsistent with the presence of a main Sersic galaxy halo with a slight (B-V)\ncolour gradient of 10${}^{-4}$ mag/arcsec surrounded by intragroup light with a\nvery blue colour of (B-V)=0.25 and a constant surface brightness mu_V=28.0\nmag/arcsec${}^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

Recent developments allow us to apply techniques from\nspin physics to advance its viability. The cross section for the primary fusion\nfuel in a tokamak reactor, D+T=>alpha+n, would be increased by a factor of 1.5\nif the fuels were polarized. Simulations predict further non-linear power gains\nin large-scale machines such as ITER, due to increased alpha heating. These are\nsignificant enhancements that could lower the requirements needed to reach\nignition and could be used to extend useful reactor life by compensating for\nneutron degradation. The potential realization rests on the survival of spin\npolarization for periods comparable to the energy containment time. Interest in\npolarized fuel options had an initial peak of activity in the 1980s, where\ncalculations predicted that polarizations could in fact survive a plasma.\nHowever, concerns were raised regarding the cumulative impacts of fuel\nrecycling from the reactor walls. In addition, the technical challenges of\npreparing and handling polarized materials prevented direct tests. Over the\nlast several decades, this situation has changed dramatically. Detailed\nsimulations of the ITER plasma have projected negligible wall recycling in a\nhigh power reactor.

Such a\nposterior is determined together by a generative model imposed on data and the\nselection event that enforces a truncation on the assumed law. The effective\ndifference between the selective posterior and the usual Bayesian framework is\nreflected in the use of a truncated likelihood. The normalizer of the truncated\nlaw in the adjusted framework is the probability of the selection event; this\nis typically intractable and it leads to the computational bottleneck in\nsampling from such a posterior. The current work lays out a primal-dual\napproach of solving an approximating optimization problem to provide valid\npost-selective Bayesian inference. The selection procedures are posed as\ndata-queries that solve a randomized version of a convex learning program which\nhave the advantage of preserving more left-over information for inference.

Beside graph states, quantum states amenable to\nfinite-time robust stabilization include a class of universal resource states\ndisplaying two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological order, along with\ntensor network states obtained by generalizing a construction due to Bravyi and\nVyalyi. Extensions to representative classes of mixed graph-product and thermal\nstates are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Lighthill (1971) originally proposed\nthat this burst-and-coast behavior can save fish energy during swimming by\ntaking advantage of the viscous Bone-Lighthill boundary layer thinning\nmechanism. Here, an additional inviscid Garrick mechanism is discovered that\nallows swimmers to control the ratio of their added mass thrust-producing\nforces to their circulatory drag-inducing forces by decreasing their duty\ncycle, DC, of locomotion. This mechanism can save intermittent swimmers as much\nas 60% of the energy it takes to swim continuously at the same speed. The\ninviscid energy savings are shown to increase with increasing amplitude of\nmotion, increase with decreasing Lighthill number, Li, and switch to an\nenergetic cost above continuous swimming for sufficiently low DC. Intermittent\nswimmers are observed to shed four vortices per cycle that form into groups\nthat are self-similar with the DC. In addition, previous thrust and power\nscaling laws of continuous self-propelled swimming are further generalized to\ninclude intermittent swimming. The key is that by averaging the thrust and\npower coefficients over only the bursting period then the intermittent problem\ncan be transformed into a continuous one. Furthermore, the intermittent thrust\nand power scaling relations are extended to predict the mean speed and cost of\ntransport of swimmers. By tuning a few coefficients with a handful of\nsimulations these self-propelled relations can become predictive. In the\ncurrent study, the mean speed and cost of transport are predicted to within 3%\nand 18% of their full-scale values by using these relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 19:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

However atomically thin materials\nare highly sensitive to surrounding dielectric media, which imposes severe\nlimitations to their practical applicability. Hence for their suitable\nintegration into devices, the development of reliable encapsulation procedures\nthat preserve their physical properties are required. Here, the excitonic\nphotoluminescence of WSe2 monolayer flakes is assessed, at room temperature and\n10 K, on mechanically exfoliated flakes encapsulated with SiOx and AlxOy layers\nemploying chemical and physical deposition techniques. Conformal flakes coating\non untreated - non-functionalized - flakes is successfully demonstrated by all\nthe techniques except for atomic layer deposition, where a cluster-like oxide\ncoating is observed. No significant compositional or strain state changes in\nthe flakes are detected upon encapsulation by any of the techniques.\nRemarkably, our results evidence that the flakes' optical emission is strongly\ninfluenced by the quality of the encapsulating oxide - stoichiometry -. When\nthe encapsulation is carried out with slightly sub-stoichiometric oxides two\nremarkable phenomena are observed. First, there is a clear electrical doping of\nthe monolayers that is revealed through a dominant trion - charged exciton -\nroom-temperature photoluminescence. Second, a strong decrease of the monolayers\noptical emission is measured attributed to non-radiative recombination\nprocesses and/or carriers transfer from the flake to the oxide. Power- and\ntemperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements further confirm that\nstoichiometric oxides obtained by physical deposition lead to a successful\nencapsulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 11:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 20:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

This method does not require the full particle\nionization track to be contained inside of the detector volume as other track\nmomentum reconstruction methods do (range-based momentum reconstruction and\ncalorimetric momentum reconstruction). We motivate use of this technique,\ndescribe a tuning of the underlying phenomenological formula, quantify its\nperformance on fully contained beam-neutrino-induced muon tracks both in\nsimulation and in data, and quantify its performance on exiting muon tracks in\nsimulation. Using simulation, we have shown that the standard Highland formula\nshould be re-tuned specifically for scattering in liquid argon, which\nsignificantly improves the bias and resolution of the momentum measurement.\nWith the tuned formula, we find agreement between data and simulation for\ncontained tracks, with a small bias in the momentum reconstruction and with\nresolutions that vary as a function of track length, improving from about 10%\nfor the shortest (one meter long) tracks to 5% for longer (several meter)\ntracks. For simulated exiting muons with at least one meter of track contained,\nwe find a similarly small bias, and a resolution which is less than 15% for\nmuons with momentum below 2 GeV/c. Above 2 GeV/c, results are given as a first\nestimate of the MCS momentum measurement capabilities of MicroBooNE for high\nmomentum exiting tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 20:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 22:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 17:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

We present a strategy for\nprogramming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means\nthat the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the\ndevice. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by\nunitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational\nproblems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a\nHamiltonian. These problems may not fit naturally on the physical layout of the\nqubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on\nthe qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters.\nMeasurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new\nparameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the\nenergy). As an example we consider finding approximate solutions to MaxCut on\n3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a\nrectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at\nleast 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5).\nWe open up the algorithm to have different parameters for each single qubit $X$\nrotation and for each $ZZ$ interaction associated with the nearest neighbor\ninteractions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an\nenveloping classical algorithm can be used to find the parameters which sit on\nthe grid to optimize an objective function with a different connectivity.

(2) We also discuss about the robust identification problem when the\nnoise distribution is un- specified and the block signal identification problem\nunder the exponential family setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 00:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

A well-studied shortcoming is that extending it to\ndisconnected graphs and directed graphs is controversial. The second\nshortcoming is that a huge number of vertices may have exactly the same score.\nThe third shortcoming is that in many applications, the distance between two\nvertices not only depends on the length of shortest paths, but also on the\nnumber of shortest paths. In this paper, first we develop a new distance\nmeasure between vertices of a graph that yields discriminative distance-based\ncentrality indices. This measure is proportional to the length of shortest\npaths and inversely proportional to the number of shortest paths. We present\nalgorithms for exact computation of the proposed discriminative indices.\nSecond, we develop randomized algorithms that precisely estimate average\ndiscriminative path length and average discriminative eccentricity and show\nthat they give $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-approximations of these indices. Third, we\nperform extensive experiments over several real-world networks from different\ndomains. In our experiments, we first show that compared to the traditional\nindices, discriminative indices have usually much more discriminability. Then,\nwe show that our randomized algorithms can very precisely estimate average\ndiscriminative path length and average discriminative eccentricity, using only\nfew samples. Then, we show that real-world networks have usually a tiny average\ndiscriminative path length, bounded by a constant (e.g., 2). Fourth, in order\nto better motivate the usefulness of our proposed distance measure, we present\na novel link prediction method, that uses discriminative distance to decide\nwhich vertices are more likely to form a link in future, and show its superior\nperformance compared to the well-known existing measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 00:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 16:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 11:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Furthermore,\nSchroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of\nthe explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility\nof superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed,\nSchroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of\ndiscrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different\nenergies.\n  However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave\nmechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full\nimplementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix\nformalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the\nidentification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of\nFock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a\nsum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock\nspace.\n  In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering\nmatrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the\nresolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution\ntherefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of\nquantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate\nthat discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take\ninto account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the\nrole of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of\nquantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually\nexpected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 01:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

If we define the context of the interaction to be the objects\ninvolved, then most current methods can be categorized as either: (i) training\na single classifier on the combination of the interaction and its context; or\n(ii) aiming to recognize the interaction independently of its explicit context.\nBoth methods suffer limitations: the former scales poorly with the number of\ncombinations and fails to generalize to unseen combinations, while the latter\noften leads to poor interaction recognition performance due to the difficulty\nof designing a context-independent interaction classifier. To mitigate those\ndrawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, context-aware interaction\nrecognition framework. The key to our method is to explicitly construct an\ninteraction classifier which combines the context, and the interaction. The\ncontext is encoded via word2vec into a semantic space, and is used to derive a\nclassification result for the interaction.\n  The proposed method still builds one classifier for one interaction (as per\ntype (ii) above), but the classifier built is adaptive to context via weights\nwhich are context dependent. The benefit of using the semantic space is that it\nnaturally leads to zero-shot generalizations in which semantically similar\ncontexts (subjectobject pairs) can be recognized as suitable contexts for an\ninteraction, even if they were not observed in the training set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 03:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 02:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 23:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

As for the modified gravity, we focus on Moffat's MSTG\ntheory. We fit these models to the observed rotation curves of 9 high-surface\nbrightness and 9 low-surface brightness galaxies. We apply the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to test the\ngoodness-of-fit of each model. It is found that non of the six models can well\nfit all the galaxy rotation curves. Two galaxies can be best fitted by the\nbaryonic model without involving the nonluminous dark matter. MOND can fit the\nlargest number of galaxies, and only one galaxy can be best fitted by MSTG\nmodel.

Pedestrian detection is a\nhighly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common\nscenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance\nis most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street\nor people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such \"in-the-tail\"\ndata is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing\ndifficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset\nof dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a\ndedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards\n(around 1000 images). To allow for large-scale data-driven learning, we explore\nthe use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge\nis selected the right \"priors\" or parameters for synthesis: we would like\nrealistic data with poses and object configurations that mimic true Precarious\nPedestrians. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we generate a\nmassive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to\nselect a realistic subset, which we deem the Adversarial Imposters. We\ndemonstrate that this simple pipeline allows one to synthesize realistic\ntraining data by making use of rendering/animation engines within a GAN\nframework. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to\nrank algorithms, suggesting that Adversarial Imposters can also be used for\n\"in-the-tail\" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for\nreal-world deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 10:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

We achieve this using Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs) that, during training, minimize the utterance-level separation\nerror, hence forcing separated frames belonging to the same speaker to be\naligned to the same output stream.

It consists of several interconnected,\nstructurally equivalent populations of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons,\nwhich are trained in a self-organized fashion with spike-timing dependent\nplasticity (STDP). Despite its robust learning dynamics, the model is\nsusceptible to a problem typical for recurrent networks which use a correlation\nbased (Hebbian) learning rule: if trained with high learning rates, the\nrecurrent connections can cause strong feedback loops in the network dynamics,\nwhich lead to the emergence of attractor states. This causes a strong reduction\nin the number of representable patterns and a decay in the inference ability of\nthe network. As a solution, we introduce a conceptually very simple\n\"wake-sleep\" algorithm: during the wake phase, training is executed normally,\nwhile during the sleep phase, the network \"dreams\" samples from its generative\nmodel, which are induced by random input. This process allows us to activate\nthe attractor states in the network, which can then be unlearned effectively by\nan anti-Hebbian mechanism. The algorithm allows us to increase learning rates\nup to a factor of ten while avoiding clustering, which allows the network to\nlearn several times faster. Also for low learning rates, where clustering is\nnot an issue, it improves convergence speed and reduces the final inference\nerror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 12:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

One of the key elements to gain effective\nsoftware defect prediction is proper selection of metrics used for dataset\npreparation. Objective: The purpose of this research is to verify, whether code\nsmells metrics, collected using Microsoft CodeAnalysis tool, added to basic\nmetric set, can improve defect prediction in industrial software development\nproject. Results: We verified, if dataset extension by the code smells sourced\nmetrics, change the effectiveness of the defect prediction by comparing\nprediction results for datasets with and without code smells-oriented metrics.\nIn a result, we observed only small improvement of effectiveness of defect\nprediction when dataset extended with bad smells metrics was used: average\naccuracy value increased by 0.0091 and stayed within the margin of error.\nHowever, when only use of code smells based metrics were used for prediction\n(without basic set of metrics), such process resulted with surprisingly high\naccuracy (0.8249) and F-measure (0.8286) results. We also elaborated data\nanomalies and problems we observed when two different metric sources were used\nto prepare one, consistent set of data.

As\napplications, we present first a general expression for a switching function\nthat may be of interest in electrical engineering and in the design of\nnonlinear time-series. We then introduce another general expression that allows\nwallpaper and frieze patterns for every possible planar symmetry group (besides\npatterns typical of quasicrystals) to be designed. We show how the fuzziness\nparameter $\\kappa$ plays an analogous role to temperature in physical\napplications and may be used to break the symmetry of spatial patterns. As a\nfurther, important application, we establish a theorem on the shaping of limit\ncycle oscillations far from bifurcations in smooth deterministic nonlinear\ndynamical systems governed by differential equations. Following this\napplication, we briefly discuss a generalization of the Stuart-Landau equation\nto non-sinusoidal oscillators obtained as a consequence of our theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 12:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 21:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

The hard axis assist has been provided to the\nsensing layer in the forms of spin Hall Effect (SHE) induced spin injected\ntorque and stress based effective magnetic field induced torque separately.\nPresent work mainly focuses on the efficient and qualitative detection of a\nsingle magnetic bead with the aim of detecting a single bimolecular recognition\nevent at an extremely low analyte concentration. Interfacial spin current\narising from spin orbit metal is expected to impose a torque on the free layer\nalong sensitive direction improving the signal strength by a factor of ~ 6.5\nfor a 100 nm bead at a height of 500 nm above the sensor surface. Furthermore,\nthe potentiality of a multiferroic composite consisting of a piezoelectric\nlayer coupled with magnetostrictive CoFeB based MTJ has been investigated in\nthe Biosensing applications. An external stress voltage of 500 mV has been\nobserved to be sufficient to enhance the sensitivity (~ 6 times). The use of\nnanoscaled spin devices and the absence of external magnetic field operated\nmagnetization rotation facilitates in achieving highly compact and extremely\nlow power designs. This establishes the possibility of utilizing the present\nschemes for advanced, highly sensitive, miniaturized and low power bioassaying\nsystem-on-chip applications. Numerical results were compared with some earlier\nreported experimental results to validate our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 08:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

The approach adopted in this paper is to use\nobservations of AI agents playing the game to estimate the game's quality. Some\nof best agents for this purpose are General Video Game AI agents, since they\ncan be deployed directly on a new game without game-specific tuning; these\nagents tend to be based on stochastic algorithms which give robust but noisy\nresults and tend to be expensive to run. This motivates the main contribution\nof the paper: the development of the novel N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary\nAlgorithm, where a model is used to estimate the fitness of unsampled points\nand a bandit approach is used to balance exploration and exploitation of the\nsearch space. Initial results on optimising a Space Battle game variant suggest\nthat the algorithm offers far more robust results than the Random Mutation Hill\nClimber and a Biased Mutation variant, which are themselves known to offer\ncompetitive performance across a range of problems. Subjective observations are\nalso given by human players on the nature of the evolved games, which indicate\na preference towards games generated by the N-Tuple algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 09:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}
