OW\nJ1753-3107 is the brightest of any of the currently known warm or hot DQ and\nwas discovered in the OmegaWhite Survey as exhibiting optical variations on a\nperiod of 35.5452 (2) mins, with no evidence for other periods in its light\ncurves. This period has remained constant over the last two years and a\nsingle-period sinusoidal model provides a good fit for all follow-up light\ncurves. The spectrum consists of a very blue continuum with strong absorption\nlines of neutral and ionised carbon, a broad He I 4471 A line, and possibly\nweaker hydrogen lines. The C I lines are Zeeman split, and indicate the\npresence of a strong magnetic field. Using spectral Paschen-Back model\ndescriptions, we determine that OW J1753-3107 exhibits the following physical\nparameters: T_eff = 15430 K, log(g) = 9.0, log(N(C)/N(He)) = -1.2, and the mean\nmagnetic field strength is B_z =2.1 MG. This relatively low temperature and\ncarbon abundance (compared to the expected properties of hot DQs) is similar to\nthat seen in the other warm DQ SDSS J1036+6522. Although OW J1753-3107 appears\nto be a twin of SDSS J1036+6522, it exhibits a modulation on a period slightly\nlonger than the dominant period in SDSS J1036+6522 and has a higher carbon\nabundance. The source of variations is uncertain, but they are believed to\noriginate from the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 16:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

MMSNRs comprise a class of sources whose shell-like radio\nmorphology contrasts with a filled center in X-rays; the origin of these\ncontrasting morphologies remains uncertain. Our CTIO images reveal enhanced [S\nII] emission relative to H-alpha along the northern and eastern rims of W28.\nHydroxyl (OH) masers are detected along these same rims, supporting prior\nstudies suggesting that W28 is interacting with molecular clouds at these\nlocations, as observed for several other MMSNRs. Our ROSAT HRI mosaic of W28\nprovides almost complete coverage of the SNR. The X-ray and radio emission is\ngenerally anti-correlated, except for the luminous northeastern rim, which is\nprominent in both bands. Our Chandra observation sampled the X-ray-luminous\ncentral diffuse emission. Spectra extracted from the bright central peak and\nfrom nearby annular regions are best fit with two over-ionized recombining\nplasma models. We also find that while the X-ray emission from the central peak\nis dominated by swept-up material, that from the surrounding regions shows\nevidence for oxygen-rich ejecta, suggesting that W28 was produced by a massive\nprogenitor. We also analyze the X-ray properties of two X-ray sources (CXOU\nJ175857.55-233400.3 and 3XMM J180058.5-232735) projected into the interior of\nW28 and conclude that neither is a neutron star associated with the SNR. The\nformer is likely to be a foreground cataclysmic variable or a quiescent\nlow-mass X-ray-binary while the latter is likely to be a coronally-active main\nsequence star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 16:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

CFT consistency conditions imply integral equations for the spectral\ndensities appearing in these decompositions, and we study the relevant integral\nkernels in detail. As a corollary, we find that both the boundary and crosscap\nkernels can be identified with special limits of the d=1 crossing kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 17:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 15:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

In $3$-dimension, Shi-Tam's result is known to be\nequivalent to the Riemannian positive mass theorem.\n  In this paper, we provide a supplement to Shi-Tam's result by including the\neffect of minimal hypersurfaces on the boundary. More precisely, given a\ncompact manifold $\\Omega$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, assuming its\nboundary consists of two parts, $\\Sigma_h$ and $\\Sigma_o$, where $\\Sigma_h$ is\nthe union of all closed minimal hypersurfaces in $\\Omega$ and $\\Sigma_o$ is\nisometric to a suitable $2$-convex hypersurface $\\Sigma$ in a spatial\nSchwarzschild manifold of positive mass $m$, we establish an inequality\nrelating $m$, the area of $\\Sigma_h$, and two weighted total mean curvatures of\n$\\Sigma_o$ and $ \\Sigma$.

We detect CO in 3 AGNs with\n$\\mathrm{L_{CO} \\sim 6.3-25.1\\times 10^{9} L_{\\odot}}$ which translates to a\nmolecular hydrogen gas mass of $\\mathrm{2.5-10\\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}}$\nassuming conventional conversion factor of $\\mathrm{\\alpha_{CO}}\\sim3.6$. Our\nresults indicate a >99% probability of lower depletion time scales and lower\nmolecular gas fractions in AGN hosts with respect to the non-AGN comparison\nsample. We discuss the implications of these observations on the impact that\nAGN feedback may have on star formation efficiency of z>1 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

The model is a variant of the Hawkes self-exciting process\nand exhibits similar clustering but without the restriction that the component\ndescribing the contagion must remain static over time. Instead, our proposed\nmodel prescribes that the degree of contagion (or productivity) changes as a\nfunction of the conditional intensity; of particular interest is the special\ncase where the productivity is inversely proportional to the conditional\nintensity. The model incorporates the premise that when the disease occurs at\nvery low frequency in the population, such as in the primary stages of an\noutbreak, then anyone with the disease is likely to have a high rate of\ntransmission to others, whereas when the disease is prevalent in the\npopulation, then the transmission rate is lower due to human mitigation actions\nand prevention measures and a relatively high percentage of previous exposure\nin the total population. The model is said to be recursive, in the sense that\nthe conditional intensity at any particular time depends on the productivity\nassociated with previous points, and this productivity in turn depends on the\nconditional intensity at those points.

In this paper, we show that the strength and character of Brillouin\ninteractions are radically altered at low temperatures when the phonon\ncoherence length surpasses the system size. In this limit, the solid becomes a\ncoherent optomechanical system with macroscopic (cm-scale) phonon modes\npossessing large ($60\\ \\mu \\rm{g}$) motional masses.

Due to its low cost,\nsampling via a random walk (RW) has been proposed as an attractive solution to\nthis task. Most RW methods assume either that the network is undirected or that\nwalkers can traverse edges regardless of their direction. Some RW methods have\nbeen designed for directed networks where edges coming into a node are not\ndirectly observable. In this work, we propose Directed Unbiased Frontier\nSampling (DUFS), a sampling method based on a large number of coordinated\nwalkers, each starting from a node chosen uniformly at random. It is applicable\nto directed networks with invisible incoming edges because it constructs, in\nreal-time, an undirected graph consistent with the walkers trajectories, and\ndue to the use of random jumps which prevent walkers from being trapped. DUFS\ngeneralizes previous RW methods and is suited for undirected networks and to\ndirected networks regardless of in-edges visibility. We also propose an\nimproved estimator of node label distributions that combines information from\nthe initial walker locations with subsequent RW observations. We evaluate DUFS,\ncompare it to other RW methods, investigate the impact of its parameters on\nestimation accuracy and provide practical guidelines for choosing them. In\nestimating out-degree distributions, DUFS yields significantly better estimates\nof the head of the distribution than other methods, while matching or exceeding\nestimation accuracy of the tail. Last, we show that DUFS outperforms uniform\nnode sampling when estimating distributions of node labels of the top 10%\nlargest degree nodes, even when sampling a node uniformly has the same cost as\nRW steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 23:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 20:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

However, in many applications, the feature signal of the targets\nconsists of sparse Fourier-domain signals. It changes quickly and nonlinearly\nin the time domain, and the feature measurements are corrupted by missed\ndetections and mis-associations. These two factors make it hard to extract the\nfeature information to be used in MTT. In this paper, we develop a\nfeature-aided nearest neighbour joint probabilistic data association filter\n(NN-JPDAF) for joint MTT and feature extraction in dense target environments.\nTo estimate the rapidly varying feature signal from incomplete and corrupted\nmeasurements, we use the atomic norm constraint to formulate the sparsity of\nfeature signal and use the $\\ell_1$-norm to formulate the sparsity of the\ncorruption induced by mis-associations. Based on the sparse representation, the\nfeature signal are estimated by solving a semidefinite program (SDP) which is\nconvex. We also provide an iterative method for solving this SDP via the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration\ninvolves closed-form computation. With the estimated feature signal,\nre-filtering is performed to estimate the kinematic states of the targets,\nwhere the association makes use of both kinematic and feature information.\nSimulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm in a radar application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 00:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

The\napproach uniquely combines an unsteady three-dimensional boundary element\nmethod, a boundary layer solver and self-propelled equations of motion. This\nnovel implementation allows for the self-propelled speed, power, efficiency and\neconomy to be accurately calculated. A Dirichlet formulation is used with a\ncombination of constant strength source and doublet elements to represent a\ndeforming body with a nonlinearly deforming wake. The wake elements are\ndesingularized to numerically stabilize the evolution of the wake vorticity.\nWeak coupling is used in solving the equations of motion and in the boundary\nlayer solution. The boundary layer solver models both laminar and turbulent\nbehavior along the deforming body to estimate the total skin friction drag\nacting on the body. The results from the method are validated with analytical\nsolutions, computations and experiments. Finally, a bio-inspired self-propelled\nundulatory fin is modeled. The computed self-propelled speeds and wake\nstructures agree well with previous experiments. The computations go beyond the\nexperiments to gain further insight into the propulsive efficiency for\nself-propelled undulating fins. It is found that the undulating fin produces a\ntime-averaged momentum jet at 76% of the span that accelerates fluid in the\nstreamwise direction and in turn generates thrust. Additionally, it is\ndiscovered that high amplitude motions suppress the formation of a bifurcating\nmomentum jet and instead form a single core jet. Consequently, this maximizes\nthe amount of streamwise momentum compared to the amount of wasted lateral\nmomentum and leads to a propulsive efficiency of 78% during self-propelled\nlocomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 01:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

The scalability of our approach to\nmulti-level hierarchies stems from the decoupling of low-level option discovery\nfrom high-level meta-control policy learning, facilitated by\nunder-parametrization of the high level.

An assumption about the running of the anomalous\ndimension of the quark bilinear operator is input and the model then predicts\nthe spectrum and decay constants for the mesons. We add NJL interactions\nresponsible for flavour physics from extended tecnhicolour, top-colour etc\nusing Witten's multi-trace prescription. We show the key behaviours of a top\ncondensation model can be reproduced. We study generation of the top mass in\n(walking) one doublet and one family technicolour models and with strong ETC\ninteractions. The models clearly reveal the tensions between the large top mass\nand precision data for delta rho. The neccessary tunings needed to generate a\nmodel compatible with precision constraints are simply demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 09:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

While\nin the standard method final-state constraints can be only approximately\nhandled by means of a terminal penalty, in this work we propose a methodology\nto meet the constraints exactly. Moreover, our method guarantees recursive\nfeasibility of the final-state constraint. This is an appealing property\nespecially in realtime applications in which one would like to be able to stop\nthe computation even if the desired tolerance has not been reached, but still\nsatisfy the constraints. Following the same conceptual idea of PRONTO, the\nproposed strategy is based on two main steps which (differently from the\nstandard scheme) preserve the feasibility of the final-state constraints: (i)\nsolve a quadratic approximation of the nonlinear problem to find a descent\ndirection, and (ii) get a (feasible) trajectory by means of a feedback law\n(which turns out to be a nonlinear projection operator). To find the (feasible)\ndescent direction we take advantage of final-state constrained Linear Quadratic\noptimal control methods, while the second step is performed by suitably\ndesigning a constrained version of the trajectory tracking projection operator.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested on the optimal state\ntransfer of an inverted pendulum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

Understanding the formation of\nmassive stars requires taking into account the accretion of angular momentum\nduring their PMS phase. We study the PMS evolution of objects destined to\nbecome massive stars by accretion, focusing on the links between the physical\nconditions of the environment and the rotational properties of young stars. In\nparticular, we look at the physical conditions that allow the production of\nmassive stars by accretion. We present PMS models computed with a new version\nof the Geneva Stellar Evolution code self-consistently including accretion and\nrotation according to various accretion scenarios for mass and angular\nmomentum. We describe the internal distribution of angular momentum in PMS\nstars accreting at high rates and we show how the various physical conditions\nimpact their internal structures, evolutionary tracks, and rotation velocities\nduring the PMS and the early main sequence. We find that the smooth angular\nmomentum accretion considered in previous studies leads to an angular momentum\nbarrier and does not allow the formation of massive stars by accretion. A\nbraking mechanism is needed in order to circumvent this angular momentum\nbarrier. This mechanism has to be efficient enough to remove more than 2/3 of\nthe angular momentum from the inner accretion disc. Due to the weak efficiency\nof angular momentum transport by shear instability and meridional circulation\nduring the accretion phase, the internal rotation profiles of accreting stars\nreflect essentially the angular momentum accretion history. As a consequence,\ncareful choice of the angular momentum accretion history allows circumvention\nof any limitation in mass and velocity, and production of stars of any mass and\nvelocity compatible with structure equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

These sources are capable of producing pairs of\nindistinguishable photons but typically suffer from an effective $50\\%$ loss.\nBy slightly decoupling the input waveguide from the ring, the drop port\ncoincidence ratio can be significantly increased with the trade-off being that\nthe pump is less efficiently coupled into the ring. Ring resonators with this\ndesign have been demonstrated having coincidence ratios of $\\sim 96\\%$ but\nrequiring a factor of $\\sim 10$ increase in the pump power. Through the\nmodification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral\ndependence, it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the\nincreased pumping requirement. This can be achieved by coupling the input\nwaveguide to the ring multiple times, thus creating a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer. This coupler design can be used on both sides of the ring\nresonator so that resonances supported by one of the couplers are suppressed by\nthe other. This is the ideal configuration for a photon-pair source as it can\nonly support the pump photons at the input side while only allowing the\ngenerated photons to leave through the output side. Recently, this device has\nbeen realized with preliminary results exhibiting the desired spectral\ndependence and with a coincidence ratio as high as $\\sim 97\\%$ while allowing\nthe pump to be nearly critically coupled to the ring.

Auto-scaling provides a popular paradigm for\nautomatically adjusting service capacity in response to demand while meeting\nperformance targets, and queue-driven auto-scaling techniques have been widely\ninvestigated in the literature. In typical data center architectures and cloud\nenvironments however, no centralized queue is maintained, and load balancing\nalgorithms immediately distribute incoming tasks among parallel queues. In\nthese distributed settings with vast numbers of servers, centralized\nqueue-driven auto-scaling techniques involve a substantial communication\noverhead and major implementation burden, or may not even be viable at all.\n  Motivated by the above issues, we propose a joint auto-scaling and load\nbalancing scheme which does not require any global queue length information or\nexplicit knowledge of system parameters, and yet provides provably near-optimal\nservice elasticity. We establish the fluid-level dynamics for the proposed\nscheme in a regime where the total traffic volume and nominal service capacity\ngrow large in proportion. The fluid-limit results show that the proposed scheme\nachieves asymptotic optimality in terms of user-perceived delay performance as\nwell as energy consumption. Specifically, we prove that both the waiting time\nof tasks and the relative energy portion consumed by idle servers vanish in the\nlimit. At the same time, the proposed scheme operates in a distributed fashion\nand involves only constant communication overhead per task, thus ensuring\nscalability in massive data center operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky\nWay (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain\ntheir origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that\ninteractions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs,\nresembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the\nkinematic and structural properties of dSphs. Using N-body+SPH simulations, we\ninvestigate the dependence of this transformation mechanism on the gas\nfraction, fgas, in the disk of the progenitor dwarf. Our numerical experiments\nincorporate for the first time the combined effects of radiative cooling,\nram-pressure stripping, star formation, supernova (SN) winds, and a cosmic UV\nbackground. For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported\ndwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (fgas >= 0.5),\ndemonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of\ntransformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (fgas = 0)\ncounterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN\nwinds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides,\naugmenting their transformation. When fgas >= 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously\nunfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to\ntransform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs\nretain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas,\nnaturally resembling transition-type systems.

In this paper, SM privacy is studied by considering the presence of a\nrenewable energy source (RES) and a rechargeable battery (RB), which can be\nused to partially hide the consumer's energy consumption behavior. Privacy is\nmeasured by the information leakage rate, which denotes the average mutual\ninformation between the user's real energy consumption and the energy requested\nfrom the grid, which the SM reads and reports to the UP. The impact of the\nknowledge of the amount of energy generated by the RES at the UP is also\nconsidered. The minimum information leakage rate is characterized as a\ncomputable information theoretic single-letter expression in the two extreme\ncases, that is, when the battery capacity is infinite or zero. Numerical\nresults are presented for the finite battery capacity case to illustrate the\npotential privacy gains from the existence of an RB.

This is well described by the\nphenomenological TLS model even though its microscopic explanation is still\nelusive. Here, by scaling down to the nanometer scale amorphous systems much\nbelow the bulk phonon-TLS mean free path, we probed the robustness of that\nmodel in restricted geometry systems.

This could be ascribed to an unexpected high density of TLS on the\nsurfaces which still dominates the phonon diffusion processes at low\ntemperatures and explains why the universal quadratic temperature dependence of\nthermal conductance still holds for amorphous nanowires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 12:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Using the SET as a sensitive detector, we found that the resonance\nfrequency could be tuned from 82 MHz to 100 MHz and the quality factor exceeded\n30000. The strong charge-mechanical coupling was demonstrated by observing the\nSET induced ~140 kHz resonance frequency shifts and mechanical damping. We also\nfound that the SET can enhance the nonlinearity of the resonator. Our\nSET-coupled graphene mechanical resonator could approach an ultra-sensitive\nmass resolution of ~0.55*10^(-21) g and a force sensitivity of ~1.9*10^(-19)\nN/(Hz)^(1/2), and can be further improved. These properties indicate that our\ndevice is a good platform both for fundamental physical studies and potential\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 13:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

In the press release of the Nobel committee it is\nclaimed that a hammock made of a squared meter of one-atom thick graphene could\nsustain the wight of a 4 kg cat. More practically important are applications of\ngraphene like scaffolds and sensors which are crucially dependent on the\nmechanical strength. Meter-sized graphene is even being considered for the\nlightsails in the starshot project to reach the star alpha centaury. The\npredicted strength of graphene is based on its very large Young modulus which\nis, per atomic layer, much larger than that of steel. This reasoning however\nwould apply to conventional thin plates but does not take into account the\npeculiar properties of graphene as a thermally fluctuating crystalline\nmembrane. It was shown recently both experimentally and theoretically that\nthermal fluctuations lead to a dramatic reduction of the Young modulus and\nincrease of the bending rigidity for micron-sized graphene samples in\ncomparison with atomic scale values. This makes the use of the standard\nF\\\"oppl-von Karman elasticity (FvK) theory for thin plates not directly\napplicable to graphene and other single atomic layer membranes. This fact is\nimportant because the current interpretation of experimental results is based\non the FvK theory. In particular, we show that the FvK-derived Schwerin\nequation, routinely used to derive the Young modulus from indentation\nexperiments has to be essentially modified for graphene at room temperature and\nfor micron sized samples. Based on scaling analysis and atomistic simulation we\ninvestigate the mechanics of graphene under transverse load up to breaking.

This\ndiscontinuous model is non-Filippov, and the concept of Filippov solution\ncannot be used. Furthermore some Carath\\'eodory solutions are unphysical.\nTherefore we introduce the concept of stiction solutions: these are the\nCarath\\'eodory solutions that are physically relevant, i.e. the ones that\nfollow the stiction law. However, we find that some of the stiction solutions\nare forward non-unique in subregions of the slip onset. We call these solutions\nsingular, in contrast to the regular stiction solutions that are forward\nunique. In order to further the understanding of the non-unique dynamics, we\nintroduce a regularization of the model. This gives a singularly perturbed\nproblem that captures the main features of the original discontinuous problem.\nWe identify a repelling slow manifold that separates the forward slipping to\nforward sticking solutions, leading to a high sensitivity to the initial\nconditions.

Moreover, the difficulty in parameter\nselection in the existing TS approach does not make it any more attractive.\nThis paper presents an alternative, low-complexity formulation of the TS\noptimization procedure for K-Means clustering. This approach does not require\nmany parameter settings. We initially constrain the centers to points in the\ndataset.

We have employed the Minkowski functionals to quantify\nsupercluster morphology. We calculate supercluster luminosities and masses\nusing two methods. Firstly, we used data about the luminosities and stellar\nmasses of high stellar mass galaxies with $\\log(M_*/h^{-1}M_\\odot) \\geq 11.3$.\nSecondly, we applied a scaling relation that combines morphological and\nphysical parameters of superclusters to obtain supercluster luminosities, and\nobtained supercluster masses using the mass-to-light ratios found for local\nrich superclusters. We find that the BGW superclusters are very elongated\nsystems, with shape parameter values of less than $0.2$. This value is lower\nthan that found for the most elongated local superclusters. The values of the\nfourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for the richer BGW superclusters ($V_3 = 7$\nand $10$) show that they have a complicated and rich inner structure. We\nidentify two Planck SZ clusters in the BGW superclusters, one in the richest\nBGW supercluster, and another in one of the poor BGW superclusters. The\nluminosities of the BGW superclusters are in the range of $1 -\n8\\times~10^{13}h^{-2}L_\\odot$, and masses in the range of $0.4 -\n2.1\\times~10^{16}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. Supercluster luminosities and masses obtained\nwith two methods agree well. We conclude that the BGW is a complex of massive,\nluminous and large superclusters with very elongated shape. The search and\ndetailed study, including the morphology analysis of the richest superclusters\nand their complexes from observations and simulations can help us to understand\nformation and evolution of the cosmic web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 15:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

To mitigate this gap, we propose\na new adversarial erasing approach for localizing and expanding object regions\nprogressively.

To further enhance\nthe quality of the discovered regions by adversarial erasing, an online\nprohibitive segmentation learning approach is developed to collaborate with\nadversarial erasing by providing auxiliary segmentation supervision modulated\nby the more reliable classification scores.

We examine the azimuthal\ncorrelations between the system and one of its particles. We point out that the\nperturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can\nlead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order\ndivergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross\nsection at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle\n$\\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark\npair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and\ndiboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass\nlepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.\nHowever, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the\ncomputation of QED radiative corrections. We specify general conditions that\nproduce the divergences by discussing their physical origin in fixed-order\ncomputations. We show lowest-order illustrative results for $\\cos(n\\varphi)$\nasymmetries (with $n=1,2,4,6$) in top-quark pair production and associated\nproduction of a vector boson and a jet at the LHC. The divergences are removed\nby a proper all-order resummation procedure of the perturbative contributions.\nResummation leads to azimuthal asymmetries that are finite and computable. We\npresent first quantitative results of such a resummed computation for the\n$\\cos(2\\varphi)$ asymmetry in top-quark pair production at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 15:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

To address this concern, a promising approach consists in\nconcatenating a speech enhancement and a speech recognition deep neural network\nand to jointly update their parameters as if they were within a single bigger\nnetwork.

A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on entities\nor distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. An epistemic formalism is developed, where concepts like\nindividual and collective knowledge are used, and knowledge may be actual or\npotential. The physical state $S$ corresponds to the collective potential\nknowledge. The state $S$ is a subset of a state space $\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such\nthat $S$ always contains several elements $Z$, which correspond to unattainable\nstates of complete potential knowledge of the world. The evolution of $S$\ncannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution of the elements $Z$,\nunlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase space. The evolution of\n$S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in \\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which\nis updated according to $n\\rightarrow n+1$ each time potential knowledge\nchanges. In certain experimental contexts $C$, there is initial knowledge at\ntime $n$ that a given series of properties $P,P',\\ldots$ will be observed\nwithin a given time frame, meaning that a series of values $p,p',\\ldots$ of\nthese properties will become known.

Ranging from environmental issues\nto biomedical applications, it has the potential to address many of today's\ndire problems. However, an understanding of the mechanism of transformation\nbetween carbon allotropes at a microscopic level is crucial for its development\ninto highly desirable materials. In this work we report such a phase\ntransformation between two carbon allotropes, from penta-graphene (a\nsemiconductor) into biphenylene (a metal) under uniaxial loading. Using density\nfunctional theory we demonstrated that the phase transformation occurs through\na synchronized reorganization of the carbon atoms with a simultaneous drop in\nenergy. The results of this work confirms that penta-graphene is a meta-stable\nstructure. On the other hand, a rigorous analysis of biphenylene suggests that\nit is an energetically, mechanically, dynamically and thermally stable\nstructure, both in the form of a sheet and a tube. Its electronic structure\nsuggests that it is metallic in both these forms. Therefore, this work unravels\nthe possibility of phase transition in 2-D carbon systems and thereby designing\nnano-materials capable of altering their properties in an instant. Furthermore,\nheating biphenylene sheet at a high temperature (5000K) revealed another phase\ntransformation into a more stable hexa-graphene like structure.

Often caused by the cameras limited\ncapabilities, it is common for these captured facial images to be blurred or\nlow resolution. Super resolution algorithms are therefore crucial in improving\nthe resolution of such images especially when the image size is small requiring\nenlargement. This paper aims to demonstrate the effect of one of the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in the field of image super resolution. To\ndemonstrate the functionality of the algorithm, various before and after 3D\nface alignment cases are provided using the images from the Labeled Faces in\nthe Wild (lfw). Resulting images are subject to testing on a closed set face\nrecognition protocol using unsupervised algorithms with high dimension\nextracted features.

The flow of\ncharge carriers in vdW heterostructures can be efficiently rectified by the\ninter-layer coupling between neighboring layers, offering a rich collection of\nfunctionalities and a mechanism for designing atomically thin devices.\nNevertheless, non-uniform contact in larger-area heterostructures reduces the\ndevice efficiency. In this work, ion irradiation had been verified as an\nefficient technique to enhance the contact and interlayer coupling in the newly\ndeveloped graphene/WSe2 hetero-structure with a large area of 10 mm x 10 mm.\nDuring the ion irradiation process, the morphology of monolayer graphene had\nbeen modified, promoting the contact with WSe2. Experimental evidences of the\ntunable interlayer electron transfer are displayed by investigation of\nphotoluminescence and ultrafast absorption of the irradiated heterostructure.\nBesides, we have found that in graphene/WSe2 heterostructure, graphene serves\nas a fast channel for the photo-excited carriers to relax in WSe2, and the\nnonlinear absorption of WSe2 could be effectively tuned by the carrier transfer\nprocess in graphene, enabling specific optical absorption of the\nheterostructure in comparison with separated graphene or WSe2. On the basis of\nthese new findings, by applying the ion beam modified graphene/WSe2\nheterostructure as a saturable absorber, Q-switched pulsed lasing with\noptimized performance has been realized in a Nd:YAG waveguide cavity. This work\npaves the way towards developing novel devices based on large-area\nheterostructures by using ion beam irradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

The relative intensity of the two peaks evolves in a peculiar way\nwith injected current. Spatially and spectrally resolved EL maps confirmed the\npresence of two main transitions in the spectra, and suggested that they are\nemitted by the majority of single nano-LEDs. In order to elucidate the physical\norigin of this effect, we performed theoretical calculations of the strain,\nelectric field, and charge density distributions both for planar LEDs and\nNW-LEDs. On this basis, we simulated also the EL spectra of these devices,\nwhich exhibit a double peak structure for N-polar heterostructures, both in the\nNW and the planar case. In contrast, this feature is not observed when Ga-polar\nplanar LEDs are simulated. We found that the physical origin of the double peak\nstructure is a stronger quantum-confined Stark effect occurring in the first\nand last quantum well of the N-polar heterostructures. The peculiar evolution\nof the relative peak intensities with injected current, seen only in the case\nof the NW-LED, is attributed to the three-dimensional strain variation\nresulting from elastic relaxation at the free sidewalls of the NWs. Therefore,\nthis study provides important insights on the working principle of N-polar LEDs\nbased on both planar and NW heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 19:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}
