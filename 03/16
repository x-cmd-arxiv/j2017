Our results are homogeneously\ncompared with a previous work using the same methodology applied to a sample of\nSeyfert 2 (Hernandez-Garcia et al. 2015). X-ray variability is found in all 15\nnuclei over the aforementioned ranges of timescales. The main variability\npattern is related to intrinsic changes in the sources, which are observed in\nten nuclei. Changes in the column density are also frequent, as they are\nobserved in six nuclei, and variations at soft energies, possibly related to\nscattered nuclear emission, are detected in six sources. X-ray intraday\nvariations are detected in six out of the eight studied sources. Variations at\nUV frequencies are detected in seven out of nine sources. A comparison between\nthe samples of Seyfert 1.8/1.9 and 2 shows that, even if the main variability\npattern is due to intrinsic changes of the sources in the two families, these\nnuclei exhibit different variability properties in the UV and X-ray domains. In\nparticular, variations in the broad X-ray band on short time-scales\n(days/weeks), and variations in the soft X-rays and UV on long time-scales\n(months/years) are detected in Seyfert 1.8/1.9 but not in Seyfert 2.

To the leading order in the charge-vibration interaction,\nwe calculate the current and the nonequilibrium phonon occupation by the\nKeldsyh Green's function technique. We analyze the inelastic,\nvibration-assisted tunneling processes in the regime $\\omega <\\Delta$, with the\nsuperconducting energy gap $\\Delta$, and for sharp resonant transmission\nthrough the dot. When the energy $\\varepsilon_0$ of the dot's level is close to\nthe Fermi energy $\\mu$, i.e. $|\\varepsilon_0-\\mu|\\ll \\Delta$, inelastic Andreev\nreflections dominate up to voltage $eV\\gtrsim\\Delta$. The inelastic\nquasiparticle tunneling becomes the leading process when the dot's level is\nclose to the gap $|\\varepsilon_0-\\mu|\\sim \\Delta \\pm \\omega$. In both cases,\nthe inelastic tunneling processes appear as sharp and prominent peaks - not\nbroadened by temperature - in the $I$-$V$ characteristic and pave the way for\ninelastic spectroscopy of vibrational modes even at temperatures $T \\gg\n\\omega$. We also found that inelastic Andreev reflections as well as\nquasiparticle tunneling induce a strong nonequilibrium state of the oscillator.\nIn different ranges on the dot's level, we found that the current produces: (i)\nground-state cooling of the oscillator with phonon occupation $n\\ll 1$, (ii)\naccumulation of energy in the oscillator with $n\\gg 1$ and (iii) a mechanical\ninstability which is a precursor of self-sustained oscillations. We show that\nground-state cooling is achieved simultaneously for several modes of different\nfrequencies. Finally, we discuss how the nonequilibrium vibrational state can\nbe detected by the asymmetric behavior of the inelastic current peaks respect\nto the gate voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 17:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

There are two key\nnovelties. First, starting with a large database of deep Spitzer 24{\\mu}m and\nVLA 20cm detections that are used to define prior positions for fitting the\nFIR/submm data, we perform an active selection of useful priors independently\nat each frequency band, moving from less to more confused bands. Exploiting\nknowledge of redshift and all available photometry, we identify hopelessly\nfaint priors that we remove from the fitting pool. This approach significantly\nreduces blending degeneracies and allows reliable photometry to be obtained for\ngalaxies in FIR+mm bands. Second, we obtain well-behaved, nearly Gaussian flux\ndensity uncertainties, individually tailored to all fitted priors in each band.\nThis is done by exploiting extensive simulations that allow us to calibrate the\nconversion of formal fitting uncertainties to realistic uncertainties depending\non quantities directly measurable. We achieve deeper detection limits with high\nfidelity measurements and uncertainties at FIR+mm bands. As an illustration of\nthe utility of these measurements, we identify 70 galaxies with z>3 and\nreliable FIR+mm detections.

Despite the success, the\nserving time is still the bottleneck due to expensive run-time computation of\nmultiple layers of dense matrices. GPGPU, FPGA, or ASIC-based serving systems\nrequire additional hardware that are not in the mainstream design of most\ncommercial applications. In contrast, tree or forest-based models are widely\nadopted because of low serving cost, but heavily depend on carefully engineered\nfeatures. This work proposes a Deep Embedding Forest model that benefits from\nthe best of both worlds. The model consists of a number of embedding layers and\na forest/tree layer. The former maps high dimensional (hundreds of thousands to\nmillions) and heterogeneous low-level features to the lower dimensional\n(thousands) vectors, and the latter ensures fast serving.\n  Built on top of a representative DNN model called Deep Crossing, and two\nforest/tree-based models including XGBoost and LightGBM, a two-step Deep\nEmbedding Forest algorithm is demonstrated to achieve on-par or slightly better\nperformance as compared with the DNN counterpart, with only a fraction of\nserving time on conventional hardware. After comparing with a joint\noptimization algorithm called partial fuzzification, also proposed in this\npaper, it is concluded that the two-step Deep Embedding Forest has achieved\nnear optimal performance.

In the\npresent work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large\nprogram with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical\nsample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar\ncompanions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat\ndistributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the\nsub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7% at the 68% confidence\nlevel (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 $M_{Jup}$, which is compatible with\npreviously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions\nof state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational\ninstability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan & Rice (2013), with and without\nscattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered\npopulations, we would be able to detect more than 30% of companions in the 1-75\n$M_{Jup}$ range (95% CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we\nestimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be\nwithin 1.0-8.6% (95% CL).

The idea at the heart of our hybrid scheme --- based on a\nreformulation of $E^{(2)}$ as a sum of elementary contributions associated with\neach determinant of the MR wave function --- is to split $E^{(2)}$ into a\nstochastic and a deterministic part. During the simulation, the stochastic part\nis gradually reduced by dynamically increasing the deterministic part until one\nreaches the desired accuracy. In sharp contrast with a purely stochastic MC\nscheme where the error decreases indefinitely as $t^{-1/2}$ (where $t$ is the\ncomputational time), the statistical error in our hybrid algorithm displays a\npolynomial decay $\\sim t^{-n}$ with $n=3-4$ in the examples considered here.

In particular, real flat\nETFs are equivalent to self-complementary binary codes that achieve the\nGrey-Rankin bound.

In this paper, we evaluate deep learning models using\nthree different computing architectures to address these problems: quantum\ncomputing to train complex topologies, high performance computing (HPC) to\nautomatically determine network topology, and neuromorphic computing for a\nlow-power hardware implementation. We use the MNIST dataset for our experiment,\ndue to input size limitations of current quantum computers. Our results show\nthe feasibility of using the three architectures in tandem to address the above\ndeep learning limitations. We show a quantum computer can find high quality\nvalues of intra-layer connections weights, in a tractable time as the\ncomplexity of the network increases; a high performance computer can find\noptimal layer-based topologies; and a neuromorphic computer can represent the\ncomplex topology and weights derived from the other architectures in low power\nmemristive hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 19:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 18:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

First of all, the whole system concept\nconsisting of a 3D vision system, an UR10 robot and a charging station is\npresented. Then we show the shape-based matching methods used to successfully\nidentify and get the exact pose of the charging port. The same approach is used\nto calibrate the camera-robot system by using just known structure of the\nconnector plug and no additional markers. Finally, a three-step robot motion\nplanning procedure for plug-in is presented and functionality is demonstrated\nin a series of successful experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 20:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

Low mass stars are currently the best targets for searches for rocky\nplanets in the habitable zone of their host star.

We are working to extend this\nplanetary sample to lower masses and longer periods through dense and long-term\nmonitoring of the radial velocity of a small M dwarf sample. Methods. We\nobtained large numbers of HARPS spectra for the M dwarfs GJ 3138, GJ 3323, GJ\n273, GJ 628 and GJ 3293, from which we derived radial velocities (RVs) and\nspectroscopic activity indicators.

In the considered game, not only each player's local objective\nfunction depends on other players' decisions, but also the feasible decision\nsets of all the players are coupled together with a globally shared affine\ninequality constraint. Adopting the variational GNE, that is the solution of a\nvariational inequality, as a refinement of GNE, we introduce a primal-dual\nalgorithm that players can use to seek it in a distributed manner. Each player\nonly needs to know its local objective function, local feasible set, and a\nlocal block of the affine constraint. Meanwhile, each player only needs to\nobserve the decisions on which its local objective function explicitly depends\nthrough the interference graph and share information related to multipliers\nwith its neighbors through a multiplier graph. Through a primal-dual analysis\nand an augmentation of variables, we reformulate the problem as finding the\nzeros of a sum of monotone operators. Our distributed primal-dual algorithm is\nbased on forward-backward operator splitting methods. We prove its convergence\nto the variational GNE for fixed step-sizes under some mild assumptions. Then a\ndistributed algorithm with inertia is also introduced and analyzed for\nvariational GNE seeking. Finally, numerical simulations for network Cournot\ncompetition are given to illustrate the algorithm efficiency and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 21:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Key\ncomplementary insights are provided from analysis of the graphene and MoSe$_2$\nRaman modes, which reveals net photoinduced electron transfer from MoSe$_2$ to\ngraphene and hole accumulation in MoSe$_2$. Remarkably, the steady state Fermi\nenergy of graphene saturates at $290\\pm 15~\\tr{meV}$ above the Dirac point.\nThis behavior is observed both in ambient air and in vacuum and is discussed in\nterms of band offsets and environmental effects.

In particular, to\nenable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices with a minimum total\ntransmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the\nthree-dimensional (3D) placement and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV\nassociation, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active IoT\ndevices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are\ndetermined. Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying\nnetwork, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end,\nbased on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time instances at which\nthe UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D\ntrajectory of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the\nmobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the IoT devices. Simulation\nresults show that, using the proposed approach, the total transmit power of the\nIoT devices is reduced by 45% compared to a case in which stationary aerial\nbase stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a\nmaximum of 28% enhanced system reliability compared to the stationary case. The\nresults also reveal an inherent tradeoff between the number of update times,\nthe mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the IoT devices. In\nessence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the\nIoT devices at the cost of an increased mobility for the UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 21:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 16:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In this note, we\ndescribe an approach to calculating quantum corrections to the decay rate of\nfalse vacua that is able to account fully and self-consistently for the\nunderlying inhomogeneity of the solitonic tunneling configuration. We show that\nthis method can be applied both to theories in which the instability arises\nalready at the level of the classical potential and those in which the\ninstability arises entirely through radiative effects, as is the case for the\nSM Higgs vacuum. We analyse two simple models in the thin-wall regime, and we\nshow that the modifications of the one-loop corrections from accounting fully\nfor the inhomogeneity can compete at the same level as the two-loop homogeneous\ncorrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

In this paper, we study this problem in the Centralized Local model,\nwhere the goal is to decide whether an edge is part of the spanning subgraph by\nexamining only a small part of the input; yet, answers must be globally\nconsistent and independent of prior queries.\n  Unfortunately, maximally sparse spanning subgraphs, i.e., spanning trees,\ncannot be constructed efficiently in this model. Therefore, we settle for a\nspanning subgraph containing at most $(1+\\varepsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices and $\\varepsilon$ is a given approximation/sparsity\nparameter). We achieve query complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(poly(\\Delta/\\varepsilon)n^{2/3})$, ($\\tilde{O}$-notation hides\npolylogarithmic factors in $n$). where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the\ninput graph.

Maintaining causal consistency in\ndistributed shared memory systems has received significant attention in the\npast, mostly on {\\em full replication} wherein each replica stores a copy of\nall the registers in the shared memory. To ensure causal consistency, all\ncausally preceding updates must be performed before an update is performed at\nany given replica. Therefore, some mechanism for tracking causal dependencies\nis required, such as vector timestamps with the number of vector elements being\nequal to the number of replicas in the context of full replication. In this\npaper, we investigate causal consistency in {\\em partially replicated systems},\nwherein each replica may store only a subset of the shared registers. Building\non the past work, this paper makes three key contributions: 1. We present a\nnecessary condition on the metadata (which we refer as a {\\em timestamp}) that\nmust be maintained by each replica to be able to track causality accurately.\nThe necessary condition identifies a set of directed edges in a {\\em share\ngraph} that a replica's timestamp must keep track of. 2. We present an\nalgorithm for achieving causal consistency using a timestamp that matches the\nabove necessary condition, thus showing that the condition is necessary and\nsufficient. 3. We define a measurement of timestamp space size and present a\nlower bound (in bits) on the size of the timestamps. The lower bound matches\nour algorithm in several special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:34:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 May 2018 07:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 05:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

A massless Dirac fermion generates new symmetries\ncorresponding to chirality spin and charge spin as well as conformal scaling\ntransformations. With the introduction of intrinsic W-parity, a massless Dirac\nfermion can be treated as a Majorana-type or Weyl-type spinor in a\nsix-dimensional spacetime that reflects the intrinsic quantum numbers of\nchirality spin. A generalized Dirac equation is obtained in the six-dimensional\nspacetime with a maximal symmetry. Based on the framework of gravitational\nquantum field theory proposed in Ref. \\cite{YLWU} with the postulate of gauge\ninvariance and coordinate independence, we arrive at a maximally symmetric\ngravitational gauge field theory for the massless Dirac fermion in\nsix-dimensional spacetime. Such a theory is governed by the local spin gauge\nsymmetry SP(1,5) and the global Poincar\\'e symmetry P(1,5)= SO(1,5)$\\ltimes\nP^{1,5} $ as well as the charge spin gauge symmetry SU(2). The theory leads to\nthe prediction of doubly electrically charged bosons. A scalar field and\nconformal scaling gauge field are introduced to maintain both global and local\nconformal scaling symmetries. A generalized gravitational Dirac equation for\nthe massless Dirac fermion is derived in the six-dimensional spacetime. The\nequations of motion for gauge fields are obtained with conserved currents in\nthe presence of gravitational effects. The dynamics of the gauge-type\ngravifield as a Goldstone-like boson is shown to be governed by a conserved\nenergy-momentum tensor, and its symmetric part provides a generalized Einstein\nequation of gravity. An alternative geometrical symmetry breaking mechanism for\nthe mass generation of Dirac fermions is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 00:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 10:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

To tackle these problems, in this work, we exploit general\ncorpus information to automatically select and subsequently classify web images\ninto semantic rich (sub-)categories. The following two major challenges are\nwell studied: 1) noise in the labels of subcategories derived from the general\ncorpus; 2) noise in the labels of images retrieved from the web.

The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below\npion-production threshold of the year of 2016.\n  The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world NN data with\nthe outstanding chi^2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever\naccomplished for any chiral NN potential to date. The NN potentials presented\nmay serve as a solid basis for systematic ab initio calculations of nuclear\nstructure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In\nparticular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will\nmake possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order.\nOur family of potentials is non-local and, generally, of soft character. This\nfeature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding\nenergy (from two-body forces only) converges to about 8.1 MeV at the highest\norders. This leaves room for three-nucleon-force contributions of moderate\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 02:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 19:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

In general, these algorithms require a high\ncomputational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the major challenges\nin phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal likelihood. This quantity is\ncommonly used for comparing different evolutionary models, but its calculation,\neven for simple models, incurs high computational cost. Another interesting\nchallenge relates to the estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long\nMarkov chains are required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter\ninference, especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are\naddressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS) is a\nBayesian computation algorithm which provides the means to estimate marginal\nlikelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to sample from the posterior\ndistribution at no extra cost. The methods currently used in phylogenetics for\nmarginal likelihood estimation lack in practicality due to their dependence on\nmany tuning parameters and the inability of most implementations to provide a\ndirect way to calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates. To\naddress these issues, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is\nassessed under different scenarios and compared to established methods.

This problem arises in many\nreal-world applications related to query processing or pattern recognition such\nas computer vision, social network analysis, bioinformatic and big data\nanalytic. Subgraph isomorphism search knows a lot of investigations and\nsolutions mainly because of its importance and use but also because of its\nNP-completeness.

In contrast to the\nsimplicity of the statement, the method was surprisingly difficult. This\ndependency motivated further research for positivity of (quasi-)rational\nfunctions. More and more (quasi-)rational functions have been proven to be\npositive, and some of the proofs are even quite simple. However, there are also\nothers whose positivity are still open conjectures.

The conversion efficiency of laser pulse energy into bremsstrahlung\nradiation depends strongly on both the intensity and duration of the pulse,\nsaturating at values of about 10e-5. Depending on whether the intensity is\nabove or below the damage threshold of the material, the emission can originate\neither from the surface or the bulk of the dielectric respectively. The\nbremsstrahlung emission may provide a broadband light source for diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 12:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

An equivalent\ndescription is given by factorisations in the symmetric group. Simple double\nHurwitz numbers are a class of Hurwitz-type counts of specific interest. In\nrecent years a related counting problem in the context of random matrix theory\nwas introduced as so-called monotone Hurwitz numbers. These can be viewed as a\ndesymmetrised version of the Hurwitz-problem. A combinatorial interpolation\nbetween simple and monotone double Hurwitz numbers was introduced as mixed\ndouble Hurwitz numbers and it was proved that these objects are piecewise\npolynomial in a certain sense.

However, these can neither cope well with the geometric\ndistortion between sketches and images nor be feasible for large-scale SBIR due\nto the heavy continuous-valued distance computation.

Specifically, three\nconvolutional neural networks are utilized to encode free-hand sketches,\nnatural images and, especially, the auxiliary sketch-tokens which are adopted\nas bridges to mitigate the sketch-image geometric distortion.

When the probability density of the noise\nand the prior are Gaussian, the solution of such a statistical inverse problem\nis also Gaussian. Therefore, the underlying solution is characterized by the\nmean and covariance matrix of the posterior probability density. However, the\ncovariance matrix of the posterior probability density is full and large.\nHence, the computation of such a matrix is impossible for large dimensional\nparameter spaces. It is shown that for many ill-posed problems, the Hessian\nmatrix of the data misfit part has low numerical rank and it is therefore\npossible to perform a low-rank approach to approximate the posterior covariance\nmatrix. For such a low-rank approximation, one needs to solve a forward partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) and the adjoint PDE in both space and time. This in\nturn gives $\\mathcal{O}(n_x n_t)$ complexity for both, computation and storage,\nwhere $n_x$ is the dimension of the spatial domain and $n_t$ is the dimension\nof the time domain. Such computations and storage demand are infeasible for\nlarge problems. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a new approach that\nutilizes a recently developed low-rank in time algorithm together with the\nlow-rank Hessian method.

The skeleton aims to preserve\nthe search order heuristic by distributing work in an ordered fashion, closely\nfollowing the sequential search order. We demonstrate the generality of the\napproach by applying the skeleton to 40 instances of three combinatorial\nproblems: Maximum Clique, 0/1 Knapsack and Travelling Salesperson. The\noverheads of our Haskell skeleton are reasonable: giving slowdown factors of\nbetween 1.9 and 6.2 compared with a class-leading, dedicated, and highly\noptimised C++ Maximum Clique solver. We demonstrate scaling up to 200 cores of\na Beowulf cluster, achieving speedups of 100x for several Maximum Clique\ninstances. We demonstrate low variance of parallel performance across all\ninstances of the three combinatorial problems and at all scales up to 200\ncores, with median Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) below 2%. Parallel solvers\nthat do not follow the sequential search order exhibit far higher variance,\nwith median RSD exceeding 85% for Knapsack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 14:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 14:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Using one-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations that\nfollow the field line geometry, we find that for plausibly realistic young\nstars, steady-state transonic accretion occurs naturally in the absence of any\nother source of variability. However, we show that if the density in the inner\ndisk varies smoothly in time with ~ day long time-scales (e.g., due to\nturbulence) this complication can lead to the development of shocks in the\naccretion column. These shocks propagate along the accretion column and\nultimately hit the star, leading to rapid, large amplitude changes in the\naccretion rate.

One critical\nstage of the \\textit{offline} portion of the algorithm is a greedy algorithm,\nrequiring maximization of an error estimate over parameter space. In practice\nthis maximization is usually performed by replacing the parameter domain\ncontinuum with a discrete \"training\" set. When the dimension of parameter space\nis large, it is necessary to significantly increase the size of this training\nset in order to effectively search parameter space. Large training sets\ndiminish the attractiveness of RBM algorithms since this proportionally\nincreases the cost of the offline {phase}.\n  In this work we propose novel strategies for offline RBM algorithms that\nmitigate the computational difficulty of maximizing error estimates over a\ntraining set. The main idea is to identify a subset of the training set, a\n\"surrogate parameter domain\" (SPD), on which to perform greedy algorithms. The\nSPD's we construct are much smaller in size than the full training set, yet our\nexamples suggest that they are accurate enough to represent the solution\nmanifold of interest at the current offline RBM iteration. We propose two\nalgorithms to construct the SPD: Our first algorithm, the Successive\nMaximization Method (SMM) method, is inspired by inverse transform sampling for\nnon-standard univariate probability distributions. The second constructs an SPD\nby identifying pivots in the Cholesky Decomposition of an approximate error\ncorrelation matrix. We demonstrate the algorithm through numerical experiments,\nshowing that the algorithm is capable of accelerating offline RBM procedures\nwithout degrading accuracy, assuming that the solution manifold has low\nKolmogorov width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 15:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

The extension is impelled\nby the need to simulate fracture hampering (acceleration) when it penetrates\ninto a layer with increased (decreased) rock pressure. The paper presents the\nproblem formulation, an efficient numerical method for its solving, examples of\nfractures propagating through layers with various stresses and general\nconclusions. It is established that when the fracture enters a layer with\nincreased rock stresses (positive stress contrast), it actually stops. In this\ncase, the fluid particle velocity drops practically to zero and the velocity\nnear the tip oscillates about a small value until the fluid pressure increases\nto the level of the increased rock pressure. In the opposite case, when the\nfracture enters a layer with decreased stresses (negative stress contrast), the\nfracture front accelerates until the fluid pressure drops to the level of the\ndecreased rock pressure. Physical considerations and numerical results imply\nthat the transition through a boundary of layers with different stresses may be\ncharacterized by a simple dimensionless parameter. The latter is defined as the\nratio of the average difference between the fluid and rock pressures (at the\nmoment of reaching the contact) to the stress jump at the contact. The\nparameter is applicable to contacts with positive as well as negative\ncontrasts. The model and the method developed are to serve for improvement of\nthe popular pseudo three-dimensional (P3D) model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 15:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

For dust and perfect fluids, we evaluate exact\nsolutions and construct their cosmological analysis through some cosmological\nparameters. We conclude that decelerated expansion is obtained for quintessence\nmodel with dust distribution while perfect fluid with dominating potential\nenergy over kinetic energy leads to current cosmic expansion for both phantom\nas well as quintessence models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 07:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

In\ncurrent FPM imaging platforms, systematic error sources come from the\naberrations, LED intensity fluctuation, parameter imperfections and noise,\nwhich will severely corrupt the reconstruction results with artifacts. Although\nthese problems have been researched and some special methods have been proposed\nrespectively, there is no method to solve all of them. However, the systematic\nerror is a mixture of various sources in the real situation. It is difficult to\ndistinguish a kind of error source from another due to the similar artifacts.\nTo this end, we report a system calibration procedure, termed SC-FPM, based on\nthe simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, LED intensity correction and adaptive\nstep-size strategy, which involves the evaluation of an error matric at each\niteration step, followed by the re-estimation of accurate parameters. The great\nperformance has been achieved both in simulation and experiments. The reported\nsystem calibration scheme improves the robustness of FPM and relaxes the\nexperiment conditions, which makes the FPM more pragmatic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 07:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

The algorithm consists of iterative, superposed\noperations on a single grid, and it is composed of two simple full-grid\nroutines: a restriction and a coarsened interpolation-relaxation. The\nrestriction is used to collect sources using recursive coarsened averages, and\nthe interpolation-relaxation simultaneously applies coarsened finite-difference\noperators and interpolations. The routines are scheduled in a saw-like refining\ncycle. Convergence to machine precision is achieved repeating the full cycle\nusing accumulated residuals and successively collecting the solution. Its total\nnumber of operations scale linearly with the number of nodes. It provides an\nattractive fast solver for Boundary Value Problems (BVPs), specially for\nsimulations running entirely in the GPU.

The latter is essentially accomplished via two toroidal structures\npresumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent\nkey-properties as follows: First, in each \"Torus\" a surplus charge is entrapped\nfor the time period of an 11-year sunspot cycle; for the next cycle the charge\nchanges sign. Second, the net charge of Torus, moving with the solar rotational\nspeed (U), generates a huge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up an\nintense poloidal magnetic field. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific\ndistance from the Radiative Zone, so that the U of an entrapped charge carrier\nequals the local propagation velocity for an electromagnetic disturbance (v).\nThus, two Torus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive\nelectrostatic force equals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two\nelementary currents. Fourth, the surplus charge steadily increases; electrons\nare systematically attracted inwards or repealed outwards via the poloidal\nfield. The charges remain without any \"Debye shielding\" action in the\nTorus-core region, while they demonstrate a \"Debye anti-shielding effect\"\ncloser to the Radiative Zone. Thus, the Torus charge \"moves\" with zero\nresistivity and rotational speed U; the Torus core region behaves like a\ngigantic superconductor at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline.\nFifth, the tori move equatorward drifting on a surface being an ellipsoid by\nrevolution on which the condition U=v is satisfied. Moreover, we present a\npreliminary 3D solar circuit with the ability to reverse the magnetic field in\neach 22-year cycle. Finally, we discuss many longstanding unresolved questions\nin the context of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 20:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

It\nrequires two empty squares per possible winning line (group) to be marked,\ni.e., with a coverage ratio of 2.0. In this paper we present a new strategy,\ncalled Set Matching. A matching set consists of a set of nodes (the markers), a\nset of possible winning lines (the groups), and a coverage set indicating how\nall groups are covered after every first initial move. This strategy needs less\nthan two markers per group. As such it is able to prove positions in k-in-a-Row\ngames to be draws, which cannot be proven using the Hales-Jewett pairing\nstrategy. We show several efficient configurations with their matching sets.\nThese include Cycle Configurations, BiCycle Configurations, and PolyCycle\nConfigurations involving more than two cycles. Depending on configuration, the\ncoverage ratio can be reduced to 1.14.
