In the present work, three-dimensional settling process is\ninvestigated numerically by using CFD--DEM (Computational Fluid\nDynamics--Discrete Element Method). The inter-particle collision force, the van\nder Waals force, and the fluid--particle interaction forces are considered. The\nnumerical model is used to simulate the hindered settling process of silt based\non the experimental setup in the literature. The results obtained in the\nsimulations, including the structural densities of the beds, the characteristic\nlines, and the particle terminal velocity, are in good agreement with the\nexperimental observations in the literature.

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to\nsimulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by\naccumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$. We find that Earth-like planets orbiting a\nSun-like star may never be able to escape from glaciation if their orbital\ndistance is greater than $\\sim$ 1.27 AU (Flux $<$ 847 W m$^{-2}$ or 62$\\%$ of\nthe Solar constant), because CO$_2$ would condense at the poles forming\npermanent CO$_2$ ice caps. This limits the amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere\nand thus its greenhouse effect. The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the\npolar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as\nits graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$\nice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and\nhence by the internal heat flux. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet\nlocated at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5/4.5/15 bars of\ndry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100/30/10 mW m$^{-2}$.

The chemical evolution of the core is affected by changing\nits physical parameters such as the total density and the amount of\ngas-depletion onto grain surfaces as well as the cosmic ray ionisation rate,\n$\\zeta$. We estimated $\\zeta_{\\text {CMM3}}$ = 1.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$\ns$^{-1}$.

Species response\ndifferently to changes into the core physical conditions, but they are more\nsensitive to changes in the depletion percentage and CR ionisation rate than to\nvariations in the core density. Gas-phase models highlighted the importance of\nsurface reactions as factories of large molecules and showed that for sulphur\nbearing species depletion is important to reproduce observations.\n  Comparing the results of the reference model with the most recent millimeter\nobservations of the NGC 2264 CMM3 core showed that our model is capable of\nreproducing the observed abundances of most of the species during early stages\n($\\le$ 3$\\times$10$^4$ yrs) of their chemical evolution.

Clustering is evaluated in two dimensions, by binning absorbers\nboth in projected radius and in velocity separation. Excess MgII is detected\naround massive galaxies out to R_p=20 Mpc. At projected radii less than 800\nkpc, the excess extends out to velocity separations of 10,000 km/s.

An adaptive\nrestarting scheme can improve the convergence rate of the fast gradient method,\nwhen the parameter of a strongly convex cost function is unknown or when the\niterates of the algorithm enter a locally strongly convex region. Recently, we\nintroduced the optimized gradient method, a first-order algorithm that has an\ninexpensive per-iteration computational cost similar to that of the fast\ngradient method, yet has a worst-case cost function rate that is twice faster\nthan that of the fast gradient method and that is optimal for large-dimensional\nsmooth convex problems. Building upon the success of accelerating the fast\ngradient method using adaptive restart, this paper investigates similar\nheuristic acceleration of the optimized gradient method.

Nanoplasmonics is an\nemerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains\non multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter\ninteraction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC\nthat incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical\ninterconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics.

Our design space\nexploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a\nperformance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our\nestimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark\nsuite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible\nenergy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for\nfully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics.

For pre-2013 devices, we\nobserve avalanches delayed by ns to several 100~ns at 637, 777nm and 820 nm\ndemonstrating that holes created in the zero field region of the silicon bulk\ncan diffuse back to the high field region triggering delayed avalanches.

In dynamic sampling, each new measurement location is\nselected based on information obtained from previous measurements. Therefore,\ndynamic sampling schemes have the potential to dramatically reduce the number\nof measurements needed for high fidelity reconstructions. However, most\nexisting dynamic sampling methods for point-wise measurement acquisition tend\nto be computationally expensive and are therefore too slow for practical\napplications.\n  In this paper, we present a framework for dynamic sampling based on machine\nlearning techniques, which we call a supervised learning approach for dynamic\nsampling (SLADS). In each step of SLADS, the objective is to find the pixel\nthat maximizes the expected reduction in distortion (ERD) given previous\nmeasurements. SLADS is fast because we use a simple regression function to\ncompute the ERD, and it is accurate because the regression function is trained\nusing data sets that are representative of the specific application. In\naddition, we introduce a method to terminate dynamic sampling at a desired\nlevel of distortion, and we extended the SLADS methodology to sample groups of\npixels at each step.

Among the main effects that the Milky Way exerts in binary systems,\nthe Galactic tide is the only one that is not probabilistic and can be deduced\nfrom a potential. Therefore, it is possible to perform an analysis of the\nglobal structure of the phase space of binary systems in the solar\nneighbourhood using the Galactic potential. Aims. The aim of this work is to\nobtain a simple model to study the collisionless dynamical evolution of generic\nwide binaries systems in the solar neighbourhood. Methods. Through an averaging\nprocess, we reduced the three-dimensional potential of the Galaxy to a secular\none-degree of freedom model. The accuracy of this model was tested by comparing\nits predictions with numerical simulations of the exact equations of motion of\na two-body problem disturbed by the Galaxy. Results. Using the one-degree of\nfreedom model, we developed a detailed dynamical study, finding that the\nsecular Galactic tide period changes as a function of the separation of the\npair, which also gives a dynamical explanation for the arbitrary classification\nbetween \"wide\" and \"tight\" binaries. Moreover, the secular phase space for a\ngeneric gravitationally bound pair is similar to the dynamical structure of a\nLidov-Kozai resonance, but surprisingly this structure is independent of the\nmasses and semimajor axis of the binary system. Thus, the Galactic potential is\nable to excite the initially circular orbit of binary systems to high values of\neccentricity, which has important implications for studies of binary star\nsystems (with and without exoplanets), comets, and Oort cloud objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 20:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The modern multi-label problems are typically large-scale in\nterms of number of observations, features and labels, and the amount of labels\ncan even be comparable with the amount of observations. In this context,\ndifferent remedies have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.\nIn this work, we aim at exploiting the output sparsity by introducing a new\nloss, called the sparse weighted Hamming loss. This proposed loss can be seen\nas a weighted version of classical ones, where active and inactive labels are\nweighted separately. Leveraging the influence of sparsity in the loss function,\nwe provide improved generalization bounds for the empirical risk minimizer, a\nsuitable property for large-scale problems. For this new loss, we derive rates\nof convergence linear in the underlying output-sparsity rather than linear in\nthe number of labels. In practice, minimizing the associated risk can be\nperformed efficiently by using convex surrogates and modern convex optimization\nalgorithms. We provide experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrating\nthe pertinence of our approach when compared to non-weighted techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 20:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

Enabling robots to recognise different\nmaterials (concrete, metal etc.) in a scene is important for many tasks, e.g.\nrobotic interventions in nuclear decommissioning. Previous work on 3D semantic\nreconstruction has predominantly focused on recognition of everyday domestic\nobjects (tables, chairs etc.), whereas previous work on material recognition\nhas largely been confined to single 2D images without any 3D reconstruction.\nMeanwhile, most 3D semantic reconstruction methods rely on computationally\nexpensive post-processing, using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Fields\n(CRFs), to achieve consistent segmentations. In contrast, we propose a deep\nlearning method which performs 3D reconstruction while simultaneously\nrecognising different types of materials and labelling them at the pixel level.\nUnlike previous methods, we propose a fully end-to-end approach, which does not\nrequire hand-crafted features or CRF post-processing. Instead, we use only\nlearned features, and the CRF segmentation constraints are incorporated inside\nthe fully end-to-end learned system. We present the results of experiments, in\nwhich we trained our system to perform real-time 3D semantic reconstruction for\n23 different materials in a real-world application. The run-time performance of\nthe system can be boosted to around 10Hz, using a conventional GPU, which is\nenough to achieve real-time semantic reconstruction using a 30fps RGB-D camera.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first real-time end-to-end\nsystem for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and material recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 20:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

For the flip in filament can\nbe explained by halo formation time and the migrating time when its environment\nchanges from sheet to filament.

One of the goals of MoD systems is to provide personalized\ntransportation services to passengers. This process is facilitated by a\ncentralized operator that coordinates the assignment of vehicles to individual\npassengers, based on location data. However, current approaches assume that\naccurate positioning information for passengers and vehicles is readily\navailable. This assumption raises privacy concerns. In this work, we address\nthis issue by proposing a method that protects passengers' drop-off locations\n(i.e., their travel destinations). Formally, we solve a batch assignment\nproblem that routes vehicles at obfuscated origin locations to passenger\nlocations (since origin locations correspond to previous drop-off locations),\nsuch that the mean waiting time is minimized. Our main contributions are\ntwo-fold. First, we formalize the notion of privacy for continuous\nvehicle-to-passenger assignment in MoD systems, and integrate a privacy\nmechanism that provides formal guarantees. Second, we present a scalable\nalgorithm that takes advantage of superfluous (idle) vehicles in the system,\ncombining multiple iterations of the Hungarian algorithm to allocate a\nredundant number of vehicles to a single passenger. As a result, we are able to\nreduce the performance deterioration induced by the privacy mechanism. We\nevaluate our methods on a real, large-scale data set consisting of over 11\nmillion taxi rides (specifying vehicle availability and passenger requests),\nrecorded over a month's duration, in the area of Manhattan, New York. Our work\ndemonstrates that privacy can be integrated into MoD systems without incurring\na significant loss of performance, and moreover, that this loss can be further\nminimized at the cost of deploying additional (redundant) vehicles into the\nfleet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 21:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

In particular, it has been\nacknowledged for quite some time that boundaries can break gauge invariance,\nand thereby turn gauge degrees of freedom into physical ones. There is however\nno known systematic way of identifying these degrees of freedom and possible\nassociated boundary observables. Following recent work by Donnelly and Freidel,\nwe show that this can be achieved by extending the covariant Hamiltonian\nformalism so as to make it gauge-invariant under arbitrary large gauge\ntransformations. This can be done at the expense of extending the phase space\nby introducing new boundary fields, which in turn determine new boundary\nsymmetries and observables. We present the general framework behind this\nconstruction, and find the conditions under which it can be applied to an\narbitrary Lagrangian. By studying the examples of Abelian Chern-Simons theory\nand first order three-dimensional gravity, we then show that the new boundary\nobservables satisfy the known corresponding Kac-Moody affine algebras. This\nshows that this new extended phase space formulation does indeed properly\ndescribe the dynamical boundary degrees of freedom, and gives credit to the\nresults which have been previously derived in the case of diffeomorphism\nsymmetry. We expect that this systematic understanding of the boundary\nsymmetries will play a major role for the quantization of gravity in finite\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 21:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 20:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 17:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 00:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

Using the\nexistence of MOLS with subMOLS, we prove that if $\\dim(k,n)={k \\choose 2}-1$\nthen $\\dim(k,N) = {k \\choose 2}-1$ for all sufficiently large $N$.\n  Let the ensemble of an $\\mathrm{OA}$ be the set of Latin squares derived by\ninterpreting any three columns of the OA as a Latin square. We demonstrate many\nrestrictions on the number of Latin squares of each parity that the ensemble of\nan $\\mathrm{OA}(k,n)$ can contain. These restrictions depend on $n\\mod4$ and\ngive some insight as to why it is harder to build projective planes of order $n\n\\not= 2\\mod4$ than for $n \\not= 2\\mod4$. For example, we prove that when $n\n\\not= 2\\mod 4$ it is impossible to build an $\\mathrm{OA}(n+1,n)$ for which all\nLatin squares in the ensemble are isotopic (equivalent to each other up to\npermutation of the rows, columns and symbols).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

We have acquired a unique\nlarge-scale data set on the growth and asexual reproduction of two freshwater\nplanarian species, Dugesia japonica and Dugesia tigrina, which reproduce by\ntransverse fission and succeeding regeneration of head and tail pieces into new\nplanarians. We show that generation-dependent memory effects in planarian\nreproduction need to be taken into account to accurately capture the\nexperimental data. To achieve this, we developed a new additive model that\nmixes multiple size control strategies based on planarian size, growth, and\ntime between divisions. Our model quantifies the proportions of each strategy\nin the mixed dynamics, revealing the ability of the two planarian species to\nutilize different strategies in a coordinated manner for size control.\nAdditionally, we found that head and tail offspring of both species employ\ndifferent mechanisms to monitor and trigger their reproduction cycles. Thus, we\nfind a diversity of strategies not only between species but also between heads\nand tails within species.

In\nparticular, since the underlying state in the SP-MPS uses only Abelian\nsymmetries, one does not need the singlet embedding scheme for non-singlet\nstates, as normally employed in spin-adapted DMRG, to achieve a single\nconsistent variationally optimized state. (2) Due to the use of\n$|\\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\\rangle$ as its underlying state, the SP-MPS can be closely\nconnected to broken symmetry mean-field states. This allows to\nstraightforwardly generate the large number of broken symmetry guesses needed\nto explore complex electronic landscapes in magnetic systems. Further, this\nconnection can be exploited in the future development of quantum embedding\ntheories for open-shell systems. (3) The sum of MPOs representation for the\nHamiltonian and spin projector $\\mathcal{P}_S$ naturally leads to an\nembarrassingly parallel algorithm for computing expectation values and\noptimizing SP-MPS.

Because the errors of the real and reactive\npower measurements calculated using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) follow\nlong-tailed probability distributions, the conventional UKF provides strongly\nbiased state estimates since it relies on the weighted least squares estimator.\nBy contrast, the state estimates and residuals of our GM-UKF are proved to be\nroughly Gaussian, allowing the sigma points to reliably approximate the mean\nand the covariance matrices of the predicted and corrected state vectors. To\ndevelop our GM-UKF, we first derive a batch-mode regression form by processing\nthe predictions and observations simultaneously, where the statistical\nlinearization approach is used. We show that the set of equations so derived\nare equivalent to those of the unscented transformation.

The PS's are applied\nto a two-dimensional matrix that consists of serially correlated predicted\nstate and innovation vectors to detect observation and innovation outliers.\nThese outliers are suppressed by the GM-estimator using the iteratively\nreweighted least squares algorithm. Finally, the asymptotic error covariance\nmatrix of the GM-UKF state estimates is derived from the total influence\nfunction.

For a free boson conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions\nas a concrete example, we build a quasi-local unitary transformation $V$ that\nmaps $|\\Psi\\rangle$ into $|\\Psi^\\Lambda\\rangle$ and show two main results. (i)\nAny spacetime symmetry of the ground state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is also mapped by $V$\ninto a spacetime symmetry of the cMERA $|\\Psi^\\Lambda\\rangle$. However, while\nin the CFT the stress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ (in terms of which all the\nspacetime symmetry generators are expressed) is local, the corresponding cMERA\nstress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\Lambda}(x) = V T_{\\mu\\nu}(x) V^{\\dagger}$ is\nquasi-local. (ii) From the cMERA, we can extract quasi-local scaling operators\n$O^{\\Lambda}_{\\alpha}(x)$ characterized by the exact same scaling dimensions\n$\\Delta_{\\alpha}$, conformal spins $s_{\\alpha}$, operator product expansion\ncoefficients $C_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$, and central charge $c$ as the original\nCFT. Finally, we argue that these results should also apply to interacting\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

Roughly speaking, decisiveness\nallows one to lift most good properties from finite Markov chains to\ndenumerable ones, and therefore to adapt existing verification algorithms to\ninfinite-state models. Decisive Markov chains however do not encompass\nstochastic real-time systems, and general stochastic transition systems (STSs\nfor short) are needed. In this article, we provide a framework to perform both\nthe qualitative and the quantitative analysis of STSs. First, we define various\nnotions of decisiveness (inherited from [1]), notions of fairness and of\nattractors for STSs, and make explicit the relationships between them. Then, we\ndefine a notion of abstraction, together with natural concepts of soundness and\ncompleteness, and we give general transfer properties, which will be central to\nseveral verification algorithms on STSs. We further design a generic\nconstruction which will be useful for the analysis of {\\omega}-regular\nproperties, when a finite attractor exists, either in the system (if it is\ndenumerable), or in a sound denumerable abstraction of the system. We next\nprovide algorithms for qualitative model-checking, and generic approximation\nprocedures for quantitative model-checking. Finally, we instantiate our\nframework with stochastic timed automata (STA), generalized semi-Markov\nprocesses (GSMPs) and stochastic time Petri nets (STPNs), three models\ncombining dense-time and probabilities. This allows us to derive decidability\nand approximability results for the verification of these models.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing control\nrefinement approaches for DAE systems via the notions of (bi)simulation\nrelations and approximate simulation relations from computer science. The\nquantified refinement accuracy is achieved by defining observation metrics over\na general system framework named transition systems. We employ the behavioral\ntheory to tackle dynamical systems and control problems in a more general\nframework. Due to the difficulty in dealing with a DAE system directly, we\nderive another system, which is behaviorally equivalent to the related DAE\nsystem and in standard state space form, to provide ease for further control\nrefinement. Consequently, well-developed model reduction approaches can be\napplied to obtain an abstract simplified system, which can be rewritten into a\nDAE system again.

Spatial separation of charge- and spin-wave packets over a distance\nexceeding 200 um was confirmed. In addition, we found that the 1D electron\ndynamics can be controlled by tuning the electric environment. These\nexperimental results provide fundamental information about non-equilibrium\nphenomena in actual 1D electron systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 23:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

We\nterm this service Ultra-Reliable Ubiquitous-Rate Communication (UR2C). This\npaper investigates the role of frequency reuse in supporting UR2C in the\ndownlink. To this end, two frequency reuse schemes are considered:\nuser-specific frequency reuse (FRu) and BS-specific frequency reuse (FRb). For\na given unit frequency channel, FRu reduces the number of serving user\nequipments (UEs), whereas FRb directly decreases the number of interfering base\nstations (BSs). This increases the distance from the interfering BSs and the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) attains ultra-reliability, e.g. 99% SIR\ncoverage at a randomly picked UE. The ultra-reliability is, however, achieved\nat the cost of the reduced frequency allocation, which may degrade overall\ndownlink rate. To fairly capture this reliability-rate tradeoff, we propose\nubiquitous rate defined as the maximum downlink rate whose required SIR can be\nachieved with ultra-reliability. By using stochastic geometry, we derive\nclosed-form ubiquitous rate as well as the optimal frequency reuse rules for\nUR2C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 23:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

The classical grid search or trial-error\nmethods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian\noptimization (BO) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of\nblack box functions. In situations where the black box function can be\nevaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is\nused. Current batch BO approaches are restrictive in that they fix the number\nof evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified\nevaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying\nacquisition function. We present the Budgeted Batch Bayesian Optimization (B3O)\nfor hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design - we identify the\nappropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. To set the batch\nsize flexible, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) for\nautomatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition\nfunctions.

In particular, the proposed\ncooperative path planner sequentially generates a set of spatially diverse\nroutes according to a number of factors, including travel distance, ease of\ntravel, and uncertainty associated with the ease of travel. The planner's\ndependence on each of these factors is altered by a weighted score, doing so\nchanges the criteria for determining an optimum route. To penalize the\nselection of same paths by different vehicles, a control gain is used to\nincrease the cost of paths that lie near the route(s) assigned to other\nvehicles. By varying the control gain, the spatial diversity among routes can\nbe accomplished. By repeatedly searching for different paths cooperatively, an\noptimal path can be selected that yields the most valuable route.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 02:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

The key perspective is that of (relativity) symmetry\nrepresentation, and the idea that the physical space is to be identified as the\nconfiguration space for a free particle. Parallel to the case of the phase\nspace, we have a model of the quantum physical space which reduces to the\nNewtonian classical model under the classical limit. The latter is to be\nobtained as a contraction limit of the relativity symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In\nthis study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic\nprograms. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the\nrules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches\nthat consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the\nlatter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties\nfor belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.\n  We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial\nmeet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which\nallow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and\nsupport. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more\ninformation from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,\nbut they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the\nfirst in the field to the best of our knowledge.\n  In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the\nrevision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to\nthe logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the\nbelief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our\noperators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a\nlogic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions\nto performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.\nFinally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision\nmethods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and\ngeneralise the other method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

We offer a minimum output analysis to\nquantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes\nthat produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the\nminimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source\nlocalization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved\nusing compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical\nnetworks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more\nreadily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected\nnetwork with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is\nsufficient for locating any number of sources.

The support recovery\nproblem is formulated as the marginalized maximum likelihood (or type-II ML)\nestimation of the variance hyperparameters of a joint sparsity inducing\nGaussian prior on the source signals. We derive conditions under which the\nresulting nonconvex constrained optimization perfectly recovers the nonzero\nsupport of a joint-sparse Gaussian source ensemble with arbitrarily high\nprobability. The support error probability decays exponentially with the number\nof MMVs at a rate that depends on the smallest restricted singular value and\nthe nonnegative null space property of the self Khatri-Rao product of the\nsensing matrix. Our analysis confirms that nonzero supports of size as high as\nO($m^2$) are recoverable from $m$ measurements per sparse vector. Our derived\nsufficient conditions for support consistency of the proposed constrained\ntype-II ML solution also guarantee the support consistency of any global\nsolution of the multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) optimization whose\nnonzero coefficients lie inside a bounded interval. For the case of noiseless\nmeasurements, we further show that a single MMV is sufficient for perfect\nrecovery of the $k$-sparse support by M-SBL, provided all subsets of $k + 1$\ncolumns of the sensing matrix are linearly independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 04:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 06:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 13:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

One purported advantage of replacing or augmenting human\njudgment with computer models in high stakes settings-- such as sentencing,\nhiring, policing, college admissions, and parole decisions-- is the perceived\n\"neutrality\" of computers. It is argued that because computer models do not\nhold personal prejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from\nprejudice. There is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not\nremove the potential for bias, and can even amplify it if the training data\nwere generated by a process that is itself biased. In this paper, we provide a\nprobabilistic notion of algorithmic bias. We propose a method to eliminate bias\nfrom predictive models by removing all information regarding protected\nvariables from the data to which the models will ultimately be trained. Unlike\nprevious work in this area, our framework is general enough to accommodate data\non any measurement scale. Motivated by models currently in use in the criminal\njustice system that inform decisions on pre-trial release and parole, we apply\nour proposed method to a dataset on the criminal histories of individuals at\nthe time of sentencing to produce \"race-neutral\" predictions of re-arrest. In\nthe process, we demonstrate that a common approach to creating \"race-neutral\"\nmodels-- omitting race as a covariate-- still results in racially disparate\npredictions.

The degree of savings\nthat can be achieved by adapting the resources is a tradeoff between savings,\nadaptation frequency, and increased queuing time.

We follow the\nevolution of the CIV BAL, and find that, for the slower outflowing material,\nthe absorption trough varies little (if at all) on a rest-frame timescale of 2\nyr. However, we detect a strong deepening of the absorption in the gas moving\nat larger velocities (-20,000 - -23,000 km s-1). The data is consistent with a\nmultistreaming flow crossing our line of sight to the source. The transverse\nvelocity of the flow should be few thousand km s-1, similar to the rotation\nvelocity of the BLR gas (2,600 km s-1). By simply assuming Keplerian motion,\nthese two components must have similar locations, pointing to a common outflow\nforming the BLR and the BAL.

The same holds true for methods as\nsparse feature tracking when initial flow or depth information for new features\nat arbitrary positions is needed.

However, in most networks, nodes, topology and edge\nweights are all initially unknown. We introduce selective harvesting, a variant\nof AS where the next node to be queried must be chosen among the neighbors of\nthe current queried node set; the available training data for deciding which\nnode to query is restricted to the subgraph induced by the queried set (and\ntheir node attributes) and their neighbors (without any node or edge\nattributes). Therefore, selective harvesting is a sequential decision problem,\nwhere we must decide which node to query at each step. A classifier trained in\nthis scenario suffers from a tunnel vision effect: without recourse to\nindependent sampling, the urge to query promising nodes forces classifiers to\ngather increasingly biased training data, which we show significantly hurts the\nperformance of AS methods and standard classifiers. We find that it is possible\nto collect a much larger set of targets by using multiple classifiers, not by\ncombining their predictions as an ensemble, but switching between classifiers\nused at each step, as a way to ease the tunnel vision effect. We discover that\nswitching classifiers collects more targets by (a) diversifying the training\ndata and (b) broadening the choices of nodes that can be queried next. This\nhighlights an exploration, exploitation, and diversification trade-off in our\nproblem that goes beyond the exploration and exploitation duality found in\nclassic sequential decision problems.

Use of a\nforeign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker\nis code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other\nlanguages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a\nlanguage; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the\nconversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign\nword used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a\nfundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential\nprerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for\nmultilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel\ncomputational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on\nthe social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to\nsample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose\nthree novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users\nin different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate\nwords indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a\nground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The\nSpearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the\nthree metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most\ncompetitive existing baseline reported in the literature.

Hence, it is widely\nused in cloud storage systems to save storage space and network bandwidth.\nHowever, the occurrence of deduplication can be easily identified by monitoring\nand analyzing network traffic, which leads to the risk of user privacy leakage.\nThe attacker can carry out a very dangerous side channel attack, i.e.,\nlearn-the-remaining-information (LRI) attack, to reveal users' privacy\ninformation by exploiting the side channel of network traffic in deduplication.\nExisting work addresses the LRI attack at the cost of the high bandwidth\nefficiency of deduplication. In order to address this problem, we propose a\nsimple yet effective scheme, called randomized redundant chunk scheme (RRCS),\nto significantly mitigate the risk of the LRI attack while maintaining the high\nbandwidth efficiency of deduplication. The basic idea behind RRCS is to add\nrandomized redundant chunks to mix up the real deduplication states of files\nused for the LRI attack, which effectively obfuscates the view of the attacker,\nwho attempts to exploit the side channel of network traffic for the LRI attack.\nOur security analysis shows that RRCS could significantly mitigate the risk of\nthe LRI attack. We implement the RRCS prototype and evaluate it by using three\nlarge-scale real-world datasets.

Alternatively, they can be seen as a model of concurrency with\nsynchronized choice as communication primitive. Well-designed negotiations must\nbe sound, meaning that, whatever its current state, the negotiation can still\nbe completed. In earlier work, Esparza and Desel have shown that deciding\nsoundness of a negotiation is Pspace-complete, and in Ptime if the negotiation\nis deterministic. They have also extended their polynomial soundness algorithm\nto an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations. However,\nthey did not analyze the runtime of the extended algorithm, and also left open\nthe complexity of the soundness problem for the intermediate class. In the\nfirst part of this paper we revisit the soundness problem for deterministic\nnegotiations, and show that it is Nlogspace-complete, improving on the earlier\nalgorithm, which requires linear space. In the second part we answer the\nquestion left open by Esparza and Desel.

In the\nthird and final part, we show that the techniques developed in the first two\nparts of the paper can be applied to analysis problems other than soundness,\nincluding the problem of detecting race conditions, and several classical\nstatic analysis problems. More specifically, we show that, while these problems\nare intractable for arbitrary acyclic deterministic negotiations, they become\ntractable in the sound case. So soundness is not only a desirable behavioral\nproperty in itself, but also helps to analyze other properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 13:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 08:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 17:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The main issue of this work, since separately each of these\nmethods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches\nin order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in\nvarious geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method\nincorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence\nmodel.

However,\ndeveloping response-adaptive trial designs that offer patient benefit while\nensuring the resulting trial avoids bias and provides a statistically rigorous\ncomparison of the different treatments included is highly challenging. In this\npaper, the theory of Multi-Armed Bandit Problems is used to define a family of\nnear optimal adaptive designs in the context of a clinical trial with a\nnormally distributed endpoint with known variance. Through simulation studies\nbased on an ongoing trial as a motivation we report the operating\ncharacteristics (type I error, power, bias) and patient benefit of these\napproaches and compare them to traditional and existing alternative designs.\nThese results are then compared to those recently published in the context of\nBernoulli endpoints. Many limitations and advantages are similar in both cases\nbut there are also important differences, specially with respect to type I\nerror control. This paper proposes a simulation-based testing procedure to\ncorrect for the observed type I error inflation that bandit-based and adaptive\nrules can induce. Results presented extend recent work by considering a\nnormally distributed endpoint, a very common case in clinical practice yet\nmostly ignored in the response-adaptive theoretical literature, and illustrate\nthe potential advantages of using these methods in a rare disease context. We\nalso recommend a suitable modified implementation of the bandit-based adaptive\ndesigns for the case of common diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 14:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

We look at variations\nto the traditional BosonSampling architecture by considering other quantum\nstates of light. We show a worlds first application inspired by BosonSampling\nin quantum metrology where measurements may be made more accurately than with\nany classical method.

In this context, Sparse Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE)\nhave been shown to be among the most promising methods because of their ability\nto model highly complex models at relatively low computational costs. A\nleast-square minimization technique may be used to determine the coefficients\nof the sparse PCE by relying on the so called experimental design (ED), i.e.\nthe sample points where the original computational model is evaluated. An\nefficient sampling strategy is then needed to generate an accurate PCE at low\ncomputational cost. This paper is concerned with the problem of identifying an\noptimal experimental design that maximizes the accuracy of the surrogate model\nover the whole input space within a given computational budget. A novel\nsequential adaptive strategy where the ED is enriched sequentially by\ncapitalizing on the sparsity of the underlying metamodel is introduced.

Conventional\nbusiness process models only describe the lifecycles of individual instances\n(cases) in isolation. Although process models may include data elements (cf.\nBPMN), explicit connections to real data models (e.g., an entity relationship\nmodel or a UML class model) are rarely made. Therefore, we propose a novel\napproach that extends data models with a behavioral perspective. Data models\ncan easily deal with many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. This is\nexploited to create process models that can also model complex interactions\nbetween different types of instances. Classical multiple-instance problems are\ncircumvented by using the data model for event correlation. The declarative\nnature of the proposed language makes it possible to model behavioral\nconstraints over activities like cardinality constraints in data models. The\nresulting object-centric behavioral constraint (OCBC) model is able to describe\nprocesses involving interacting instances and complex data dependencies.

It is also compared to the\nUKF and the Generalized Maximum-Likelihood-type robust iterated EKF (GM-IEKF).\nSimulation results reveal that the GM-UKF outperforms the GM-IEKF and the UKF\nin all scenarios considered. In particular, when the system is operating under\nstressed conditions, inducing system nonlinearities, the GM-IEKF and the UKF\ndiverge while our GM-UKF does converge. In addition, when the power measurement\nnoises obey a Cauchy distribution, our GM-UKF converges to a state estimate\nvector that exhibits a much higher statistical efficiency than that of the\nGM-IEKF; by contrast, the UKF fails to converge. Finally, potential\napplications and future work of the proposed GM-UKF are discussed in concluding\nremarks section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

The dual nature of this phase change, which is both\nelectronic and structural, turns the electrical oscillations into an intrinsic\nactuation mechanism, powered by a small DC voltage and capable to selectively\nexcite the different mechanical modes of a microstructure. Our results pave the\nway towards the realization of micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems with\nautonomous actuation from integrated DC power sources such as solar cells or\nmicro-batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 08:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 08:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}
