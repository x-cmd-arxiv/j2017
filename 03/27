In this\npaper, we propose a novel token-based approach to compute a wide class of\ntarget functions to which we refer as \"Token-based function Computation with\nMemory\" (TCM) algorithm. In this approach, node values are attached to tokens\nand travel across the network. Each pair of travelling tokens would coalesce\nwhen they meet, forming a token with a new value as a function of the original\ntoken values. In contrast to the Coalescing Random Walk (CRW) algorithm, where\ntoken movement is governed by random walk, meeting of tokens in our scheme is\naccelerated by adopting a novel chasing mechanism. We proved that, compared to\nthe CRW algorithm, the TCM algorithm results in a reduction of time complexity\nby a factor of at least $\\sqrt{n/\\log(n)}$ in Erd\\\"os-Renyi and complete\ngraphs, and by a factor of $\\log(n)/\\log(\\log(n))$ in torus networks.\nSimulation results show that there is at least a constant factor improvement in\nthe message complexity of TCM algorithm in all considered topologies.\nRobustness of the CRW and TCM algorithms in the presence of node failure is\nanalyzed. We show that their robustness can be improved by running multiple\ninstances of the algorithms in parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

While a large\nnumber of distance metric/subspace learning models have been developed for\nre-id, the cross-view transformations they learned are view-generic and thus\npotentially less effective in quantifying the feature distortion inherent to\neach camera view. Learning view-specific feature transformations for re-id\n(i.e., view-specific re-id), an under-studied approach, becomes an alternative\nresort for this problem. In this work, we formulate a novel view-specific\nperson re-identification framework from the feature augmentation point of view,\ncalled Camera coRrelation Aware Feature augmenTation (CRAFT). Specifically,\nCRAFT performs cross-view adaptation by automatically measuring camera\ncorrelation from cross-view visual data distribution and adaptively conducting\nfeature augmentation to transform the original features into a new adaptive\nspace. Through our augmentation framework, view-generic learning algorithms can\nbe readily generalized to learn and optimize view-specific sub-models whilst\nsimultaneously modelling view-generic discrimination information. Therefore,\nour framework not only inherits the strength of view-generic model learning but\nalso provides an effective way to take into account view specific\ncharacteristics. Our CRAFT framework can be extended to jointly learn\nview-specific feature transformations for person re-id across a large network\nwith more than two cameras, a largely under-investigated but realistic re-id\nsetting.

We propose a computationally simple and\ntuning-free test statistic, characterize its limiting null distribution,\nanalyze the statistical power and prove its minimax optimality. As an important\nby-product of the test statistic, a ratio-consistent estimator for the\nquadratic functional of a covariance matrix from correlated samples is\ndeveloped.

Indeed, blindly using classical\ninference results based on the assumed independence of samples will lead to\nmany false discoveries, which suggests the need for conducting independence\ntesting before applying existing methods. To address the challenge arising from\ncorrelation among samples, we propose a \"sandwich estimator\" of Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient by de-correlating the samples.

Membrane buds\nwere first detected with <50 nm radius, grew to >200 nm radius, and extended\ninto longer tubules with dependence on the membrane tension and CTxB\nconcentration. Compared to the concentration of the planar supported lipid\nbilayers, CTxB was >10x more concentrated on the positive curvature top and\n>25x more concentrated on the negative Gaussian curvature neck of the nanoscale\nmembrane buds.

Precise determination of stellar masses is necessary to test the\nvalidity of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stellar evolutionary models, whose\npredictions are in disagreement with measurements for masses below 1.2 Msun.

The proposed potential is\ncompared with three other potentials from the literature. The potentials\ndemonstrate reasonable agreement with first-principles binding energies of\nsmall Si clusters as well as single-layer and bilayer silicenes. The four\npotentials are used to evaluate the thermal stability of free-standing\nsilicenes in the form of nano-ribbons, nano-flakes and nano-tubes.

Two fundamental challenges in it are visual-semantic embedding and\ndomain adaptation in cross-modality learning and unseen class prediction steps,\nrespectively. To address both challenges, this paper presents two corresponding\nmethods named Adaptive STructural Embedding (ASTE) and Self-PAsed Selective\nStrategy (SPASS), respectively. Specifically, ASTE formulates the\nvisualsemantic interactions in a latent structural SVM framework to adaptively\nadjust the slack variables to embody the different reliableness among training\ninstances. In this way, the reliable instances are imposed with small\npunishments, wheras the less reliable instances are imposed with more severe\npunishments. Thus, it ensures a more discriminative embedding. On the other\nhand, SPASS offers a framework to alleviate the domain shift problem in ZSL,\nwhich exploits the unseen data in an easy to hard fashion. Particularly, SPASS\nborrows the idea from selfpaced learning by iteratively selecting the unseen\ninstances from reliable to less reliable to gradually adapt the knowledge from\nthe seen domain to the unseen domain. Subsequently, by combining SPASS and\nASTE, we present a self-paced Transductive ASTE (TASTE) method to progressively\nreinforce the classification capacity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets (i.e., AwA, CUB, and aPY) demonstrate the superiorities of ASTE and\nTASTE. Furthermore, we also propose a fast training (FT) strategy to improve\nthe efficiency of most of existing ZSL methods. The FT strategy is surprisingly\nsimple and general enough, which can speed up the training time of most\nexisting methods by 4~300 times while holding the previous performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 01:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

However,\nexisting solutions require the use of bulky lasers to excite the nanoparticles\nand similarly bulky and expensive spectrometers to measure the scattered Raman\nsignals, which limit the practicality and applications of this nano-biosensing\ntechnique. In addition, due to the high path loss of the intra-body\nenvironment, the received signals are usually very weak, which hampers the\naccuracy of the measurements.

The difficulties from analyzing\nthese data mainly come from two aspects: first, there are major statistical and\ncomputational challenges for modeling and analyzing high dimensional\nmultichannel brain signals; second, there is no set of universally-agreed\nmeasures for characterizing connectivity. To model multichannel brain signals,\nour approach is to fit a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with potentially\nhigh lag order so that complex lead-lag temporal dynamics between the channels\ncan be captured. Estimates of the VAR model will be obtained by our proposed\nhybrid LASSLE (LASSO+LSE) method which combines regularization (to control for\nsparsity) and least squares estimation (to improve bias and mean-squared\nerror). Then we employ some measures of connectivity but put an emphasis on\npartial directed coherence (PDC) which can capture the directional connectivity\nbetween channels. PDC is a frequency-specific measure that explains the extent\nto which the present oscillatory activity in a sender channel influences the\nfuture oscillatory activity in a specific receiver channel relative to all\npossible receivers in the network.

To\nmatch the short rise time, narrow light curve peak, and extremely broad\nspectral lines of SN1998bw requires a model with <3Msun ejecta but a high\nexplosion energy of a few 1e52erg and 0.5Msun of Ni56.

However, multilevel variables are often required to account for\nthreshold effects, in which knowledge of the Boolean case does not generalise\nstraightforwardly. This motivated the development of conversion methods for\nmultilevel to Boolean models. In particular, Van Ham's method has been shown to\nyield a one-to-one, neighbour and regulation preserving dynamics, making it the\nde facto standard approach to the problem. However, Van Ham's method has\nseveral drawbacks: most notably, it introduces vast regions of \"non-admissible\"\nstates that have no counterpart in the multilevel, original model. This raises\nspecial difficulties for the analysis of interaction between variables and\ncircuit functionality, which is believed to be central to the understanding of\ndynamic properties of logical models. Here, we propose a new multilevel to\nBoolean conversion method, with software implementation. Contrary to Van Ham's,\nour method doesn't yield a one-to-one transposition of multilevel trajectories,\nhowever, it maps each and every Boolean state to a specific multilevel state,\nthus getting rid of the non-admissible regions and, at the expense of\n(apparently) more complicated, \"parallel\" trajectories. One of the prominent\nfeatures of our method is that it preserves dynamics and interaction of\nvariables in a certain manner. As a demonstration of the usability of our\nmethod, we apply it to construct a new Boolean counter-example to the\nwell-known conjecture that a local negative circuit is necessary to generate\nsustained oscillations. This result illustrates the general relevance of our\nmethod for the study of multilevel logical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 05:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 07:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

Reconciliation consists in explaining these\ndifferences by gene-scale events such as duplication, loss, transfer, which\ntranslates mathematically into a mapping between gene tree nodes and species\ntree nodes or branches. Gene conversion is a very frequent biological event,\nwhich results in the replacement of a gene by a copy of another from the same\nspecies and in the same gene tree. Including this event in reconciliations has\nnever been attempted because this changes as well the solutions as the methods\nto construct reconciliations. Standard algorithms based on dynamic programming\nbecome ineffective. We propose here a novel mathematical framework including\ngene conversion as an evolutionary event in gene tree/species tree\nreconciliation. We describe a randomized algorithm giving in polynomial running\ntime a reconciliation minimizing the number of duplications, losses and\nconversions. We show that the space of reconciliations includes an analog of\nthe Last Common Ancestor reconciliation, but is not limited to it.

The QD is modeled as a\ntwo-level system with an excited state representing a single exciton, and\nground state represents the absence of an exciton. Coupling to the radiative\nmodes of the cavity is treated within usual Born-Markov approximation, whereas\ndot-phonon coupling is discussed within non-Markovian regime beyond Born\napproximation.

Image deconvolution, also known as inverse\nfiltering, has been widely exploited as a recovery technique because of its\npractical feasibility, and operates by assuming the linear shift-invariant\nproperty of the imaging system. However, shift invariance is not rigorously\nhold in all imaging situations and it is not a necessary condition for solving\nthe inverse problem of light propagation.

It has been shown that in-memory data\nprocessing systems suffer from serious memory pressure. The situation becomes\neven worse for the service-oriented data processing systems due to various\nreasons. For example, in a service-oriented system, multiple submitted tasks\nare launched at the same time and executed in the same context in the\nresources, comparing with the batch processing mode where the tasks are\nprocessed one by one. Therefore, the memory pressure will affect all submitted\ntasks, including the tasks that only incur the light memory pressure when they\nare run alone. In this paper, we find that the reason why memory pressure\narises is because the running tasks produce massive long-living data objects in\nthe limited memory space. Our studies further reveal that the long-living data\nobjects are generated by the API functions that are invoked by the in-memory\nprocessing frameworks. Based on these findings, we propose a method to classify\nthe API functions based on the memory usage rate. Further, we design a\nscheduler called MURS to mitigate the memory pressure. We implement MURS in\nSpark and conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of MURS. The\nresults show that when comparing to Spark, MURS can 1) decrease the execution\ntime of the submitted jobs by up to 65.8\\%, 2) mitigate the memory pressure in\nthe server by decreasing the garbage collection time by up to 81\\%, and 3)\nreduce the data spilling, and hence disk I/O, by approximately 90\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 09:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 11:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

Polymeric\nbeads consist of several Kuhn segments, and their motion is dictated by the\nHelmholtz energy of the sample, which is a sum of the entropic elasticity of\nchain strands between beads, slip springs, and nonbonded interactions. The\nentanglement effect is introduced by the slip springs, which are springs\nconnecting either nonsuccessive beads on the same chain or beads on different\npolymer chains. The terminal positions of slip springs are altered during the\nsimulation through a kinetic Monte Carlo hopping scheme, with rate-controlled\ncreation/destruction processes for the slip springs at chain ends. The rate\nconstants are consistent with the free energy function employed and satisfy\nmicroscopic reversibility at equilibrium. The free energy of nonbonded\ninteractions is derived from an appropriate equation of state, and it is\ncomputed as a functional of the local density by passing an orthogonal grid\nthrough the simulation box; accounting for it is necessary for reproducing the\ncorrect compressibility of the polymeric material. Parameters invoked by the\nmesoscopic model are derived from experimental volumetric and viscosity data or\nfrom atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, establishing a \"bottom-up\"\npredictive framework for conducting slip spring simulations of polymeric\nsystems of specific chemistry.

Previously\nreported magnetic data cover only a small fraction ($\\sim$3.5\\%) of $P_{\\rm\nrot}$, and were furthermore acquired when the star was in a photometric and\nspectroscopic `low state' at which the longitudinal magnetic field $\\langle\nB_z\\rangle$~was likely at a minimum. We have obtained a new ESPaDOnS magnetic\nmeasurement of HD 108, 6 years after the last reported measurement. The star is\nreturning to a spectroscopic high state, although its emission lines are still\nbelow their maximum observed strength, consistent with the proposed 55-year\nperiod. We measured $\\langle B_z\\rangle=-325 \\pm 45$ G, twice the strength of\nthe 2007-2009 observations, raising the lower limit of the dipole surface\nmagnetic field strength to $B_{\\rm d} \\ge 1$ kG. The simultaneous increase in\n$\\langle B_z\\rangle$~and emission strength is consistent with the oblique\nrotator model. Extrapolation of the $\\langle B_z\\rangle$~maximum via comparison\nof HD 108's spectroscopic and magnetic data with the similar Of?p star HD\n191612 suggests that $B_{\\rm d} > 2$~kG, yielding $t_{\\rm S, max}<3$~Myr,\ncompatible with the stellar age. These results also yield a better agreement\nbetween the observed X-ray luminosity and that predicted by the XADM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 10:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

In the late\nphase of planetary formation, when embryo-sized objects dominate the inner\nregion of the system, asteroids are also present and can provide additional\nmaterial for objects inside the habitable zone (HZ).

We use Markov\nRandom Fields (MRFs) to detect spatio-temporally coherent anomalies in gridded\nannual rainfall data across India from 1901-2005. MRFs are undirected graphical\nmodels where each node is associated with a \\{location,year\\} pair, with edges\nconnecting nodes representing adjacent locations or years.

Optimal values of latent state variables are estimated by maximizing\nthe posterior probability of the observations, using Gibbs sampling.

Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift\nof about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original\npower law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed\nR_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,\nwhere the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift\nexplains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15\nGeV/c.

Although the number\nof GRBs identified at z>6 remains small, they provide a unique window on\ntypical star-forming galaxies at that time, and thus are complementary to deep\nfield observations. We report the identification of the optical drop-out\nafterglow of Swift GRB 120923A in near-infrared Gemini-North imaging, and\nderive a redshift of z=7.84_{-0.12}^{+0.06} from VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy.

The X-ray\nand near-infrared afterglow were also faint, and in this sense it was a rather\ntypical long-duration GRB in terms of rest-frame luminosity. We present ground-\nand space-based follow-up observations spanning from X-ray to radio, and find\nthat a standard external shock model with a constant-density circumburst\nenvironment with density, n~4x10^-2 cm^-3 gives a good fit to the data.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lately emerged\nas a major approach to image classification. Most research on CNNs thus far has\nfocused on developing architectures such as the Inception and residual\nnetworks. The convolution layer is the core of the CNN, but few studies have\naddressed the convolution unit itself. In this paper, we introduce a\nconvolution unit called the active convolution unit (ACU). A new convolution\nhas no fixed shape, because of which we can define any form of convolution. Its\nshape can be learned through backpropagation during training. Our proposed unit\nhas a few advantages. First, the ACU is a generalization of convolution; it can\ndefine not only all conventional convolutions, but also convolutions with\nfractional pixel coordinates. We can freely change the shape of the\nconvolution, which provides greater freedom to form CNN structures. Second, the\nshape of the convolution is learned while training and there is no need to tune\nit by hand. Third, the ACU can learn better than a conventional unit, where we\nobtained the improvement simply by changing the conventional convolution to an\nACU. We tested our proposed method on plain and residual networks, and the\nresults showed significant improvement using our method on various datasets and\narchitectures in comparison with the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

This problem is known\nto be NP-hard in general. Our contribution is two fold: a polyhedral\ncharacterization and an approximation algorithm. Previously Chen et al. have\nshown that the stable matching polytope is integral if and only if the subgraph\nobtained after running phase one of Irving's algorithm is bipartite. We improve\nupon this result by showing that there are instances where this subgraph might\nnot be bipartite but one can further eliminate some edges and arrive at a\nbipartite subgraph. Our elimination procedure ensures that the set of stable\nmatchings remains the same, and thus the stable matching polytope of the final\nsubgraph contains the incidence vectors of all stable matchings of our original\ngraph. This allows us to characterize a larger class of instances for which the\nweighted stable matching problem is polynomial-time solvable. We also show that\nour edge elimination procedure is best possible, meaning that if the subgraph\nwe arrive at is not bipartite, then there is no bipartite subgraph that has the\nsame set of stable matchings as the original graph. We complement these results\nwith a $2$-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight stable matching\nproblem for instances where each agent has at most two possible partners in any\nstable matching. This is the first approximation result for any class of\ninstances with general weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Transmitting the entire 360 video in high quality over\nbandwidth-constrained networks from server to client for real-time playback is\nchallenging. In this paper we propose a multi-stream switching framework for VR\nvideo streaming: the server pre-encodes a set of VR video streams covering\ndifferent view ranges that account for server-client round trip time (RTT)\ndelay, and during streaming the server transmits and switches streams according\nto a user's detected head rotation angle. For a given RTT, we formulate an\noptimization to seek multiple VR streams of different view ranges and the\nhead-angle-to-stream mapping function simultaneously, in order to minimize the\nexpected distortion subject to bandwidth and storage constraints. We propose an\nalternating algorithm that, at each iteration, computes the optimal streams\nwhile keeping the mapping function fixed and vice versa. Experiments show that\nfor the same bandwidth, our multi-stream switching scheme outperforms a\nnon-switching single-stream approach by up to 2.9dB in PSNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 14:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

We consider this a serious shortcoming since we assume user modeling\nbased on mind maps to be equally effective as user modeling based on other\nitems. Hence, millions of mind-mapping users could benefit from user-modeling\napplications such as recommender systems. The objective of this doctoral thesis\nis to develop an effective user-modeling approach based on mind maps. To\nachieve this objective, we integrate a recommender system in our mind-mapping\nand reference-management software Docear. The recommender system builds user\nmodels based on the mind maps, and recommends research papers based on the user\nmodels. As part of our research, we identify several variables relating to\nmind-map-based user modeling, and evaluate the variables' impact on\nuser-modeling effectiveness with an offline evaluation, a user study, and an\nonline evaluation based on 430,893 recommendations displayed to 4,700 users. We\nfind, among others, that the number of analyzed nodes, modification time,\nvisibility of nodes, relations between nodes, and number of children and\nsiblings of a node affect the effectiveness of user modeling. When all\nvariables are combined in a favorable way, this novel approach achieves\nclick-through rates of 7.20%, which is nearly twice as effective as the best\nbaseline. In addition, we show that user modeling based on mind maps performs\nabout as well as user modeling based on other items, namely the research\narticles users downloaded or cited.

We demonstrate that XMDYN results are in good\nquantitative agreement with the above mentioned approaches, suggesting that the\ncurrent implementation of XMDYN is a viable approach to simulate the dynamics\nof x-ray-driven non-equilibrium dynamics in solids.

Developing a computational\nframework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step.

We propose\nMedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates\nand supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between\nobserved covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of\npatient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP\nkernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points\nwhile estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and\nperiodicity in patient observations.

If SgrA* is indeed a SMBH it will, in projection onto\nthe sky, have the largest event horizon and will certainly be the first and\nmost important target of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Very Long Baseline\nInterferometry (VLBI) observations currently being prepared.

In the GEE the orbital radius of the binary system is\nabout equal to the radius of the giant star, and the more compact companion\naccretes mass through an accretion disk. The accretion disk is assumed to\nlaunch two opposite jets that efficiently remove gas from the envelope along\nthe orbit of the companion.

To illustrate the main\nalgorithm ideas, we focus on the case of two and three layers in this work. The\nkey compression step in the H-FMM is based on a fact that the multipole\nexpansion for the sources of the free-space Green's function can be used also\nto compress the far field of the sources of the layered-media or domain Green's\nfunction, and a similar result exists for the translation operators for the\nmultipole and local expansions. The mathematical error analysis is shown\nrigorously by an image representation of the Sommerfeld spectral form of the\ndomain Green's function. As a result, in the H-FMM algorithm, both the\n\"multipole-to-multipole\" and \"local-to-local\" translation operators are the\nsame as those in the free-space case, allowing easy adaptation of existing\nfree-space FMM. All the spatially variant information of the domain Green's\nfunction are collected into the \"multipole-to-local\" translations and therefore\nthe FMM becomes \"heterogeneous\". The compressed representation further reduces\nthe cost of evaluating the domain Green's function when computing the local\ndirect interactions. Preliminary numerical experiments are presented to\ndemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm with much improved\nperformance over some existing methods for inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, we\nalso show that, due to the equivalence between the complex line image\nrepresentation and Sommerfeld integral representation of layered media Green's\nfunction, the new algorithm can be generalized to multi-layered media with\nminor modification where details for compression formulas, translation\noperators, and bookkeeping strategies will be addressed in a subsequent paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

We propose a two-stage cascaded face detection framework, Multi-Path\nRegion-based Convolutional Neural Network (MP-RCNN), that seamlessly combines a\ndeep neural network with a classic learning strategy, to tackle this challenge.\nThe first stage is a Multi-Path Region Proposal Network (MP-RPN) that proposes\nfaces at three different scales. It simultaneously utilizes three parallel\noutputs of the convolutional feature maps to predict multi-scale candidate face\nregions. The \"atrous\" convolution trick (convolution with up-sampled filters)\nand a newly proposed sampling layer for \"hard\" examples are embedded in MP-RPN\nto further boost its performance. The second stage is a Boosted Forests\nclassifier, which utilizes deep facial features pooled from inside the\ncandidate face regions as well as deep contextual features pooled from a larger\nregion surrounding the candidate face regions. This step is included to further\nremove hard negative samples.

However, in practice the high dimensional\nintegrations involved in the marginal likelihood (i.e. integrated over the\nstochastic processes) significantly complicates model fitting. Thus\nnon-standard computationally intensive procedures based on simulating the\nmarginal likelihood have so far only been proposed. In this paper, we describe\nan efficient method of implementation by demonstrating how the high dimensional\nintegrations involved in the marginal likelihood can be computed efficiently.\nSpecifically, by using a property of the multivariate normal distribution and\nthe standard marginal cumulative distribution function identity, we transform\nthe marginal likelihood so that the high dimensional integrations are contained\nin the cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution,\nwhich can then be efficiently evaluated. Hence maximum likelihood estimation\ncan be used to obtain parameter estimates and asymptotic standard errors (from\nthe observed information matrix) of model parameters.

Here we report\nexperimental radiation emission spectra from ultrarelativistic positrons in\nsilicon in a regime where both quantum and radiation-reaction effects dominate\nthe dynamics of the positrons. We found that each positron emits multiple\nphotons with energy comparable to its own energy, revealing the importance of\nquantum photon recoil. Moreover, the shape of the emission spectra indicates\nthat photon emissions occur in a nonlinear regime where positrons absorb\nseveral quanta from the crystal field. Our theoretical analysis shows that only\na full quantum theory of radiation reaction is capable of explaining the\nexperimental results, with radiation-reaction effects arising from the recoils\nundergone by the positrons during multiple photon emissions. This experiment is\nthe first fundamental test of quantum electrodynamics in a new regime where the\ndynamics of charged particles is determined not only by the external\nelectromagnetic fields but also by the radiation-field generated by the charges\nthemselves. Future experiments carried out in the same line will be able to, in\nprinciple, also shed light on the fundamental question about the structure of\nthe electromagnetic field close to elementary charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}
