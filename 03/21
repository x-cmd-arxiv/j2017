By analyzing a NR\nwaveform with mass ratio $8$ and dimensionless spins $+0.85$ obtained with the\nBAM code, we conclude that the model would benefit from NR simulations\nspecifically targeted at improving the postmerger-ringdown phenomenological\nfits for mass ratios $\\gtrsim 8$ and spins $\\gtrsim 0.8$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 16:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

With the emergence of mobile computing such\narchitectures became increasingly important and several techniques emerged to\nsupport in their specification. These techniques usually allow for the\nspecification of concrete architecture instances. Sometimes, however, it is\ndesired to focus on the specification of constraints, rather than concrete\narchitectures. Especially specifications of architecture patterns usually focus\non a few, important constraints, leaving out the details of the concrete\narchitecture implementing the pattern. With this article we introduce an\napproach to specify such constraints for dynamic architectures. To this end, we\nintroduce the notion of configuration traces as an abstract model for dynamic\narchitectures. Then, we introduce the notion of configuration trace assertions\nas a formal language based on linear temporal logic to specify constraints for\nsuch architectures. In addition, we also introduce the notion of configuration\ndiagrams to specify interfaces and certain common activation and connection\nconstraints in one single, graphical notation. The approach is well-suited to\nspecify patterns for dynamic architectures and verify them by means of formal\nanalyses. This is demonstrated by applying the approach to specify and verify\nthe Blackboard pattern for dynamic architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 16:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

To date, expressive efficiency analyses\nfocused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are\nrepresentationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the\nexpressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the\nobservation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways.\nWe focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering\nstate of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and\nanalyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that\ninterconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive\nefficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between\nintermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in\nlarge-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is\npractical and one that is not.

A Bayesian analysis using a standard\nGalactic model and these magnitude limits yields a host star mass $M_h = 0.21\n^{+0.21}_{-0.09}~ M_\\odot$, a planet mass of $m_p = 23.4\n^{+23.9}_{-9.9}~M_\\oplus$ at a projected separation of $a_\\perp =\n1.12^{+0.16}_{-0.17},$AU. This result illustrates excess flux in a high\nresolution image of a microlens-source system need not be due to the lens. It\nis important to check that the lens-source relative proper motion is consistent\nwith the microlensing prediction. The high resolution image analysis techniques\ndeveloped in this paper can be used to verify the WFIRST exoplanet microlensing\nsurvey mass measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 20:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The velocities\nof the molecular gas in both observations and our simulations fall in the range\nof $100-400$ km/s, much lower than expected if they fall from a few tens of kpc\nballistically. If the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is at rest, the ram pressure\nof the ICM only slightly reduces the velocity of the clouds. When we assume\nthat the clouds are actually \"fluffier\" because they are co-moving with a\nwarm-hot layer, the velocity becomes smaller. If we also consider the AGN wind\nin the cluster center by adding a wind profile measured from the simulation,\nthe clouds are further slowed down at small radii, and the resulting velocities\nare in general agreement with the observations and simulations. Because ram\npressure only affects gas but not stars, it can cause a separation between a\nfilament and young stars that formed in the filament as they move through the\nICM together.

Moreover, the external information on the variance is summarized by\nthe Bayesian meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) approach. To incorporate external\ninformation into the sample size re-estimation, we propose to update the MAP\nprior based on the results of the internal pilot study and to re-estimate the\nsample size using an estimator from the posterior.

Given the\nsignificant forecasts for network traffic growth to/from data centres,\neffective management of both data centre resources and of the wide area\nnetworks resources that provide access to those data centres will become\nincreasingly important. In this paper, we present an architecture for workload\nplacement, which uniquely employs a logically centralised controller that is\nboth network and data centre aware, which aims to place workloads to optimise\nthe use of both data centre and wide area network resources. We call this\napproach workload engineering. We present the results of a simulation study,\nwhere we use a reinforcement-learning based placement algorithm on the\ncontroller. Results of the study show this algorithm was able to place\nworkloads to make more efficient use of network and data centre resources and\nplaced ~5-8% more workloads than other heuristic placement algorithms\nconsidered, for the same installed capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 21:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 16:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

For the Crab Nebula as a reference source we\nfind no variability in the TeV band. Our main focus is the study of the TeV\nblazars Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501.

In the recently identified class of ultraluminous X-ray\npulsars, accretor is a neutron star and thus has a fairly small mass with a\nsmall Eddington limit. The accretion disc structure around such an object\naffects important observables such as equilibrium period, period derivative and\nthe size of the magnetosphere. We propose a model of a nearly-standard\naccretion disc interacting with the magnetosphere only in a thin layer near the\ninner disc rim. Our calculations show that the size of the magnetosphere may be\nrepresented as the classical Alfv\\'en radius times a dimensionless factor $\\xi$\nwhich depends on the disc thickness only. In the case of\nradiation-pressure-dominated disc, the size of the magnetosphere does not\ndepend on the mass accretion rate. In general, increasing the disc thickness\nleads to a larger magnetosphere size in units of the Alfv\\'en radius. For large\nenough mass accretion rates and magnetic moments, it is important to take into\naccount not only the pressure of the magnetic field and the radiation pressure\ninside the disc, but also the pressure of the radiation produced close to the\nsurface of the neutron star in accretion column. The magnetospheric size may\nincrease by up to factor of two as a result of the effects related to the disc\nthickness and the irradiation from the central source. Accounting for these\neffects reduces the estimate of the neutron star magnetic moment by a factor of\nseveral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 23:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Schroedinger proposed the equation to find the statistical property of a\nquantum particle on a finite time interval. It is called \"Schroedinger's\nfunctional equation\". Given probability distributions of a particle at initial\nand terminal times, it determines the joint distribution of a quantum particle\nat initial and terminal times so that a particle is Markovian. S. Bernstein\ngeneralized Schroedinger's idea and introduced the so-called Bernstein\nprocesses which are also called reciprocal processes or one-dimensional Markov\nrandom fields. The theory of stochastic differential equation for\nSchroedinger's functional equation was given by B. Jamison. The solution is\nDoob's h-path process with given two end point marginals.

In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph\ngenerative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically\ncoherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and\nexploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition\nGenerative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework\nbetween a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph\ndiscriminators.

The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level\nadversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence\nlevel and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial\ntraining of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with\nsmooth logical transition between sentence topics.

The comparison provides a direct\nassessment of the agreement of the numerics with Cox's theory and reveals a\ncritical feature of the numerical treatment of contact line dynamics: agreement\nis poor at small angles while it is better at large angles. This scaling factor\nis shown to depend only on $\\theta_\\Delta$ and the viscosity ratio $q$. In the\ncase of small $\\theta_e$, we use the prediction by Eggers [Phys. Rev. Lett.,\nvol. 93, pp 094502, 2004] of the critical capillary number for the\nLandau-Levich-Derjaguin forced dewetting transition. We generalize this\nprediction to large $\\theta_e$ and arbitrary $q$ and express the critical\ncapillary number as a function of $\\theta_e$ and $r_m$. An analogy can be drawn\nbetween $r_m$ and the numerical slip length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 03:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 20:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 14:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 19:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

The estimated modulation\nof binding energy for the 1s exciton is found to be 58.6% (70.5% for 2s, 78.9%\nfor 3s, 85% for 4s) by coating an Al$_2$O$_3$ layer on top, while the\ncorresponding reduction in quasi-particle bandgap is estimated to be 248 meV.\nSuch a direct evidence of large tunability of the binding energy of exciton\ncomplexes as well as the bandgap in monolayer TMDs holds promise of novel\ndevice applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 05:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 15:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

These objects are\nexpected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for\nfurther processing, specially for knowledge discovery, in order that\nappropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data\nitems captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to\nthe cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource\nwastage (e.g. network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has\nbeen proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge\ndiscovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited\ncomputational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither\nCloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone.\nTherefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build an\nsustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this paper, we review\nexisting approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in the Fog\ncomputing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case\nscenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common\nfeatures of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts\nin this domain. Based on our review, we further identify several major\nfunctionalities that ideal Fog computing platforms should support and a number\nof open challenges towards implementing them, so as to shed light on future\nresearch directions on realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart\ncities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 07:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

In such a magnetic field dependence characteristic sharp features are\nobserved, which are coming from Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) in a coupled\nelectron-nuclear spin system. For sensitive detection of such LAC-lines we use\nlock-in detection to measure the photoluminescence intensity. This experimental\ntechnique allows us to obtain new LAC lines.

The\noptical and near-infrared afterglow of this GRB had a peculiar spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) with a strong flux-drop at 8000 {\\AA} (4000 {\\AA}\nrest-frame) suggesting an unusually steep extinction curve. By analyzing the\ncontribution and physical properties of the host galaxy, we here aim at\nproviding additional information on the properties and origin of this steep,\nnon-standard extinction. We find that the strong flux-drop in the GRB afterglow\nspectrum at < 8000 {\\AA} and rise at < 4000 {\\AA} is well explained by the\ncombination of a steep extinction curve along the GRB line of sight and\ncontamination by the host galaxy light so that the scenario with an extreme\n2175 {\\AA} extinction bump can be excluded. We localise the GRB to be at a\nprojected distance of approximately 4 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy.\nBased on emission-line diagnostics of the four detected nebular lines, Halpha,\nHbeta, [O II] and [O III], we find the host to be a modestly star forming (SFR\n= 1.34 +/- 0.04 Msun yr^-1) and relatively metal poor (Z = 0.35^{+0.15}_{-0.11}\nZsun) galaxy with a large dust content, characterized by a measured visual\nattenuation of A_V = 1.74 +/- 0.41 mag, thus unexceptional in all its physical\nproperties. We model the extinction curve of the host-corrected afterglow and\nshow that the standard dust properties causing the reddening seen in the Local\nGroup are inadequate in describing the steep drop. We conclude that the steep\nextinction curve seen in the afterglow towards the GRB is of exotic origin, is\nsightline-dependent only and thus solely a consequence of the circumburst\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 09:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 11:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

In this paper, we propose an\napproach for layer-wise training of a deep network for the supervised\nclassification task. A transformation matrix of each layer is obtained by\nsolving an optimization aimed at a better representation where a subsequent\nlayer builds its representation on the top of the features produced by a\nprevious layer. We compared the performance of our approach with a DNN trained\nusing back-propagation which has same architecture as ours. Experimental\nresults on the real image datasets demonstrate efficacy of our approach. We\nalso performed kernel analysis of layer representations to validate the claim\nof better feature encoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 09:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Additionally, the dynamics of\nultralow-energy collisions is dominated by long-range interactions, i.e.,\n\"universal\" chemical forces.

Over two decades, the displacement\nspectrum is well-modeled by that of a damped harmonic oscillator driven by a\n$1/f$ thermal force, suggesting that the loss angle of the beam material is\nfrequency-independent. The inferred loss angle at 3.4 MHz, $\\phi = 4.5\\cdot\n10^{-6}$, agrees well with the quality factor ($Q$) of the fundamental beam\nmode ($\\phi = Q^{-1}$). In conjunction with $Q$ measurements made on higher\norder flexural modes, and accounting for the mode dependence of stress-induced\nloss dilution, we find that the intrinsic (undiluted) loss angle of the beam\nchanges by less than a factor of 2 between 50 kHz and 50 MHz.

The upcoming\nT2HK (with small matter effects and high statistics) and DUNE (with large\nmatter effects) experiments have been shown to have excellent sensitivity to\n$\\delta_{CP}$ and the neutrino mass hierarchy, respectively. The recent T2HKK\nproposal aims to improve the hierarchy sensitivity of T2HK by placing one of\nthe two tanks of the HK detector at a site in Korea, to collect data at $\\sim\n1100$ km baseline. In light of the fact that DUNE will anyway collect data at\n$\\sim 1300$ km, we explore whether it is advantageous to collect additional\nlong-baseline data as proposed with T2HKK, or to enhance the\n$\\delta_{CP}$-precision with the `conventional' T2HK by keeping both detector\ntanks in Japan. We do this by comparing the physics reach of these two options\nin conjunction with DUNE. We find that DUNE+T2HKK is better at excluding the\nwrong hierarchy, reaching $\\Delta\\chi^2 > 175$ irrespective of the true\nparameters. While DUNE+T2HK can measure $\\delta_{CP}$ with more precision in\nsome parts of the parameter space, both DUNE+T2HK and DUNE+T2HKK perform\nequally well near the current best-fit point, giving a $\\delta_{CP}$ width of\naround $15^\\circ$. The T2HKK setup allows us to correlate and constrain the\nsystematic errors between the two detectors collecting data from the same\nsource, which can increase the sensitivity of the experiment by up to 25\\%.\nSuch a reduction of the systematic errors is crucial for determining the\noscillation parameters with greater significance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 08:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Historical\ngeocoding is the process of transforming the indirect localisation information\nto direct localisation that can be placed on a map, which enables spatial\nanalysis and cross-referencing. Many efficient geocoders exist for current\naddresses, but they do not deal with the temporal aspect and are based on a\nstrict hierarchy (..., city, street, house number) that is hard or impossible\nto use with historical data. Indeed historical data are full of uncertainties\n(temporal aspect, semantic aspect, spatial precision, confidence in historical\nsource, ...) that can not be resolved, as there is no way to go back in time to\ncheck. We propose an open source, open data, extensible solution for geocoding\nthat is based on the building of gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects\nextracted from historical topographical maps.

Both detectors are surrounded by a highly reflective\nand scintillating multilayer polymer foil to increase the light collection\nefficiency and to veto surface backgrounds. While this study is motivated by\nthe CRESST experiment, the results are also relevant for other rare event\nsearches using scintillating cryogenic bolometers in the field of the search of\ndark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$).

Recent methods replace the non-convex regularization with $\\ell_1$ or\nnuclear norm relaxations. It is well known that this approach can be guaranteed\nto recover a near optimal solutions if a so called restricted isometry property\n(RIP) holds. On the other hand it is also known to perform soft thresholding\nwhich results in a shrinking bias which can degrade the solution.\n  In this paper we study an alternative non-convex regularization term. This\nformulation does not penalize elements that are larger than a certain threshold\nmaking it much less prone to small solutions. Our main theoretical results show\nthat if a RIP holds then the stationary points are often well separated, in the\nsense that their differences must be of high cardinality/rank. Thus, with a\nsuitable initial solution the approach is unlikely to fall into a bad local\nminima. Our numerical tests show that the approach is likely to converge to a\nbetter solution than standard $\\ell_1$/nuclear-norm relaxation even when\nstarting from trivial initializations. In many cases our results can also be\nused to verify global optimality of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 12:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Many databases on asteroid brightnesses (e.g. ALCDEF, WISE) are\npotential sources for extensive asteroid shape and spin modelling. Individual\nlightcurve inversion models require several apparitions and hundreds of data\npoints per target. However, we can analyse the coarse shape and spin\ndistributions over populations of at least thousands of targets even if there\nare only a few points and one apparition per asteroid. This is done by\nexamining the distribution of the brightness variations observed within the\nchosen population.\n  Aims. Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather\nthan individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this\napproach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of\nill-posedness, and practical applicability.\n  Methods. We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by\nconsidering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint\ndistribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are\nthe shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The\nmain advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions\nthat yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution.\nThe inverse problem can be treated linearly. Even though the inaccuracy of the\nmodel is considerable, databases of thousands of targets should yield some\ninformation on the distribution.\n  Results. We establish the theoretical soundness and the typical accuracy\nlimits of the approach both analytically and numerically. Using simulations, we\nderive a practical estimate of the model distribution in the (shape,\nspin)-plane.

Here we extend the model comparisons to kiloparsec scales,\ntaking into account hot shocked gas generated by supernovae, and a non-uniform\ndynamo-generated magnetic field at both large and small scales down to 4 pc\nspatial resolution. Radiative transfer calculations are used to model dust\nemission and polarization on the top of MHD simulations. We compute synthetic\nmaps of column density $N_H$, polarization fraction $p$, and polarization angle\ndispersion $S$, and study their dependencies on the important properties of the\nMHD simulations. These include the large-scale magnetic field and its\norientation, the small-scale magnetic field, and supernova-driven shocks.\nSimilar filament-like structures of $S$ as seen in the Planck all-sky maps are\nvisible in our synthetic results, although the smallest scale structures are\nabsent from our maps. Supernova-driven shock fronts and $S$ do not show\nsignificant correlation. Instead, $S$ can clearly be attributed to the\ndistribution of the small-scale magnetic field. We also find that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field influences the polarization properties, such that,\nfor a given strength of magnetic fluctuation, a strong plane-of-the-sky mean\nfield weakens the observed $S$, while strengthening $p$. The anticorrelation of\n$p$ and $S$, and decreasing $p$ as a function of $N_H$ are consistent across\nall synthetic observations. The magnetic fluctuations follow an exponential\ndistribution, rather than Gaussian, characteristic of flows with intermittent\nrepetitive shocks. The observed polarization properties and column densities\nare sensitive to the line of sight distance over which the emission is\nintegrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 12:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 02:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

We find that chemistry has in general very little effect on the\nnondimensional radius $\\xi_{\\rm out}$ which parametrizes the core stability.\nCores that are initially stable or unstable tend to stay near their initial\nstates, in terms of stability (i.e., $\\xi_{\\rm out} \\sim$ constant), as the\nchemistry develops.

Models, languages, and tools, that allow to obtain\nvaluable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are\ntypically represented as data cubes, and exploited using Online Analytical\nProcessing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is\nthe current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW.Since QB does\nnot include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have\nproposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the\nneed of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are represented on\nthe SW, we need tools to analyze them. However, writing efficient analytical\nqueries over SW cubes demands a deep knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. These skills\nare not common in typical analytical users. Also, OLAP languages like MDX are\nfar from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools\nto exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken\nto promote the publication of such data. We address this problem in this paper.\nOur approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using OLAP\noperations over cubes, without dealing with SW standards. For this, we devised\nCQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language\nthat operates over cubes. Using the metadata provided by QB4OLAP, we translate\nCQL queries into SPARQL. Then, we propose query improvement strategies to\nproduce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting SPARQL query optimization\ntechniques. We evaluate our approach using the Star-Schema benchmark, showing\nthat our proposal outperforms others.

Recent local scanning probe measurements of\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) interfaces indicated the existence of spatially\ninhomogeneous electrical current paths and electrostatic potential associated\nwith the structural domain formation in the tetragonal phase of STO. However,\nhow these effects impact the electron conduction in LAO/STO devices has not\nbeen fully studied. Here we report a study of temperature dependent electronic\ntransport in combination with the polarized light microscopy of structural\ndomains in mesoscopic scale LAO/STO devices. By reducing the spatial size of\nthe conductive interface to be comparable to the size of a single tetragonal\ndomain of STO, the anisotropy of interfacial electron conduction in\nrelationship to the domain wall and its direction was characterized in the\ntemperature range $T$=10-300K. It was found that the four-point resistance\nmeasured with current parallel to the domain wall in device is larger than the\nresistance measured perpendicular to the domain wall. This observation is\nqualitatively consistent with the current diverting effect from a more\nconductive domain wall within the sample. Among all the samples studied, the\nmaximum resistance ratio found is at least 10 and could be as large as 10$^5$\nat $T$=10K. This electronic anisotropy may have implications on other oxide\nhetero-interfaces and the further understanding of electronic/magnetic\nphenomena found in LAO/STO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 14:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

This approach automatically\nmakes available a fast discrete Fourier transform (FFT) on the data.\n  The key objective of the construction of spatial discretizations is the\nunique reconstruction of the trigonometric polynomial using the sampling values\nat the sampling nodes.

Assuming that the multivariate trigonometric polynomial under\nconsideration is a linear combination of $T$ trigonometric monomials, the\noversampling factor $M/T$ is independent of the spatial dimension and, roughly\nspeaking, with high probability only logarithmic in $T$, which is much better\nthan the oversampling factor that is expected when using one single rank-1\nlattice.\n  The newly developed approaches for the construction of spatial\ndiscretizations are probabilistic methods.

Numerical and observational studies indicate that the star formation rate\nand efficiency crucially depend on the mixture of solenoidal and compressive\nmodes in the turbulent acceleration field, which can be quantified by the\nturbulent driving parameter b. For purely solenoidal (divergence-free) driving\nprevious studies showed that b=1/3 and for entirely compressive (curl-free)\ndriving b=1. In this study, we determine the evolution of the turbulent driving\nparameter b in magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation\nand evolution. The clouds form due to the convergence of two flows of warm\nneutral gas. We explore different scenarios by varying the magnitude of the\ninitial turbulent perturbations in the flows. We show that the driving mode of\nthe turbulence within the cloud strongly fluctuates with time and exhibits no\nclear correlation with typical cloud properties, such as the cloud mass and the\n(Alfven) Mach number. We specifically find that $b$ strongly varies from b=0.3\nto b=0.8 on timescales t<5 Myr, where the timescale and range of variation can\nchange from cloud to cloud. This rapid change of b from solenoidal to\ncompressive driving is primarily associated with global contraction of the\ncloud and subsequent onset of star formation. We conclude that the effective\nturbulence driving parameter should be treated as a free parameter that can\nvary from solenoidal to compressive in both time and space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 14:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

It aims to estimate the central subspace\n(CS) without making distributional assumption. To overcome the\nlarge-$p$-small-$n$ problem we propose a new approach for SDR. Our method\ncombines the following ideas for high dimensional data analysis: (1) Randomly\npartition the covariates into subsets and use distance correlation (DC) to\nconstruct a sketch of envelope subspace with low dimension. (2) Obtain a sketch\nof the CS by applying conventional SDR method within the constructed envelope\nsubspace. (3) Repeat the above two steps for a few times and integrate these\nmultiple sketches to form the final estimate of the CS. We name the proposed\nSDR procedure \"integrated random-partition SDR (iRP-SDR)\". Comparing with\nexisting methods, iRP-SDR is less affected by the selection of tuning\nparameters.

We obtain the following results.\n  Recently, Adjiashvili [SODA 17] introduced a novel LP for the problem and\nused it to break the $2$-approximation barrier for instances when the maximum\ncost $M$ of an edge in $E$ is bounded by a constant; his algorithm computes a\n$1.96418+\\epsilon$ approximate solution in time $n^{{(M/\\epsilon^2)}^{O(1)}}$.\nUsing a simpler LP, we achieve ratio $\\frac{12}{7}+\\epsilon$ in time\n$2^{O(M/\\epsilon^2)} poly(n)$.This gives ratio better than $2$ for logarithmic\ncosts, and not only for constant costs.\n  One of the oldest open questions for the problem is whether for unit costs\n(when $M=1$) the standard LP-relaxation, so called Cut-LP, has integrality gap\nless than $2$.

A holy-grail\nsolution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter\nan input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during\ntraining), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes.\nHowever, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process\nmultiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle\nsignals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to\naddress the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as\nmanipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key\nparameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal (even unseen\nones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a\nfully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an\nimage-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet\nlearns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding\nsignal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to\nboth signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters\nfrom the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform\nhigh-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding\nsignals (e.g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds\nper image) even for unseen signals.

The latter was introduced by E. W. Stacy\nas a special family of lifetime distributions containing gamma, exponential\npower and Weibull distributions. These distributions seem to be very promising\nin the statistical description of many real phenomena being very convenient and\nalmost universal models for the description of statistical regularities in\ndiscrete data. Analytic properties of GNB distributions are studied. A GG\ndistribution is proved to be a mixed exponential distribution if and only if\nthe shape and exponent power parameters are no greater than one. The mixing\ndistribution is written out explicitly as a scale mixture of strictly stable\nlaws concentrated on the nonnegative halfline. As a corollary, the\nrepresentation is obtained for the GNB distribution as a mixed geometric\ndistribution. The corresponding scheme of Bernoulli trials with random\nprobability of success is considered. Within this scheme, a random analog of\nthe Poisson theorem is proved establishing the convergence of mixed binomial\ndistributions to mixed Poisson laws. Limit theorems are proved for random sums\nof independent random variables in which the number of summands has the GNB\ndistribution and the summands have both light- and heavy-tailed distributions.\nThe class of limit laws is wide enough and includes the so-called generalized\nvariance gamma distributions.

We conclude that the nonthermal\nnature of the Hawking spectrum leads to Planck-scale nonthermal correlations,\nshedding light on the information paradox in black hole evaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 21:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Custom correlation and standard deviation estimators\nconsider normal distribution of returns and market efficiency hypothesis. It\nforced investors to search more universal instruments of tail risk protection.\nOne of the possible solutions is a naive risk parity strategy, which avoids\nestimation of expected returns and correlations. The authors develop the idea\nfurther and propose a fractal distribution of returns as a core. This class of\ndistributions is more general as it does not imply strict limitations on risk\nevolution. The proposed model allows for modifying a rule for volatility\nestimation, thus, enhancing its explanatory power. It turns out that the latter\nimproves the performance metrics of an investment portfolio over the ten year\nperiod. The fractal model of volatility plays a significant protective role\nduring the periods of market abnormal drawdowns. Consequently, it may be useful\nfor a wide range of asset managers which incorporate innovative risk models\ninto globally allocated portfolios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 19:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 11:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

Graphene is of particular interest for the implementation of\npetahertz optoelectronics due to its unique transport properties, such as high\ncarrier mobility with near-ballistic transport and exceptionally strong\ncoupling to optical fields. The back action of carriers in response to an\noptical field is therefore of key importance towards applications.
