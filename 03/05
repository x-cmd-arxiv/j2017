In this paper, we fill\nthis gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through\nanalyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic\ncomplexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'\nECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic\ndevelopment and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of\nECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare\ndifferent measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with\nmonetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the\nnon-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have\nstronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate\nregressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other\nsocioeconomic factors.

As a result, the spin-connection fields, gauging\nthe local frame Lorentz symmetry group SO(1,3)_{LF}, appear in PGG much as\nphotons and gluons appear in SM. We propose that such an analogy may follow\nfrom their common emergent nature allowing to derive PGG in the same way as\nconventional gauge theories. In essence, we start with an arbitrary theory of\nsome vector and fermion fields which possesses only global spacetime\nsymmetries, such as Lorentz and translational invariance, in flat Minkowski\nspace. The two vector field multiplets involved are proposed to belong,\nrespectively, to the adjoint (A_{{\\mu}}^{ij}) and vector (e_{{\\mu}}^{i})\nrepresentations of the starting global Lorentz symmetry. We show that if these\nprototype vector fields are covariantly constrained,\nA_{{\\mu}}^{ij}A_{ij}^{{\\mu}}=M_{A} and e_{{\\mu}}^{i}e_{i}^{{\\mu}}=M_{e}, thus\ncausing a spontaneous violation of the accompanying global symmetries (M_{A,e}\nare their proposed violation scales), then the only possible theory compatible\nwith these length-preserving constraints is turned out to be the gauge\ninvariant PGG, while the corresponding massless (pseudo)Goldstone modes are\nnaturally collected in the emergent gauge fields of tetrads and\nspin-connections.

Using a simplified noise model that can\nbe analyzed exactly together with optimal statistical estimators, we compare\nWVA to a conventional measurement method. We find that introducing WVA indeed\nyields a much lower variance of the parameter of interest than does the\nconventional technique, optimized in the absence of any partitioning\nmeasurements. In contrast, a statistically optimal analysis that employs\npartitioning measurements, incorporating all partitioned results and their\nknown correlations, is found to yield an improvement -- typically slight --\nover the noise reduction achieved by WVA. This is because the simple WVA\ntechnique is not tailored to a given noise environment and therefore does not\nmake use of correlations between the different partitions. We also compare WVA\nto traditional background subtraction, a familiar technique where measurement\noutcomes are partitioned to eliminate unknown offsets or errors in calibration.\nSurprisingly, in our model background subtraction turns out to be a special\ncase of the optimal partitioning approach in the balanced case, possessing a\nsimilar typically slight advantage over WVA. These results give deeper insight\ninto the role of partitioning measurements, with or without post-selection, in\nenhancing measurement precision, which some have found puzzling.

A realistic dispersal structure which favors\nthe persistence of interacting ecological systems has been studied in [Holland\n\\& Hastings, Nature, 456:792--795 (2008)], where it is shown that a\nrandomization of the structure of dispersal network in a metapopulation model\nof prey and predator increases the species persistence via clustering,\nprolonged transient dynamics, and amplitudes of population fluctuations. In\nthis paper, by contrast, we show that a deterministic network topology in a\nmetapopulation can also favor asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics if\nspecies dispersal obeys a long-range interaction governed by a\ndistance-dependent power-law. To explore the effects of power-law coupling, we\ntake a realistic ecological model, namely the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in\neach patch (node) of the network of oscillators, and show that the coupled\nsystem is driven from synchrony to asynchrony with an increase in the power-law\nexponent. Moreover, to understand the relationship between species persistence\nand variations in power-law exponent, we compute correlation coefficient to\ncharacterize cluster formation, synchrony order parameter and median predator\namplitude. We further show that smaller metapopulations with less number of\npatches are more vulnerable to extinction as compared to larger metapopulations\nwith higher number of patches. We believe that the present work improves our\nunderstanding of the interconnection between the random network and\ndeterministic network in theoretical ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 18:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

This paper shows how to perform\nnonlinear blind source separation; i.e., how to determine if these signals are\nequal to linear or nonlinear mixtures of the state variables of two or more\nstatistically independent subsystems. First, the local distributions of\nmeasurement velocities are processed in order to derive vectors at each point\nin x-space. If the data are separable, each of these vectors must be directed\nalong a subspace of x-space that is traversed by varying the state variable of\none subsystem, while all other subsystems are kept constant. Because of this\nproperty, these vectors can be used to construct a small set of mappings, which\nmust contain the unmixing function, if it exists. Therefore, nonlinear blind\nsource separation can be performed by examining the separability of the data\nafter it has been transformed by each of these mappings. The method is\nanalytic, constructive, and model-independent. It is illustrated by blindly\nrecovering the separate utterances of two speakers from nonlinear combinations\nof their audio waveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 20:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Hanguard\nachieves a fine-grained, per-app protection through bridging the OS-level\nsituation awareness and the router-level per-flow control: each phone runs a\nnon-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access\nthe protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its\naccess decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after\nverifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. Hanguard\nuses a role-based access control (RBAC) schema which leverages type enforcement\n(TE) and multi-category security (MCS) primitives to define highly flexible\naccess control rules.

The aim of this study is to devise a strategy to\nadapt existing non-polarisable force fields upon addition of polarisation,\nbecause induction was already contained to an extent, implicitly, due to\nparametrisation against empirical data. Therefore, a fraction of the van der\nWaals interaction energy should be subtracted so that the Lennard-Jones terms\nonly account for dispersion and the Drude dipoles for induction.\nSymmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is used to resolve the dispersion\nand induction terms in dimers and to calculate scaling factors to reduce the\nLennard-Jones terms from the non-polarisable model. Simply adding Drude dipoles\nto an existing fixed-charge model already improves the prediction of transport\nproperties, increasing diffusion coefficients and lowering the viscosity.\nScaling down the Lennard-Jones terms leads to still faster dynamics and to\ndensities that match experiment extremely well. The concept developed here\nimproves the prediction of density and transport properties and can be adapted\nto other models and systems.

Molecular\ncloud structure can be understood as a fragmentation process driven by the\ninterplay of turbulence, magnetic fields, and gravity (acting on either a\ndynamical or ambipolar-diffusion time scale). This results in a natural way to\nunderstand filamentary structure as magnetic ribbons that have an apparent\nwidth that scales differently than the Jeans length.

The computational cost of performing\nthese calculations has to date been relatively high, impeding many important\napplications of these approaches. Here we present a correlated sampling\nmethodology for AFQMC which relies on error cancellation to dramatically\naccelerate the calculation of energy differences of relevance to chemical\ntransformations. In particular, we show that our correlated sampling-based\nAFQMC approach is capable of calculating redox properties, deprotonation\nfree-energies, and hydrogen abstraction energies in an efficient manner without\nsacrificing accuracy. We validate the computational protocol by calculating the\nionization potentials and electron affinities of the atoms contained in the G2\nTest Set, and then proceed to utilize a composite method, which treats\nfixed-geometry processes with correlated sampling-based AFQMC and relaxation\nenergies via MP2, to compute the ionization potential, deprotonation\nfree-energy, and the O-H bond disocciation energy of methanol, all to within\nchemical accuracy.

Previously reported experimental\nintensity distributions on the detector exhibit Gaussian distribution and our\nsimulations show that this is an indication that such electron sources must be\nat least partially coherent. This, in turn means that strictly speaking the Van\nCittert Zernike theorem cannot be applied, since it assumes an incoherent\nsource. The approach of applying the van Cittert Zernike theorem is examined in\nmore detail by performing simulations of interference patterns for the electron\nsources of different size and different coherence length, evaluating the\neffective source size from the extent of the simulated interference pattern and\ncomparing the obtained result with the pre-defined value. The intensity\ndistribution of the source is assumed to be Gaussian distributed, as it is\nobserved in experiments. The visibility or the contrast in the simulated\nholograms is found to be always less than 1 which agrees well with previously\nreported experimental results and thus can be explained solely by the Gaussian\nintensity distribution of the source. The effective source size estimated from\nthe extent of the interference pattern turns out to be of about 2-3 times\nlarger than the pre-defined size, but it is approximately equal to the\nintrinsic resolution of the imaging system.

To gain a better understanding of these binary systems and to\nsupport the AIDA mission, this paper investigates the creep stability of the\nDidymos primary by representing it as a cohesionless self-gravitating granular\naggregate subject to rotational acceleration. To achieve this goal, a\nsoft-sphere discrete element model (SSDEM) capable of simulating granular\nsystems in quasi-static states is implemented and a quasi-static spin-up\nprocedure is carried out. We devise three critical spin limits for the\nsimulated aggregates to indicate their critical states triggered by reshaping\nand surface shedding, internal structural deformation, and shear failure,\nrespectively. The failure condition and mode, and shear strength of an\naggregate can all be inferred from the three critical spin limits. The effects\nof arrangement and size distribution of constituent particles, bulk density,\nspin-up path, and interparticle friction are numerically explored. The results\nshow that the shear strength of a spinning self-gravitating aggregate depends\nstrongly on both its internal configuration and material parameters, while its\nfailure mode and mechanism are mainly affected by its internal configuration.\nAdditionally, this study provides some constraints on the possible physical\nproperties of the Didymos primary based on observational data and proposes a\nplausible formation mechanism for this binary system. With a bulk density\nconsistent with observational uncertainty and close to the maximum density\nallowed for the asteroid, the Didymos primary in certain configurations can\nremain geo-statically stable without including cohesion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 13:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Specially, in the non-cooperative power\ncontrol game, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated for each SBS to\nmaximize their energy efficiency (EE). By exploiting the properties of\nparameter-free fractional programming and the concept of perspective function,\nthe non-convex optimization problem for each SBS is transformed into an\nequivalent constrained convex optimization problem. Then, the constrained\nconvex optimization problem is converted into an unconstrained convex\noptimization problem by exploiting the mixed penalty function method. The\ninequality constraints are eliminated by introducing the logarithmic barrier\nfunctions and the equality constraint is eliminated by introducing the\nquadratic penalty function.
