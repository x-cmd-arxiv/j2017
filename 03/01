There is a\nplethora of methods to choose from today, each with their own advantages and\ndisadvantages. One requirement shared between all kNN based methods is the need\nfor a good representation and distance measure between samples.\n  We introduce a new method called differentiable boundary tree which allows\nfor learning deep kNN representations. We build on the recently proposed\nboundary tree algorithm which allows for efficient nearest neighbor\nclassification, regression and retrieval. By modelling traversals in the tree\nas stochastic events, we are able to form a differentiable cost function which\nis associated with the tree's predictions. Using a deep neural network to\ntransform the data and back-propagating through the tree allows us to learn\ngood representations for kNN methods.\n  We demonstrate that our method is able to learn suitable representations\nallowing for very efficient trees with a clearly interpretable structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Most previous studies have been carried out in a conventional model\nwhere a network of magnetic domains is considered and each domain has a\nconstant magnetic field. We investigate a more general model where a network of\ndomains is still assumed, but each domain has a helical magnetic field. We find\nthat the asymptotic behavior does not depend on the configuration of magnetic\nfields. Remarkably, we analytically obtain the asymptotic values of the\nvariance of polarization in the conventional model. When the helicity is small,\nwe show that there appears the damped oscillating behavior in the early stage\nof evolution. Moreover, we see that the constraints on the axion coupling and\nthe cosmological magnetic fields using polarization observations are affected\nby the magnetic field configuration. This is because the different transient\nbehavior of polarization dynamics is caused by the different magnetic field\nconfiguration. Recently, [C. Wang and D. Lai, J. Cosmol. Astropart.

In this\npaper we address three open questions posed by Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al., namely\n(a) detecting a target when the query response is a direction to an\napproximately shortest path to the target, (b) detecting a target when querying\na vertex that is an approximate median of the current candidates' set (instead\nof an exact one), and (c) detecting multiple targets, for which to the best of\nour knowledge no progress has been made so far. We resolve questions (a) and\n(b) by providing appropriate upper and lower bounds, as well as a new potential\n$\\Gamma$ that guarantees efficient target detection even by querying an\napproximate median each time. With respect to (c), we initiate a systematic\nstudy for detecting two targets in graphs and we identify sufficient conditions\non the queries that allow for strong (linear) lower bounds and strong\n(polylogarithmic) upper bounds for the number of queries. All of our positive\nresults can be derived using our new potential $\\Gamma$ that allows querying\napproximate medians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-20"}

V@R is a quantile-based risk measure and neglects extreme risks\nin the tail. V@R belongs to the family of distortion risk measures. A serious\ndeficiency of V@R is that firms can hide their total downside risk in corporate\nnetworks, unless a consolidated solvency balance sheet is required for each\neconomic scenario. In this case, they can largely reduce their total capital\nrequirements via appropriate transfer agreements within a network structure\nconsisting of sufficiently many entities and thereby circumvent capital\nregulation. We prove several versions of such a result for general distortion\nrisk measures of V@R-type, explicitly construct suitable allocations of the\nnetwork portfolio, and finally demonstrate how these findings can be extended\nbeyond distortion risk measures. We also discuss why consolidation requirements\ncannot completely eliminate this problem.

The model is motivated by adding to the\ngravity sector an extra spin-2 field interacting nonlocally with the physical\nmetric coupled to matter. The form of the nonlocal interaction is inspired by\nthe simplest form of the Deser-Woodard (DW) model, $\\alpha R\\frac{1}{\\Box}R$,\nwith one of the Ricci scalars being replaced by a constant $m^{2}$, and gravity\nis therefore modified in the infrared by adding a simple term of the form\n$m^2\\frac{1}{\\Box}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert term.

Reducing these data to high-precision photometric\ntime-series is challenging due to the wide point spread function (PSF) and the\nblending of stellar light in such dense regions. We developed an\nimage-subtraction-based K2 reduction pipeline that is applicable to both\ncrowded and sparse stellar fields. We applied our pipeline to the data-rich C0\nK2 super-stamp, containing the two open clusters, as well as to the neighboring\npostage stamps. In this paper, we present our image subtraction reduction\npipeline and demonstrate that this technique achieves ultra-high photometric\nprecision for sources in the C0 super-stamp. We extract the raw light curves of\n3960 stars taken from the UCAC4 and EPIC catalogs and de-trend them for\nsystematic effects. We compare our photometric results with the prior\nreductions published in the literature. For detrended, TFA-corrected sources in\nthe 12--12.25 $\\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range, we achieve a best 6.5 hour window\nrunning rms of 35 ppm falling to 100 ppm for fainter stars in the 14--14.25 $\n\\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range. For stars with $\\rm K_{p}> 14$, our detrended and\n6.5 hour binned light curves achieve the highest photometric precision.\nMoreover, all our TFA-corrected sources have higher precision on all time\nscales investigated. This work represents the first published image subtraction\nanalysis of a K2 super-stamp. This method will be particularly useful for\nanalyzing the Galactic bulge observations carried out during K2 campaign 9.

The most\nheavily-used recommendation frameworks assume user interactions that are\ncharacterized by a single relation. However, for many tasks, such as\nrecommendation in social networks, user-item interactions must be modeled as a\ncomplex network of multiple relations, not only a single relation. Recently\nresearch on multi-relational factorization and hybrid recommender models has\nshown that using extended meta-paths to capture additional information about\nboth users and items in the network can enhance the accuracy of recommendations\nin such networks. Most of this work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous\nnetworks, and to apply these techniques, weighted relations must be simplified\ninto binary ones. However, information associated with weighted edges, such as\nuser ratings, which may be crucial for recommendation, are lost in such\nbinarization. In this paper, we explore a random walk sampling method in which\nthe frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and apply this\ngenerate extended meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous networks.

For the\none-component case the third and fourth virial coefficients are calculated\nanalytically. It is shown that an adjustment of a single model parameter allows\nus to reproduce the third and fourth virial coefficients of the gas of hard\nspheres with small deviations from their exact values. A thorough comparison of\nthe compressibility factor and speed of sound of the developed model with the\none and two component Carnahan-Starling equation of state is made. It is shown\nthat the model with the induced surface tension is able to reproduce the\nresults of the Carnahan-Starling equation of state up to the packing fractions\n0.2-0.22 at which the usual Van der Waals equation of state is inapplicable. At\nhigher packing fractions the developed equation of state is softer than the gas\nof hard spheres and, hence, it breaks causality in the domain where the\nhadronic description is expected to be inapplicable. Using this equation of\nstate we develop an entirely new hadron resonance gas model and apply it to a\ndescription of the hadron yield ratios measured at AGS, SPS, RHIC and ALICE\nenergies of nuclear collisions. The achieved quality of the fit per degree of\nfreedom is about 1.08. We confirm that the strangeness enhancement factor has a\npeak at low AGS energies, while at and above the highest SPS energy of\ncollisions the chemical equilibrium of strangeness is observed. We argue that\nthe chemical equilibrium of strangeness, i.e. $\\gamma_s \\simeq 1$, observed\nabove the center of mass collision energy 4.3 GeV may be related to the\nhadronization of quark gluon bags which have the Hagedorn mass spectrum, and,\nhence, it may be a new signal for the onset of deconfinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 20:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 13:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

This effortful\ndesign process starts in stark contrast to the easiness with which people can\nuse language to describe real and imaginary environments. We present SceneSeer:\nan interactive text to 3D scene generation system that allows a user to design\n3D scenes using natural language. A user provides input text from which we\nextract explicit constraints on the objects that should appear in the scene.\nGiven these explicit constraints, the system then uses a spatial knowledge base\nlearned from an existing database of 3D scenes and 3D object models to infer an\narrangement of the objects forming a natural scene matching the input\ndescription. Using textual commands the user can then iteratively refine the\ncreated scene by adding, removing, replacing, and manipulating objects. We\nevaluate the quality of 3D scenes generated by SceneSeer in a perceptual\nevaluation experiment where we compare against manually designed scenes and\nsimpler baselines for 3D scene generation. We demonstrate how the generated\nscenes can be iteratively refined through simple natural language commands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 20:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Specifically, the\nproblem of optical phase imaging is considered and the quantum probe is taken\nto be a balanced coherent superposition of components with an arbitrary quantum\nstate in one mode and vacuum states in all the other modes, which is a\ngeneralization of the multi-mode NOON state. The analytical form for the\nquantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) is presented, which shows the performance by\nproviding a lower bound of the estimation uncertainty. It is shown that the\nNOON state has the worst performance among those in the class of the entangled\nstates considered. We also analyze in detail four different scenarios, which\nare the NOON state, the entangled coherent state, the entangled squeezed\ncoherent state, and the entangled squeezed vacuum state. From the comparison\namong these four states, we find that when the mean photon number is fixed, the\nsqueezed vacuum state has the smallest QCRB, followed by the squeezed coherent\nstate, entangled coherent state, and NOON state. We also illustrate that the\nbalanced entangled state can perform better than a more generalized unbalanced\nform studied in previous works for certain scenarios. Finally, we give an\nexperimental setup for producing a two-mode entangled state that can beat the\nNOON state in quantum metrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

However, two important performance issues prevent modern WiFi from\nreaching its potential: Increased latency under load caused by excessive\nqueueing (i.e. bufferbloat) and the 802.11 performance anomaly.\n  To remedy these issues, we present a novel two-part solution: We design a new\nqueueing scheme that eliminates bufferbloat in the wireless setting. Leveraging\nthis queueing scheme, we then design an airtime fairness scheduler that\noperates at the access point and doesn't require any changes to clients.\n  We evaluate our solution using both a theoretical model and experiments in a\ntestbed environment, formulating a suitable analytical model in the process.

(For\nexample, a statistical query (SQ) gives an estimate of $Ex_{x \\sim D}[q(x)]$\nfor any choice of the query function $q$ mapping $X$ to the reals, where $D$ is\nan unknown data distribution over $X$.) Yet some data analysis algorithms rely\non properties of functions that depend on multiple samples. Such algorithms\nwould be naturally implemented using $k$-wise queries each of which is\nspecified by a function $q$ mapping $X^k$ to the reals. Hence it is natural to\nask whether algorithms using $k$-wise queries can solve learning problems more\nefficiently and by how much.\n  Blum, Kalai and Wasserman (2003) showed that for any weak PAC learning\nproblem over a fixed distribution, the complexity of learning with $k$-wise SQs\nis smaller than the (unary) SQ complexity by a factor of at most $2^k$. We show\nthat for more general problems over distributions the picture is substantially\nricher. For every $k$, the complexity of distribution-independent PAC learning\nwith $k$-wise queries can be exponentially larger than learning with\n$(k+1)$-wise queries. We then give two approaches for simulating a $k$-wise\nquery using unary queries. The first approach exploits the structure of the\nproblem that needs to be solved. It generalizes and strengthens (exponentially)\nthe results of Blum et al.. It allows us to derive strong lower bounds for\nlearning DNF formulas and stochastic constraint satisfaction problems that hold\nagainst algorithms using $k$-wise queries.

The most extreme of\nthese, the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), are the subset of X-ray detected\noutflows with velocities higher than 10,000 km/s, believed to originate in\nrelativistic disc winds, a few hundred gravitational radii from the black hole.\nThe absorption features produced by these outflows are variable, but no clear\nlink has been found between the behaviour of the X-ray continuum and the energy\nor equivalent width of the outflow features due to the long time-scales of\nquasar variability. Here, we present the detection of multiple absorption lines\nfrom an extreme ultra-fast gas flow in the X-ray spectrum of the active\ngalactic nucleus IRAS 13224-3809, at 0.236+/-0.006 times the speed of light\n(71,000 km/s), where the absorption is strongly anti-correlated with the\nemission from the inner regions of the accretion disk.

We\nfind signatures of the wind simultaneously in both low and high energy\ndetectors, which are consistent with a single ionized outflow, linking the two\nphenomena. The detection of the wind responding to the emission from the inner\ndisk demonstrates a connection between accretion processes occurring on very\ndifferent scales, with the X-rays from within a few gravitational radii of the\nblack hole ionizing the relativistically outflowing gas as the flux rises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 22:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

This study focuses upon the problem of\ntheir ascent dynamics to provide an explanation of the periodic multiple\neruption events in large igneous provinces and hotspots. We demonstrate from\nphysical experiments that plumes can ascend in a continuous process to form a\nsingle large head trailing into a long slender tail, typically described in the\nliterature only under specific physical conditions. Alternatively, they ascend\nin a pulsating fashion, and produce multiple in-axis heads of varying\ndimensions. Based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, we performed\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to constrain the\nthermo-mechanical conditions that decide the continuous versus pulsating\ndynamics. Our CFD simulations suggest the density ($\\rho^*$) and the viscosity\n($R$) ratios of the ambient to the plume materials and the influx rates ($Re$)\nare the prime factors in controlling the ascent dynamics. Conditions with large\n$R$ ($>$50) develop pulsating plumes, which are sustained preferentially under\nlow $\\rho^*$ and $Re$ conditions. Again, the increasing temperature difference\nbetween the plume and the ambient medium is found to promote pulsating\nbehaviour. From these CFD simulations we show the thermal structures of a\nplume, and predict the peak thermal events near the surface that commence\nperiodically as pulses with a time interval of 1.4-3 Ma. The pulsating plume\nmodel explains the multiple eruption events in the Deccan Traps in India, where\nthe time scale of their intervals estimated from the available\n$^{40}Ar$/$^{39}Ar$ geochronological data shows an excellent match with our\nsimulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

These methods suffer from two\nmajor drawbacks: 1) the set of basic units is fixed, such as the set of words,\ncharacters or phonemes in speech recognition, and 2) the decomposition of\ntarget sequences is fixed. These drawbacks usually result in sub-optimal\nperformance of modeling sequences. In this pa- per, we extend the popular CTC\nloss criterion to alleviate these limitations, and propose a new loss function\ncalled Gram-CTC. While preserving the advantages of CTC, Gram-CTC automatically\nlearns the best set of basic units (grams), as well as the most suitable\ndecomposition of tar- get sequences. Unlike CTC, Gram-CTC allows the model to\noutput variable number of characters at each time step, which enables the model\nto capture longer term dependency and improves the computational efficiency. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed Gram-CTC improves CTC in terms of both\nperformance and efficiency on the large vocabulary speech recognition task at\nmultiple scales of data, and that with Gram-CTC we can outperform the\nstate-of-the-art on a standard speech benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 00:59:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 00:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

We are concerned mainly\nwith the origin of the boson peak and the connection between the boson peak and\nthe transverse Ioffe-Regel limit. For all types of disorders, we observe the\nemergence of the boson peak and Ioffe-Regel limits. With increasing disorder,\nthe boson peak frequency $\\omega_{BP}$, transverse Ioffe-Regel frequency\n$\\omega_{IR}^T$, and longitudinal Ioffe-Regel frequency $\\omega_{IR}^L$ all\ndecrease. We find that there are two ways for the boson peak to form:\ndeveloping from and coexisting with (but remaining independent of) the\ntransverse van Hove singularity without and with local coordination number\nfluctuation. In the presence of a single type of disorder, $\\omega_{IR}^T\\ge\n\\omega_{BP}$, and $\\omega_{IR}^T\\approx \\omega_{BP}$ only when the disorder is\nsufficiently strong and causes spatial fluctuation of the local coordination\nnumber. Moreover, if there is no positional disorder, $\\omega_{IR}^T\\approx\n\\omega_{IR}^L$. Therefore, the argument that the boson peak is equivalent to\nthe transverse Ioffe-Regel limit is not general.

We further combine two types\nof disorders to cause disorder in both the local coordination number and\nlattice site position. The density of vibrational states of the resulting\nnetworks resembles that of marginally jammed solids well.

Finally, we illustrate two applications of the\nproposed consensus algorithm in clustered consensus and in bearing-based\nformation control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 04:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 05:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 06:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Most researchers use these supervised\nmodels since, it is argued, they can exploit more knowledge of the projects.\n  At FSE'16, Yang et al. reported startling results where unsupervised defect\npredictors outperformed supervised predictors for effort-aware just-in-time\ndefect prediction.

The three coarse-grained models differ in\nterms of treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions and water\npolarizability. The NP-membrane interaction consists in the transition from a\nmetastable NP- membrane complex, in which the NP is only partially embedded in\nthe membrane, to a configuration in which the NP is anchored to both membrane\nleaflets. All the three coarse grained models provide a description of the\nmetastable NP-membrane complex that is consistent with that obtained using an\natomistic force field. As for the anchoring transition, the polarizable- water\nMartini correctly describes the molecular mechanisms and the energetics of the\ntransition. The standard version of the Martini model, instead, underestimates\nthe free energy barriers for anchoring and does not completely capture the\nmembrane deformations involved in the transition process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 06:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Four periods of eclipses - 94.2, 8.65, 1.52 and 1.43\nd - have been observed by the Kepler satellite, and three point sources (A, B,\nand C) are seen in high angular resolution images.\n  From spectroscopic observations made with the HIDES spectrograph attached to\nthe 1.88-m telescope of the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), for the\nfirst time we calculated radial velocities (RVs) of the component B - a pair of\nG-type stars - and combined them with Kepler photometry in order to obtain\nabsolute physical parameters of this pair.

(1) Network decomposition: it can decompose a trained neural network\ninto multiple small independent networks thus dividing the problem and reducing\nthe computation time. (2) Training assessment: the appropriateness of a trained\nresult with a given hyperparameter or randomly chosen initial parameters can be\nevaluated by using a modularity index.

In the case of\nthe so-called Toothbrush relic, the shock Mach number estimated from X-ray\nobservations ($M_{\\rm X}\\approx1.2-1.5$) is substantially weaker than that\ninferred from the radio spectral index ($M_{\\rm rad}\\approx2.8$).Toward\nunderstanding such a discrepancy, we here consider the following diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA) models:(1) weak-shock models with $M_{\\rm s}\\lesssim\n2$ and a preexisting population of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) with a flat\nenergy spectrum,and (2) strong-shock models with $M_{\\rm s}\\approx3$ and either\nshock-generated suprathermal electrons or preexisting fossil CRe. We calculate\nthe synchrotron emission from the accelerated CRe, following the time evolution\nof the electron DSA, and subsequent radiative cooling and postshock turbulent\nacceleration (TA). We find that both models could reproduce reasonably well the\nobserved integrated radio spectrum of the Toothbrush relic, but the observed\nbroad transverse profile requires the stochastic acceleration by downstream\nturbulence, which we label \"turbulent acceleration\" or TA to distinguish it\nfrom DSA. Moreover, to account for the almost uniform radio spectral index\nprofile along the length of the relic, the weak-shock models require a preshock\nregion over 400~kpc with a uniform population of preexisting CRe with a high\ncutoff energy ($\\gtrsim 40$ GeV). Due to the short cooling time, it is\nchallenging to explain the origin of such energetic electrons.

This approach directly addresses code portability, leaving to\ncompilers the support of each different accelerator, but one has to carefully\nassess the relative costs of portable approaches versus computing efficiency.\nIn this paper we address precisely this issue, using as a test-bench a\nmassively parallel Lattice Boltzmann algorithm. We first describe our\nmulti-node implementation and optimization of the algorithm, using OpenACC and\nMPI. We then benchmark the code on a variety of processors, including\ntraditional CPUs and GPUs, and make accurate performance comparisons with other\nGPU implementations of the same algorithm using CUDA and OpenCL. We also asses\nthe performance impact associated to portable programming, and the actual\nportability and performance-portability of OpenACC-based applications across\nseveral state-of-the- art architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 09:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

We introduce a novel\nplanning method based on trajectory optimisation to plan safe and efficient\npaths in continuous occupancy maps.

In the\nneighborhood of the critical point, the latency phase corresponds to the\ndiffusion time over the critical region, and the S-growth to the fast\nconvergence that follows.

Bridges when $x=z=0$ are\nparticularly interesting because they model the trajectory of the frequency of\nan allele which appears at a time, then is lost by random drift or mutation\nafter a time $T$. The coalescent genealogy back in time of a population in a\nneutral Wright-Fisher diffusion process is well understood. In this paper we\nobtain a new interpretation of the coalescent genealogy of the population in a\nbridge from a time $t\\in (0,T)$. In a bridge with allele frequencies of 0 at\ntimes 0 and $T$ the coalescence structure is that the population coalesces in\ntwo directions from $t$ to $0$ and $t$ to $T$ such that there is just one\nlineage of the allele under consideration at times $0$ and $T$. The genealogy\nin Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges with selection is more complex than in the\nneutral model, but still with the property of the population branching and\ncoalescing in two directions from time $t\\in (0,T)$. The density of the\nfrequency of an allele at time $t$ is expressed in a way that shows coalescence\nin the two directions. A new algorithm for exact simulation of a neutral\nWright-Fisher bridge is derived. This follows from knowing the density of the\nfrequency in a bridge and exact simulation from the Wright-Fisher diffusion.\nThe genealogy of the neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is also modelled by branching\nP\\'olya urns, extending a representation in a Wright-Fisher diffusion. This is\na new very interesting representation that relates Wright-Fisher bridges to\nclassical urn models in a Bayesian setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 10:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 13:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 14:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Classical theory predicts the\nencircling accretion disk is unstable, as do some self-consistent MHD\nsimulations of the flow. Yet observations of strongly accreting sources\ngenerally fail to exhibit cyclic or unstable dynamics on the expected\ntimescales. This paper checks whether turbulent fluctuations impede thermal\ninstability. It also asks if it makes sense to conduct linear stability\nanalyses on a turbulent background. These issues are explored with a set of MRI\nsimulations in thermally unstable local boxes in combination with stochastic\nequations that approximate the disk energetics. These models show that the\ndisk's thermal behaviour deviates significantly from laminar theory, though\nultimately a thermal runaway does occur. We find that the disk temperature\nevolves as a biased random walk, rather than increasing exponentially, and thus\ngenerates a broad spread of outcomes, with instability often delayed for\nseveral thermal times. We construct a statistical theory that describes some of\nthis behaviour, emphasising the importance of the `escape time' and its\nassociated probability distribution. In conclusion, turbulent fluctuations on\nthere own cannot stabilise a disk, but they can weaken and delay thermal\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 10:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Despite remarkable\nadvances have been achieved in the past decades for various TE systems, the\nenergy conversion efficiencies of TE devices, which is characterized by a\ndimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT ), remain a generally poor factor that\nseverely limits their competitiveness and range of employment. The bottleneck\nfor substantially boosting ZT coefficient lies in the strong interdependence of\nthe physical parameters involved in electronic and phononic transport. Here, we\npropose a new strategy of incorporating nanotwinned structures to decouple the\nelectronic and phononic transport. Combining the new concept of nanotwin with\nthe previously widely used nanocrystalline approach, the power factor of the Si\nnanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures is enhanced by 120% compared to bulk\ncrystalline Si, while the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced to a level\nwell below the amorphous limit, yielding a theoretical limit of 0.43 for ZT\ncoefficient at room temperature. This value is almost two orders of magnitude\nlarger than that for bulk Si and twice of the polycrystalline Si. Even for the\nexperimentally existing nanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures (e.g. grain\nsize of 5 nm), the ZT coefficient can be as high as 0.2 at room temperature,\nwhich is the highest ZT value among all the Si based bulk nanostructures so\nfar. Such substantial improvement stems from two aspects: (1) the improvement\nof the power factor is caused by the increase of Seebeck coefficient\n(degeneracy of the band valley) and the enhancement of electrical conductivity\n(the reduction of the effective band mass); (2) the significant reduction of\nthe lattice thermal conductivity is mainly caused by the extremely strong\nphonon-grain boundary and phonon-twin boundary scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 11:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Under\nsome conditions, funding is either a cost or a benefit, i.e., one of the\nlending/borrowing rates does not play a role in pricing derivatives. When\nderivatives are priced, considering different lending/borrowing rates leads to\nsemi-linear BSDEs and PDEs, and thus it is necessary to solve the equations\nnumerically. However, once it can be guaranteed that only one of the rates\naffects pricing, linear equations can be recovered and analytical formulae can\nbe derived. Moreover, as a byproduct, our results explain how debt value\nadjustment (DVA) and funding benefits are dissimilar. It is often believed that\nconsidering both DVA and funding benefits results in a double-counting issue\nbut it will be shown that the two components are affected by different\nmathematical structures of derivative transactions.

This widens the\napplicability and improves, up to constants, the desired efficient acceleration\nof previous variance reduction methods, all of which still assume knowledge of\n$L$ (and, hence, are not robust against its estimate). Precisely, compared to\nthe iteration and oracle complexities of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ of\nprevious robust methods with a small stepsize policy, our robust method obtains\nthe faster iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ with oracle\ncomplexity of $(\\ln L)\\mathcal{O}(d\\epsilon^{-2})$ (up to logs).

Reaching such competency in areas such as astronomy and physics\nhas long been known to be challenging. The movement from everyday conceptions\nof the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with\npitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the\ndisciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational\nconsideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and\nlecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to\npropose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is\nfocused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as\nan overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and\nlecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could\ndiscern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. 137\npeople from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a\nhermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the\nformulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD,\nreflecting a view of participants' competence levels. The ADD reveals four\nincreasing levels of disciplinary discernment: Identification, Explanation,\nAppreciation, and Evaluation. This facilitates the identification of a clear\nrelationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary\ndiscernment. The analytical outcomes of the study suggest how teachers of\nscience, after using the ADD to assess the students disciplinary knowledge, may\nattain new insights into how to create more effective learning environments by\nexplicitly crafting their teaching to support the crossing of boundaries in the\nADD model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 12:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

In spatially extended systems,\nparticularly in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible responses,\nincluding critical transitions, gradual transitions and locally confined\nresponses. Here, we use the context of vegetation dynamics in drylands in order\nto study the response of pattern-forming ecosystems to oscillating\nprecipitation and local disturbances. We focus on two precipitation ranges, a\nbistability range of bare soil with a patterned vegetation state, and a\nbistability range of uniform vegetation with a patterned vegetation state. In\nthese ranges, there are many different stable states, which allow for both\nabrupt and gradual transitions between the system states to occur. We find that\nlarge amplitude oscillations of the precipitation rate can lead to a collapse\nof the vegetation in one range, while in the other range, they result in the\nconvergence to a patterned state with a preferred wavelength. In addition, we\nshow that a series of local disturbances results in the collapse of the\nvegetation in one range, while it drives the system toward fluctuations around\na finite average biomass in the other range. Moreover, it is shown that under\ncertain conditions, local disturbances can actually increase the overall\nvegetation density. These significant differences in the system response are\nattributed to the existence of localized states in one of the bistability\nranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Hence, its\nsurface material may be easily decomposed in near-sun environment. Phaethon's\nspectrum exhibits extremely blue-slope in the VIS-NIR region (so-called\nPhaethon Blue). Another candidate large member of the PGC, (155140) 2005 UD,\nshows a B/F-type color, however with a C-type-like red color over its ~1/4\nrotational part, which implies an exposition of less metamorphosed primordial\ninternal structure of the PGC precursor by a splitting or breakup event long\nago. If so, some rotational part of Phaethon should show the C-type color as\nwell as 2005 UD. Hence, we carried out the time-series VIS-spectroscopic\nobservations of Phaethon using 1-m telescope in order to detect such a\nsignature. Also, R-band photometries were simultaneously performed in order to\ncomplement our spectroscopy. Consequently, we obtained a total of 68\nVIS-spectrophotometric data, 78% of which show the B-type blue-color, as\nagainst the rest of 22% showing the C-type red-color. We successfully acquired\nrotationally time-resolved spectroscopic data, of which particular rotational\nphase shows a red-spectral slope as the C-type color, as 2005 UD does,\nsuggesting longitudinal inhomogeneity on Phaethon's surface. We constrained\nthis C-type red-colored area in the mid-latitude in Phaethon's southern\nhemisphere based on the rotationally time-resolved spectroscopy along with\nPhaethon's axial rotation state, of which size suggests the impact-induced\norigin of the PGC.

However, most existing methods only consider the nonlocal\nself-similarity (NSS) prior of noisy input image. That is, the similar patches\nare collected only from degraded input, which makes the quality of image\ndenoising largely depend on the input itself. However, such methods often\nsuffer from a common drawback that the denoising performance may degrade\nquickly with increasing noise levels. In this paper we propose a new prior\nmodel, called group sparsity residual constraint (GSRC). Unlike the\nconventional group-based sparse representation denoising methods, two kinds of\nprior, namely, the NSS priors of noisy and pre-filtered images, are used in\nGSRC. In particular, we integrate these two NSS priors through the mechanism of\nsparsity residual, and thus, the task of image denoising is converted to the\nproblem of reducing the group sparsity residual. To this end, we first obtain a\ngood estimation of the group sparse coefficients of the original image by\npre-filtering, and then the group sparse coefficients of the noisy image are\nused to approximate this estimation. To improve the accuracy of the nonlocal\nsimilar patch selection, an adaptive patch search scheme is designed.\nFurthermore, to fuse these two NSS prior better, an effective iterative\nshrinkage algorithm is developed to solve the proposed GSRC model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed GSRC modeling outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art denoising methods in terms of the objective and the perceptual\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 20:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 03:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 06:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 08:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

The model is kept intentionally minimal, avoiding the\nintroduction of many degrees of freedom, couplings and mass scales. In stark\ncontrast to $\\Lambda$CDM, for natural values of the parameters, the model\nattains transient accelerated expansion, which avoids the future horizon\nproblem, while it maintains the field displacement mildly sub-Planckian such\nthat the flatness of the quintessential tail is not lifted by radiative\ncorrections and violations of the equivalence principle (fifth force) are under\ncontrol. In particular, the required value of the cosmological constant is near\nthe eletroweak scale. Attention is paid to the reheating of the Universe, which\navoids gravitino overproduction and respects nucleosynthesis constraints.\nKination is treated in a model independent way. A spike in gravitational waves,\ndue to kination, is found not to disturb nucleosynthesis as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 14:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

It is customarily assumed that this\ncollapse occurs along an equal-time hypersurface, say, t = 0. However, such a\nna\\\"ive instantaneous collapse process is inconsistent with relativity, because\nthe equal-time hypersurfaces of different inertial reference frames are\ndifferent. The attempts at implementation of instantaneous collapse in several\ndifferent reference frames then lead to violations of probability conservation\nand violations of the scalar character of the probability contained in given\nvolume elements. This problem affects not only the Copenhagen interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, but also other interpretations in which it is still\nnecessary to specify what changes in probabilities occur when and where in a\nmanner consistent with relativistic spacetime geometry. In the 1980s Schlieder\nand Hellwig and Kraus proposed that collapse of the probability distribution\nalong the past light cone of the measurement point avoids these difficulties\nand leads to a Lorentz-invariant collapse scenario. Their proposal received\nlittle attention and some negative criticisms. In this paper I argue that the\nproposed past-light cone collapse is not only reasonable, but is compelled by\nLorentz invariance of probability conservation, and is equally valid for the\nspatial probability distributions in quantum mechanics and for those in a game\nof chance, for instance, the probability distribution for a game with playing\ncards scattered over some spatial region. I examine the objections that have\nbeen made to the past-light-cone collapse scenario and show that these\nobjections are not valid. Finally, I propose two possible interferometer\nexperiments that can serve as direct tests of past-light-cone collapse, one\nwith an atom interferometer, and the other with a light interferometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

The only sign of current star formation in this big\ngalaxy is the HII region SH2, an isolated star cluster complex with a ring-like\nmorphology and an estimated age of 0.1 Gyr at a galactocentric distance of\nabout 35 kpc. A nearby intermediate-age globular cluster, surrounded by weak\nline emission and a few more young star clusters, is kinematically associated.\nThe origin of this complex is enigmatic. The nebular emission lines permit a\nmetallicity determination which can discriminate between a dwarf galaxy or\nother possible precursors. We used the Integrated Field Unit of the VIMOS\ninstrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to\nstudy the morphology, kinematics, and metallicity employing line maps, velocity\nmaps, and line diagnostics of a few characteristic spectra. The line ratios of\ndifferent spectra vary, indicating highly structured HII regions, but define a\nlocus of uniform metallicity. The strong-line diagnostic diagrams and empirical\ncalibrations point to a nearly solar or even super-solar oxygen abundance. The\nvelocity dispersion of the gas is highest in the region offset from the bright\nclusters. Star formation may be active on a low level. There is evidence for a\nlarge-scale disk-like structure in the region of SH2, which would make the\nsimilar radial velocity of the nearby globular cluster easier to understand.\nThe high metallicity does not fit to a dwarf galaxy as progenitor. We favour\nthe scenario of a free-floating gaseous complex having its origin in the merger\n2 Gyr ago. Over a long period the densities increased secularly until finally\nthe threshold for star formation was reached. SH2 illustrates how massive star\nclusters can form outside starbursts and without a considerable field\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

A representative case is liquid helium, in which\nzero-point vibrations of the helium atoms prevent its solidification at low\ntemperatures. A similar behaviour is found for the internal degrees of freedom\nin electrons. Among the most prominent is a quantum spin liquid (QSL), in which\nlocalized spins are highly correlated but fluctuate even at absolute zero.\nRecently, a coupling of spins with other degrees of freedom has been proposed\nas an innovative approach to generate even more fascinating QSLs such as\norbital--spin liquids. However, such ideas are limited to the internal degrees\nof freedom in electrons. Here, we demonstrate that a coupling of localized\nspins with the zero-point motion of hydrogen atoms (proton fluctuations) in a\nhydrogen-bonded organic Mott insulator provides a new class of QSLs. We find\nthat a divergent dielectric behaviour towards a hydrogen-bond order is\nsuppressed by the quantum proton fluctuations, resulting in a quantum\nparaelectric (QPE) state. Furthermore, our thermal-transport measurements\nreveal that a QSL state with gapless spin excitations rapidly emerges upon\nentering the QPE state. These findings indicate that the quantum proton\nfluctuations give rise to a novel QSL --- a quantum-disordered state of\nmagnetic and electric dipoles --- through the coupling between the electron and\nproton degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

This opens up the possibility\nof creating, storing, and manipulating non-Gaussian quantum states in\nmechanical degrees of freedom. However, before sophisticated quantum control of\nmechanical motion can be achieved, we must realize systems with long coherence\ntimes while maintaining a sufficient interaction strength. These systems should\nbe implemented in a simple and robust manner that allows for increasing\ncomplexity and scalability in the future. Here we experimentally demonstrate a\nhigh frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a\nsuperconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction. In contrast to previous\nexperiments with qubit-mechanical systems, our device requires only simple\nfabrication methods, extends coherence times to many microseconds, and provides\ncontrollable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We use this system to\ndemonstrate basic quantum operations on the coupled qubit-phonon system.\nStraightforward improvements to the current device will allow for advanced\nprotocols analogous to what has been shown in optical and microwave resonators,\nresulting in a novel resource for implementing hybrid quantum technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 15:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

We aim at measuring the\nLyman continuum escape fraction, which is one of the key parameters to compute\nthe contribution of star-forming galaxies to the UV background.

Also,\nthe need for a new standardization body in addition to those who exist is\nstated that will motivate governments to invest more on IoT development.\nHowever, to show the importance of proposed CoT, a brief review on IoT present\nstatus is performed and then some terminologies and classification of IoT\nnetworks is presented. This classification helps manufacturers to gain a proper\nview for their future products development. Then, observing from production\npoint of view the need for CoT is highlighted. Finally, as smart systems may\nwork in different dimensions of applications via internet or intranet\nconnectivity, the basic specifications of proposed CoT are presented.\nConsequently, due to nature of CoTs, a new multi- dimension multi-hierarchy\ncontrol strategy is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

Even though modern studies of Bianchi\nmodular forms go back to the mid 1960's, most of the fundamental problems\nsurrounding their theory are still wide open. Only for certain types of Bianchi\nmodular forms, which we will call non-genuine, it is possible at present to\ndevelop dimension formulas: They are (twists of) those forms which arise from\nelliptic cuspidal modular forms via the Langlands Base-Change procedure, or\narise from a quadratic extension of the imaginary quadratic field via\nautomorphic induction (so-called CM-forms). The remaining Bianchi modular forms\nare what we call genuine, and they are of interest for an extension of the\nmodularity theorem (formerly the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, crucial in the\nproof of Femat's Last Theorem) to imaginary quadratic fields. In a preceding\npaper by Rahm and Sengun, an extreme paucity of genuine cuspidal Bianchi\nmodular forms has been reported, but those and other computations were\nrestricted to level One. In this paper, we are extending the formulas for the\nnon-genuine Bianchi modular forms to deeper levels, and we are able to spot the\nfirst, rare instances of genuine forms at deeper level and heavier weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}
