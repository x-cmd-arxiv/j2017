Methods: From the spectroscopic follow-ups of the ATLASGAL TOP100\nsample, we selected several multiplets of CH3CN, CH3CCH, and CH3OH emission\nlines to derive and compare the physical properties of the gas in the clumps\nalong the evolutionary sequence. Our findings are compared with results\nobtained from CO isotopologues, dust, and NH3 from previous studies on the same\nsample. Results: The chemical properties of each species have a major role on\nthe measured physical properties. Low temperatures are traced by NH3, CH3OH,\nand CO (in the early phases), the warm and dense envelope can be probed with\nCH3CN, CH3CCH, and, in evolved sources via CO isotopologues. CH3OH and CH3CN\nare also abundant in the hot cores, and their high-excitation transitions may\nbe good tools to study the kinematics in the hot gas surrounding the YSOs that\nthese clumps are hosting. All tracers show, to different degrees, progressive\nwarming with evolution. The relation between gas temperature and L/M is\nreproduced by a toy model of a spherical, internally heated clump. Conclusions:\nThe evolutionary sequence defined for the clumps is statistically valid and we\ncould identify the processes dominating in different intervals of L/M. For\nL/M<2Lsun/Msun a large quantity of gas is still being accumulated and\ncompressed at the bottom of the potential well. Between\n2Lsun/Msun<L/M<40Lsun/Msun the YSOs gain mass and increase in L; the first hot\ncores appear around L/M=10Lsun/Msun. Finally, for L/M>40Lsun/Msun HII regions\nbecome common, showing that dissipation of the parental clump dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

The problem contains a wide range of scales\nand a relatively large, heterogeneous constraint parameter space.

The\nfirst-generation optical layout is sensitive to quantum geometrical noise\ncorrelations with shear symmetry---those that can be interpreted as a\nfundamental noncommutativity of space-time position in orthogonal directions.\nGeneral experimental constraints are placed on parameters of a set of models of\nspatial shear noise correlations, with a sensitivity that exceeds the\nPlanck-scale holographic information bound on position states by a large\nfactor. This result significantly extends the upper limits placed on models of\ndirectional noncommutativity by currently operating gravitational wave\nobservatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 20:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

This is particularly acute for\nsimulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,\nfully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous\nparameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence,\nit can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data\nhandling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons\nrigorously. This paper takes a novel approach to spatial discretisation,\nconsidering it much like a numerical simulation model problem of its own. It\nintroduces a generalised, extensible, self-documenting approach to carefully\ndescribe, and necessarily fully, the constraints over the heterogeneous\nparameter space that determine how a domain is spatially discretised. This\nadditionally provides a method to accurately record these constraints, using\nhigh-level natural language based abstractions, that enables full accounts of\nprovenance, sharing and distribution. Together with this description, a\ngeneralised consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical\nmodels is developed, that is automated, robust and repeatable, quick-to-draft,\nrigorously verified and consistent to the source data throughout. This\ninterprets the description above to execute a self-consistent spatial\ndiscretisation process, which is automatically validated to expected discrete\ncharacteristics and metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

Discrete element\nsimulations reveal that for sufficiently small confining pressures, the energy\ndissipation is dominated by the effects related to the presence of cohesive\nforces between the particles. The residual resistance against shear can be\nquantitatively explained by a combination of two effects arising in a wet\ngranulate: i) enhanced friction at particle contacts in the presence of\nattractive capillary forces, and ii) energy dissipation due to the rupture and\nreformation of liquid bridges. Coulomb friction at grain contacts gives rise to\nan energy dissipation which grows linearly with increasing confining pressure,\nfor both dry and wet granulates. Because of a lower Coulomb friction\ncoefficient in the case of wet grains, as the confining pressure increases the\nenergy dissipation for dry systems is faster than for wet ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 17:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 01:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 19:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

With these results, we provide the basis for further research,\nsuch as for analyzing the (co-)evolution of build files with other artifacts or\nimproving effort estimation approaches.

We find that, if the galaxy reaches the central region of a cool-core\ncluster, it is expected to lose all its gas, independently of its entry\nconditions and of the cluster's mass. On the other hand, it is expected to\nnever lose all its gas after crossing a cluster without a cool-core just once.\nBefore reaching the centre of the cluster, the SFR of the galaxy is always\nenhanced, by a factor of 1.5 to 3.

The structure and dynamics of these plumes are in fact closer to\nthose found in solid rotating cylinders heated from below, suggesting that the\nconfinement within the TC induced by the Taylor-Proudman constraint influences\nconvection in a similar way as solid walls would do. There is further\nsimilarity in that the critical modes in the TC all exhibit a slow retrograde\nprecession at onset.

The\nformulation is general in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary\ncross-section made of any type of elastoplastic material. In material science\nthe Functionally Graded Material (FGM) is a non-homogeneous composite which\nperforms as a single-phase material, by unifying the best properties of its\nconstituent phase material. The nonlinear elastic-plastic behavior is treated\nby employing the deformation theory of plasticity. According to this theory,\nthe material constants are assumed variable within the cross section, and are\nupdated through an iterative process so as the equivalent stress and strain at\neach point coincide with the uniaxial material curve. In this investigation a\nnew straightforward nonlinear procedure is introduced in the deformation theory\nof plasticity which simplifies the solution method. At each iteration step, the\nwarping function is obtained by solving the torsion problem of a\nnon-homogeneous isotropic bar using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in\nconjunction with the Analog Equation Method (AEM). Without restricting the\ngenerality, the FGM material is comprised of a ceramic phase and a metal phase.\nThe ceramic is assumed to behave linearly elastic, whereas the metal is modeled\nas an elastic-linear hardening material. Furthermore, the TTO homogenization\nscheme for estimating the effective properties of the two-phase FGM was\nadopted.

Therefore, if the\nblack hole is surrounded by an isolated box, there is a thermal equilibrium\nbetween the black hole and radiation gas. A simple case considering the thermal\nequilibrium between the Schwarzschild black hole and radiation gas in an\nisolated box has been well investigated previously in detail, i.e. taking the\nconservation of energy and principle of maximal entropy for the isolated system\ninto account. In this paper, following the above spirit, the effects of massive\ngraviton on the thermal equilibrium will be investigated. For the gravity with\nmassive graviton, we will use the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive\ngravity which has been proven to be ghost free. Because the graviton mass\ndepends on two parameters in the dRGT massive gravity, here we just investigate\ntwo simple cases related to the two parameters, respectively. Our results show\nthat in the first case the massive graviton can suppress or increase the\ncondensation of black hole in the radiation gas although the $T-E$ diagram is\nsimilar like the Schwarzschild black hole case. For the second case, a new\n$T-E$ diagram has been obtained. Moreover, an interesting and important\nprediction is that the condensation of black hole just increases from the zero\nradius of horizon in this case, which is very different from the Schwarzschild\nblack hole case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 21:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Our observation is that both segmentation and detection are based on\nclassifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the basic target is a pixel or\na receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection), which\ninspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of pixels/proposals for\ngenerating adversarial perturbations.

When a\nwavepacket is launched along the orbits, it emerges on classical unstable\nperiodic orbits as a scar in the stationary states. This localization along the\nperiodic orbit is clarified through the semiclassical approximation. It\nessentially originates from the same mechanism of a scar in stationary states:\nthe piling up of the contribution from the classical actions of multiply\nrepeated passes on a primitive periodic orbit. To create this enhancement,\nseveral states are required in the energy range, which is determined by the\ninitial wavepacket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 22:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Activity in a network's underlying graph\ngenerates a sequence of edges in the form of a stream; for example, a social\nnetwork may generate a graph stream based on the interactions (edges) between\ndifferent users (nodes) over time. While many graph mining algorithms have\nalready been developed for analyzing relatively small graphs, graphs that begin\nto approach the size of real-world networks stress the limitations of such\nmethods due to their dynamic nature and the substantial number of nodes and\nconnections involved.\n  In this paper we present GraphZip, a scalable method for mining interesting\npatterns in graph streams. GraphZip is inspired by the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) class of\ncompression algorithms, and uses a novel dictionary-based compression approach\nin conjunction with the minimum description length principle to discover\nmaximally-compressing patterns in a graph stream. We experimentally show that\nGraphZip is able to retrieve complex and insightful patterns from large\nreal-world graphs and artificially-generated graphs with ground truth patterns.\nAdditionally, our results demonstrate that GraphZip is both highly efficient\nand highly effective compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for mining\ngraph streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 22:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

In order to efficiently address the problem, this work first decomposes\nthe aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative\nprobabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP)\ntransformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage.\nUnlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical\nbalance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable\nmodel, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function,\nexact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations\nbetween faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in\ncapturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing\na smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any\nface in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the\nstructure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping\nthe advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density\nestimation.

Accordingly, the mean matrix can be estimated by solving\na penalized regression problem, applying a lasso penalty to the elementwise\neffects. Although solving this penalized regression problem is straightforward,\nspecifying appropriate values of the penalty parameters is not. Leveraging the\nposterior mode interpretation of the penalized regression problem, moment-based\nempirical Bayes estimators of the penalty parameters can be defined.

The question of\nhow much similarity the FeSCs have with the copper oxide high temperature\nsuperconductors emerged since the initial discovery of long-range\nantiferromagnetism in the FeSCs in proximity to superconductivity. Despite the\ngreat resemblance in their phase diagrams, there exist important disparities\nbetween FeSCs and cuprates that need to be considered in order to paint a full\npicture of these two families of high temperature superconductors. One of the\nkey differences lies in the multi-orbital multi-band nature of FeSCs, in\ncontrast to the effective single-band model for cuprates. Due to the complexity\nof multi-orbital band structures, the orbital degree of freedom is often\nneglected in formulating the theoretical models for FeSCs.

Reionization impulsively heats the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) to $\\sim10^4$ K, and owing to long cooling and dynamical times in the\ndiffuse gas, comparable to the Hubble time, memory of reionization heating is\nretained. Therefore, a late ending reionization has significant implications\nfor the structure of the $z\\sim5-6$ Lyman-$\\alpha$ (ly$\\alpha$) forest. Using\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations that allow us to vary the timing of\nreionization and its associated heat injection, we argue that extant thermal\nsignatures from reionization can be detected via the Ly$\\alpha$ forest power\nspectrum at $5< z<6$. This arises because the small-scale cutoff in the power\ndepends not only the the IGM temperature at these epochs, but is also\nparticularly sensitive to the pressure smoothing scale set by the IGM full\nthermal history. Comparing our different reionization models with existing\nmeasurements of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum at $z=5.0-5.4$, we\nfind that models satisfying Planck's $\\tau_e$, constraint favor a moderate\namount of heat injection consistent with galaxies driving reionization, but\ndisfavoring quasar-driven scenarios. We explore the impact of different\nreionization histories and heating models on the shape of the power spectrum,\nand find that they can produce similar effects, but argue that this degeneracy\ncan be broken with high enough quality data. We study the feasibility of\nmeasuring the flux power spectrum at $z\\simeq 6$ using mock quasar spectra and\nconclude that a sample of $\\sim10$ high-resolution spectra with an attainable\nsignal-to-noise ratio will allow distinguishing between different reionization\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 00:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 06:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 22:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The\ncombined layer is potentially more discriminative than the original\nconvolutional layer, and its inference is faster for two reasons: 1) the zero\ncells of the LCCL feature maps will remain zero after element-wise\nmultiplication, and thus it is safe to skip the calculation of the\ncorresponding high-cost convolution in the original convolutional layer, 2)\nLCCL is very fast if it is implemented as a 1*1 convolution or only a single\nfilter shared by all channels.

A 2-join is an edge cutset\nthat appeared in decomposition theorems of several complex classes, such as\nperfect graphs, even-hole-free graphs and others. In these decomposition\ntheorems 2-joins are used together with vertex cutsets that are more general\nthan clique cutsets, such as star cutsets and their generalizations (which are\nmuch harder to use in algorithms). This is a first example of a decomposition\ntheorem that uses just the combination of clique cutsets and 2-joins. This has\nseveral consequences.

Two correlators, i.e. the usual\none and the right-handed one, are adopted in the LCSR calculation. The\nresultant LCSRs for the $B \\to K^*$ TFFs are arranged according to the twist\nstructure of the $K^*$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), whose\ntwist-2, twist-3 and twist-4 terms behave quite differently by using different\ncorrelators. We observe that the twist-4 LCDAs, though generally small, shall\nhave sizable contributions to the TFFs $A_{1/2}$, $V$ and $T_1$, thus the\ntwist-4 terms should be kept for a sound prediction. We also observe that even\nthough different choices of the correlator lead to different LCSRs with\ndifferent twist contributions, the large correlation coefficients for most of\nthe TFFs indicate that the LCSRs for different correlators are close to each\norder, not only for their values at the large recoil point $q^2=0$ but also for\ntheir ascending trends in whole $q^2$-region. Such a high degree of correlation\nis confirmed by their application to the branching fraction of the\nsemi-leptonic decay $B \\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$. Thus, a proper choice of\ncorrelator may inversely provide a chance for probing uncertain LCDAs, i.e. the\ncontributions from those LCDAs can be amplified to a certain degree via a\nproper choice of correlator, thus amplifying the sensitivity of the TFFs, and\nhence their related observables, to those LCDAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 11:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 01:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

However, in the presence of dependent\ntypes, there often exist certain acute problems that make it difficult for PTS\nto directly accommodate many common realistic programming features such as\ngeneral recursion, recursive types, effects (e.g., exceptions, references,\ninput/output), etc. In this paper, Applied Type System (ATS) is presented as a\nframework for designing and formalizing type systems in support of practical\nprogramming with advanced types (including dependent types). In particular, it\nis demonstrated that ATS can readily accommodate a paradigm referred to as\nprogramming with theorem-proving (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are\nconstructed in a syntactically intertwined manner, yielding a practical\napproach to internalizing constraint-solving needed during type-checking. The\nkey salient feature of ATS lies in a complete separation between statics, where\ntypes are formed and reasoned about, and dynamics, where programs are\nconstructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer possible for a\nprogram to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in PTS.

We\nuse the SRT data in combination with archival Very Large Array observations to\nderive both the spectral aging and Rotation Measure (RM) images of the radio\ngalaxies 3C40A and 3C40B embedded in Abell 194. The optical analysis indicates\nthat Abell 194 does not show a major and recent cluster merger, but rather\nagrees with a scenario of accretion of small groups. Under the minimum energy\nassumption, the lifetimes of synchrotron electrons in 3C40B measured from the\nspectral break are found to be 157 Myrs. The break frequency image and the\nelectron density profile inferred from the X-ray emission are used in\ncombination with the RM data to constrain the intra-cluster magnetic field\npower spectrum. By assuming a Kolmogorov power law power spectrum, we find that\nthe RM data in Abell 194 are well described by a magnetic field with a maximum\nscale of fluctuations of Lambda_max=64 kpc and a central magnetic field\nstrength of <B0>=1.5 microG. Further out, the field decreases with the radius\nfollowing the gas density to the power of eta=1.1. Comparing Abell 194 with a\nsmall sample of galaxy clusters, there is a hint of a trend between central\nelectron densities and magnetic field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 13:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and\ncompare them with classical NLP approaches.\n  Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nn-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical\nconcepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The\nperformance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge\nsummaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.\n  Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The\naverage F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our\nmodel having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We\nadditionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method\nthat extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.\n  Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the\nperformance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically\nlearns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces\nthe annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally\nrequired to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant\nphrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and\ninterpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach\nto patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 15:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Dark state protection, achieved by coherent\ncoupling between subunits in the antenna structure, can significantly reduce\nradiative recombination and enhance the efficiency of energy trapping. Because\nthe dark states cannot be populated by optical transitions from the ground\nstate, they are usually accessed through phononic relaxation from the bright\nstates. In this study, we explore a novel way of connecting the dark states and\nthe bright states via optical transitions. In a ring-like chromophore system\ninspired by natural photosynthetic antennae, the single-excitation bright state\ncan be optically connected to the lowest energy single-excitation dark state\nthrough certain double-excitation states. We call such double-excitation states\nthe ferry states and show that they are the result of accidental degeneracy\nbetween two categories of double-excitation states. We then mathematically\nprove that the ferry states are only available when N, the number of subunits\non the ring, satisfies N=4l+2 (l being an integer). Numerical calculations\nconfirm that the ferry states enhance the energy transfer power of our model,\nshowing a significant energy transfer power spike at N=6 compared with smaller\nN values, even without phononic relaxation. The proposed mathematical theory\nfor the ferry states is not restricted to this one particular system or\nnumerical model. In fact, it is potentially applicable to any coherent optical\nsystem that adopts a ring-shaped chromophore arrangement. Beyond the ideal\ncase, the ferry state mechanism also demonstrates robustness under weak\nphononic dissipation, weak site energy disorder, and large coupling strength\ndisorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 20:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 18:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}
