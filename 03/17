The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that\nmechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable;\nhowever, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various\napplications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of\ndata-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose\nGaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and\nhighlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic\napproaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian non-parametric method, and hence can\nmodel complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior\ninformation can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean\nfunctions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation\nmodel is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit\ncorrelations between data from different cells.

The inverse problem is posed\nas follows: for a given selection of airfoils, the objective is to find the\nblade geometry (described as blade twist and chord distributions) which\nrealizes the desired turbine aerodynamic performance at the design point; the\ndesired performance is prescribed as angle of attack ($\\alpha$) and axial\ninduction factor ($a$) distributions along the blade. An iterative approach is\nused. An initial estimate of blade geometry is used with the direct solver\n(RANS/ADM) to obtain $\\alpha$ and $a$. The differences between the calculated\nand desired values of $\\alpha$ and $a$ are computed and a new estimate for the\nblade geometry (chord and twist) is obtained via nonlinear least squares\nregression using the Trust-Region-Reflective (TRF) method.

Besides, of course, the proximal point method,\nthese method include the gradient descent, forward--backward splitting,\nDouglas--Rachford splitting, Newton's method, as well as several methods for\nsaddle-point problems, such as the Alternating Directions Method of\nMultipliers, and the Chambolle--Pock method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 16:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 16:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 20:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

While this scenario is supported\nby observations of ubiquitous oscillations in the corona carrying sufficient\nwave energy and by theoretical models that have described the concentration of\nenergy in small scale structures, it is still unclear whether this wave energy\ncan maintain the million degree solar corona. The aim of this work is to assess\nhow much energy can be converted by a phase-mixing process triggered by the\npropagation of Alfv\\'enic waves in a cylindric coronal structure, such as a\ncoronal loop, and to estimate the impact on the coronal heating. To this end,\nwe run 3D MHD simulations of a magnetised cylinder where the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries through a boundary shell and a footpoint driver is set to trigger kink\nmodes which mode couple to torsional Alfv\\'en modes in the boundary shell.\nThese Alfv\\'en waves are expected to phase-mix and the system allows us to\nstudy the subsequent thermal energy deposition. We run a reference simulation\nto explain the main process and then we vary simulation parameters. When we\ntake into consideration high values of magnetic resistivity and strong\nfootpoint drivers, we find i) that phase-mixing leads to a temperature increase\nof the order of $10^5$ K or less, depending on the structure of the boundary\nshell, ii) that this energy is able to balance the radiative losses only in the\nlocalised region involved in the heating, iii) and how the boundary layer and\nthe persistence of the driver influence the thermal structure of the system.\nOur conclusion is that due to the extreme physical parameters we adopted and\nthe moderate impact on the heating of the system, it is unlikely that\nphase-mixing can contribute on a global scale to the heating of the solar\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 16:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

A highly accurate\ninterface-resolved numerical algorithm is employed to analyse the entire\nmigration dynamics of the oblate particle and compare it with that of the\nsphere. Similarly to the inertial focusing of spheres, the oblate particle\nreaches one of the four face-centred equilibrium positions, however they are\nvertically aligned with the axis of symmetry in the spanwise direction. In\naddition, the lateral trajectories of spheres and oblates collapse into an\nequilibrium manifold before ending at the equilibrium positions, with the\nequilibrium manifold tangential to lines of constant background shear for both\nsphere and oblate particles. The differences between the migration of the\noblate and sphere are also presented, in particular the oblate may focus on the\ndiagonal symmetry line of the duct cross-section, close to one of the corners,\nif its diameter is larger than a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that the\nfinal orientation and rotation of the oblate exhibit a chaotic behaviour for\nReynolds numbers beyond a critical value. Finally, we document that the lateral\nmotion of the oblate particle is less uniform than that of the spherical\nparticle due to its evident tumbling motion throughout the migration. In a\nsquare duct, the strong tumbling motion of the oblate in the first stage of the\nmigration results in a lower lateral velocity and consequently longer focusing\nlength with respect to that of the spherical particle. The opposite is true in\na rectangular duct where the higher lateral velocity of the oblate in the\nsecond stage of the migration, with negligible tumbling, gives rise to shorter\nfocusing lengths.

To provide a complete description of\nheavy-ion fusion it is important to characterize the quasifission process. In\nparticular, the impact of changing the neutron-richness of the quasifission\nprocess is not well known. A previous study of Cr + W reactions at a constant\n13 % above the Coulomb barrier concluded that an increase in neutron-richness\nleads to a decrease in the prominence of the quasifission reaction channel.\nPurpose: The interplay between the fusion-fission and quasifission reaction\nchannels, with varying neutron-richness, was explored at a constant excitation\nenergy, closer to the interaction barrier than the previous work, to see if the\ncorrelation between neutron-richness and quasifission is valid at lower\nenergies. Methods: Mass distributions were determined for eight different\ncombinations of Cr + W reactions at the Australian National University at 52.0\nMeV of excitation energy in the compound nucleus. Results: A curvature\nparameter was determined for the fission-like fragment mass distributions and\ncompared to various reaction parameters known to influence quasifission.\nConclusions: The present work demonstrates that at energies near the\ninteraction barrier the deformation effects dominate over the neutron-richness\neffects in the competition between quasifission and compound nucleus formation\nin these Cr + W systems and is an important consideration for future with heavy\nand superheavy element production reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 17:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Choosing simulated\nanalogs whose j values are consistent with the conventional picture of a\nprevious (< 3 Gyr ago), close encounter (< 100 kpc) of M33 about M31 results in\na very low virial mass for M31 ($\\rm\\sim\\!10^{12}\\; M_{\\odot}$). This supports\nthe new scenario put forth in Patel et al. (2017), wherein M33 is on its first\npassage about M31 or on a long period orbit. We conclude that this Bayesian\ninference scheme, utilising satellite j, is a promising method to reduce the\ncurrent factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW and M31 moving\nforward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The proposed\nalgorithm results in an architecture with reduced bit-width messages, leading\nto a significantly higher decoding throughput and to a lower area as compared\nto a min-sum decoder when serial message-transfer is used. The architecture is\nplaced and routed for the standard min-sum reference decoder and for the\nproposed finite-alphabet decoder using a custom pseudo-hierarchical backend\ndesign strategy to further alleviate routing congestions and to handle the\nlarge design.

DM-VAD is required in\nmany signal processing applications, e.g. distributed speech enhancement based\non multi-channel Wiener filtering, but is non-existent up to date. The proposed\nmethod neither requires a fusion center nor prior knowledge about the node\npositions, microphone array orientations or the number of observed sources. It\nconsists of two steps: (i) distributed source-specific energy signal unmixing\n(ii) energy signal based voice activity detection. Existing computationally\nefficient methods to extract source-specific energy signals from the mixed\nobservations, e.g., multiplicative non-negative independent component analysis\n(MNICA) quickly loose performance with an increasing number of sources, and\nrequire a fusion center. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a\ndistributed energy signal unmixing method based on a source-specific node\nclustering method to locate the nodes around each source. To determine the\nnumber of sources that are observed in the WASN, a source enumeration method\nthat uses a Lasso penalized Poisson generalized linear model is developed. Each\nidentified cluster estimates the energy signal of a single (dominant) source by\napplying a two-component MNICA. The VAD problem is transformed into a\nclustering task, by extracting features from the energy signals and applying\nK-means type clustering algorithms. All steps of the proposed method are\nevaluated using numerical experiments. A VAD accuracy of $> 85 \\%$ is achieved\nfor a challenging scenario where 20 nodes observe 7 sources in a simulated\nreverberant rectangular room.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 18:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

We provide some examples of quantum Markov chains\nthat satisfy these conditions and analyze the expected run-time of the\nalgorithm, which depends strongly on the degeneracy of the underlying\nHamiltonian. For Hamiltonians with highly degenerate spectrum, it is efficient,\nas it is polylogarithmic in the dimension and linear in the mixing time. For\nnon-degenerate spectra, its runtime is essentially the same as its classical\ncounterpart, which is linear in the mixing time and quadratic in the dimension,\nup to a logarithmic factor in the dimension. We analyze the circuit depth\nnecessary to implement it, which is proportional to the sum of the depth\nnecessary to implement one step of the quantum Markov chain and one phase\nestimation. This algorithm is stable under noise in the implementation of\ndifferent steps. We also briefly discuss how to adapt different `Coupling from\nthe Past'-algorithms to the quantum setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 19:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 10:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Despite\nsuch variety, they all require display calibration to create a proper mixed\nreality environment. With the aid of tracking systems, it is possible to\nregister rendered graphics with tracked objects in the real world. We propose a\ncalibration procedure to properly align the coordinate system of a 3D virtual\nscene that the user sees with that of the tracker. Our method takes a blackbox\napproach towards the HMD calibration, where the tracker's data is its input and\nthe 3D coordinates of a virtual object in the observer's eye is the output; the\nobjective is thus to find the 3D projection that aligns the virtual content\nwith its real counterpart. In addition, a faster and more intuitive version of\nthis calibration is introduced in which the user simultaneously aligns multiple\npoints of a single virtual 3D object with its real counterpart; this reduces\nthe number of required repetitions in the alignment from 20 to only 4, which\nleads to a much easier calibration task for the user.

Consistent with previous works, we show that the\nfinal black hole masses are rather insensitive to the masses of the initial\nseeds, even for seed masses of up to 10^6 M_sol. In addition, we apply our\nmodel to the formation of high-redshift quasars, as well as to the nearby\nsystem NGC 6951, where a tentative comparison is made in spite of the presence\nof a bar in the galaxy. We show that our model can reproduce the high black\nhole masses of the high-redshift quasars within a sufficiently short time,\nprovided a high mass supply rate from the host galaxy. In addition, it\nreproduces several of the properties observed in NGC 6951. With respect to the\nlatter system, our analysis suggests that supernova feedback may be important\nto create the observed fluctuations in the star formation history as a result\nof negative feedback effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 22:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

When energy and\ninformation are transferred in the same frequency band, a major design issue is\ntransmission scheduling to avoid interference and achieve high communication\nperformance. Commonly used centralized scheduling methods in WPCN may result in\nhigh control signaling overhead and thus are not suitable for wireless networks\nconstituting a large number of WDs with random locations and dynamic\noperations. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a distributed\nscheduling protocol for energy and information transmissions in WPCN.\nSpecifically, we allow a WD that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast\nan energy request buzz (ERB), which triggers WET from its associated hybrid\naccess point (HAP) to recharge the battery. If no ERB is sent, the WDs contend\nto transmit data to the HAP using the conventional $p$-persistent CSMA (carrier\nsensing multiple access). In particular, we propose an energy queueing model\nbased on an energy decoupling property to derive the throughput performance.\nOur analysis is verified through simulations under practical network\nparameters, which demonstrate good throughput performance of the distributed\nscheduling protocol and reveal some interesting design insights that are\ndifferent from conventional contention-based communication network assuming the\nWDs are powered with unlimited energy supplies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 01:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

Our method\ncould be used to measure the total duration of a sequence of events with\nenhanced accuracy, and to reduce the amount of quantum communication needed to\nstabilize clocks in a quantum network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 03:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 18:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 08:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 16:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 16:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of\nthe angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax\nderived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \\textit{Spitzer}\nlight curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this\nanalysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star\nwith the mass $0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\ M_\\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\\pm 9\n\\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\\rm LS} = 0.80 \\pm 0.19\\\n\\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\\rm LS} = 0.54 \\pm 0.08\\ \\textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is\nthe first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the\nGalactic bulge.

Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with\nintrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as\nsensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is\nprohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the\nMermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction\nand enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we\nuse magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer\nchromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin\norientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K\nof the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our\nstudies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the\nhallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals\ncrystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a\nmetamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed\nin the bulk crystal is restored.

As cranial capacity increased,\nrepresentations became more fine-grained (encoded more features), allowing them\nto act as catalysts, leading to streams of thought.

Accompanying such processes, the social network\nevolves as new links emerge between users with common interests.

A unique characteristic of this\nproblem is the tradeoff between sufficient indoor coverage and limited outdoor\nleakage, which has to be met without explicit knowledge of the environment. In\nthis paper, we address the small base station (SBS) transmit power assignment\nproblem based on stochastic bandit theory. Unlike existing solutions that rely\non heavy involvement of RF engineers surveying the target area, we take\nadvantage of the human user behavior with simple coverage feedback in the\nnetwork, and thus significantly reduce the planned human measurement. In\naddition, the proposed power assignment algorithms follow the Bayesian\nprinciple to utilize the available prior knowledge from system self\nconfiguration. To guarantee good performance when the prior knowledge is\ninsufficient, we incorporate the performance correlation among similar power\nvalues, and establish an algorithm that exploits the correlation structure to\nrecover majority of the degraded performance. Furthermore, we explicitly\nconsider power switching penalties in order to discourage frequent changes of\nthe transmit power, which cause varying coverage and uneven user experience.\nComprehensive system-level simulations are performed for both single and\nmultiple SBS deployment scenarios, and the resulting power settings are\ncompared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Significant performance gains of\nthe proposed algorithms are observed. Particularly, the correlation structure\nenables the algorithm to converge much faster to the optimal long-term power\nthan other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

It is known however that in any finite size system a\ncritical behavior must be absent. Here we develop a model of the optically\ncooled nuclear polaron, which goes beyond the mean-field approximation. An\nexpression of the generalized free energy of the optically cooled nuclear\npolaron, valid for a finite, albeit large, number of spins, is derived. This\nmodel permits to describe the continuous transition from the fluctuation\ndominated regime to the saturation regime, as the nuclear spin temperature\ndecreases. It is shown that due to the finite number of nuclear spins involved\nin the polaron, the critical effects close to TC are smoothed by the spin\nfluctuations. Particularly, instead of a divergence, the nuclear spin\nfluctuations exhibit a sharp peak at TC, before being depressed well below TC.\nInterestingly, the formation of the nuclear polaron can, in certain conditions,\nboost the nuclear polarization beyond the value obtained solely by optical\npumping.

We use\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations of a disc galaxy prone to mild bar\ninstability. For realistic initial conditions of satellites, we take advantage\nof cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like dark matter haloes. Results. The\nsatellites may have a significant impact on the time of bar formation. Some\nruns with satellites demonstrate a delay, while others show an advancement in\nbar formation compared to the isolated run, with such time differences reaching\n$\\sim$ 1 Gyr. Meanwhile, the final bar configuration, including its very\nappearance and the bar characteristics such as the pattern speed and the\nexponential growth rate of its amplitude are independent of the number of\nencounters and their orbits. The contribution of satellites with masses below\n$10^9 M_{\\odot}$ is insignificant, unless their pericentre distances are small.\nWe suggest that the encounters act indirectly via inducing perturbations across\nthe disc that evolve to delayed waves in the central part and interfere with an\nemerging seed bar.

Although color palettes may come from\ndifferent sources such as online crowd-sourcing, photographs and graphical\ndesigns, in this paper, we consider color palettes extracted from fine art\ncollections, which we believe to be an abundant source of stylistic and unique\ncolor themes. We aim to capture color styles embedded in these collections by\nmeans of statistical models and to build practical applications upon these\nmodels. As artists often use their personal color themes in their paintings,\nmaking these palettes appear frequently in the dataset, we employed density\nestimation to capture the characteristics of palette data. Via density\nestimation, we carried out various predictions and interpolations on palettes,\nwhich led to promising applications such as photo-style exploration, real-time\ncolor suggestion, and enriched photo recolorization. It was, however,\nchallenging to apply density estimation to palette data as palettes often come\nas unordered sets of colors, which make it difficult to use conventional\nmetrics on them. To this end, we developed a divide-and-conquer sorting\nalgorithm to rearrange the colors in the palettes in a coherent order, which\nallows meaningful interpolation between color palettes. To confirm the\nperformance of our model, we also conducted quantitative experiments on\ndatasets of digitized paintings collected from the Internet and received\nfavorable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 13:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

One question that\nsystematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or\ncomplex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an\nindependent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this\nprobability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing\nabove some threshold (complex contagion)?

Two cases with particle\nsizes differing by a factor of 2, at the same solid volume fraction of 20% and\nbulk Reynolds number are considered. These are complemented with two reference\nsingle-phase flows: the unladen case, and the flow of a Newtonian fluid with\nthe effective suspension viscosity of the same mixture in the laminar regime.\nAs recently highlighted in Costa et al. (PRL 117, 134501), a particle-wall\nlayer is responsible for deviations of the statistics from what is observed in\nthe continuum limit where the suspension is modeled as a Newtonian fluid with\nan effective viscosity. Here we investigate the fluid and particle dynamics in\nthis layer and in the bulk. In the particle-wall layer, the near wall\ninhomogeneity has an influence on the suspension micro-structure over a\ndistance proportional to the particle size. In this layer, particles have a\nsignificant (apparent) slip velocity that is reflected in the distribution of\nwall shear stresses. This is characterized by extreme events (both much higher\nand much lower than the mean). Based on these observations we provide a scaling\nfor the particle-to-fluid apparent slip velocity as a function of the flow\nparameters. We also extend the flow scaling laws in to second-order Eulerian\nstatistics in the homogeneous suspension region away from the wall. Finite-size\neffects in the bulk of the channel become important for larger particles, while\nnegligible for lower-order statistics and smaller particles.

We then show that, in trees of height three, it is NP-hard to\napproximate the problem within a factor $2^{f(n)}$ for any sublinear function\n$f$ of the size of the input $n$. Again, this bound is tight, as we prove that\nthe usual max-product algorithm finds (in any network) approximations within\nfactor $2^{c \\cdot n}$ for some constant $c < 1$.

This correlation is unfortunate as it\nensures that small errors in the computed free energy surface can give rise to\nlarge errors in the extrapolated properties of the fitted model. To resolve\nthis problem we thus propose a method for fitting macroscopic nucleation models\nthat uses simulations of planar interfaces and simulations of three-dimensional\nnuclei in tandem. We show that when the parameters of the macroscopic model are\nfitted in this way the numerical errors for the final fitted model are smaller\nand that the extrapolated predictions for large nuclei are thus more reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}
