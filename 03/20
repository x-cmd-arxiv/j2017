Bounds are established for the condition number of the resulting\nlinear system with and without diagonal preconditioning for the implicit Euler\nand general implicit RK methods. Two solution strategies are considered for the\nlinear system resulting from general implicit RK integration: the simultaneous\nsolution (the system is solved as a whole) and a successive solution which\nfollows the commonly used implementation of implicit RK methods to first\ntransform the system into smaller systems using the Jordan normal form of the\nRK matrix and then solve them successively.\n  For the simultaneous solution in case of a positive semidefinite symmetric\npart of the RK coefficient matrix and for the successive solution it is shown\nthat .

They show that there are three\nmesh-dependent factors that can affect the conditioning: the number of\nelements, the mesh nonuniformity measured in the Euclidean metric, and the mesh\nnonuniformity with respect to the inverse of the diffusion matrix.

In this paper we\nstudy the rheological behavior of liquid foams loaded with granular\nsuspensions. We focus on the effect of small particles, i.e. particle-to-bubble\nsize ratio smaller than 0.1, and we measure the complex modulus as a function\nof particle size and particle volume fraction. With respect to previous work,\nthe results highlight a new elastic regime characterized by unequaled modulus\nvalues as well as independence of size ratio. A careful investigation of the\nmaterial microstructure reveals that particles organize through the network\nbetween the gas bubbles and form a granular skeleton structure with tightly\npacked particles. The latter is proven to be responsible for the reported new\nelastic regime. Rheological probing performed by strain sweep reveals a\ntwo-step yielding of the material: the first one occurs at small strain and is\nclearly attributed to yielding of the granular skeleton; the second one\ncorresponds to the yielding of the bubble assembly, as observed for\nparticle-free foams. Moreover the elastic modulus measured at small strain is\nquantitatively described by models for solid foams in assuming that the\ngranular skeleton possesses a bulk elastic modulus of order 100 kPa. Additional\nrheology experiments performed on the bulk granular material indicate that this\nsurprisingly high value can be understood as soon as the magnitude of the\nconfinement pressure exerted by foam bubbles on packed grains is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 16:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The detachment reaction of the metal\ncentre of the porphyrin is investigated both in the gas phase and for molecules\nadsorbed on the GNR. As most metal porphyrins are very stable against this\nreaction, it is found that these molecules bind only weakly to a perfect\nnanoribbon. However, interaction with a single-atom vacancy in the GNR results\nin chemical bonding by the transition metal centre being shared between\nnitrogen atoms in the porphyrin ring and the carbon atoms next to the vacancy\nin the GNR. For both the physisorbed and the chemisorbed geometry, the\ninclusion of van der Waals interaction results in a significant enlargement of\nthe binding energy and reduction of the adsorption height. Electronic transport\ncalculations using non-equilibrium Greens functions show that the conductivity\nof the GNR is altered by the chemisorbed porphyrin molecules. Since the metal\ncenters of porphyrins carry an element-specific magnetic moment, not only the\nnet conductance, but also the spin-dependent conductance of the GNR is\naffected. In particular, the adsorption of Ru-porphyrin on the single-atom\nvacancy results in a very large spin polarization of the current of 88% at\nsmall applied source-drain voltages.

Yet, existing methods for training ICA models rely on the\nassumption that relational features reflect the true labels of the nodes. This\nunrealistic assumption introduces a bias that is inconsistent with the actual\nprediction algorithm. In this paper, we introduce recurrent collective\nclassification (RCC), a variant of ICA analogous to recurrent neural network\nprediction. RCC accommodates any differentiable local classifier and relational\nfeature functions. We provide gradient-based strategies for optimizing over\nmodel parameters to more directly minimize the loss function. In our\nexperiments, this direct loss minimization translates to improved accuracy and\nrobustness on real network data. We demonstrate the robustness of RCC in\nsettings where local classification is very noisy, settings that are\nparticularly challenging for ICA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 21:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

We name such an overcomplete basis\nas holographic coherent states. A generic boundary state can be expanded on\nthis basis, which describes the state as a superposition of different spatial\ngeometries in the bulk. We discuss how to define distinct classical geometries\nand small fluctuations around them. We show that small fluctuations around\nclassical geometries define \"code subspaces\" which are mapped to the boundary\nHilbert space isometrically with quantum error correction properties. In\naddition, we also show that the overlap between different geometries is\nsuppressed exponentially as a function of the geometrical difference between\nthe two geometries. The geometrical difference is measured in an area law\nfashion, which is a manifestation of the holographic nature of the states\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 22:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The classifier is called\npointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best\nclassifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain.\nThe quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined\nto be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A \"fast\" rejection rate is\nachieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the\nnumber of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides\nlogarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are\nintimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that\nin the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called\nConsistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the\nwell-known CAL active algorithm.\n  We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called\nLESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending\non Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions.

Here we build a model describing the essential\nfeatures of a large array of turbines with arbitrary design and layout, by\nconsidering a fully-developed wind farm whose upper edge is bounded by a\nself-similar boundary layer. The exchanges between the wind farm, the\noverlaying boundary layer, and the outer flow are parameterized by means of the\nclassical entrainment hypothesis. We obtain a concise expression for the wind\nfarm's power density (corresponding to power output per unit planform area), as\na function of three coefficients, which represent the array thrust and the\nturbulent exchanges at each of the two interfaces. We assess the performance of\nour model by comparing the predicted power density to field data, laboratory\nmeasurements and large-eddy simulations for the fully-developed regions of wind\nfarms, finding good agreement. We extend our model to include the effect of\natmospheric stability on power output, by using an established parameterization\nrelating entrainment coefficients to local Froude numbers. Our predictions for\npower variation with atmospheric stability are in broad agreement with field\nmeasurements. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first\nquantitative comparison between an atmospheric-stability-dependent model and\nfield data. Finally, we consider an ideal limit for array operation, whereby\nturbines are designed to maximize momentum exchange with the overlying boundary\nlayer.

We use\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents\nend-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.\n  We demonstrate two experimental results.\n  First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show\nresults on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded\nvocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find\nthat two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain\nsymbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style).\nThus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among\n'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.\n  Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset,\nwhere we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned'\nagents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to\nask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative\ndialog and a better team.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 03:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Baroclinicity is\ncurrently believed to be key to the development of an eddy-saturated state. In\nthis paper, it is shown that eddy saturation can also occur in a purely\nbarotropic flow over topography, without baroclinicity. Thus, eddy saturation\nis a fundamental property of barotropic dynamics above topography. It is\ndemonstrated that the main factor controlling the appearance or not of\neddy-saturated states in the barotropic setting is the structure of geostrophic\ncontours, that is the contours of $f/H$ of the ratio of the Coriolis parameter\nto the ocean's depth. Eddy-saturated states occur when the geostrophic contours\nare open, that is when the geostrophic contours span the whole zonal extent of\nthe domain. This minimal requirement for eddy-saturated states is demonstrated\nusing numerical integrations of a single-layer quasi-geostrophic flow over two\ndifferent topographies characterized by either open or closed geostrophic\ncontours with parameter values loosely inspired by the Southern Ocean. In this\nsetting, transient eddies are produced through a barotropic-topographic\ninstability that occurs due tot the interaction of the large-scale zonal flow\nwith the topography. Through the study of this barotropic-topographic\ninstability insight is gained on how eddy-saturated states are established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 04:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 17:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 06:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

In an attempt to make the SVMs more\nappropriate for complex realistic market behavior, a leverage parameter was\nintroduced in the Taylor SVM, which however led to the violation of the\nefficient market hypothesis (EMH, a necessary mean-zero condition for the\nreturn distribution that prevents arbitrage possibilities).

This paper analyzes the statistical performance of PCA in this\nsetting, i.e., for high-dimensional data drawn from a low-dimensional subspace\nand degraded by heteroscedastic noise.

In this scenario, favorable conditions for the\ninspiral of a black hole binary are initiated by its gravitational interaction\nwith a distant companion, rather than by a common-envelope phase invoked in\nstandard binary evolution models. We use a code that follows self-consistently\nthe evolution of massive triple stars, combining the secular triple dynamics\n(Lidov-Kozai cycles) with stellar evolution. After a black hole triple is\nformed, its dynamical evolution is computed using either the orbit-averaged\nequations of motion, or a high-precision direct integrator for triples with\nweaker hierarchies for which the secular perturbation theory breaks down. Most\nblack hole mergers in our models are produced in the latter non-secular\ndynamical regime.

Measured\neccentricities could therefore be used to uniquely identify binary mergers\nformed through the evolution of triple stars.

The line\nprofiles of [C I] are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the\nsame telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This\nresult suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks,\nand is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin\n[C I] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the\ncolumn density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10^17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10^16\ncm^-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density\nratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris,\nrespectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and\ndiffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO\nare likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO\nmolecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2\nmolecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of\nsecondary gas from dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 10:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

We've even seen\nimage generation from multi-category datasets such as the Microsoft Common\nObjects in Context (MSCOCO) through the use of generative adversarial networks\n(GANs). Synthesizing objects with a complex shape, however, is still\nchallenging. For example, animals and humans have many degrees of freedom,\nwhich means that they can take on many complex shapes. We propose a new\ntraining method called Image-Text-Image (I2T2I) which integrates text-to-image\nand image-to-text (image captioning) synthesis to improve the performance of\ntext-to-image synthesis. We demonstrate that %the capability of our method to\nunderstand the sentence descriptions, so as to I2T2I can generate better\nmulti-categories images using MSCOCO than the state-of-the-art. We also\ndemonstrate that I2T2I can achieve transfer learning by using a pre-trained\nimage captioning module to generate human images on the MPII Human Pose\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 22:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

In the solar system, MD predicts the existence of some\npossibly non-negligible dynamical effects, which can be used to constrain the\nfreedom in MD theories. Known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) have\ntheir argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node, and inclination\ndistributed in highly non-uniform fashion; ETNOs are bodies with perihelion\ndistances greater than the orbit of Neptune and with semimajor axes greater\nthan 150 au and less than $\\sim1500$ au.

The new research frontier in this direction includes the\nimportant problem of how to assess dynamic changes of signal activity. We\naddress this problem in a novel way by defining the graph-variate signal\nalongside methods for its analysis. Essentially, graph-variate signal analysis\nleverages graphs of reliable connectivity information to filter instantaneous\nbivariate functions of the multivariate signal. This opens up a new and robust\napproach to analyse joint signal and network dynamics at sample resolution.\nFurthermore, our method can be formulated as instantaneous networks on which\nstandard network analysis can be implemented. When graph connectivity is\nestimated from the multivariate signal itself, the appropriate consideration of\ninstantaneous graph signal functions allows for a novel dynamic connectivity\nmeasure-- graphvariate dynamic (GVD) connectivity-- which is robust to spurious\nshort-term dependencies. Particularly, we present appropriate functions for\nthree pertinent connectivity metrics-- correlation, coherence and the phase-lag\nindex. We show that our approach can determine signals with a single correlated\ncouple against wholly uncorrelated data of up to 128 nodes in signal size (1\nout of 8128 weighted edges). GVD connectivity is also shown to be more robust\nthan i) other GSP approaches at detecting a randomly traveling spheroid on a 3D\ngrid and ii) standard dynamic connectivity in determining differences in EEG\nrestingstate and task-related activity.

The scaling\noccurs because the strings lose energy into classical radiation of the scalar\nand gauge fields of the Abelian Higgs model. We quantify the energy loss with a\ndimensionless radiative efficiency parameter, and show that it does not vary\nsignificantly with lattice spacing or string separation. This implies that the\nradiative energy loss underlying the scaling behaviour is not a lattice\nartefact, and justifies the extrapolation of measured network properties to\nlarge times for computations of cosmological perturbations. We also show that\nthe core growth method, which increases the defect core width with time to\nextend the dynamic range of simulations, does not introduce significant\nsystematic error. We compare $\\dot{\\xi}$ and $\\bar v^2$ to values measured in\nsimulations using the Nambu-Goto approximation, finding that the latter\nunderestimate the mean string separation by about 25%, and overestimate $\\bar\nv^2$ by about 10%. The scaling of the string separation implies that string\nloops decay by the emission of massive radiation within a Hubble time in field\ntheory simulations, in contrast to the Nambu-Goto scenario which neglects this\nenergy loss mechanism. String loops surviving for only one Hubble time emit\nmuch less gravitational radiation than in the Nambu-Goto scenario, and are\nconsequently subject to much weaker gravitational wave constraints on their\ntension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 10:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 09:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

The standard techniques of\nthe quantum inverse scattering method cannot be applied because the Poisson\nbracket is non ultra-local. Inspired by an approach of Faddeev and Reshetikhin,\nwe show that in this class of models, there is a way to deform the symplectic\nstructure of the theory leading to a much simpler theory that is ultra-local\nand can be quantized on the lattice whilst preserving integrability. This\nlattice theory takes the form of a generalized spin chain that can be solved by\nstandard algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques.

Compute-compress-and-forward\n(CCF) can further enhance the network performance by introducing compression\noperations at receivers. In this paper, we develop a more general compression\nframework, termed generalized compute-compress-and-forward (GCCF), where the\ncompression function involves multiple quantization-and-modulo lattice\noperations. We show that GCCF achieves a broader compression rate region than\nCCF. We also compare our compression rate region with the fundamental\nSlepian-Wolf (SW) region. We show that GCCF is optimal in the sense of\nachieving the minimum total compression rate. We also establish the criteria\nunder which GCCF achieves the SW region. In addition, we consider a two-hop\nrelay network employing the GCCF scheme. We formulate a sum-rate maximization\nproblem and develop an approximate algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical\nresults are presented to demonstrate the performance superiority of GCCF over\nCCF and other schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 12:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

However, a\nside-by-side comparison shows that the absolute intensity of the Ga-polar\nquantum wells is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the N-polar\nquantum disks. A similar difference is observed for the initial decay time of\nphotoluminescence transients obtained by time-resolved measurements, indicating\nthe presence of a highly efficient nonradiative decay channel for the quantum\ndisks. In apparent contradiction to this conjecture, the decay of both samples\nis observed to slow down dramatically after the initial rapid decay.\nIndependent of temperature, the transients approach a power law for longer\ndecay times, reflecting that recombination occurs between individual electrons\nand holes with varying spatial separation.

Observation based reconstructions of past land\ncover are rare and commonly used model based reconstructions exhibit\nconsiderable differences.

These reconstructions incorporate a number of auxiliary datasets\nraising questions regarding the method's sensitivity to different auxiliary\ndatasets.\n  Here the sensitivity of the method is examined by performing spatial\nreconstructions for northern Europe during three time periods (1900 CE, 1725 CE\nand 4000 BCE). The auxiliary datasets considered include the most commonly\nutilized sources of past land-cover data --- e.g.\\ estimates produced by a\ndynamic vegetation (DVM) and anthropogenic land-cover change (ALCC) models.\nFive different auxiliary datasets were considered, including different climate\ndata driving the DVM and different ALCC models. The resulting reconstructions\nwere also evaluated using cross-validation for all the time periods. For the\nrecent time period, 1900 CE, the different land-cover reconstructions were\ncompared against a present day forest map.\n  The validation confirms that the statistical model provides a robust spatial\ninterpolation tool with low sensitivity to differences in auxiliary data and\nhigh capacity to capture information in the pollen based proxy data.

The anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) proposes that such extinctions\ncan be caused by prices for wildlife products increasing with species rarity.\nThis price-rarity relationship creates financial incentives to extract the last\nremaining individuals of a population, despite higher search and harvest costs.\nThe AAE has become a standard approach for conceptualizing the threat of\neconomic markets on endangered species. Despite its potential importance for\nconservation, AAE theory is based on a simple graphical model with limited\nanalysis of possible population trajectories. By specifying a general class of\nfunctions for price-rarity relationships, we show that the classic theory can\nunderstate the risk of species extinction. AAE theory proposes that only\npopulations below a critical Allee threshold will go extinct due to increasing\nprice-rarity relationships. Our analysis shows that this threshold can be much\nhigher than the original theory suggests, depending on initial harvest effort.\nMore alarmingly, even species with population sizes above this Allee threshold,\nfor which AAE predicts persistence, can be destined to extinction. Introducing\neven a minimum price for harvested individuals, close to zero, can cause large\npopulations to cross the classic anthropogenic Allee threshold on a trajectory\ntowards extinction. These results suggest that traditional AAE theory may give\na false sense of security when managing large harvested populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 13:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 03:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

Multivalued networks can be converted to partial Boolean maps, in a way\nthat preserves the asynchronous dynamics. We investigate the problem of\nextending these maps to non-admissible states, i.e. states that do not have a\nmultivalued counterpart. We observe that attractors are preserved if a stepwise\nversion of the original function is considered for conversion. Different\nextensions of the Boolean conversion affect the structure of the interaction\ngraphs in different ways. A particular technique for extending the partial\nBoolean conversion is identified, that ensures that feedback cycles are\npreserved. This property, combined with the conservation of the asymptotic\nbehaviour, can prove useful for the application of results and analyses defined\nin the Boolean setting to multivalued networks, and vice versa. As a first\napplication, by considering the conversion of a known example for the discrete\nmultivalued case, we create a Boolean map showing that the existence of a\ncyclic attractor and the absence of fixed points are compatible with the\nabsence of local negative cycles.

This gives a simple technique to find quasi periodic pulses separated by\ntimes smaller than a nanosecond. One should look for emission lines that cannot\nbe identified with known spectral lines in spectra. Such signals, generated by\nslower pulses, could also be found in the far infra-red, millimeter and radio\nregions, where they could be detected as objects unusually bright in a single\nnarrow-band filter or channel. The outstanding interest of the technique comes\nfrom its simplicity so that it can be used to find ultra-rapid quasi-periodic\noscillators in large astronomical surveys. A very small fraction of objects\npresently identified as Lyman alpha emitters that do not have other spectral\nfeatures to confirm the Lyman alpha redshift, may possibly be quasi-periodic\noscillators.

Therefore, disruptive event classification provides\nuseful information for preventive maintenance of the assets in distribution\nnetworks. Preventive maintenance provides wide range of benefits in terms of\ntime, avoiding unexpected outages, maintenance crew utilization, and equipment\nreplacement cost. In this paper, a PMU-data-driven framework is proposed for\nclassification of disruptive events in distribution networks. The two\ndisruptive events, i.e., malfunctioned capacitor bank switching and\nmalfunctioned regulator on-load tap changer (OLTC) switching are considered and\ndistinguished from the normal abrupt load change in distribution grids. The\nperformance of the proposed framework is verified using the simulation of the\nevents in the IEEE 13-bus distribution network. The event classification is\nformulated using two different algorithms as; i) principle component analysis\n(PCA) together with multi-class support vector machine (SVM), and ii)\nautoencoder along with softmax classifier. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms and satisfactory classification\naccuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 01:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}
