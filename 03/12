For instance, the space-division multiplexing\naccomplished through the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme achieves\nsignificant capacity increase by the realized parallel channel, but it requires\nexpensive hardware resources. Here, we present a novel multiplexing\nmethodology, named meta-multiplexing, which allows ordinary modulated signals\noverlap together to form a set of \"artificial\" parallel channels, meanwhile, it\nonly requires similar resources as ordinary modulation schemes. We prove the\ncapacity law for the meta-multiplexing system and disclose that under broad\nconditions, the capacity of a single channel increases linearly with the signal\nto noise ratio (SNR), which breaks the conventional logarithmic growth of the\ncapacity over SNR. Numerous simulation studies verify the capacity law and\ndemonstrate the high efficiency of meta-multiplexing.

The HFFD is a face descriptor containing of rich\ndiscriminant information that is created by fusing some frequency-based\nfeatures extracted using both wavelet and DCT analysis of several different\nposes of 2D face images. The main aim of this method is to represent the\nmulti-pose face images using a dominant frequency component with still having\nreasonable achievement compared to the recent multi-pose face recognition\nmethods. The HFFD based face recognition tends to achieve better performance\nthan that of the recent 2D-based face recognition method. In addition, the\nHFFD-based face recognition also is sufficiently to handle large face\nvariability due to face pose variations .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 02:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

In addition, any specific research needs a particular\nadjustment to the generalized approach and specializing them to suit the\nproject in hand. However, unlike most well-established science disciplines,\ncomputing research is not supported by well-defined, globally accepted methods.\nThis is because of its infancy and ambiguity in its definition, on one hand,\nand its extensive coverage and overlap with other fields, on the other hand.\nThis article discusses the research methods in science and engineering in\ngeneral and in computing in particular. It shows that despite several special\nparameters that make research in computing rather unique, it still follows the\nsame steps that any other scientific research would do.

One\nexplanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account:\nthe plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to\nthe illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis\n& Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is\nmisretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion\nprocess at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural\nmarking.

There is a timely need to map the latest software\nDCNNs to application-specific hardware, in order to achieve orders of magnitude\nimprovement in performance, energy efficiency and compactness. Stochastic\nComputing (SC), as a low-cost alternative to the conventional binary computing\nparadigm, has the potential to enable massively parallel and highly scalable\nhardware implementation of DCNNs. One major challenge in SC based DCNNs is\ndesigning accurate nonlinear activation functions, which have a significant\nimpact on the network-level accuracy but cannot be implemented accurately by\nexisting SC computing blocks. In this paper, we design and optimize SC based\nneurons, and we propose highly accurate activation designs for the three most\nfrequently used activation functions in software DCNNs, i.e, hyperbolic\ntangent, logistic, and rectified linear units. Experimental results on LeNet-5\nusing MNIST dataset demonstrate that compared with a binary ASIC hardware DCNN,\nthe DCNN with the proposed SC neurons can achieve up to 61X, 151X, and 2X\nimprovement in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively, at the cost of\nsmall precision degradation.In addition, the SC approach achieves up to 21X and\n41X of the area, 41X and 72X of the power, and 198200X and 96443X of the\nenergy, compared with CPU and GPU approaches, respectively, while the error is\nincreased by less than 3.07%. ReLU activation is suggested for future SC based\nDCNNs considering its superior performance under a small bit stream length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 15:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}
