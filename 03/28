Numerical results revealed for the quantum\npseudo dot that: (i) The amplitude of Gauss entropy is greater than the\namplitude of Tsallis entropy which inturn is greater than the amplitude of\nShannon entropy. The Tsallis entropy is not more significant in nanostructure\ncompared to Shannon and Gauss entropies, (ii) With an increase of the zero\npoint, the dominance of the Gauss entropy on the Shannon entropy was observed\non one hand and the dominance of the Shannon entropy on the Tsallis entropy on\nthe other hand ; this suggested that in nanostructures, Gauss entropy is more\nsuitable in the evaluation of the average of information in the system, for the\ndelta quantum dot it was observed that (iii) when the Gauss entropy is\nconsidered, a lot of information about the system is missed. The collapse\nrevival phenomenon in Shannon entropy was observed in RbCl and GaAs delta\nquantum dot with the enhancement of delta parameter; with an increase in this\nparameter, the system in the case of CsI evolved coherently; with Shannon and\nTsallis entropies , information in the system is faster and coherently\nexchanged; (iv) The Shannon entropy is more significant because its amplitude\noutweighs on the others when the delta dimension length enhances.

These methods naturally\nfacilitate tractable uncertainty quantification and incorporation of prior\ninformation. A common feature of these models, including the Bayesian lasso,\nglobal-local shrinkage priors, and spike-and-slab priors is that the\ncorresponding priors on the regression coefficients can be expressed as scale\nmixture of normals. While the three-step Gibbs sampler used to sample from the\noften intractable associated posterior density has been shown to be\ngeometrically ergodic for several of these models (Khare and Hobert, 2013; Pal\nand Khare, 2014), it has been demonstrated recently that convergence of this\nsampler can still be quite slow in modern high-dimensional settings despite\nthis apparent theoretical safeguard. We propose a new method to draw from the\nsame posterior via a tractable two-step blocked Gibbs sampler. We demonstrate\nthat our proposed two-step blocked sampler exhibits vastly superior convergence\nbehavior compared to the original three- step sampler in high-dimensional\nregimes on both real and simulated data.

First, we\nderive explicit upper bounds for the (geometric) rate of convergence.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that while the original Bayesian\nlasso chain is not Hilbert-Schmidt, the proposed chain is trace class (and\nhence Hilbert-Schmidt). The trace class property has useful theoretical and\npractical implications. It implies that the corresponding Markov operator is\ncompact, and its eigenvalues are summable.

To build our\noptimizer, we introduce a set of abstract operators for expressing GD\nalgorithms and propose a novel approach to estimate the number of iterations a\nGD algorithm requires to converge. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic\ndatasets show that our optimizer not only chooses the best GD plan but also\nallows for optimizations that achieve orders of magnitude performance speed-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 17:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

The kinematic structure\nof the responses (i.e., their angular dependence) can be decomposed\nunambiguously through a \"bias\" expansion of the local power spectrum, with a\nfixed number of physical response coefficients, which are only a function of\nthe hard wavenumber $k$. Further, the responses up to $n$-th order completely\ndescribe the $(n+2)$-point function in the squeezed limit, i.e. with two hard\nand $n$ soft modes, which one can use to derive the response coefficients.

Here we present a new method for estimating the column\ndensity of cold molecular gas (Sigma_gas) using optical spectroscopy. We\nutilise the spatially resolved H-alpha maps of flux and velocity dispersion\nfrom the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy\nSurvey.

Working synergistically with the coupling, the noise on one system\ndrives a large fluctuation in the other, even when there is no noise in the\nsecond system.

If resonance\ncrossing occurs on the right timescale, of order a few Myrs, characteristic for\nyoung protostellar systems, the inner and outer discs can become highly\nmisaligned ($\\gtrsim 60$ degrees).

A focus of the paper\nis on methodology to standardise the different characteristics so that users\ncan aggregate them in a suitable way specifying weights for the various\ncriteria that are relevant in the clustering application at hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 19:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 21:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

The fused-filament fabrication method\ninvolves melting a thermoplastic, followed by layer-by-layer extrusion of the\nmolten viscoelastic material to fabricate a three-dimensional object. The\nstrength of the welds between layers is controlled by interdiffusion and\nentanglement of the melt across the interface. However, diffusion slows down as\nthe printed layer cools towards the glass transition temperature. Diffusion is\nalso affected by high shear rates in the nozzle, which significantly deform and\ndisentangle the polymer microstructure prior to welding.

By contrast to most\nspeech enhancement algorithms that overlook the speech variability mainly\ncaused by phoneme structure, our framework comprises a set of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), each one of which is an 'expert' in enhancing a given speech\ntype corresponding to a phoneme. A gating DNN determines which expert is\nassigned to a given speech segment. A speech presence probability (SPP) is then\nobtained as a weighted average of the expert SPP decisions, with the weights\ndetermined by the gating DNN. A soft spectral attenuation, based on the SPP, is\nthen applied to enhance the noisy speech signal. The experts and the gating\ncomponents of the DMoE network are trained jointly. As part of the training,\nspeech clustering into different subsets is performed in an unsupervised\nmanner. Therefore, unlike previous methods, a phoneme-labeled database is not\nrequired for the training procedure. A series of experiments with different\nnoise types verified the applicability of the new algorithm to the task of\nspeech enhancement. The proposed scheme outperforms other schemes that either\ndo not consider phoneme structure or use a simpler training methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 20:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Users often interpret these by comparing them to standard thresholds,\ne.g. 0.1%, 1% and 5%, which is sometimes reinforced by a star rating (***, **,\n*). We consider an arbitrary statistical test whose p-value p is not available\nexplicitly, but can be approximated by Monte Carlo samples, e.g. by bootstrap\nor permutation tests. The standard implementation of such tests usually draws a\nfixed number of samples to approximate p. However, the probability that the\nexact and the approximated p-value lie on different sides of a threshold (the\nresampling risk) can be high, particularly for p-values close to a threshold.\nWe present a method to overcome this. We consider a finite set of\nuser-specified intervals which cover [0,1] and which can be overlapping. We\ncall these p-value buckets. We present algorithms that, with arbitrarily high\nprobability, return a p-value bucket containing p. We prove that for both a\nbounded resampling risk and a finite runtime, overlapping buckets need to be\nemployed, and that our methods both bound the resampling risk and guarantee a\nfinite runtime for such overlapping buckets. To interpret decisions with\noverlapping buckets, we propose an extension of the star rating system.

However, the fit to low energy observables is not\ngreat especially for $\\sin2\\beta$, and up and down quark masses. In this paper,\nwe show that by choosing PS as the gauge group and modifying the Yukawa sector,\nthe low energy fit improves significantly while other qualities of the model\nare maintained. In particular, the lightest SUSY particle is the neutralino\nwith mass of order 300 - 500 GeV, the lightest stop and sbottom have mass of\norder 3 - 5 TeV and the CP odd Higgs mass is of order 5 - 6 TeV, so we are in\nthe decoupling limit for the light Higgs. In addition, we reinterpret gluino\nsimplified model analyses by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and find that the\nmost stringent gluino mass bound for our model is\n$M_{\\tilde{g}}\\sim1.9\\,\\text{TeV}$. The current best fit point, consistent with\nthis bound, with gluino mass $M_{\\tilde{g}}=1.9\\,\\text{TeV}$ has\n$\\chi^2/\\text{dof}\\approx1.12$, compared to the best fit point of the previous\nmodel with $\\chi^2/\\text{dof}=1.90$.

The\ninhomogeneity is introduced via step functions in the reaction progress\nvariable, with the local value of energy release correspondingly increased so\nas to maintain the same average energy density in the medium, and thus a\nconstant Chapman Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. A one-step Arrhenius rate\ngoverns the rate of energy release in the reactive zones. The resulting\ndynamics of a detonation propagating in such systems with one-dimensional\nlayers and two-dimensional squares are simulated using a Godunov-type\nfinite-volume scheme. The resulting wave dynamics are analyzed by computing the\naverage wave velocity and one-dimensional averaged wave structure. In the case\nof sufficiently inhomogeneous media wherein the spacing between reactive zones\nis greater than the inherent reaction zone length, average wave speeds\nsignificantly greater than the corresponding CJ speed of the homogenized medium\nare obtained. If the shock transit time between reactive zones is less than the\nreaction time scale, then the classical CJ detonation velocity is recovered.\nThe spatio-temporal averaged structure of the waves in these systems is\nanalyzed via a Favre averaging technique, with terms associated with the\nthermal and mechanical fluctuations being explicitly computed. The analysis of\nthe averaged wave structure identifies the super-CJ detonations as weak\ndetonations owing to the existence of mechanical non-equilibrium at the\neffective sonic point embedded within the wave structure. The correspondence of\nthe super-CJ behavior identified in this study with real detonation phenomena\nthat may be observed in experiments is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 22:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

There are\nseveral well-studied notions of fractal dimension for sets and measures in\nEuclidean space. We consider a definition of fractal dimension for finite\nmetric spaces which agrees with standard notions used to empirically estimate\nthe fractal dimension of various sets. We define the fractal dimension of some\nmetric space to be the infimum $\\delta>0$, such that for any $\\epsilon > 0$,\nfor any ball $B$ of radius $r\\geq 2\\epsilon$, and for any $\\epsilon $-net $N$\n(that is, for any maximal $\\epsilon $-packing), we have $|B\\cap\nN|=O((r/\\epsilon)^\\delta)$.\n  Using this definition we obtain faster algorithms for a plethora of classical\nproblems on sets of low fractal dimension in Euclidean space. Our results apply\nto exact and fixed-parameter algorithms, approximation schemes, and spanner\nconstructions. Interestingly, the dependence of the performance of these\nalgorithms on the fractal dimension nearly matches the currently best-known\ndependence on the standard Euclidean dimension.

One of\nthe desirable attributes of stabilization is the use of bounded space for each\nvariable. In this paper, we present an algorithm that transforms a stabilizing\nprogram that uses variables with unbounded domain into a stabilizing program\nthat uses bounded variables and (practically bounded) physical time. While\nnon-stabilizing programs (that do not handle transient faults) can deal with\nunbounded variables by assigning large enough but bounded space, stabilizing\nprograms that need to deal with arbitrary transient faults cannot do the same\nsince a transient fault may corrupt the variable to its maximum value. We show\nthat our transformation algorithm is applicable to several problems including\nlogical clocks, vector clocks, mutual exclusion, leader election, diffusing\ncomputations, Paxos based consensus, and so on. Moreover, our approach can also\nbe used to bound counters used in an earlier work by Katz and Perry for adding\nstabilization to a non-stabilizing program.

A known problem with this\n\"off-policy\" approach is that the robot's errors compound when drifting away\nfrom the supervisor's demonstrations. On-policy, techniques alleviate this by\niteratively collecting corrective actions for the current robot policy.\nHowever, these techniques can be tedious for human supervisors, add significant\ncomputation burden, and may visit dangerous states during training. We propose\nan off-policy approach that injects noise into the supervisor's policy while\ndemonstrating. This forces the supervisor to demonstrate how to recover from\nerrors. We propose a new algorithm, DART (Disturbances for Augmenting Robot\nTrajectories), that collects demonstrations with injected noise, and optimizes\nthe noise level to approximate the error of the robot's trained policy during\ndata collection. We compare DART with DAgger and Behavior Cloning in two\ndomains: in simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo tasks\n(Walker, Humanoid, Hopper, Half-Cheetah) and in physical experiments with human\nsupervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter.

The nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics are heterogeneous,\nsatisfying a Lipschitz-like condition that will be defined later and is more\ngeneral than the Lipschitz condition. In the proposed algorithm, a control\ninput and a filter are designed for each agent. Each agent's filter has two\noutputs and the idea is that the first output estimates the average of the\ninput signals and the second output estimates the average of the input\nvelocities asymptotically. In parallel, each agent's position and velocity are\ndriven to track, respectively, the first and the second outputs.

Since the nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics can be\nunbounded and the input signals are arbitrary, novel state-dependent\ntime-varying gains are employed in agents' filters and control inputs to\novercome these unboundedness effects.

In this paper, we propose a general framework for Robust Guided\nImage Filtering (RGIF), which contains a data term and a smoothness term, to\nsolve the two issues mentioned above. The data term makes our model\nsimultaneously denoise the target image and perform GIF which is robust against\nthe heavy noise.

The method of Model-Free Monte Carlo\n(MFMC) can do this by stitching together state transitions for a new policy\nbased on previously-sampled trajectories from other policies. This \"off-policy\nMonte Carlo simulation\" method works well when the state space has low\ndimension but fails as the dimension grows. This paper describes a method for\nfactoring out some of the state and action variables so that MFMC can work in\nhigh-dimensional MDPs. The new method, MFMCi, is evaluated on a very\nchallenging wildfire management MDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 20:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Conflicts among stakeholders (e.g., timber\ncompanies, home owners, and wildlife biologists) have often led to spirited\npolitical debates and even violent eco-terrorism. One way to transform these\nconflicts into multi-stakeholder negotiations is to provide a high-fidelity\nsimulation environment in which stakeholders can explore the space of\nalternative policies and understand the tradeoffs therein. Such an environment\nneeds to support fast optimization of MDP policies so that users can adjust\nreward functions and analyze the resulting optimal policies. This paper\nassesses the suitability of SMAC---a black-box empirical function optimization\nalgorithm---for rapid optimization of MDP policies. The paper describes five\nreward function components and four stakeholder constituencies. It then\nintroduces a parameterized class of policies that can be easily understood by\nthe stakeholders. SMAC is applied to find the optimal policy in this class for\nthe reward functions of each of the stakeholder constituencies. The results\nconfirm that SMAC is able to rapidly find good policies that make sense from\nthe domain perspective. Because the full-fidelity forest fire simulator is far\ntoo expensive to support interactive optimization, SMAC is applied to a\nsurrogate model constructed from a modest number of runs of the full-fidelity\nsimulator. To check the quality of the SMAC-optimized policies, the policies\nare evaluated on the full-fidelity simulator. The results confirm that the\nsurrogate values estimates are valid. This is the first successful optimization\nof wildfire management policies using a full-fidelity simulation. The same\nmethodology should be applicable to other contentious natural resource\nmanagement problems where high-fidelity simulation is extremely expensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-10"}

Similarly to\nholography, measuring not only the magnitude but also the phase of the DVCS\namplitude allows to perform 3D images of the internal structure of the proton.\nThe phase is made accessible through the quantum-mechanical interference of\nDVCS with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, in which the final photon is emitted\nby the electron rather than the proton.\n  We report herein the first full determination of the BH-DVCS interference by\nexploiting the distinct energy dependences of the DVCS and BH amplitudes.

A good approximation of the\nellipsometric behaviour is achieved with Maxwell-Garnett theory for a composite\nfilm formed by a mixture of TiO2 and TiN phases suggesting that double ENZ\nTiOxNy films are formed by inclusions of TiN within a TiO2 matrix. These\noxynitride compounds could be considered as new materials exhibiting double ENZ\nin the visible and near-IR spectral ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 09:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

So far the RGB-based appearance is widely used in most existing\nworks. However, when people appeared in extreme illumination or changed\nclothes, the RGB appearance-based re-id methods tended to fail. To overcome\nthis problem, we propose to exploit depth information to provide more invariant\nbody shape and skeleton information regardless of illumination and color\nchange. More specifically, we exploit depth voxel covariance descriptor and\nfurther propose a locally rotation invariant depth shape descriptor called\nEigen-depth feature to describe pedestrian body shape. We prove that the\ndistance between any two covariance matrices on the Riemannian manifold is\nequivalent to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding Eigen-depth\nfeatures. Furthermore, we propose a kernelized implicit feature transfer scheme\nto estimate Eigen-depth feature implicitly from RGB image when depth\ninformation is not available. We find that combining the estimated depth\nfeatures with RGB-based appearance features can sometimes help to better reduce\nvisual ambiguities of appearance features caused by illumination and similar\nclothes.

Some domain-specific\nlanguages (DSLs) have been proposed to provide more intuitive ways to implement\ngraph algorithms, but due to the lack of support for remote access --- reading\nor writing attributes of other vertices through references --- they cannot\nhandle the above mentioned dynamic communication, causing a class of Pregel\nalgorithms with fast convergence impossible to implement.\n  To address this problem, we design and implement Palgol, a more declarative\nand powerful DSL which supports remote access. In particular, programmers can\nuse a more declarative syntax called chain access to naturally specify dynamic\ncommunication as if directly reading data on arbitrary remote vertices. By\nanalyzing the logic patterns of chain access, we provide a novel algorithm for\ncompiling Palgol programs to efficient Pregel code. We demonstrate the power of\nPalgol by using it to implement several practical Pregel algorithms, and the\nevaluation result shows that the efficiency of Palgol is comparable with that\nof hand-written code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 12:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 17:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

It hosts several compact and\nUCHII regions, as well as two known hot molecular cores (SgrB2(N1) and\nSgrB2(N2)), where complex organic molecules are detected. Our goal is to use\nthe high sensitivity of ALMA to characterize the hot core population in\nSgrB2(N) and shed a new light on the star formation process. We use a complete\n3 mm spectral line survey conducted with ALMA to search for faint hot cores in\nSgrB2(N). We report the discovery of three new hot cores that we call\nSgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N4), and SgrB2(N5). The three sources are associated with\nclass II methanol masers, well known tracers of high-mass star formation, and\nSgrB2(N5) also with a UCHII region. The chemical composition of the sources and\nthe column densities are derived by modelling the whole spectra under the\nassumption of LTE. The H2 column densities are computed from ALMA and SMA\ncontinuum emission maps. The H2 column densities of these new hot cores are\nfound to be 16 up to 36 times lower than the one of the main hot core Sgr\nB2(N1). Their spectra have spectral line densities of 11 up to 31 emission\nlines per GHz, assigned to 22-25 molecules. We derive rotational temperatures\naround 140-180 K for the three new hot cores and mean source sizes of 0.4 for\nSgrB2(N3) and 1.0 for SgrB2(N4) and SgrB2(N5). SgrB2(N3) and SgrB2(N5) show\nhigh velocity wing emission in typical outflow tracers, with a bipolar\nmorphology in their integrated intensity maps suggesting the presence of an\noutflow, like in SgrB2(N1). The associations of the hot cores with class II\nmethanol masers, outflows, and/or UCHII regions tentatively suggest the\nfollowing age sequence: SgrB2(N4), SgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N5), SgrB2(N1).

Constructed X-ray light\ncurves for B1957+20 using these values are qualitatively consistent with those\nobserved, and we find occultation of the shock by the companion as a minor\ninfluence, demanding significant Doppler factors to yield double peaks. For\nJ1023+0038, radio eclipses imply $R_0 \\lesssim 0.4$ while X-ray light curves\nsuggest $0.1\\lesssim R_0 \\lesssim 0.3$ (from the pulsar). Degeneracies in the\nmodel parameter space encourage further development to include transport\nconsiderations. Generically, the spatial variation along the shock of the\nunderlying electron power-law index should yield energy-dependence in the shape\nof light curves motivating future X-ray phase-resolved spectroscopic studies to\nprobe the unknown physics of pulsar winds and relativistic shock acceleration\ntherein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 13:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

In\nseveral emerging fields, for example computer vision and quantum control, there\nis a growing need for spline interpolation on curved, non-Euclidean space. The\ngeneralization of cubic splines to manifolds is not self-evident, with several\ndistinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing\nproperty, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, require the solution\nof a coupled set of non-linear boundary value problems that cannot be\nintegrated explicitly, even if formulae for geodesics are available.

The survivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a\nneighbouring vertex or staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if\neventually one of them eats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise,\nthe survivor wins. The zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of\nzombies needed to play such that the probability that they win is at least 1/2.\n  This variant of the game was recently investigated for several graph\nfamilies, such as cycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of projective planes,\nand grids $P_n \\square P_n$.

An\nend-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is\nnon-trivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture\nthus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth\ntraining data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven\nby privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pre-trained to\nlearn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The\nlearned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to\noptimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However,\nexploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the\nperformance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between\nthem. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering\nlatent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a\nconsistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and\nnetwork are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization\nprocedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power\nto model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer\ntraining data.

In this case the original matrix is possibly\nhigh-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher\ndimensional space of monomial features. Many well-studied extensions of linear\nmodels, including affine subspaces and their union, can be described by a\nvariety model. In addition, varieties can be used to model a richer class of\nnonlinear quadratic and higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the\nsampling requirements for matrix completion under a variety model with a focus\non a union of affine subspaces. We also propose an efficient matrix completion\nalgorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the rank of the\nmatrix of monomial features. Our algorithm uses the well-known \"kernel trick\"\nto avoid working directly with the high-dimensional monomial matrix. We show\nthe proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically generated data up to\nthe predicted sampling complexity bounds. The proposed algorithm also\noutperforms standard low rank matrix completion and subspace clustering\ntechniques in experiments with real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The Dufort-Frankel approach is first compared to\nthe classical Euler implicit and explicit schemes to compute the solution of\nnonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials.

We also establish properties\nof the eigenvalue curves such as monotonicity, crossings, asymptotic growth,\ncascading and phantom spectral lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 02:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

We consider direction curve and\ndonor curve to study non-lightlike curve couples such as involute-evolute\ncurves, Mannheim partner curves and Bertrand partner curves. We obtain new\nmethods to construct partner curves of a unit speed non-lightlike curve and\ngive some applications related to helices and slant helices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 13:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 08:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

ROOT\nfeatures can be called both directly from Node.js code and by JIT-compiling C++\nmacros. All rootJS methods are invoked asynchronously and support callback\nfunctions, allowing non-blocking operation of Node.js applications using them.\nLast but not least, our bindings have been designed to platform-independent and\nshould therefore work on all systems supporting both ROOT 6 and Node.js.\n  Thanks to rootJS it is now possible to create ROOT-aware Web applications\ntaking full advantage of the high performance and extensive capabilities of\nNode.js. Examples include platforms for the quality assurance of acquired,\nreconstructed or simulated data, book-keeping and e-log systems, and even Web\nbrowser-based data visualisation and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}
