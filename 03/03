We evaluate the applicability of two traditional SGS\nmodels, namely the eddy-viscosity (EV) and the scale-similarity (SS) model, and\none recently proposed nonlinear (NL) SGS model in the realm of compressible MHD\nturbulence. Using 209 simulations of decaying, supersonic (initial sonic Mach\nnumber of ~3) MHD turbulence with a shock-capturing scheme and varying\nresolution, SGS model and filter, we analyze the ensemble statistics of kinetic\nand magnetic energy spectra and structure functions. Furthermore, we compare\nthe temporal evolution of lower and higher order statistical moments of the\nspatial distributions of kinetic and magnetic energy, vorticity, current\ndensity, and dilatation magnitudes. We find no statistical influence on the\nevolution of the flow by any model if grid-scale quantities are used to\ncalculate SGS contributions. In addition, the SS models, which employ an\nexplicit filter, have no impact in general. On the contrary, both EV and NL\nmodels change the statistics if an explicit filter is used. For example, they\nslightly increase the dissipation on the smallest scales. We demonstrate that\nthe nonlinear model improves higher order statistics already with a small\nexplicit filter, i.e. a three-point stencil. The results of e.g. the structure\nfunctions or the skewness and kurtosis of the current density distribution are\ncloser to the ones obtained from simulations at higher resolution.

However, maximum matching\nof a network is often not unique, and finding all MISs may provide deep\ninsights to the controllability of the network. Finding all possible input\nnodes, which form the union of all MISs, is computationally challenging for\nlarge networks. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for the\nproblem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make it\nefficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. We\nrigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated its\nperformance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental results\nshowed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than the\nexisting method on large real networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 18:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 02:08:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 15:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 17:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

This plugin model allows a target application to disconnect\nfrom the hardware emulator at checkpoint time and then re-connect to a possibly\ndifferent hardware emulator at the time of restart. The DMTCP plugin model is\nimportant in allowing three distinct parties to seamlessly inter-operate. The\nthree parties are: the EDA designer, who is concerned with formal verification\nof a circuit design; the DMTCP developers, who are concerned with providing\ntransparent checkpointing during the circuit emulation; and the hardware\nemulator vendor, who provides a plugin library that responds to checkpoint,\nrestart, and other events.\n  The new plugin model is an example of process-level virtualization:\nvirtualization of external abstractions from within a process. This capability\nis motivated by scenarios for testing circuit models with the help of a\nhardware emulator. The plugin model enables a three-way collaboration: allowing\na circuit designer and emulator vendor to each contribute separate proprietary\nplugins while sharing an open source software framework from the DMTCP\ndevelopers. This provides a more flexible platform, where different fault\ninjection models based on plugins can be designed within the DMTCP\ncheckpointing framework. After initialization, one restarts from a checkpointed\nstate under the control of the desired plugin. This restart saves the time\nspent in simulating the initialization phase, while enabling fault injection\nexactly at the region of interest. Upon restart, one can inject faults or\notherwise modify the remainder of the simulation. The work concludes with a\nbrief survey of checkpointing and process-level virtualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 18:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

This strongly suggests that in non-relativistic\ntheories, we cannot make a real space factorization of the Hilbert space on a\ngeneric time slice except the constant time slice, as opposed to relativistic\nfield theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 19:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 08:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

We find\nthat the inner and outer disc scalelengths, as well as the break radius,\ncorrelate with the total angular momentum of the initial merging system, and\nare larger for high angular momentum systems. We follow the angular momentum\nredistribution in our simulated galaxies, and find that, like the mass, the\ndisc angular momentum is acquired via accretion, i.e. to the detriment of the\ngaseous halo. Furthermore, high angular momentum systems give more angular\nmomentum to their discs, which affects directly their radial density profile.\nAdding simulations of isolated galaxies to our sample, we find that the\ncorrelations are valid also for disc galaxies evolved in isolation. We show\nthat the outer part of the disc at the end of the simulation is populated\nmainly by inside-out stellar migration, and that in galaxies with higher\nangular momentum, stars travel radially further out. This, however, does not\nmean that outer disc stars (in type II discs) were mostly born in the inner\ndisc. Indeed, generally the break radius increases over time, and not taking\nthis into account leads to overestimating the number of stars born in the inner\ndisc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 19:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

There is a growing interest in developing automated techniques for SHM\nbased on data collected in a wireless sensor network. In order to conserve\npower and extend battery life, however, it is desirable to minimize the amount\nof data that must be collected and transmitted in such a sensor network. In\nthis paper, we highlight the fact that modal analysis can be formulated as an\natomic norm minimization (ANM) problem, which can be solved efficiently and in\nsome cases recover perfectly a structure's mode shapes and frequencies. We\nsurvey a broad class of sampling and compression strategies that one might\nconsider in a physical sensor network, and we provide bounds on the sample\ncomplexity of these compressive schemes in order to recover a structure's mode\nshapes and frequencies via ANM.

A large number of natural problems\ncan be formulated as LWS problems, yielding obvious $O(n^2)$-time solutions.\n  In many interesting instances, the $O(n^2)$-many weights can be succinctly\nrepresented. Yet except for near-linear time algorithms for some specific\nspecial cases, little is known about when an LWS instantiation admits a\nsubquadratic-time algorithm and when it does not. In particular, no lower\nbounds for LWS instantiations have been known before. In an attempt to remedy\nthis situation, we provide a general approach to study the fine-grained\ncomplexity of succinct instantiations of the LWS problem. In particular, given\nan LWS instantiation we identify a highly parallel core problem that is\nsubquadratically equivalent. This provides either an explanation for the\napparent hardness of the problem or an avenue to find improved algorithms as\nthe case may be.\n  More specifically, we prove subquadratic equivalences between the following\npairs (an LWS instantiation and the corresponding core problem) of problems: a\nlow-rank version of LWS and minimum inner product, finding the longest chain of\nnested boxes and vector domination, and a coin change problem which is closely\nrelated to the knapsack problem and (min,+)-convolution. Using these\nequivalences and known SETH-hardness results for some of the core problems, we\ndeduce tight conditional lower bounds for the corresponding LWS instantiations.\nWe also establish the (min,+)-convolution-hardness of the knapsack problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 20:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

This makes it a prime candidate for the\nminimal-span channel, which only captures the near-wall flow by restricting the\nspanwise channel width to be of the order of a few hundred viscous units.\nRecently, Chung et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418-431) showed\nthat a minimal-span channel can accurately characterise the hydraulic behaviour\nof roughness. Following this, we aim to investigate the fundamental dynamics of\nthe minimal-span channel framework with an eye towards further improving\nperformance. The streamwise domain length of the channel is investigated with\nthe minimum length found to be three times the spanwise width or 1000 viscous\nunits, whichever is longer. A half-height (open) channel with slip wall is\nshown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with\nhalf the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the\nouter layer of a half-height channel to reduce the high streamwise velocity.\nFinally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds\nnumber with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic\nbehaviour of a rough surface. An empirical costing argument is developed to\ndetermine the cost in terms of CPU hours of minimal-span channel simulations a\npriori. This argument involves counting the number of eddy lifespans in the\nchannel, which is then related to the statistical uncertainty of the streamwise\nvelocity. For a given statistical uncertainty in the roughness function, this\ncan then be used to determine the simulation run time. Following this, a\nfinite-volume code with a body-fitted grid is used to determine the roughness\nfunction for square-based pyramids using the above insights. Good agreement\nwith the literature for the same roughness geometry is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 21:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Given a matrix $A$, the algorithm\ncomputes a factorization $A = UTV^{*}$, where $U$ and $V$ have orthonormal\ncolumns, and $T$ is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred).\nThe algorithm randUTV is developed primarily to be a fast and easily\nparallelized alternative to algorithms for computing the Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD). randUTV provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD\nfor problems such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear\nsystems, determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix,\netc. Moreover, randUTV produces highly accurate approximations to the singular\nvalues of $A$. Unlike the SVD, the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV\nfactorization in an incremental, single-stage, and non-iterative way, making it\npossible to halt the factorization process once a specified tolerance has been\nmet. Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy and speed of randUTV to the\nSVD are presented.

Consequently there is a large amount of interest in the potential for\nallowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate approximation architectures.\n  We investigate a method of adapting approximation architectures which uses\nfeedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states\nto guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail.\nThis method is \"unsupervised\" in the sense that it makes no direct reference to\nreward or the VF estimate. We introduce an algorithm based upon this idea which\nadapts a state aggregation approximation architecture on-line.\n  A common method of scoring a VF estimate is to weight the squared Bellman\nerror of each state-action by the probability of that state-action occurring.\nAdopting this scoring method, and assuming $S$ states, we demonstrate\ntheoretically that - provided (1) the number of cells $X$ in the state\naggregation architecture is of order $\\sqrt{S}\\log_2{S}\\ln{S}$ or greater, (2)\nthe policy and transition function are close to deterministic, and (3) the\nprior for the transition function is uniformly distributed - our algorithm,\nused in conjunction with a suitable RL algorithm, can guarantee a score which\nis arbitrarily close to zero as $S$ becomes large.

To overcome this problem, Cho, Sun\nand Lee (\\textit{Statistical Methodology}, 23, 18-34, 2015) recently introduced\ngeneralized progressive censoring which ensures to get a pre specified number\nof failures. In this paper we analyze generalized progressive censored data in\npresence of competing risks.

Based on the exact distributions of the\nmaximum likelihood estimators exact confidence intervals can be obtained.\nAsymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals are also provided for comparison\npurposes. We further consider the Bayesian analysis of the unknown parameters\nunder a very flexible Beta-Gamma prior.

The predominant task\nfor user similarity applications is to discover all similar pairs that have a\npairwise cosine similarity value larger than a given threshold $\\tau$.

We enhance the model by allowing the players to keep in their\nprivate classical workspace apart from their input also some classical private\ncoins. Surprisingly, we show that every quantum protocol can be transformed\ninto an equivalent quantum protocol with private coins that is perfectly\nprivate, i.e. the players only learn the value of the function and nothing\nmore. Last, we consider the model where the players are allowed to use one-shot\ncoins, i.e. private coins that can be used only once during the protocol. While\nin the classical case, private coins and one-shot coins are equivalent, in the\nquantum case, we prove that they are not. More precisely, we show that every\nquantum memoryless protocol with one-bit inputs that uses one-shot coins can be\ntransformed into a memoryless quantum protocol without private coins and\nwithout increasing too much its information cost. Hence, while private coins\nalways allow for private quantum protocols, one-shot coins do not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 07:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 10:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Fractals and the golden ratio appear\nsurprisingly on the way. The sequence of physical harmonics is an increasingly\nenumerable submonoid of (R+,+) whose pairs of consecutive terms get arbitrarily\nclose as they grow. These properties suggest the definition of a new\nmathematical object which we denote a tempered monoid. Mapping the elements of\nthe tempered monoid of physical harmonics from R to N may be considered\ntantamount to defining equal temperaments. The number of equal parts of the\noctave in an equal temperament corresponds to the multiplicity of the related\nnumerical semigroup. Analyzing the sequence of musical harmonics we derive two\nimportant properties that tempered monoids may have: that of being\nproduct-compatible and that of being fractal. We demonstrate that, up to\nnormalization, there is only one product-compatible tempered monoid, which is\nthe logarithmic monoid, and there is only one nonbisectional fractal monoid\nwhich is generated by the golden ratio. The example of half-closed cylindrical\npipes imposes a third property to the sequence of musical harmonics, the\nso-called odd-filterability property. We prove that the maximum number of equal\ndivisions of the octave such that the discretizations of the golden fractal\nmonoid and the logarithmic monoid coincide, and such that the discretization is\nodd-filterable is 12. This is nothing else but the number of equal divisions of\nthe octave in classical Western music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 08:37:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 09:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 11:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Here we review micro-jets of different\norigins, scales and appearances, and propose a unified framework to describe\ntheir dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, representing a\ndimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin\nimpulse). This parameter is rigorously defined for various jet drivers,\nincluding gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations\nwith hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid\nsurface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into\nthree distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets\n($\\zeta<10^{-3}$) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the\ncollapse and rebound. Intermediate jets ($10^{-3}<\\zeta<0.1$) pierce the\nopposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during\nthe rebound. Strong jets ($\\zeta>0.1$) pierce the bubble early during the\ncollapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as\nthe jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet\nimpact and vapour-jet volume. We find that, upon normalising these observables\nto dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions\nof $\\zeta$, which we can reproduce numerically using potential flow theory. An\ninteresting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single\nobservable, such as the bubble displacement, suffices to estimate any other\nparameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of\nintermediate and weak jets only depend on $\\zeta$, not on the jet driver. In\nthe same regime, the jet parameters are found to be well approximated by\npower-laws of $\\zeta$, which we explain through analytical arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 09:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Based on the global\noscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling which\nindicate that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence\nand in the helium-burning phase for these ~2M_sun stars. Finally, our results\nindicate less mode suppression than predicted by recent theories for magnetic\nsuppression of certain oscillation modes in red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 10:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Upon\ninclusion of Ho2O3, due to the strong spin orbit coupling of the rare earth\nHo3+ ion, we do see 13 percent enhancement in the efficiency. We attribute such\nan enhancement in power conversion efficiency to the increased lifetime of the\nphoto-excited excitons. Essentially, a Ho3+ ion accelerates the phenomenon of\nthe spin rephasing or the intersystem crossing of the excitons in a\nphotosensitizer. Increase in the absorbance and decrease in the\nphotoluminescence intensity suggests a decrease in the recombination rate,\nhinting an enhanced charge transport and is in accordance with our\nelectrochemical impedance spectra and the J V characteristics. From the above\nwe strongly believe that enhanced efficiency of the device is due to increased\nintersystem crossing which would accelerate the exciton dissociation. On top of\nspin orbit interaction, a configuration where the electric and magnetic fields\nare perpendicular to each other helped in enhancing the efficiency by 16\npercent, suggesting that the Lorentz force also plays a dominant role in\ncontrolling the charge transport of the photo-generated charge carriers.

However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper\naims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for\nthe reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data.\n  Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of\nthe aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern\nwith additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing\nartifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and\nremove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition.\n  Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted\nmagnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that\nwe can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing\nartifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed\naliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large\nreceptive field.\n  Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact\nlearning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts.\nCompared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed\nnetwork shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts.\nFurthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster.\n  Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately\ngenerates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 12:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric\nSolution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides\nthe position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated\nusing Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims. We\ninvestigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by\nmeans of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods. Mean cluster parallax\nand proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations\nwithin the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the\ninternal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects\nof the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of\nthe TGAS data is assessed. Results. Values given for standard uncertainties are\nstill inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of\nleast squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster\nparallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with\nearlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the\nPleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that\ndiscrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the\ncluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether\nthose potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the\nclusters. Conclusions. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters\nfar beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership\nassessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows\nthe same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly\nincreased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 12:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

However, the\nradial k-space trajectory requires a large number of radial lines for\nhigh-resolution reconstruction. Increasing the number of radial lines causes\nlonger acquisition time, making it more difficult for routine clinical use. On\nthe other hand, if we reduce the number of radial lines, streaking artifact\npatterns are unavoidable. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep\nlearning approach with domain adaptation to restore high-resolution MR images\nfrom under-sampled k-space data.\n  Methods: The proposed deep network removes the streaking artifacts from the\nartifact corrupted images. To address the situation given the limited available\ndata, we propose a domain adaptation scheme that employs a pre-trained network\nusing a large number of x-ray computed tomography (CT) or synthesized radial MR\ndatasets, which is then fine-tuned with only a few radial MR datasets.\n  Results: The proposed method outperforms existing compressed sensing\nalgorithms, such as the total variation and PR-FOCUSS methods. In addition, the\ncalculation time is several orders of magnitude faster than the total variation\nand PR-FOCUSS methods.Moreover, we found that pre-training using CT or MR data\nfrom similar organ data is more important than pre-training using data from the\nsame modality for different organ.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate the possibility of a domain-adaptation when only a\nlimited amount of MR data is available.

Dynamic time warping (DTW) aligns two sequences by\nnonlinear local warping and returns a distance value. DTW shows superior\nability in many applications, e.g. video, image, etc. However, in DTW, two\npoints are paired essentially based on point-to-point Euclidean distance (ED)\nwithout considering the autocorrelation of sequences. Thus, points with\ndifferent semantic meanings, e.g. peaks and valleys, may be matched providing\ntheir coordinate values are similar. As a result, DTW is sensitive to noise and\npoorly interpretable. This paper proposes an efficient and flexible sequence\nalignment algorithm, dynamic state warping (DSW). DSW converts each time point\ninto a latent state, which endows point-wise autocorrelation information.\nAlignment is performed by using the state sequences. Thus DSW is able to yield\nalignment that is semantically more interpretable than that of DTW. Using one\nnearest neighbor classifier, DSW shows significant improvement on\nclassification accuracy in comparison to ED (70/85 wins) and DTW (74/85 wins).\nWe also empirically demonstrate that DSW is more robust and scales better to\nlong sequences than ED and DTW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 13:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Here, we formulate an all-optical experimental set-up\ninvolving such NOT operations that can hasten, delay, or completely avert ESD,\nall depending on when it is applied during the process of decoherence.\nAnalytical expressions for these are derived in terms of parameters of the\ninitial state's density matrix, whether for pure or mixed entangled states.\nAfter a discussion of the schematics of the experiment, the problem is\ntheoretically analyzed, and simulation results of such manipulations of ESD are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 14:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

The superthermal particles can penetrate into the shock upstream\nregion producing an extended shock precursor. The cold upstream plasma flow is\ndecelerated by the force provided by the superthermal particle pressure\ngradient. In high Mach number collisionless shocks, efficient particle\nacceleration is likely coupled with turbulent magnetic field amplification\n(MFA) generated by the anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles.

Indeed, after a symmetrization and a linearization\naround the equilibrium, the system of the incompressible viscoelasticity\nreduces to an incompressible system of damped wave equations for both the fluid\nvelocity and the deformation tensor. These two approaches are not compatible.\nIn this paper, we prove global existence of solutions, uniformly in both time\n$t \\in [0, \\infty)$ and viscosity $\\mu \\geq 0$.

On the other hand, a drawback of the model is that the function\ndescribing the tidal torque is not smooth and consists of a superposition of\nkinks, so that both analytical and numerical computations turn out to be rather\ndelicate: indeed, standard perturbation theory based on power series expansion\ncannot be applied and the implementation of a fast algorithm to integrate the\nequations of motion numerically requires a high degree of care. In this paper,\nwe make a detailed study of the spin-orbit dynamics of Mercury, as predicted by\nthe realistic model: In particular, we present numerical and analytical results\nabout the nature of the librations of Mercury's spin in the 3:2 resonance. The\nresults provide evidence that the librations are quasi-periodic in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 14:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

To overcome this drawback we propose\na new algorithm called RF-ML to perform an operation on the manifold with help\nof Ricci flow before reducing the dimension of manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 07:27:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 08:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 02:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}
