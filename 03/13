The general picture arising from most of these scenarios is that the\nclassical singularity at the end of collapse is replaced by a bounce. The most\nstriking consequence of the bounce is that the black hole horizon may live for\nonly a finite time. The possible implications for astrophysics are important\nsince, if these models capture the essence of the collapse of a massive star,\nan observable signature of quantum gravity may be hiding in astrophysical\nphenomena. One intriguing idea that is implied by these models is the possible\nexistence of exotic compact objects, of high density and finite size, that may\nnot be covered by an horizon. The present article outlines the main features of\nthese collapse models and some of the most relevant open problems. The aim is\nto provide a comprehensive (as much as possible) overview of the current status\nof the field from the point of view of astrophysics.

In this study, employing density\nfunctional theoretical calculations, it has been found out that with the\nforming of heterostructure between MoS2 with buckled 2D materials such as\nsilicence, germanene and stanene, only a small strain can trigger the phase\ntransition.

The origin of such behavior can be\nunderstood as strain induced interlayer covalent bond formation, which finally\nmake MoS2 lattice more sensitive to external strain.

Additionally, results indicated that advances in programming, analytical\nthinking, and abstract analysis skills were evident in not only the students\nbut also the student teachers, suggesting a strong bidirectional flow of\nknowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 20:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

We show that this effect, a\nmaterial property of the cross-linking mechanics, modifies the bundle dynamics\nnon-trivially, and induces a bimodal $L^2-L^3$ length-dependent material\nresponse that departs from the Euler-Bernoulli theory.

When data look like a noise, the scaling exponent may be the only\ninformative feature that summarizes such data. Methods for the assessment of\nself-similarity by estimating Hurst exponent often involve analysis of rate of\ndecay in a spectrum defined in various multiresolution domains. When this\nspectrum is calculated using discrete non-decimated wavelet transforms, due to\nincreased autocorrelation in wavelet coefficients, the estimators of $H$ show\nincreased bias compared to the estimators that use traditional orthogonal\ntransforms. At the same time, non-decimated transforms have a number of\nadvantages when employed for calculation of wavelet spectra and estimation of\nHurst exponents: the variance of the estimator is smaller, input signals and\nimages could be of arbitrary size, and due to the shift-invariance, the local\nscaling can be assessed as well. We propose two methods based on robust\nestimation and resampling that alleviate the effect of increased\nautocorrelation while maintaining all advantages of non-decimated wavelet\ntransforms. The proposed methods extend the approaches in existing literature\nwhere the logarithmic transformation and pairing of wavelet coefficients are\nused for lowering the bias. In a simulation study we use fractional Brownian\nmotions with a range of theoretical Hurst exponents. For such signals for which\n\"true\" $H$ is known, we demonstrate bias reduction and overall reduction of the\nmean-squared error by the two proposed estimators.

Finally, the UAV transmission\nefficiency is enhanced by the use of small-form-factor multi-beam directional\nantennas and optimal power/link scheduling across the scalable signal\nrepresentation layers. Our experiments demonstrate competitive advantages over\nconventional methods for visual sensing. This is a first-of-its-kind study of\nan emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 23:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 19:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

In order to capture the VR users' quality-of-service (QoS) in SCNs, a\nnovel VR model, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is proposed. This\nmodel jointly accounts for VR metrics such as tracking accuracy, processing\ndelay, and transmission delay. In this model, the small base stations (SBSs)\nact as the VR control centers that collect the tracking information from VR\nusers over the cellular uplink. Once this information is collected, the SBSs\nwill then send the three dimensional images and accompanying surround stereo\naudio to the VR users over the downlink. Therefore, the resource allocation\nproblem in VR wireless networks must jointly consider both the uplink and\ndownlink. This problem is then formulated as a noncooperative game and a\ndistributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state\nnetworks (ESNs) is proposed to find the solution of this game. The use of the\nproposed ESN algorithm enables the SBSs to predict the VR QoS of each SBS and\nguarantees the convergence to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. The analytical\nresult shows that each user's VR QoS jointly depends on both VR tracking\naccuracy and wireless resource allocation.

In this paper, we investigate the inference\npower of user ratings data, and propose a simple yet general cognitive\ninference model, called rating to profile (R2P), to infer user demographics\nfrom user provided ratings.

Here, we investigate how heat generated by the radioactive\ndecay of 26Al and 60Fe influences the formation of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as a function of its accretion time and size of\nparent body. We use an existing thermal evolution model that includes various\nphase transitions, heat transfer in the ice-dust matrix, and gas diffusion\nthroughout the porous material, based on thermodynamic parameters derived from\nRosetta observations. Two possibilities are considered: either, to account for\nits bilobate shape, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was assembled from two primordial\n~2 kilometer-sized planetesimals, or it resulted from the disruption of a\nlarger parent body with a size corresponding to that of comet Hale-Bopp (~70\nkm). To fully preserve its volatile content, we find that either\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's formation was delayed between ~2.2 and 7.7 Myr\nafter that of Ca-Al-rich Inclusions in the protosolar nebula or the comet's\naccretion phase took place over the entire time interval, depending on the\nprimordial size of its parent body and the composition of the icy material\nconsidered.

We approach\nthe computation of plans for such domains as the problem of searching over a\ndeterministic state model. In this model, some of the successor states are\nobtained by solving numerically the so-called initial value problem over a set\nof ordinary differential equations (ODE) given by the current plan prefix.\nThese equations hold over time intervals whose duration is determined\ndynamically, according to whether zero crossing events take place for a set of\ninvariant conditions. The resulting planner, FS+, incorporates these features\ntogether with effective heuristic guidance. FS+ does not impose any of the\nsyntactic restrictions on process effects often found on the existing\nliterature on Hybrid Planning. A key concept of our approach is that a clear\nseparation is struck between planning and simulation time steps. The former is\nthe time allowed to observe the evolution of a given dynamical system before\ncommitting to a future course of action, whilst the later is part of the model\nof the environment.

By means of the\ngradual process, the proposed network can simplify the direct SR problem to\nmultistep easier upsampling tasks with very small magnification factor in each\nstep. Furthermore, a gradual training strategy is presented for the GUN. In the\nproposed training process, an initial network can be easily trained with\nedge-like samples, and then the weights are gradually tuned with more complex\nsamples. The GUN can recover fine and vivid results, and is easy to be trained.\nThe experimental results on several image sets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 04:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 01:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

Methods specifically designed for\nconjugate models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to\ndeal with non-conjugate terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods\ncan handle the non-conjugate terms but they usually ignore the conjugate\nstructure of the model which might result in slow convergence. In this paper,\nwe propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference\n(CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate\ncomputations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the\nrest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in\nthe mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a\nvariational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's\napplicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our\nexperimental results show that our method converges much faster than the\nmethods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 06:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

Moreover, it is well-known that also the shape parameter affects the\naccuracy of the local RBF approximants and, as a consequence, of the PU\ninterpolant. Thus here, both the shape parameter used to fit the local problems\nand the size of the associated linear systems are supposed to vary among the\nsubdomains. They are selected by minimizing an a priori error estimate. As\nevident from extensive numerical experiments and applications provided in the\npaper, the proposed method turns out to be extremely accurate also when data\nwith non-homogeneous density are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 07:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

We first propose MTSQL, a set of extensions to\nstandard SQL, which fixes the ambiguity problem.

We use this obstruction to the\n$Q$-exactness of the stress tensor, together with the Ward identities, in order\nto determine the general form of the stress tensor and $R$-current one-point\nfunctions in supersymmetric vacua, which allows us to obtain general\nexpressions for the supersymmetric Casimir charges and partition function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 09:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 21:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In\nthis work, we explicitly define a node's discoverability in a network, and\nformulate a general node discoverability optimization problem, where the goal\nis to create a budgeted set of incoming edges to the target node so as to\noptimize the target node's discoverability in the network. Although the\noptimization problem is proven to be NP-hard, we find that the defined\ndiscoverability measures have good properties that enable us to use a greedy\nalgorithm to find provably near-optimal solutions.

This results in rotation\nvelocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or\nincreasing with disk radius. Comparison between the dynamical mass and the sum\nof stellar and cold gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, inferred\nfrom ancillary data, suggest high baryon factions in the inner, star-forming\nregions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than\nin the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (stellar initial mass\nfunction, calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in\nterms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves for the outer\ndisks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation\nvelocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this\ntrend arises because of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the\nmassive, high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon dominated, with\ndark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the\nlarge velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial\npressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing\nradius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift.\nQualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early Universe\nefficiently condensed at the centres of dark matter halos when gas fractions\nwere high, and dark matter was less concentrated.

To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services\noffered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service\ntools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the\nclassifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that\nadversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another\nclassifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different\narchitectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is\nknown as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box\nsystems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and\ntransferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to\nprotect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block\ntheir transferability.

A\npowerful line of argument in favour of quantum gravity considers models of\nhybrid systems consisting of coupled quantum-classical sectors. The conclusion\nis that such models are inconsistent: either the quantum sector's defining\nproperties necessarily spread to the classical sector, or they are violated.\nThese arguments have a long history, starting with the debates about the\nquantum nature of the electromagnetic fields in the early days of quantum\ntheory. Yet, they have limited scope because they rely on particular dynamical\nmodels obeying restrictive conditions, such as unitarity. In this paper we\npropose a radically new, more general argument, relying on less restrictive\nassumptions. The key feature is an information-theoretic characterisation of\nboth sectors, including their interaction, via constraints on copying\noperations. These operations are necessary for the existence of observables in\nany physical theory, because they constitute the most general representation of\nmeasurement interactions. Remarkably, our argument is formulated without\nresorting to particular dynamical models, thus being applicable to any hybrid\nsystem, even those ruled by \"post-quantum\" theories. Its conclusion is also\ncompatible with partially quantum systems, such as those that exhibit features\nlike complementarity, but may lack others, such as entanglement. As an example,\nwe consider a hybrid system of qubits and rebits. Surprisingly, despite the\nrebit's lack of complex amplitudes, the signature quantum protocols such as\nteleportation are still possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 10:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

When using Auto-Encoders,\nintuitively one assumes that features which are good for reconstruction will\nalso lead to high classification accuracy. Indeed, it became research practice\nand is a suggested strategy by introductory books. However, we prove that this\nis not always the case. We thoroughly investigate the quality of features\nproduced by Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoders when trained to reconstruct\ntheir input. In particular, we analyze the relation between the reconstruction\nand classification capabilities of the network, if we were to use the same\nfeatures for both tasks. Experimental results suggest that in fact, there is no\ncorrelation between the reconstruction score and the quality of features for a\nclassification task. This means, more formally, that the sub-dimension\nrepresentation space learned from the Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (while\nbeing trained for input reconstruction) is not necessarily better separable\nthan the initial input space. Furthermore, we show that the reconstruction\nerror is not a good metric to assess the quality of features, because it is\nbiased by the decoder quality.

Using XRD-CT allows analysis of the 3D\nstructure of the anode, but most importantly, removes the contributions from\nthe sample container and other battery components, particularly important for\nPDF analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

We quantified the host environment of galaxies as the distance to the\nspine of the nearest filament, and compared various galaxy properties within 12\nbins of this distance. We considered galaxies up to 10 $h^{-1}$Mpc from\nfilaments, i.e. deep inside voids. The filaments were defined by a point\nprocess (the Bisous model) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 10.\nIn order to remove the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment\ndensity and redshift, we applied weighting to normalise the corresponding\ndistributions of galaxy populations in each bin. After the normalisation with\nrespect to environment density and redshift, several residual dependencies of\ngalaxy properties still remain. Most notable is the trend of morphology\ntransformations, resulting in a higher elliptical-to-spiral ratio while moving\nfrom voids towards filament spines, bringing along a corresponding increase in\nthe $g-i$ colour index and a decrease in star formation rate. After separating\nelliptical and spiral subsamples, some of the colour index and star formation\nrate evolution still remains. The mentioned trends are characteristic only for\ngalaxies brighter than about $M_{r} = -20$ mag. Unlike some other recent\nstudies, we do not witness an increase in the galaxy stellar mass while\napproaching filaments. The detected transformations can be explained by an\nincrease in the galaxy-galaxy merger rate and/or the cut-off of extragalactic\ngas supplies (starvation) near and inside filaments. Unlike voids, large-scale\ngalaxy filaments are not a mere density enhancement, but have their own\nspecific impact on the constituent galaxies, reducing the star formation rate\nand raising the chances of elliptical morphology also at a fixed environment\ndensity level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

There is considerable interest in using RAR designs in drug\ndevelopment for rare diseases, where traditional designs are not feasible or\nethically objectionable. In this paper we discuss and address a major criticism\nof RAR: the undesirable type I error inflation due to unknown time trends in\nthe trial. Time trends can appear because of changes in the characteristics of\nrecruited patients - so-called \"patient drift\". Patient drift is a realistic\nconcern for clinical trials in rare diseases because these typically recruit\npatients over a very long period of time. We compute by simulations how large\nthe type I error inflation is as a function of the time trend magnitude in\norder to determine in which contexts a potentially costly correction is\nactually necessary. We then assess the ability of different correction methods\nto preserve type I error in this context and their performance in terms of\nother operating characteristics, including patient benefit and power. We make\nrecommendations of which correction methods are most suitable in the rare\ndisease context for several RAR rules, differentiating between the two-armed\nand the multi-armed case. We further propose a RAR design for multi-armed\nclinical trials, which is computationally cheap and robust to several time\ntrends considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 11:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

In terms of modeling, there are $n$ nodes arranged in a\n2-dimensional grid and forming some initial \\emph{shape}. The goal is for the\ninitial shape $A$ to \\emph{transform} to some target shape $B$ by a sequence of\nmovements. Most of the paper focuses on \\emph{transformability} questions,\nmeaning whether it is in principle feasible to transform a given shape to\nanother. We first consider the case in which only rotation is available to the\nnodes. Our main result is that deciding whether two given shapes $A$ and $B$\ncan be transformed to each other, is in $\\mathbf{P}$.

A recently proposed simple model has revealed a general mechanism by\nwhich such systems can become robust against inclusion of elements with random\ninteractions when the elements have a moderate number of links. This happens as\na result of two opposing effects such that while the inclusion of elements with\nmore interactions makes each individual element more robust against\ndisturbances, it also increases the net impact of the loss of any element in\nthe system. The interaction is, however, in many systems often intrinsically\nbidirectional like for mutual symbiosis, competition in ecology, and the\naction-reaction law of Newtonian mechanics, etc. This study reports the strong\nreinforcement effect of the bidirectionality of the interactions on the\nrobustness of evolving systems. We show that the system with purely\nbidirectional interactions can grow with two-fold average degree, in comparison\nwith the purely unidirectional system. This drastic shift of the transition\npoint comes from the reinforcement of each node, not from a change in structure\nof the emergent system. For systems with partially bidirectional interactions\nwe find that the area of the growing phase gets expanded. In the dense\ninteraction regime, there exists an optimum proportion of bidirectional\ninteractions for the growth rate at around $1/3$. In the sparsely connected\nsystems, small but finite fraction of bidirectional links can change the\nsystem's behaviour from non-growing to growing behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian\noptimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledge-gradient (dKG), for\nwhich we show one-step Bayes-optimality, asymptotic consistency, and greater\none-step value of information than is possible in the derivative-free setting.\nOur procedure accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, comes\nin both sequential and batch forms, and can optionally reduce the computational\ncost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single\ndirectional derivative. We also compute the d-KG acquisition function and its\ngradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show d-KG\nprovides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization\nprocedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic\nregression, deep learning, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 13:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 13:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 04:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Significant\nadvances in our understanding of flare physics often come from coordinated\nobservations between multiple instruments. Consequently, considerable efforts\nhave been, and continue to be made to coordinate observations among instruments\n(e.g. through the Max Millennium Program of Solar Flare Research). However,\nthere has been no study to date that quantifies how many flares have been\nobserved by combinations of various instruments. Here we describe a technique\nthat retrospectively searches archival databases for flares jointly observed by\nRHESSI, SDO/EVE (MEGS-A and -B), Hinode/(EIS, SOT, and XRT), and IRIS. Out of\nthe 6953 flares of GOES magnitude C1 or greater that we consider over the 6.5\nyears after the launch of SDO, 40 have been observed by six or more instruments\nsimultaneously. Using each instrument's individual rate of success in observing\nflares, we show that the numbers of flares co-observed by three or more\ninstruments are higher than the number expected under the assumption that the\ninstruments operated independently of one another. In particular, the number of\nflares observed by larger numbers of instruments is much higher than expected.\nOur study illustrates that these missions often acted in cooperation, or at\nleast had aligned goals. We also provide details on an interactive widget now\navailable in SSWIDL that allows a user to search for flaring events that have\nbeen observed by a chosen set of instruments. This provides access to a broader\nrange of events in order to answer specific science questions.

We then propose a generalized SCFlip\ndecoding algorithm, referred to as Dynamic-SCFlip (D-SCFlip), which dynamically\nbuilds a list of candidate bit-flips, while guaranteeing that extra decoding\nattempts are performed by decreasing probability of success. Simulation results\nshow that D-SCFlip is an effective alternative to SC-List decoding of polar\ncodes, by providing very good error correcting performance, with an average\ncomputation complexity close to the one of the SC decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 14:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

One key limitation which\nhas not been well predicted by theory is the gain saturation behavior which\ndetermines its ability to process large amplitude signals. The typical\nexplanation for this behavior in phase-preserving amplifiers based on\nthree-wave mixing is pump depletion, in which the consumption of pump photons\nto produce amplification results in a reduction in gain. However, in this work\nwe present experimental data and theoretical calculations showing that the\nfourth-order Kerr nonlinearities inherent in the Josephson junctions are the\ndominant factor in the Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC).

Those two generations of carbonates can\nbe distinguished by a very sharp change in compositions, from being rich in Mg\nand poor in Fe and Mn, to being poor in Mg and rich in Fe and Mn. Between these\ntwo generations of carbonate is evidence for fracturing and local corrosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 15:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

Its conservation, however,\nyields \"empty\" de Sitter (open, flat, closed) as single cosmological solution,\nwhere Misner-Sharp total energy acts as cosmological constant and where the\nsource of curvature energy is unidentified. It is argued that de Sitter is only\napparently empty of matter.

Curvature of time accounts completely for\nthe extrinsic curvature, i.e., renders open de Sitter spatially flat. This\nexplains the well known, surprising, spatial flatness of Misner-Sharp energy,\neven if extrinsic curvature is non-zero. The general relativistic derivation\nfrom Misner-Sharp energy is confirmed by a Machian equation of recessional and\npeculiar energy, which explicitly assumes the presence of matter. This\nrelational model enhances interpretation. Time-dilated open de Sitter is\nspatially flat, dynamically close to $\\Lambda$CDM, and is shown to be without\nthe conceptual problems of concordance cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 20:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 12:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 14:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}
