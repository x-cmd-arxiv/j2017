Several searches for such exomoons are now underway, and the\nexquisite astronomical data quality of upcoming space missions and ground-based\nextremely large telescopes could make the detection and characterization of\nexomoons possible in the near future. Here we explore the effects of tidal\nheating on the potential of Mars- to Earth-sized satellites to host liquid\nsurface water, and we compare the tidal heating rates predicted by tidal\nequilibrium model and a viscoelastic model. In addition to tidal heating, we\nconsider stellar radiation, planetary illumination and thermal heat from the\nplanet. However, the effects of a possible moon atmosphere are neglected. We\nmap the circumplanetary habitable zone for different stellar distances in\nspecific star-planet-satellite configurations, and determine those regions\nwhere tidal heating dominates over stellar radiation. We find that the\n`thermostat effect' of the viscoelastic model is significant not just at large\ndistances from the star, but also in the stellar habitable zone, where stellar\nradiation is prevalent. We also find that tidal heating of Mars-sized moons\nwith eccentricities between 0.001 and 0.01 is the dominant energy source beyond\n3--5 AU from a Sun-like star and beyond 0.4--0.6 AU from an M3 dwarf star. The\nlatter would be easier to detect (if they exist), but their orbital stability\nmight be under jeopardy due to the gravitational perturbations from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 16:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

The temperature is derived from the\ntemperature-dependant decay time constant of luminescence from a minuscule\nscintillation sensor (0.05 mm3) located in very close proximity to the sample\nunder test. In this work we present the underlying principle of cryogenic\nluminescence lifetime thermometry, discuss the features of the detection\nmethod, the choice of temperature sensor and demonstrate how the temperature\nmonitoring system was integrated within the viewing system of the end-station\nused for the visualisation of protein crystals. The thermometry system was\ncharacterised using a Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) crystal scintillator that exhibits good\nresponsivity of the decay time constant as function of temperature over a wide\nrange (8-270 K). The scintillation sensor was calibrated and the uncertainty of\nthe temperature measurements over the primary operation temperature range of\nthe beamline (30-150 K) was assessed to be +-1.6 K. It has been shown that the\ntemperature of the sample holder, measured using the luminescence sensor,\nagrees well with the expected value. The technique was applied to characterise\nthe thermal performance of different sample mounts that have been used in MX\nexperiments at the I23 beamline. The thickness of the mount is shown to have\nthe greatest impact upon the temperature distribution across the sample mount.\nAltogether these tests and findings demonstrate the usefulness of the\nthermometry system in highlighting the challenges that remain to be addressed\nfor the in-vacuum MX experiment to become a reliable and indispensable tool for\nstructural biology\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 16:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

This particle (denoted\nhere by $H_3$) is weakly mixed with the Standard Model Higgs field ($h$) with\nmixing $\\theta_1\\lesssim m_{H_3}/m_h$, barring fine-tuned cancellation. In the\nspecific case when the $B-L$ symmetry is embedded into the TeV scale left-right\nseesaw scenario, we show that the bounds on the $h-H_3$ mixing $\\theta_1$\nbecome further strengthened due to low energy flavor constraints, thus forcing\nthe light $H_3$ to be long lived, with displaced vertex signals at the LHC. The\nproperty of left-right TeV scale seesaw models are such that they make the\n$H_3$ decay to two photons as the dominant mode. This is in contrast with a\ngeneric light scalar that mixes with the SM Higgs boson, which could also have\nleptonic and hadronic decay modes with comparable or larger strength. We\ndiscuss the production of this new scalar field at the LHC and show that it\nleads to testable displaced vertex signals of collimated photon jets, which is\na new distinguishing feature of the left-right seesaw model.

We also compare the\nperformance of our model trained individually for each language to a variant\ntrained for all languages at once. We show that the latter model reaches\nslightly worse - but still acceptable - performance when compared to the single\nlanguage model, while benefiting from better generalization properties across\nlanguages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 18:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We use the holographically dual two-dimensional CFT on the torus and\nthe related modular symmetry in order to treat bulk black holes and conical\nsingularities (sourced by pointlike masses not shielded by horizons) on the\nsame footing. In the regime where boundary tori can be approximated by\ncylinders we are able to give universal expressions for the EE of black holes\nand conical singularities. We argue that the presence of horizons/localized\nmatter in the bulk is encoded in the EE in terms of (i) enhancement/reduction\nof the entanglement of the AdS_3 vacuum, (ii) scaling as area/volume of the\nleading term of the perturbative expansion of S_E, (iii) exponential/periodic\nbehaviour of S_E, (iv) presence of unaccessible regions in the\nnoncompact/compact dimension of the boundary cylinder. In particular, we show\nthat the reduction effect of matter on the entanglement of the vacuum found by\nVerlinde for the de Sitter vacuum extends to the AdS_3 vacuum\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 18:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

Their existence and robustness against\nadiabatic changes is deeply related, via a bulk-edge correspondence, to\ntopological properties of the band structure. The present paper shows that the\nspin-orbit may be responsible for topological transitions when the\nsuperconducting system has an underlying sublattice structure, as it appears in\na dimerized Peierls chain, graphene, and phosphorene. These systems, which\nbelong to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes class D, are found to have an extra symmetry\nthat plays the role of the parity. It enables the characterization of the\ntopology of the particle-hole symmetric band structure in terms of band\ninversions.

They reveal that, because of the underlying\nsublattice structure, the existence of topological superconducting phases\nrequires a minimum doping fixed by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit.\nMajorana boundary quasiparticles are finally predicted to emerge when the Fermi\nlevel lies in the vicinity of the bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band\nin semiconductors such as the dimerized Peierls chain and phosphorene. In a\ntwo-dimensional topological superconductor based on (stretched) graphene, which\nis semimetallic, Majorana quasiparticles cannot emerge at zero and low doping,\nthat is, when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac points.

Given a target video, object to detect, and\nreference neural network, NoScope automatically searches for and trains a\nsequence, or cascade, of models that preserves the accuracy of the reference\nnetwork but is specialized to the target video and are therefore far less\ncomputationally expensive. NoScope cascades two types of models: specialized\nmodels that forego the full generality of the reference model but faithfully\nmimic its behavior for the target video and object; and difference detectors\nthat highlight temporal differences across frames. We show that the optimal\ncascade architecture differs across videos and objects, so NoScope uses an\nefficient cost-based optimizer to search across models and cascades. With this\napproach, NoScope achieves two to three order of magnitude speed-ups\n(265-15,500x real-time) on binary classification tasks over fixed-angle webcam\nand surveillance video while maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of\nstate-of-the-art neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 18:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 07:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 21:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

The dust polarization shows\ncomplex magnetic field structures in the massive dense cores with sizes of 0.1\npc, in contrast to the ordered magnetic fields of the parsec-scale filament.\nThe major axes of the massive dense cores appear to be aligned either parallel\nor perpendicular to the magnetic fields of the filament, indicating that the\nparsec-scale magnetic fields play an important role in the formation of the\nmassive dense cores. However, the correlation between the major axes of the\ncores and the magnetic fields of the cores is less significant, suggesting that\nduring the core formation, the magnetic fields below 0.1 pc scales become less\nimportant than the magnetic fields above 0.1 pc scales in supporting a core\nagainst gravity. Our analysis of the angular dispersion functions of the\nobserved polarization segments yields the plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths\nof 0.4--1.7 mG of the massive dense cores. We estimate the kinematic, magnetic,\nand gravitational virial parameters of the filament and the cores. The virial\nparameters show that in the filament, the gravitational energy is dominant over\nmagnetic and kinematic energies, while in the cores, the kinematic energy is\ndominant. Our work suggests that although magnetic fields may play an important\nrole in a collapsing filament, the kinematics arising from gravitational\ncollapse must become more important than magnetic fields during the evolution\nfrom filaments to massive dense cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 19:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

GWAS analyze genome sequence\nvariations in order to identify genetic risk factors for diseases.

Structural alloys are commonly strengthened through a high density of\nsmall size intermetallic precipitates. At high temperatures, however, the\nprecipitates coarsen to reduce the excess energy of the interface, resulting in\na significant reduction in the strengthening provided by the precipitates. In\ncertain ternary alloys, the secondary solute segregates to the interface and\nresults in the formation of a high density of nanosize precipitates that\nprovide enhanced strength and are resistant to coarsening. To understand the\nchemical effects involved, and to identify such systems, we develop a\nthermodynamic model using the framework of the regular nanocrystalline solution\nmodel.

In the context of\nsubgraph counting, we show how edge sampling weights can be chosen so as to\nminimize the estimation variance of counts of specified sets of subgraphs. In\ndistinction with many prior graph sampling schemes, GPS separates the functions\nof edge sampling and subgraph estimation. We propose two estimation frameworks:\n(1) Post-Stream estimation, to allow GPS to construct a reference sample of\nedges to support retrospective graph queries, and (2) In-Stream estimation, to\nallow GPS to obtain lower variance estimates by incrementally updating the\nsubgraph count estimates during stream processing. Unbiasedness of subgraph\nestimators is established through a new Martingale formulation of graph stream\norder sampling, which shows that subgraph estimators, written as a product of\nconstituent edge estimators are unbiased, even when computed at different\npoints in the stream.

In this paper, we propose strengthening the\nrecognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture\nstructural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph\nmodels and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main\ncontributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform\ncalculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount\nof time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data\nrecognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be\ncaptured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting\nframework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the\ndecision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with\npowerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural\nvariation.

When de novo chromatin\nmodifications (establishment or erasure of, respectively, new or pre-existing\nDNA methylations and/or histone modifications) are made in a daughter cell,\nhowever, it has a different epigenome than its mother cell. Although de novo\nchromatin modifications are an important event that comprises elementary\nprocesses of cell differentiation, its molecular mechanism remains poorly\nunderstood. We argue in this Letter that a key to solving this problem lies in\nunderstanding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)- a type of RNA that is\nbecoming increasingly prominent in epigenetic studies. Many studies show that\nlncRNAs form ribonucleo-protein complexes in the nucleus and are involved in\nchromatin modifications. However, chromatin-modifying enzymes lack the\ninformation about genomic positions on which they act. It is known, on the\nother hand, that a single-stranded RNA in general can bind to a double-stranded\nDNA to form a triple helix. If each lncRNA forms a ribonucleo-protein complex\nwith chromatin-modifying enzymes on one hand and, at the same time, a triple\nhelix with a genomic region based on its specific nucleotide sequence on the\nother hand, it can induce de novo chromatin modifications at specific sites.\nThus, the great variety of lncRNAs can be explained by the requirement for the\ndiversity of \"genomic address codes\" specific to their cognate genomic regions\nwhere de novo chromatin modifications take place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 01:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

In this work we\nquantitatively study the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads by analysing\na large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an\nunconstrained \"ecological\" setting (a shopping mall), whose relational group\nproperties have been coded by three different human observers. We observed that\nfemales walk slower and closer than males, that workers walk faster, at a\nlarger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter\ngroup relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking\nvery close and abreast, colleagues walking at a larger distance, and friends\nwalking more abreast than family members.

Results regarding\npedestrian age show as expected that elderly people walk slowly, while active\nage adults walk at the maximum velocity. Groups with children have a strong\ntendency to walk in a non abreast formation, with a large distance (despite a\nlow abreast distance).

The former component shows rare Balmer absorption, which is an\nindicator of high density absorbing gas, thus the quasar is worth follow-up\nspectroscopic observations. Our follow-up optical and near-infrared spectra\nusing MMT, YFOSC, TripleSpec and DBSP reveal that the strengths of the\nabsorption lines vary for both of the two components, while the velocities do\nnot change.

While order sampling\nis a powerful and e cient method for weighted sampling from a stream of\nuniquely keyed items, there is no current algorithm that realizes the benefits\nof order sampling in the context of stream aggregation over non-unique keys. A\nnaive approach to order sample regardless of key then aggregate the results is\nhopelessly inefficient. In distinction, our proposed algorithm uses a single\npersistent random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache, and\nmaintains unbiased estimates of the key aggregates that can be queried at any\npoint in the stream. The basic approach can be supplemented with a Sample and\nHold pre-sampling stage with a sampling rate adaptation controlled by PBA. This\napproach represents a considerable reduction in computational complexity\ncompared with the state of the art in adapting Sample and Hold to operate with\na fixed cache size.

However, distributed transactions complicate the dependency\nresolution, and therefore, an effective transaction partitioning strategy is\nessential to reduce expensive multi-node distributed transactions. During\nfailure recovery, log must be examined from the last checkpoint onwards and the\naffected transactions are re-executed based on the way they are partitioned and\nexecuted. Existing approaches treat both transaction management and recovery as\ntwo separate problems, even though recovery is dependent on the sequence in\nwhich transactions are executed.\n  In this paper, we propose to treat the transaction management and recovery\nproblems as one. We first propose an efficient Distributed Dependency Graph\nbased Concurrency Control (DistDGCC) protocol for handling transactions\nspanning multiple nodes, and propose a new novel and efficient logging protocol\ncalled Dependency Logging that also makes use of dependency graphs for\nefficient logging and recovery. DistDGCC optimizes the average cost for each\ndistributed transaction by processing transactions in batch. Moreover, it also\nreduces the effects of thread blocking caused by distributed transactions and\nconsequently improves the runtime performance. Further, dependency logging\nexploits the same data structure that is used by DistDGCC to reduce the logging\noverhead, as well as the logical dependency information to improve the recovery\nparallelism. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of\nour proposed technique against state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental\nresults show that DistDGCC is efficient and scalable, and dependency logging\nsupports fast recovery with marginal runtime overhead. Hence, the overall\nsystem performance is significantly improved as a result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 06:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-09"}

To\nlower the transmit powers of SUs, we employ multi-hop transmission with time\ndivision multiple access, by which SUs first harvest energy from the RF signals\nof PUs and then transmit data in the allocated time concurrently with PUs, all\nin the licensed spectrum. In this way, the available transmit energy of each SU\nmainly depends on the harvested energy before the turn to transmit, namely\nenergy causality.

First we will discuss which bound state\nsolutions in different B-field regimes can be used as the basis for qubits\nstates. We find that at low B-fields combined spin-valley Kramers qubits to be\nsuitable, while at large magnetic fields pure spin or valley qubits can be\nenvisioned.

Interest in such\nexotic pairing was initiated by the 1979 discovery of heavy-fermion\nsuperconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, which exhibits strong antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations. A hallmark of unconventional pairing by anisotropic repulsive\ninteractions is that the superconducting energy gap changes sign as a function\nof the electron momentum, often leading to nodes where the gap goes to zero.\nHere, we report low-temperature specific heat, thermal conductivity and\nmagnetic penetration depth measurements in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, demonstrating the\nabsence of gap nodes at any point on the Fermi surface. Moreover,\nelectron-irradiation experiments reveal that the superconductivity survives\neven when the electron mean free path becomes substantially shorter than the\nsuperconducting coherence length. This indicates that superconductivity is\nrobust against impurities, implying that there is no sign change in the gap\nfunction.

One\nproposed model for the transport and release of mechanical energy generated in\nthe sub-phorospheric layers and photosphere is the nanoflare model that\nincorporates Ohmic heating which releases a part of the energy stored in the\nmagnetic field via magnetic reconnection. The problem with the verification of\nthis model is that we cannot resolve observationally small scale events.\nHistograms of observable characteristics of flares, show powerlaw behavior, for\nboth energy release rate, size and total energy. Depending on the powerlaw\nindex of the energy release, nanoflares might be an important candidate for\ncoronal heating; we seek to find that index.

The quantity\nwe explore is the Joule heating, which is explicitly correlated with the\nmagnetic reconnection because depends on the curl of the magnetic field. We are\nable to identify 4136 events in a volume $24 \\times 24 \\times 9.5 \\\n\\textrm{Mm}^3$ (i.e. $768 \\times 786 \\times 331$ grid cells) of a specific\nsnapshot. We find a powerlaw slope of the released energy per second, and two\npowerlaw slopes of the identified volume. The identified energy events do not\nrepresent all the released energy, but of the identified events, the total\nenergy of the largest events dominate the energy release. Most of the energy\nrelease happens in the lower corona, while heating drops with height. We find\nthat with a specific identification method that large events can be resolved\ninto smaller ones, but at the expense of the total identified energy releases.\nThe energy release which cannot be identified as an event favours a low energy\nrelease mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 12:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 08:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

By numerically investigating population\ngenetics models of recombination, migration and selection, we demonstrate that\nstronger selection can slow down evolution on a perfectly smooth fitness\nlandscape. Through simple analytical calculation, this apparently\ncounter-intuitive result is shown to stem from two opposing effects of natural\nselection on the rate of evolution. On the one hand, natural selection tends to\nincrease the rate of evolution by increasing the fixation probability of fitter\ngenotypes. On the other hand, natural selection tends to decrease the rate of\nevolution by decreasing the chance of recombination between immigrants and\nresident individuals. As a consequence of these opposing effects, there is a\nfinite selection pressure maximizing the rate of evolution.

The mechanism of disk formation around fast-rotating Be stars is not\nwell understood.

Aims. Despite all these previous\nstudies, the disk around Achernar was never directly imaged. Therefore we seek\nto produce an image of the photosphere and close environment of the star.\nMethods. We used infrared long-baseline interferometry with the PIONIER/VLTI\ninstrument to produce reconstructed images of the photosphere and close\nenvironment of the star over four years of observations. To study the disk\nformation, we compared the observations and reconstructed images to previously\ncomputed models of both the stellar photosphere alone (normal B phase) and the\nstar presenting a circumstellar disk (Be phase). Results. The observations\ntaken in 2011 and 2012, during the quiescent phase of Achernar, do not exhibit\na disk at the detection limit of the instrument.

In order to deal with the large frequency deviation problem,\nwhich is the main concern of the power system integrated with a large number of\nrenewable energy, a faster convergence is critical. In this paper, we propose a\nsecondary frequency control method named Power-Imbalance Allocation Control\n(PIAC) to restore the nominal frequency with a minimized control cost,in which\na coordinator estimates the power imbalance and dispatches the control inputs\nto the controllers after solving an economic power dispatch problem. The power\nimbalance estimation converges exponentially in PIAC, both overshoots and large\nfrequency deviations are avoided. In addition, when PIAC is implemented in a\nmulti-area controlled network, the controllers of an area are independent of\nthe disturbance of the neighbor areas, which allows an asynchronous control in\nthe multi-area network. A Lyapunov stability analysis shows that PIAC is\nlocally asymptotically stable and simulation results illustrates that it\neffectively eliminates the drawback of the traditional integral control based\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 14:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 12:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 11:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly\nacross geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here\nwe consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking\nwater might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile\nhormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat\nsoluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin\nA, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development\nhas been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone\nanalog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause\ndevelopmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing\nmicrocephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.\nWe review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually\nfound some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and\narhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is\nunprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.\nClaims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not\nbeen documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly\ncases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different\nstates across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim\nthat Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular\nmechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend\nthat the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal\nlink to microcephaly is investigated further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 19:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

In the strategically-timed attack, the\nadversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent at\na small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to\nthis subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a\nnovel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and\napplied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a\ndesignated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a\nplanning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the\nplanning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the\nagent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to\ntake the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the two tactics to the agents\ntrained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including\nDQN and A3C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically timed attack reduces as much\nreward as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) does by\nattacking the agent 4 times less often.

The relations equate the dissipation rate for\neither passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the\ninitial values, boundary values, and internal sources, as those are sampled\nbackward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic\nconcepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the\nboundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are\nimposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar values are\nimposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the\nproblem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of\nchannel-flow flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing\nproperties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the\nrelation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous\nstochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle\ntrajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. In the first\npaper of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only\npossible mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away\nfrom walls. Here it is shown that this remains true when there are no scalar\nfluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the other hand, that a distinct\nmechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary\nlayers near the walls.
