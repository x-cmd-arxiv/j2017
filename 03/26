The goal is to have a system that takes as input\nan image and returns a count of the objects inside and justification for the\nprediction in the form of object localization. We repose a problem, originally\nposed by Lempitsky and Zisserman, to instead predict a count map which contains\nredundant counts based on the receptive field of a smaller regression network.\nThe regression network predicts a count of the objects that exist inside this\nframe.

Given the diurnal fluctuation of shortwave and longwave\nradiation, a shift in the cloud cycle phase (CCP) may lead to substantial\nfeedbacks to the climate system. While most efforts have focused on the overall\ncloud feedback, the response of CCP to climate change has received much less\nattention. Here we analyze the variations of CCP using both long-term global\nsatellite records and general circulation models (GCM) simulations to evaluate\ntheir impacts on the earth's energy budget. Satellite records show that in warm\nperiods the CCP shifts earlier in the morning over the oceans and later in the\nafternoon over the land. Although less marked and with large inter-model\nspread, similar shifting patterns also occur in GCMs over the oceans with\nnon-negligible CCP feedbacks. Over the land, where the GCM results are not\nconclusive, our findings are supported by atmospheric boundary layer models. A\nsimplified radiative model further suggests that such shifts may in turn cause\nreduced reflection of solar radiation, thus inducing a positive feedback on\nclimate. The crucial role of the cloud cycle calls for increased attention to\nthe temporal evolution of the cloud diurnal cycle in climate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 18:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

One important issue in MT\nis that how to evaluate the MT system reasonably and tell us whether the\ntranslation system makes an improvement or not. The traditional manual judgment\nmethods are expensive, time-consuming, unrepeatable, and sometimes with low\nagreement. On the other hand, the popular automatic MT evaluation methods have\nsome weaknesses. Firstly, they tend to perform well on the language pairs with\nEnglish as the target language, but weak when English is used as source.\nSecondly, some methods rely on many additional linguistic features to achieve\ngood performance, which makes the metric unable to replicate and apply to other\nlanguage pairs easily. Thirdly, some popular metrics utilize incomprehensive\nfactors, which result in low performance on some practical tasks. In this\nthesis, to address the existing problems, we design novel MT evaluation methods\nand investigate their performances on different languages. Firstly, we design\naugmented factors to yield highly accurate evaluation. Secondly, we design a\ntunable evaluation model where weighting of factors can be optimized according\nto the characteristics of languages. Thirdly, in the enhanced version of our\nmethods, we design concise linguistic feature using part-of-speech (POS) to\nshow that our methods can yield even higher performance when using some\nexternal linguistic resources.

A main difficulty for such an extension is that the\noriginal Turbo-CS algorithm requires prior knowledge of the signal distribution\nthat is usually unavailable in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we\npropose to redesign the Turbo-CS algorithm by employing a generic denoiser that\ndoes not depend on the prior distribution and hence the name denoising-based\nTurbo-CS (D-Turbo-CS).

In the\nliterature, the potential functions of CRFs are mostly defined as a linear\ncombination of some pre-defined parametric models, and then methods like\nstructured support vector machines (SSVMs) are applied to learn those linear\ncoefficients. We instead formulate the unary and pairwise potentials as\nnonparametric forests---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble\nparameters and the trees in a unified optimization problem within the\nlarge-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily achieve nonlinear learning\nof potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Moreover, we\nlearn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due\nto the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our approach is\npowerful in modelling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The\nresulting optimization problem is very challenging because it can have\nexponentially many variables and constraints. We show that this challenging\noptimization can be efficiently solved by combining a modified column\ngeneration and cutting-planes techniques.

But what are the reasons for this\nphenomenon? Is it that such relations are more convenient and easier to\nmaintain? Or are there also some more tangible benefits to be gained from this\ncollective behaviour?\n  The current work takes a game-theoretic perspective on this phenomenon, and\nstudies the conditions under which different assortative mixing strategies lead\nto equilibrium in an evolving social network. We focus on a biased preferential\nattachment model where the strategy of each group (e.g., political or social\nminority) determines the level of bias of its members toward other group\nmembers and non-members. Our first result is that if the utility function that\nthe group attempts to maximize is the degree centrality of the group,\ninterpreted as the sum of degrees of the group members in the network, then the\nonly strategy achieving Nash equilibrium is a perfect homophily, which implies\nthat cooperation with other groups is harmful to this utility function. A\nsecond, and perhaps more surprising, result is that if a reward for inter-group\ncooperation is added to the utility function (e.g., externally enforced by an\nauthority as a regulation), then there are only two possible equilibria,\nnamely, perfect homophily or perfect heterophily, and it is possible to\ncharacterize their feasibility spaces.

The lightest\nparticle in the hidden sector, whose contribution to the CKM matrix is expected\nto be dominant, is a good dark matter (DM) candidate, so we focus on the\ncontribution, and discuss the DM physics. In this scenario, there is an\nexplicit relation between the CKM matrix and flavor violating couplings, such\nas four-quark couplings, because both are radiatively induced by the particles\nin the hidden sector.

Consequently, number counts derived from low and high angular\nresolution observations are in disagreement. This demonstrates the importance\nof resolution effects and the need to have realistic simulations to explore\nthem. We built a new 2deg^2 simulation of the extragalactic sky from the\nfar-infrared to the submillimeter. It is based on an updated version of the two\nstar-formation mode galaxy evolution model. Using global galaxy properties, we\nuse the abundance matching technique to populate a dark-matter lightcone and\nthus simulate the clustering. We produce maps and extract the sources, and show\nthat the limited angular resolution of single-dish instruments have a strong\nimpact on (sub)millimeter continuum observations. Taking into account these\nresolution effects, we are reproducing a large set of observables, including\nnumber counts, redshift distributions, and cosmic infrared background power\nspectra. Our simulation describes consistently the number counts from\nsingle-dish telescopes and interferometers. In particular, at 350 and 500 um,\nwe find that number counts measured by Herschel between 5 and 50 mJy are biased\ntowards high values by a factor 2, and that redshift distributions are biased\ntowards low z. We also show that the clustering has an important impact on the\nHerschel pixel histogram used to derive number counts from P(D) analysis.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the large number density of red Herschel sources\nfound in observations but not in models could be an observational artifact\ncaused by the combination of noise, resolution effects, and the steepness of\ncolor and flux density distributions.

Recent realizations of\nartificial gauge fields and adjustable optical lattices in cold atom\nexperiments necessitate the consideration of these self-similar spectra for the\nmost general two-dimensional lattice. In a previous work, we investigated the\nevolution of the spectrum for an experimentally realized lattice which was\ntuned by changing the unit cell structure but keeping the square Bravais\nlattice fixed. We now consider all possible Bravais lattices in two dimensions\nand investigate the structure of the Hofstadter butterfly as the lattice is\ndeformed between lattices with different point symmetry groups. We model the\noptical lattice by a sinusoidal real space potential and obtain the tight\nbinding model for any lattice geometry by calculating the Wannier functions. We\nintroduce the magnetic field via Peierls substitution and numerically calculate\nthe energy spectrum. The transition between the two most symmetric lattices,\ni.e. the triangular and the square lattice displays the importance of bipartite\nsymmetry featuring deformation as well as closing of some of the major energy\ngaps.

A Higgs mechanism within a spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking process offers formal connections, via an effective potential V(eff),\nbetween some relevant properties of the elementary particles and the dark\nenergy content of the Universe. The nonintegrable application of the Weyl's\ngeometry leads to a Proca equation accounting for the dynamics of a\nvector-meson proposed as an optimum candidate for Dark Matter. The average\nvacuum-energy density in the Universe and the \"cosmological constant\" are\nevaluated on the basis of the recent experimental data of the PLANCK Mission.\nThe resolution of the paradox is found for all exponential inflationary\npotentials and is consistent with the experimental data.

They are able to provide flexible, affordable and\nportable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods\nfor mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no\ninformation among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However,\ndata for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online\nlearning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides,\nwe find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and\nconnected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a\nnetwork cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method\nfor mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar\nusers to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned\npolicies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic\nRL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method\nin all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective\npolicies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm\nstart trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization\nof our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised\nlearning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we\npropose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the\nproposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related\ntasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that\nin a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 23:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 22:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}
