Given $\\mathsf{B}$ and\na so-called \"generator\" of $\\mathsf{A}$, this product is classically computed\nwith a cost ranging from $O(\\alpha^2 \\mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\\alpha^2\n\\mathscr{M}(n)\\log(n))$ arithmetic operations, depending on the type of\nstructure of $\\mathsf{A}$; here, $\\mathscr{M}$ is a cost function for\npolynomial multiplication. In this paper, we first generalize classical\ndisplacement operators, based on block diagonal matrices with companion\ndiagonal blocks, and then design fast algorithms to perform the task above for\nthis extended class of structured matrices. The cost of these algorithms ranges\nfrom $O(\\alpha^{\\omega-1} \\mathscr{M}(n))$ to $O(\\alpha^{\\omega-1}\n\\mathscr{M}(n)\\log(n))$, with $\\omega$ such that two $n \\times n$ matrices over\na field can be multiplied using $O(n^\\omega)$ field operations.

We propose experimentally\nfeasible protocols to probe localized edge states and dimerization of ultracold\nfermions. By confining cold-atoms in a ring lattice and changing the boundary\ncondition from periodic to open using an off-resonant laser sheet to cut open\nthe ring, topological edge states can be generated. A lattice in a topological\nconfiguration can trap a single particle released at the edge as the system\nevolves in time. Alternatively, depleting an initially filled lattice away from\nthe boundary reveals the occupied edge states. Signatures of dimerization in\nthe presence of contact interactions can be found in selected correlations as\nthe system boundary suddenly changes from periodic to open and exhibit memory\neffects of the initial state distinguishing different configurations or phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 16:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

To provide\na fair assessment of each transplant center, an effect that represents the\ncenter-specific care quality, along with patient level risk factors, is often\nincluded in the risk adjustment model. In the past, the center effects have\nbeen modeled as either fixed effects or Gaussian random effects, with various\npros and cons. Our numerical analyses reveal that the distributional\nassumptions do impact the prediction of center effects especially when the\neffect is extreme. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we propose\nto model the transplant center effect as a latent random variable with a finite\nGaussian mixture distribution. Such latent Gaussian mixture models provide a\nconvenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers.\nTo overcome the weak identifiability issues, we propose to estimate the latent\nGaussian mixture model using a penalized likelihood approach, and develop\nsequential locally restricted likelihood ratio tests to determine the number of\ncomponents in the Gaussian mixture distribution. The fitted mixture model\nprovides a convenient means of controlling the false discovery rate when\nscreening for underperforming or outperforming transplant centers.

We introduce a Quantum Computation Cut-and-Choose (QC-CC)\ntechnique which is a generalisation of the classical Cut-and-Choose in order to\nbuild quantum protocols secure against quantum covert adversaries. Such\nadversaries can deviate arbitrarily provided that their deviation is not\ndetected. As an application of the QC-CC we give a protocol for securely\nperforming two-party quantum computation with classical input/output. As basis\nwe use secure delegated quantum computing (Broadbent et al 2009), and in\nparticular the garbled quantum computation of (Kashefi et al 2016) that is\nsecure against only a weak specious adversaries, defined in (Dupuis et al\n2010). A unique property of these protocols is the separation between classical\nand quantum communications and the asymmetry between client and server, which\nenables us to sidestep the quantum rewinding issues. This opens the prospect of\nusing the QC-CC to other quantum protocols with this separation. In our proof\nof security we adapt and use (at different parts) two quantum rewinding\ntechniques, namely Watrous' oblivious q-rewinding (Watrous 2009) and Unruh's\nspecial q-rewinding (Unruh 2012).

Since the\nformation energy of a charged defect depends linearly on the Fermi level,\ndoping limits can be especially pronounced in wide bandgap semiconductors where\nthe Fermi level can vary substantially. Introduction of non-equilibrium carrier\nconcentrations during growth or processing alters the chemical potentials of\nband carriers and thus provides the possibility of modifying populations of\ncharged defects in ways impossible at thermal equilibrium. Herein we\ndemonstrate that, for an ergodic system with excess carriers, the rates of\ncarrier capture and emission involving a defect charge transition level\nrigorously determine the admixture of electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels\ndetermining the formation energy of non-zero charge states of that defect type.\nTo catalog the range of possible responses to excess carriers, we investigate\nthe behavior of a single donor-like defect as functions of extrinsic doping and\nenergy of the charge transition level. The technologically most important\nfinding is that excess carriers will increase the formation energy of\ncompensating defects for most values of the charge transition level in the\nbandgap. Thus, it may be possible to overcome limitations on doping imposed by\nnative defects. Cases also exist in wide bandgap semiconductors in which the\nconcentration of defects with the same charge polarity as the majority dopant\nis either left unchanged or actually increases. The causes of these various\nbehaviors are rationalized in terms of the capture and emission rates and\nguidelines for carrying out experimental tests of this model are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 17:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

Here we present an analysis of key aspects contributing to this\nrelation: angular momentum selection and evolution of Lagrangian mass elements\nas they accrete onto dark matter halos, condense into Milky Way-scale galaxies,\nand join the $z=0$ stellar phase. We contrast this evolution in the Illustris\nsimulation with that in a simulation without galactic winds, where the $z=0$\nangular momentum is $\\approx0.6$ dex lower. We find that winds induce\ndifferences between these simulations in several ways: increasing angular\nmomentum, preventing angular momentum loss, and causing $z=0$ stars to sample\nthe accretion-time angular momentum distribution of baryons in a biased way. In\nboth simulations, gas loses on average $\\approx0.4$ dex between accreting onto\nhalos and first accreting onto central galaxies. In Illustris, this is followed\nby $\\approx0.2$ dex gains in the `galactic wind fountain' and no further net\nevolution past the final accretion onto the galaxy. Without feedback, further\nlosses of $\\approx0.2$ dex occur in the gas phase inside the galaxies. An\nadditional $\\approx0.15$ dex difference arises from feedback preferentially\nselecting higher angular momentum gas at accretion by expelling gas that is\npoorly aligned.

Furthermore, we\nwant to explain this apparent tension between theory and observations. To do\nthis, we use the MoRIA suite of dwarf galaxy simulations to investigate whether\nobservational effects are involved in TBTF for late-type field dwarf galaxies.\nTo this end, we create synthetic radio data cubes of the simulated MoRIA\ngalaxies and analyse their HI kinematics as if they were real, observed\ngalaxies. We find that for low-mass galaxies, the circular velocity profile\ninferred from the HI kinematics often underestimates the true circular velocity\nprofile, as derived directly from the enclosed mass. Fitting the HI kinematics\nof MoRIA dwarfs with a theoretical halo profile results in a systematic\nunderestimate of the mass of their host halos. We attribute this effect to the\nfact that the interstellar medium of a low-mass late-type dwarf is continuously\nstirred by supernova explosions into a vertically puffed-up, turbulent state to\nthe extent that the rotation velocity of the gas is simply no longer a good\ntracer of the underlying gravitational force field.

It is shown that the dipolar interaction\nproduces a cascade of first- and second- order phase transitions between the\nparamagnetic and the spiral states upon temperature decreasing. Depending on\nsystem parameters, the following intermediate phases can arise: an\nincommensurate and a commensurate sinusoidally modulated states, spiral phases\nin which perpendicular spin components have different amplitudes and are\nmodulated with the same and with different wave vectors. We distinguish six\npossible sequences of phase transitions upon temperature decreasing at least\nfour of which were observed before experimentally in specific compounds. It is\nfound that the action of dipolar forces cannot always be modeled even\nqualitatively by small one-ion anisotropic spin interactions. We demonstrate\nthat the dipolar interaction is responsible for successive phase transitions in\nthe triangular-lattice multiferroic MnI$_2$: almost all available experimental\nfindings are described quantitatively within the mean-field theory by taking\ninto account the exchange, the dipolar and small symmetry-allowed anisotropic\nspin interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 19:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

To increase resolution, high numerical apertures (NA)\nare needed, but the associated large angular uncertainty results in a limited\nrange of depths that can be put in sharp focus. Plenoptic imaging was\nintroduced a few years ago to remedy this trade off. To this aim, plenoptic\nimaging reconstructs the path of light rays from the lens to the sensor.\nHowever, the improvement offered by standard plenoptic imaging is practical and\nnot fundamental: the increased DOF leads to a proportional reduction of the\nresolution well above the diffraction limit imposed by the lens NA. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that correlation measurements enable pushing plenoptic\nimaging to its fundamental limits of both resolution and DOF. Namely, we\ndemonstrate to maintain the imaging resolution at the diffraction limit while\nincreasing the depth of field by a factor of 7.

Typically, such\nmarkers are used to aid daily patient positioning and to verify the target's\nposition during treatment. This work introduces a novel, automated method for\nidentifying fiducial markers in planar x-ray imaging.\n  Methods: In brief, the method consists of automated filtration and\nreconstruction steps that generate 3D templates of marker positions. The\nnormalized cross-correlation was the used to identify fiducial markers in\nprojection images. To quantify the accuracy of the technique, a phantom study\nwas performed. 75 pre-treatment CBCT scans of 15 pancreatic cancer patients\nwere analyzed to test the automated technique under real life conditions,\nincluding several challenging scenarios for tracking fiducial markers.\n  Results: In phantom and patient studies, the method automatically tracked\nvisible marker clusters in 100% of projection images. For scans in which a\nphantom exhibited 0D, 1D, and 3D motion, the automated technique showed median\nerrors of 39 $\\mu$m, 53 $\\mu$m, and 93 $\\mu$m, respectively. Human precision\nwas worse in comparison. Automated tracking was performed accurately despite\nthe presence of other metallic objects. Additionally, transient differences in\nthe cross-correlation score identified instances where markers disappeared from\nview.\n  Conclusions: A novel, automated method for producing dynamic templates of\nfiducial marker clusters has been developed. Production of these templates\nautomatically provides measurements of tumor motion that occurred during the\nCBCT scan that was used to produce them. Additionally, using these templates\nwith intra-fractional images could potentially allow for more robust real-time\ntarget tracking in radiotherapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 23:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

The\nconjecture is: Starting from any odd positive integer and repeating R(x) we\neventually get to 1.\n  In a previous paper of the author the set of odd positive integers x such\nthat R^k(x) = 1 has been characterized as the set of odd integers whose binary\nrepresentation belongs to a set of strings G_k. Each string in G_k is the\nconcatenation of k strings z_k z_{k-1} ... z_1 where each z_i is a finite and\ncontiguous extract from some power of a string s_i of length 2x3^{i-1} (the\nseed of order i).

A new modular robot can be built for a\nspecific task by using modules as building blocks. However, constructing a\nkinematic model for a newly conceived robot requires significant work. Due to\nthe finite size of module-types, models of all module-types can be built\nindividually and stored in a database beforehand. With this priori knowledge,\nthe model construction process can be automated by detecting the modules and\ntheir corresponding interconnections. Previous literature proposed theoretical\nframeworks for constructing kinematic models of modular robots, assuming that\nsuch information was known a priori. While well-devised mechanisms and built-in\nsensors can be employed to detect these parameters automatically, they\nsignificantly complicate the module design and thus are expensive. In this\npaper, we propose a vision-based method to identify kinematic chains and\nautomatically construct robot models for modular robots. Each module is affixed\nwith augmented reality (AR) tags that are encoded with unique IDs. An image of\na modular robot is taken and the detected modules are recognized by querying a\ndatabase that maintains all module information. The poses of detected modules\nare used to compute: (i) the connection between modules and (ii) joint angles\nof joint-modules. Finally, the robot serial-link chain is identified and the\nkinematic model constructed and visualized. Our experimental results validate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. While implementation with only our RMR is\nshown, our method can be applied to other RMRs where self-identification is not\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2017 10:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

With the help of quantum channel theory, we\ninvestigate the general model of \"quantum-Zeno-like\" IFM, whose optics setup is\na Mach-Zehnder like interferometer utilizing the quantum Zeno effect, where the\nobject to be detected is semitransparent and the interrogation cycle number $N$\nis finite. And we define two important probabilities $P_{\\rm loss}$ and $P_{\\rm\nerror}$ to evaluate the IFM process, which describe the photon loss rate and\nthe error of discriminating the presenece/absence of the object respectively.\nThe minimum values of these two probabilities and the corresponding initial\ninput states to reach them are attained via this model. And we find that when\nthe interrogation cycle $N$ approaches infinity, the object can be perfectly\ndetected, where the minimum values of these two probabilities are both zero and\nthe initial input state to reach them becomes the same state $|1\\rangle$ in our\nsystem. In addition, we also study whether quantum correlation can benefit IFM\nor not, but the answer is no, in the sense that the entangled photon input\nstate cannot minimize $P_{\\rm loss}$, $P_{\\rm error}$ more than single photon\ninput state.

Therefore, two decoupled SISO systems are obtained which\nare defined as Augmented Sequence Impedance Networks (ASIN).
