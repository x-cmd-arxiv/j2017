We propose three\nmetrics: (i) the fairness of a user that quantifies how trustworthy the user is\nin rating the products, (ii) the reliability of a rating that measures how\nreliable the rating is, and (iii) the goodness of a product that measures the\nquality of the product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable\nratings that are close to the goodness of the product. We formulate a mutually\nrecursive definition of these metrics, and further address cold start problems\nand incorporate behavioral properties of users and products in the formulation.\nWe propose an iterative algorithm, FairJudge, to predict the values of the\nthree metrics. We prove that FairJudge is guaranteed to converge in a bounded\nnumber of iterations, with linear time complexity. By conducting five different\nexperiments on five rating platforms, we show that FairJudge significantly\noutperforms nine existing algorithms in predicting fair and unfair users.

This shifts the\nattention back to applicable resource allocation (RA), which need to be\napplicable for very short radio frames, large and dense sets of radio heads,\nand large user populations in the coordination area. So far, mainly CSI-based\nRA schemes have been proposed for this task. However, they have considerable\ncomplexity and also incur a significant CSI acquisition overhead on the system.\nIn this paper, we study an alternative approach which promises lower complexity\nwith also a lower overhead. We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN\nsystems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random\nForests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user\nRAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position\ninformation requires less radio resources in comparison to the acquisition of\ninstantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general,\nlearning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to\nCSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account,\nlearning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy\nCSI-based scheme by up to 100%; III) Despite their dependency on the training\ndata, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies\nand changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor\ninfluencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna\norientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the\noriginal performance results.

These make it very challenging to develop a convolutional network\n(CNN)-based image compression system. In this paper, motivated by that the\nlocal information content is spatially variant in an image, we suggest that the\nbit rate of the different parts of the image should be adapted to local\ncontent. And the content aware bit rate is allocated under the guidance of a\ncontent-weighted importance map. Thus, the sum of the importance map can serve\nas a continuous alternative of discrete entropy estimation to control\ncompression rate. And binarizer is adopted to quantize the output of encoder\ndue to the binarization scheme is also directly defined by the importance map.\nFurthermore, a proxy function is introduced for binary operation in backward\npropagation to make it differentiable. Therefore, the encoder, decoder,\nbinarizer and importance map can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner\nby using a subset of the ImageNet database.

From the magnetic field generated by the three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations, we compute and analyse the evolution of the\nmagnetic flux, of the magnetic energy and its decomposition into potential and\nfree energies, and of the relative magnetic helicity and its decomposition.\nUnlike the magnetic flux and magnetic energies, magnetic helicities are able to\nmarkedly distinguish the eruptive from the non-eruptive simulations. We find\nthat the ratio of the magnetic helicity of the current-carrying magnetic field\nto the total relative helicity presents the highest values for the eruptive\nsimulations, in the pre-eruptive phase only. We observe that the eruptive\nsimulations do not possess the highest value of total magnetic helicity. In the\nframework of our numerical study, the magnetic energies and the total relative\nhelicity do not correspond to good eruptivity proxies.

The hash calculation allows extremely fast\npacket forwarding and provides flow `stickiness', meaning that all packets\nbelonging to the same flow get dispatched to the same server. Unfortunately,\nsuch static hashing may not yield an optimal degree of load balancing, e.g.,\ndue to variations in server processing speeds or traffic patterns. On the other\nhand, dynamic schemes, such as the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) scheme,\nprovide a natural way to mitigate load imbalances, but at the expense of\nstickiness violation.\n  In the present paper we examine the fundamental trade-off between stickiness\nviolation and packet-level latency performance in large-scale data centers.

Moreover, relaxing the stickiness\nrequirement by a minuscule amount is highly effective in clipping the tail of\nthe latency distribution.

Our\ndecoder takes as input a code vector with exactly defined semantic meaning that\nencodes detailed face pose, shape, expression, skin reflectance and scene\nillumination. Due to this new way of combining CNN-based with model-based face\nreconstruction, the CNN-based encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful\nparameters from a single monocular input image. For the first time, a CNN\nencoder and an expert-designed generative model can be trained end-to-end in an\nunsupervised manner, which renders training on very large (unlabeled) real\nworld data feasible. The obtained reconstructions compare favorably to current\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and richness of representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 17:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 20:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Due to the\ndynamic scaling law of the phase ordering kinetics, the domain-area\ndistribution is described by a universal function of the domain area, rescaled\nby the mean distance between domain walls. The scaling theory for general\ncoarsening dynamics in two dimensions hypothesizes that the distribution during\nthe coarsening dynamics has a hierarchy with the two scaling regimes, the\nmicroscopic and macroscopic regimes with distinct power-law exponents. The\npower law in the macroscopic regime, where the domain size is larger than the\nmean distance, is universally represented with the Fisher's exponent of the\npercolation theory in two dimensions. On the other hand, the power-law exponent\nin the microscopic regime is sensitive to the microscopic dynamics of the\nsystem. This conjecture is confirmed by large-scale numerical simulations of\nthe coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equation for binary condensates. In the numerical\nexperiments of the superfluid system, the exponent in the microscopic regime\nanomalously reaches to its theoretical upper limit of the general scaling\ntheory. The anomaly comes from the quantum-fluid effect in the presence of\ncircular vortex sheets, described by the hydrodynamic approximation neglecting\nthe fluid compressibility. It is also found that the distribution of superfluid\ncirculation along vortex sheets obeys a dynamic scaling law with different\npower-law exponents in the two regimes.

The ring\ncurrent state depends on its past conditions therefore, it is necessary to\nconsider its history for prediction. To account this effect Nonlinear\nAutoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (NARX) is implemented. This\nnetwork considers input history of 30 minutes and output feedback of 120\nminutes. Solar wind parameters mainly velocity, density and interplanetary\nmagnetic field are used as inputs. SYMH and ASYH indices during geomagnetic\nstorms of 1998-2013, having minimum SYMH <-85 nT are used as the target for\ntraining two independent networks.

Therefore, the developed networks can predict SYMH and ASYH\nindices about an hour before, provided, real-time upstream solar wind data is\navailable.

The Gaia\nmission, launched at the end of 2013, is expected to detect of the order of few\nmillion EBs over a 5-year mission.\n  We present an automated procedure to characterize EBs based on the geometric\nmorphology of their LCs with two aims: first to study an ensemble of EBs on a\nstatistical ground without the need to model the binary system, and second to\nenable the automated identification of EBs that display atypical LCs. We model\nthe folded LC geometry of EBs using up to two Gaussian functions for the\neclipses and a cosine function for any ellipsoidal-like variability that may be\npresent between the eclipses. The procedure is applied to the OGLE-III data set\nof EBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as a proof of concept. The bayesian\ninformation criterion is used to select the best model among models containing\nvarious combinations of those components, as well as to estimate the\nsignificance of the components.\n  Based on the two-Gaussian models, EBs with atypical LC geometries are\nsuccessfully identified in two diagrams, using the Abbe values of the original\nand residual folded LCs, and the reduced $\\chi^2$. Cleaning the data set from\nthe atypical cases and further filtering out LCs that contain non-significant\neclipse candidates, the ensemble of EBs can be studied on a statistical ground\nusing the two-Gaussian model parameters. For illustration purposes, we present\nthe distribution of projected eccentricities as a function of orbital period\nfor the OGLE-III set of EBs in the LMC, as well as the distribution of their\nprimary versus secondary eclipse widths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 17:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

These models\nrequire expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded\nas hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model\nto select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general\n3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical\ninteractions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application\nto structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural\nnetwork is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of\na protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with\nthe complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding\npose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the\nprotein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the\ninteraction strength associated with these features.

Designed to\nstudy the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key\npart of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017).

The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters\nagrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up\nto 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at\nstellar masses Mstar > 10^10 M_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively\nconsistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function\nmatches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are\nfewer low-mass (Mstar < 10^10 M_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of\nclusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching.\nConversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in\nclusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (>\n5r_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of\n(sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to ~0.3 dex even well beyond\nr_200c.

It is believed that the clumps form because of gravitational\ninstability. However, a necessary condition for gravitational instability to\ndevelop is that the disc must dissipate its kinetic energy effectively, this\nenergy dissipation (also called cooling) is not well-understood. We propose\nthat collisions (coagulation) between molecular clouds dissipate the kinetic\nenergy of the discs, which leads to a dynamical cooling. The effectiveness of\nthis dynamical cooling is quantified by the dissipation parameter $D$, which is\nthe ratio between the free-fall time $t_{\\rm ff}\\approx 1/ \\sqrt{G \\rho_{\\rm\ndisc}}$ and the cooling time determined by the cloud collision process $t_{\\rm\ncool}$.

An analysis\nbased on the spectral properties of the kernel demonstrates that only a\nvanishingly small portion of the function space is reachable after a polynomial\nnumber of gradient descent iterations. This lack of approximating power\ndrastically limits gradient descent for a fixed computational budget leading to\nserious over-regularization/underfitting. The issue is purely algorithmic,\npersisting even in the limit of infinite data.\n  To address this shortcoming in practice, we introduce EigenPro iteration,\nbased on a preconditioning scheme using a small number of approximately\ncomputed eigenvectors. It can also be viewed as learning a new kernel optimized\nfor gradient descent. It turns out that injecting this small (computationally\ninexpensive and SGD-compatible) amount of approximate second-order information\nleads to major improvements in convergence. For large data, this translates\ninto significant performance boost over the standard kernel methods. In\nparticular, we are able to consistently match or improve the state-of-the-art\nresults recently reported in the literature with a small fraction of their\ncomputational budget.\n  Finally, we feel that these results show a need for a broader computational\nperspective on modern large-scale learning to complement more traditional\nstatistical and convergence analyses. In particular, many phenomena of\nlarge-scale high-dimensional inference are best understood in terms of\noptimization on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where standard algorithms\ncan sometimes have properties at odds with finite-dimensional intuition.

A\nunique feature of this experiment is that the bidders in this market are real\nestate agents that bid on their own behalf, not using third-party\nintermediaries. To help bidders, Zillow also provided a recommendation tool\nthat suggested a bid for each bidder.\n  Our main focus in this paper is on the decisions of bidders whether or not to\nadopt the platform-provided bid recommendation.

Using the bid history of\nthe agents we infer their value, and compare the agents' regret with their\nactual bidding history with results they would have obtained following the\nrecommendation. We find that for half of the agents not following the\nrecommendation, the increased effort of experimenting with alternate bids\nresults in increased regret, i.e., they get decreased net value out of the\nsystem.

Second, we demonstrate that specific code\nanalyses are necessary to analyze and refactor UI code, because of its coupling\nwith the rest of the code.

We develop a static code analysis for\ndetecting UI commands in the code. We identify a new type of design smell,\ncalled Blob Listener that characterizes UI listeners that can produce more than\ntwo UI commands.

Such budget\nfeasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in\nrecruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her.\n  This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in\n2010.

This paper compares this new V1 data\nwith data from the earth-orbiting PAMELA experiment up to energies greater than\n10 GeV where solar modulation effects are negligible. In this energy regime we\nassume the main parameters governing electron propagation are diffusion and\nenergy loss and we use a Monte Carlo program to describe this propagation in\nthe galaxy. To reproduce the new Voyager electron spectrum, which is E-1.3,\ntogether with that measured by PAMELA which is E-3.20 above 10 GeV, we require\na diffusion coefficient which is P 0.45 at energies above 0.5 GeV changing to a\nP-1.00 dependence at lower rigidities. The entire electron spectrum observed at\nboth V1 and PAMELA from 3 MeV to 30 GeV can then be described by a simple\nsource spectrum, dj/dP P-2.25, with a spectral exponent that is independent of\nrigidity. The change in exponent of the measured electron spectrum from -1.3 at\nlow energies to 3.2 at the highest energies can be explained by galactic\npropagation effects related to the changing dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient below 0.5 GeV, and the increasing importance above 0.5 GV of energy\nloss from synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, which are both E2, and\nwhich are responsible for most of the changing spectral exponent above 1.0 GV.\n  As a result of the P-1.00 dependence of the diffusion coefficient below 0.5\nGV that is required to fit the V1 electron spectrum, there is a rapid flow of\nthese low energy electrons out of the galaxy. These electrons in local IG space\nare unobservable to us at any wave length and therefore form a dark energy\ncomponent which is 100 times the electrons rest energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 21:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

It is anticipated that the owners of 5G-enabled\nsmartphones use their devices more extensively to talk, text, email, and surf\nthe Web more often than do customers with 4G smartphones or traditional\nhandsets, which puts a significantly higher demand on the battery life.\nSmartphones are currently equipped with multiple radio interfaces that enable\nthem to access different types of wireless networks including LTE-direct and\nWi-Fi-direct, besides cellular networks. Such a capability is not well explored\nwithin the context of DCS. This article proposes a new scheme to support the\nemerging features in DCS where a D2D-enabled mobile device (sink device or a\nfile/content requester) aggregates the radio resources of multiple mobile\ndevices (source devices or file/content providers) via its multiple radio\ninterfaces such that the scheme is referred to as devices-to-device (Ds2D)\ncommunications. Ds2D communication scheme ensures an optimal packet split among\nthe source mobile devices to improve the file/content transfer latency (FTL),\nenergy efficiency, and battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed optimal packet split scheme among multiple source devices\nparticipating in Ds2D communication scheme guarantees an improvement in mobile\nbattery life over wide range of data rate levels in comparison with the random\npacket split strategy and traditional D2D communication paradigm between the\nsink and source mobile devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 00:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

To deploy many\nantennas in reasonable form factors, base stations are expected to employ\nantenna arrays in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, which is known as\nfull-dimension (FD) MIMO. The most popular two-dimensional array is the uniform\nplanar array (UPA), where antennas are placed in a grid pattern. To exploit the\nfull benefit of massive MIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD), the\ndownlink channel state information (CSI) should be estimated, quantized, and\nfed back from the receiver to the transmitter. However, it is difficult to\naccurately quantize the channel in a computationally efficient manner due to\nthe high dimensionality of the massive MIMO channel. In this paper, we develop\nboth narrowband and wideband CSI quantizers for FD-MIMO taking the properties\nof realistic channels and the UPA into consideration. To improve quantization\nquality, we focus on not only quantizing dominant radio paths in the channel,\nbut also combining the quantized beams.

The large negative MR in Weyl semimetals is peculiar in that it is\nunrelated to magnetism and comes from chiral anomaly.

The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict\nelectricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for\nmarket participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very\nscarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is\nmandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by\nintroducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly\nresolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of\nfuture events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to\ndetect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we\ndecided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria.\nOur model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve\nfor electricity day-ahead auctions.

This work simulates an intraoperative setting for breast cancer\nlumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art\nmethods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method\nbased on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small\ndatabase is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control\nover the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of\noverfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are\npublicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in\nthe literature for a conservative comparison.

These data accessors are collectively known as optics;\nthey are fundamental to programs that manipulate complex data. INQUIRY:\nIndividual data accessors for simple data structures are easy to write, for\nexample as pairs of \"getter\" and \"setter\" methods. However, it is not obvious\nhow to combine data accessors, in such a way that data accessors for a compound\ndata structure are composed out of smaller data accessors for the parts of that\nstructure. Generally, one has to write a sequence of statements or declarations\nthat navigate step by step through the data structure, accessing one level at a\ntime - which is to say, data accessors are traditionally not first-class\ncitizens, combinable in their own right. APPROACH: We present a framework for\nmodular data access, in which individual data accessors for simple data\nstructures may be freely combined to obtain more complex data accessors for\ncompound data structures. Data accessors become first-class citizens. The\nframework is based around the notion of profunctors, a flexible generalization\nof functions.

We use Haskell as a vehicle\nin which to present our constructions, but languages such as Java, C#, or Scala\nthat provide the necessary features should work just as well.

It involves the implementation and\nimmediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also\naspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to\nmodern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support.\nConsequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we\naddress is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of\nDSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of\ngeneral-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both\ndomain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect\ndevelopment tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools\nlike language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving\nnor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g.,\nAwesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation\napproaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in\nthe presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of\nannotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a\nsemantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools.\nOur transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to\nimplement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with\nthose DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both\nDSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing\nDSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of\nusing a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective\ncompared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our\napproach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then\nimplemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented\nCool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be\naccommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two\nopen source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process\napplication-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost\nof developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of\nprogramming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern\nreal-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right\ntool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus\nfacilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 11:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

While reactive\nprogramming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive\nconcepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard\nbut inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change\ndetection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the\nparticular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to\nre-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is\nstill missing. To find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in\nexisting reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts,\nstate-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common\nchange detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an\nexpression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism,\nwe propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the\ntedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease\nthe implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of\nactive expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive\nconcepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness\nof active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential\nfrom non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By\nusing active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of\nreactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of\nhow application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we\nwould like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive\nprogramming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 11:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

They allow EDSL authors to\ndefine domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language\nsyntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined\nsyntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A\nuser-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be\nregarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of\nuser-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The\ncompiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the\noperator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities\nby using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to\nimplement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is\nassociation between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is\nwhether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new\ncustom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined\noperators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java\nbut it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing\ncustom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a\nvariable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an\nenvironment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of\ninstance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the\nhost type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our\nsystem, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.\nThis enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static\nname binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a\nsystem for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an\nobject-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed\nsystem by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the\ncompilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out\nsemantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running,\nis needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid\nASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a\nprogramming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a\nparsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss\nits time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have\nconducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also\nshow several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express\nvarious language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any\nkind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers\nshould be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the\nhost language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their\nown syntax and name binding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 11:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

Such immediacy\nmay conflict with the desire to perform a combined set of intermediate steps,\nsuch as a refactoring, without immediately taking effect after each individual\nedit. This becomes important when an incomplete sequence of small-scale changes\ncan easily break the running program.

Many languages\nprovide a MOP that to some degree supports reflection. However, MOPs are\ntypically language-specific, their reflective functionality is often\nrestricted, and the adaptation and application logic are often mixed which\nhardens the understanding and maintenance of the source code.

The cellular\nmicroenvironment triggers the switch between both modes, thereby allowing\nadaptation to dynamic conditions. It is, however, unclear if this\namoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity contributes to a more effective tumor\ninvasion. We address this question with a mathematical model, where the\namoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity is regulated in response to local\nextracellular matrix resistance. Our numerical analysis reveals that\nextracellular matrix structure and presence of a chemotactic gradient are key\ndeterminants of the model behavior. Only in complex microenvironments, if the\nextracellular matrix is highly heterogeneous and a chemotactic gradient directs\nmigration, the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity allows a more\nwidespread invasion compared to the non-switching amoeboid and mesenchymal\nmodes. Importantly, these specific conditions are characteristic for in vivo\ntumor invasion.

In particular, applied economists are often\ninterested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher\neffects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction\nmodels with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that\ncombine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization\nparameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the\nperformance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge,\nlasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many\nparameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i)\nthe choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven\nselection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the\nrisk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative\nperformance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To\naddress (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters,\nbased on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield\nestimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal\n(unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent\nexamples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical\napplicability of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

A great variety of models have been developed for\nthis task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for\nprediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies;\nsome tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points\nwithin a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single\nprediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of\nensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest\nas a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the\nsimplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most\ncomplex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the\nseason when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty,\nand recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to\npredict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States,\nboth at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We\ntrained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 -\n2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in\nthe five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods\nshowed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component\nmodels, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the\ncomponent models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable\npredictions to public health decision makers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

A fundamental issue is the effect of network structure on\nthe stability of the patterns. We address this issue by using the setting where\nrandom links are systematically added to a regular lattice and focusing on the\ndynamical evolution of spiral wave patterns. As the network structure deviates\nmore from the regular topology (so that it becomes increasingly more complex),\nthe original stable spiral wave pattern can disappear and a different type of\npattern can emerge. Our main findings are the following. (1) Short-distance\nlinks added to a small region containing the spiral tip can have a more\nsignificant effect on the wave pattern than long-distance connections. (2) As\nmore random links are introduced into the network, distinct pattern transitions\ncan occur, which include the transition of spiral wave to global\nsynchronization, to a chimera-like state, and then to a pinned spiral wave. (3)\nAround the transitions the network dynamics is highly sensitive to small\nvariations in the network structure in the sense that the addition of even a\nsingle link can change the pattern from one type to another. These findings\nprovide insights into the pattern dynamics in complex networks, a problem that\nis relevant to many physical, chemical, and biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-03"}

It was originally proposed to explain\nthe robust and near-perfect adaptation of {\\it E. coli} observed across a wide\nrange of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. A\nreceptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the\ntwo states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates\nactive ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of\nmethylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation\nsites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the\nclassical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and\nKoshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system\nreduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous\nfluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise\napproximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a\nweak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor\nconcentrations.

Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show\nZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The\nmagnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is\nconsistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling\npathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on\nthe motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small\ntime-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within\nlinear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Here we show that disability data from census\nrecords can also be used as a reliable substitute for mortality rates. In fact\nexcess-disability and excess-mortality go hand in hand. Moreover, as there are\nabout ten times more cases of disability than deaths, the disability variable\nis able to offer more accurate measurements in all cases where the number of\ndeaths is small. This allows a more accurate investigation of the young widower\neffect; it confirms that, as already suspected from death rate data, there is a\nhuge spike between the ages of 20 and 30. By using disability rates we can also\nstudy additional features not accessible using death rate data. For example we\ncan examine the health impact of a change in living place.

Thus, any ANN\nemploying Noisy Softplus neurons, even of deep architecture, can be trained\nsimply by the traditional algorithm, for example Back Propagation (BP), and the\ntrained weights can be directly used in the spiking version of the same network\nwithout any conversion. Furthermore, the training method can be generalised to\nother activation units, for instance Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), to train\ndeep SNNs off-line. This research is crucial to provide an effective approach\nfor SNN training, and to increase the classification accuracy of SNNs with\nbiological characteristics and to close the gap between the performance of SNNs\nand ANNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 11:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}
