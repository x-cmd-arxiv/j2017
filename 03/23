While standard\nnode-link diagrams are helpful in judging connectivity, they do not scale to\nlarge networks. Adjacency matrices also do not scale to large networks and are\nonly suitable to judge connectivity of adjacent nodes. A key approach to\nrealize scalable graph visualization are queries: instead of displaying the\nwhole network, only a relevant subset is shown.

For example, analysis of high-dimensional\nmicrobiome data from designed experiments remains an open area in microbiome\nresearch. Contemporary analyses work on metrics that summarize collective\nproperties of the microbiome, but such reductions preclude inference on the\nfine-scale effects of environmental stimuli on individual microbial taxa. Other\napproaches model the proportions or counts of individual taxa as response\nvariables in mixed models, but these methods fail to account for complex\ncorrelation patterns among microbial communities.

In this paper, we compare several Higgs sectors\nfeaturing 3 CP-even neutral Higgs bosons that are also motivated by their\nsimplicity and their capability to solve some of the flaws of the SM.

This allows us to compare the effects of singlet and pseudoscalar\nadmixtures.

The new class of $s$-concave\ndistributions is a broad and natural generalization of log-concavity, and\nincludes many important additional distributions, e.g., the Pareto distribution\nand $t$-distribution. This class has been studied in the context of efficient\nsampling, integration, and optimization, but much remains unknown about the\ngeometry of this class of distributions and their applications in the context\nof learning. The challenge is that unlike the commonly used distributions in\nlearning (uniform or more generally log-concave distributions), this broader\nclass is not closed under the marginalization operator and many such\ndistributions are fat-tailed. In this work, we introduce new convex geometry\ntools to study the properties of $s$-concave distributions and use these\nproperties to provide bounds on quantities of interest to learning including\nthe probability of disagreement between two halfspaces, disagreement outside a\nband, and the disagreement coefficient. We use these results to significantly\ngeneralize prior results for margin-based active learning, disagreement-based\nactive learning, and passive learning of intersections of halfspaces.

Here, we investigate LHC\nsignals in a different region of parameter space for the same model, where\nproduction of singlet neutrinos can occur from particles beyond those in usual\nLR models. Specifically, we assume that composite $(B - L)$ gauge boson is\nlighter than all the others in the EW sector. We show that the composite $(B -\nL)$ gauge boson can acquire a significant coupling to light quarks simply via\nmixing with elementary hypercharge gauge boson. Thus, the singlet neutrino can\nbe pair-produced via decays of $(B - L)$ gauge boson, without a charged current\ncounterpart. Furthermore, there is no decay for $(B - L)$ gauge boson directly\ninto dibosons, unlike for the usual case of $W_R^{ \\pm }$ and $Z^{ \\prime }$.\nIndependently of the above extension of the EW sector, we analyze production of\nsinglet neutrinos in decays of composite partners of $SU(2)_L$ doublet leptons,\nwhich are absent in the usual LR models.

The transient was previously claimed to be a Type\nIIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve\nshows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to\nthe archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100\ndays followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm\nshowed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$\nK, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit\nmulti-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little\nevolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being\ndistinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the\nX-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of\nits host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity\nassociated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any\nknown form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which\nthe accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and\nexcitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that\nobscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk. A\ndetailed TDE model fit to the light curve indicates that PS16dtm will remain\nbright for several years; we further predict that the X-ray emission will\nreappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Finally, we\nplace PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs and find that TDEs in AGN galaxies\nare an order of magnitude more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities,\nlikely due to interaction of the stellar debris with the pre-existing accretion\ndisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 18:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The\npurpose of our study is to explore how and to what extent this can be done.\nSpecifically, we extend many earlier calculations of the $n=0$ mode and\nnumerically determine scaling relations for the maximum elongation as a\nfunction of dimensionless parameters describing (1) the plasma profile\n($\\beta_p$ and $l_i$), (2) the plasma shape ($\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$), (3) the\nwall radius ($b/a$) and (4) most importantly the feedback system capability\nparameter $\\gamma\\tau_w$.

Emission from the CO ladder traces cold gas, and [CII] fine\nstructure emission at 158 um traces the SFR. Intensity mapping surveys the\ncumulative surface brightness of emitting lines as a function of redshift,\nrather than individual galaxies. CMB spectral distortion instruments are\nsensitive to both the mean and anisotropy of the intensity of redshifted CO and\n[CII] emission. Large-scale anisotropy is proportional to the product of the\nmean surface brightness and the line luminosity-weighted bias. The bias\nprovides a connection between galaxy evolution and its cosmological context,\nand is a unique asset of intensity mapping. Cross-correlation with galaxy\nredshift surveys allows unambiguous measurements of redshifted line brightness\ndespite residual continuum contamination and interlopers. Measurement of line\nbrightness through cross-correlation also evades cosmic variance and suggests\nnew observation strategies. Galactic foreground emission is $\\sim 10^3$ times\nlarger than the expected signals, and this places stringent requirements on\ninstrument calibration and stability. Under a range of assumptions, a linear\ncombination of bands cleans continuum contamination sufficiently that residuals\nproduce a modest penalty over the instrumental noise.

Current systems often assume the availability of\nmultiple facial images (sometimes from the same subject) as input, and must\naddress a number of methodological challenges such as establishing dense\ncorrespondences across large facial poses, expressions, and non-uniform\nillumination. In general these methods require complex and inefficient\npipelines for model building and fitting. In this work, we propose to address\nmany of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on\nan appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans.\nOur CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accurate\nalignment nor establishes dense correspondence between images, works for\narbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the\nwhole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face)\nbypassing the construction (during training) and fitting (during testing) of a\n3D Morphable Model. We achieve this via a simple CNN architecture that performs\ndirect regression of a volumetric representation of the 3D facial geometry from\na single 2D image. We also demonstrate how the related task of facial landmark\nlocalization can be incorporated into the proposed framework and help improve\nreconstruction quality, especially for the cases of large poses and facial\nexpressions.

Close to the membrane, water acquires high IRO and changes its\ndynamical properties, e.g., slowing down its translational and rotational\ndegrees of freedom in a region that extends over $\\simeq 1$ nm from the\nmembrane interface. Surprisingly, we show that at a distance as far as $\\simeq\n2.5$ nm from the interface, although the bulk-like dynamics is recovered,\nwater's IRO is still slightly higher than in bulk at the same thermodynamic\nconditions.

In\nSzekely and Rizzo(2004), a nonparametric test for equality of two multivariate\ndistributions was given, based on the Euclidean distance between observations.\nThis test was shown to be effective for high dimensional multivariate data, and\nwas implemented by an appropriate distribution free permutation test.

Agglomeration of the nanorods deteriorates the\nperformance of components based on nanorod arrays. A comprehensive body of\nliterature deals with mechanical failure mechanisms of nanorods and design\ncriteria for mechanically stable nanorod arrays. However, the structural\nintegrity of nanorod arrays is commonly evaluated only visually and\nqualitatively. We use real-space analysis of microscopic images to quantify the\nfraction of condensed nanorods in nanorod arrays. We suggest the number of\narray elements apparent in the micrographs divided by the number of array\nelements a defect-free array would contain in the same area, referred to as\nintegrity fraction, as a measure of structural array integrity. Reproducible\nprocedures to determine the imaged number of array elements are introduced.\nThus, quantitative comparisons of different nanorod arrays, or of one nanorod\narray at different stages of its use, are possible. Structural integrities of\nidentical nanorod arrays differing only in the length of the nanorods are\nexemplarily analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 21:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-24"}

For example, this is true for\noutput-sensitive similarity search/join, and for indexes supporting annulus\nqueries that aim to report a point close to a certain given distance from the\nquery point.\n  In this paper we initiate the study of distance-sensitive hashing (DSH), a\ngeneralization of LSH that seeks a family of hash functions such that the\nprobability of two points having the same hash value is a given function of the\ndistance between them. More precisely, given a distance space $(X,\n\\text{dist})$ and a \"collision probability function\" (CPF) $f\\colon\n\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow [0,1]$ we seek a distribution over pairs of functions\n$(h,g)$ such that for every pair of points $x, y \\in X$ the collision\nprobability is $\\Pr[h(x)=g(y)] = f(\\text{dist}(x,y))$. Locality-sensitive\nhashing is the study of how fast a CPF can decrease as the distance grows. For\nmany spaces, $f$ can be made exponentially decreasing even if we restrict\nattention to the symmetric case where $g=h$. We show that the asymmetry\nachieved by having a pair of functions makes it possible to achieve CPFs that\nare, for example, increasing or unimodal, and show how this leads to principled\nsolutions to problems not addressed by the LSH framework. This includes a novel\napplication to privacy-preserving distance estimation.

Since handheld AR devices\nare commonly equipped with video see-through capabilities, AR magic lens\napplications often suffer from spatial distortions, because the AR environment\nis presented from the perspective of the camera of the mobile device. Recent\napproaches counteract this distortion based on estimations of the user's head\nposition, rendering the scene from the user's perspective.

We find that e-ph scattering is\nsignificantly faster for holes compared to electrons, and that for hot carriers\nwith an initial 0.5$-$1 eV excess energy, holes take a significantly shorter\ntime ($\\sim$0.1 ps) to relax to the band edge compared to electrons, which take\n$\\sim$1 ps. The asymmetry in the hot carrier dynamics is shown to originate\nfrom the valence band degeneracy, the heavier effective mass of holes compared\nto electrons, and the details of the coupling to different phonon modes in the\nvalence and conduction bands. We show that the slow cooling of hot electrons\nand their long ballistic mean free paths (over 3 nm) are a possible cause of\nefficiency droop in GaN light emitting diodes. Taken together, our work sheds\nlight on the ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers in GaN and the nanoscale origin\nof efficiency droop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 23:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 19:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In robust component analysis, leading methods\nderive from Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), which recovers a low-rank matrix\nfrom sparse corruptions of unknown magnitude and support.

Specifically, we place two metronomes on each layer, and couple two\nlayers by placing one on top of the other. By varying the initial conditions of\nthe metronomes and adjusting the friction between the two layers, a variety of\nsynchronous patterns are observed in experiment, including the splay\nsynchronization (SS) state, the generalized splay synchronization (GSS) state ,\nthe anti-phase synchronization (APS) state, the in-phase delay synchronization\n(IPDS) state, and the in-phase synchronization (IPS) state. In particular, the\nIPDS state, in which the metronomes on each layer are synchronized in phase but\nare of a constant phase delay to metronomes on the other layer, is observed for\nthe first time.

The key technique is to transform the original network into\ntwo different MASs, defined by reconstruction and reverse reconstruction, with\nan important aspect that the dynamics of the original network for free species\nis equivalent to that of the reverse reconstruction.

Contrary to the existing\nliterature on the subject, the adopted strategy of this paper is to tackle\ncensoring at the very level of the loss function usually employed for the\ncomputation of quantiles, the so-called \"check\" function. For interpretation\npurposes, a simple comparison with the latter reveals how censoring is\naccounted for in the newly proposed loss function. Subsequently, when\nconsidering the inclusion of covariates for conditional quantile estimation, by\ndefining a new general loss function, the proposed methodology opens the gate\nto numerous parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric modelling techniques.\nIn order to illustrate this statement, we consider the well-studied linear\nregression under the usual assumption of conditional independence between the\ntrue response and the censoring variable. For practical minimization of the\nstudied loss function, we also provide a simple algorithmic procedure shown to\nyield satisfactory results for the proposed estimator with respect to the\nexisting literature in an extensive simulation study. From a more theoretical\nprospect, consistency of the estimator for linear regression is obtained using\nvery recent results on non-smooth semiparametric estimation equations with an\ninfinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, while numerical examples illustrate\nthe adequateness of a simple bootstrap procedure for inferential purposes.\nLastly, an application to a real dataset is used to further illustrate the\nvalidity and finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 09:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-24"}

No source for\naphid resistance is presently available in Brassica juncea . A wild crucifer,\nBrassica fruticulosa is known to be resistant to mustard aphid. An artificially\nsynthesized amphiploid, AD-4 (B. fruticulosa x B. rapa var. brown sarson) was\ndeveloped for use as a bridge species to transfer fruticulosa resistance to B.\njuncea. Using the selfed backcross we could select a large number of lines with\nresistance to mustard aphid.

Results: Majority of introgression lines\nhad expected euploid chromosome number(2n= 36), showed normal meiosis and high\npollen grain fertility. Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence\nrepeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to\ncharacterize introgression events.

The main phenomenological consequence of this is a sizable deviation of\nthe Higgs couplings from the Standard Model predictions. While the present\nexperimental precision in the measurement of the Higgs couplings still allows\nfor considerable release of this tension, future measurements of the Higgs\nbranching ratios with increased precision would lead to stringent constraints\non this setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 11:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 07:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

Characterizing leaf powers is a challenging open\nproblem, along with determining the complexity of their recognition. This is in\npart due to the fact that few graphs are known to not be leaf powers, as such\ngraphs are difficult to construct. Recently, Nevries and Rosenke asked if leaf\npowers could be characterized by strong chordality and a finite set of\nforbidden subgraphs.\n  In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this question, by exhibiting\nan infinite family \\G of (minimal) strongly chordal graphs that are not leaf\npowers.

Moreover, understanding the nanoscale\nbehavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of\ncollective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of\naccessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting\nproperties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting\nnanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and\nmore efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these\nadvantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable\nspeed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are\nfaster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we\noptimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We\nshowed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)\nmade of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous\ncoexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and\nefficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the\ngoverning mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual\nsuperconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and\nsuperconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity\neffect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest\nthat such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting\nproperties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this\nhybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting\nfilms and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near\nthe superconducting-to-insulating transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 12:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Since the end goal of large-scale recognition\nis to delineate complex boundaries of thousands of classes, adequate\nexploration of feature distributions is important for realizing full potentials\nof ConvNets. However, state-of-the-art works concentrate only on deeper or\nwider architecture design, while rarely exploring feature statistics higher\nthan first-order. We take a step towards addressing this problem. Our method\nconsists in covariance pooling, instead of the most commonly used first-order\npooling, of high-level convolutional features. The main challenges involved are\nrobust covariance estimation given a small sample of large-dimensional features\nand usage of the manifold structure of covariance matrices. To address these\nchallenges, we present a Matrix Power Normalized Covariance (MPN-COV) method.\nWe develop forward and backward propagation formulas regarding the nonlinear\nmatrix functions such that MPN-COV can be trained end-to-end. In addition, we\nanalyze both qualitatively and quantitatively its advantage over the well-known\nLog-Euclidean metric.

Earlier studies\nexplained the formation of such a plume in terms of the effect of a uniform\naxial magnetic field that significantly increases the lengthscale of convection\nin a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show\nthat the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral\ninhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing\nthe rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number\n$E$) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location\nwhere the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear\nonset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally\nvarying axial magnetic field. A cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite\ndimensions $(x,z)$ mimic $(\\phi,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral\ninhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where\nconvection is entirely confined to the peak-field region. The localization of\nthe flow by the magnetic field occurs even when the field strength (measured by\nthe Elsasser number $\\varLambda$) is small and viscosity controls the smallest\nlengthscale of convection. The lowest Rayleigh number at which an isolated\nplume appears within the tangent cylinder in spherical shell dynamo simulations\nagrees closely with the viscous-mode Rayleigh number in the plane layer linear\nmagnetoconvection model. The localized excitation of viscous-mode convection by\na laterally varying magnetic field provides a mechanism for the formation of\nisolated plumes within Earth's tangent cylinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 12:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 13:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

This scheme allows cooperation between the transmitter\nand the relay without the need to decode a part of the message by the relay.\nThe transmission is divided into blocks and each deterministic output of the\nchannel (observed by the relay) is mapped to a bin. The bin index is used by\nthe encoder and the relay to choose the cooperation codeword in the next\ntransmission block. In causal settings the cooperation is independent of the\nstate. In \\emph{non-causal} settings dependency between the relay's\ntransmission and the state can increase the transmission rates. The encoder\nimplicitly conveys partial state information to the relay.

This paper aims to extend\nthe merits of residual network, such as skip connection induced fast training,\nfor a typical low-level vision problem, i.e., single image super-resolution. In\ngeneral, the two main challenges of existing deep CNN for supper-resolution lie\nin the gradient exploding/vanishing problem and large numbers of parameters or\ncomputational cost as CNN goes deeper. Correspondingly, the skip connections or\nidentity mapping shortcuts are utilized to avoid gradient exploding/vanishing\nproblem. In addition, the skip connections have naturally centered the\nactivation which led to better performance. To tackle with the second problem,\na lightweight CNN architecture which has carefully designed width, depth and\nskip connections was proposed. In particular, a strategy of gradually varying\nthe shape of network has been proposed for residual network. Different residual\narchitectures for image super-resolution have also been compared.

Since the effect of the Earth oblateness\nis strong at low altitudes, its inclusion in the model can sensibly improve the\ninitial orbit, giving a better starting guess for differential corrections and\nincreasing the chances to obtain their convergence.

A $k$-spoke is the union\nof a collection of filled triangles that pairwise either have a common edge or\na common vertex. A consideration of the closeness of nerve complexes leads to a\nproximal view of simplicial complexes. A practical application of proximal\nnerve complexes is given, briefly, in terms of object shape geometry in digital\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 23:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}
