However the lensing\ndeflections also change the photon path so that the emission angle is no longer\northogonal to the background last-scattering surface. We give the first\ncalculation of the emission-angle corrections to the standard lensing\napproximation from dipole (Doppler) sources for temperature and quadrupole\nsources for temperature and polarization. We show that while the corrections\nare negligible for the temperature and E-mode polarization, additional\nlarge-scale B-modes are produced with a white spectrum that dominates those\nfrom post-Born field rotation (curl lensing). On large scales about one percent\nof the total lensing-induced B-mode amplitude is expected to be due to this\neffect. However, the photon emission angle does remain orthogonal to the\nperturbed last-scattering surface due to time delay, and half of the\nlarge-scale emission-angle B modes cancel with B modes from time delay to give\na total contribution of about half a percent. While not important for planned\nobservations, the signal could ultimately limit the ability of delensing to\nreveal low amplitudes of primordial gravitational waves.We also derive the\nrotation of polarization due to multiple deflections between emission and\nobservation. The rotation angle is of quadratic order in the deflection angle,\nand hence negligibly small: polarization typically rotates by less than an\narcsecond, orders of magnitude less than a small-scale image rotates due to\npost-Born field rotation (which is quadratic in the shear). The field-rotation\nB modes dominate the other effects on small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 16:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

Besides, different emotions might even compete in shaping\nthe public opinion. However, a comprehensive model that considers up-to-date\nfindings to replicate the patterns of emotion contagion in online social media\nis still missing. In this paper, to bridge this vital gap, we propose an\nagent-based emotion contagion model which combines features of emotion\ninfluence and tie strength preference in the dissemination process. The\nsimulation results indicate that anger-dominated users have higher vitality\nthan joy-dominated ones, and anger prefers weaker ties than joy in diffusion,\nwhich could make it easier to spread between online groups. Moreover, anger's\nhigh influence makes it competitive and easily to dominate the community,\nespecially when negative public events occur.

However,\nlarger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede\nresearch and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a\npotential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of\nparallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload\nmust be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In\nthis paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches\ncause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained\nnetworks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy\nwhen training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this\nresult, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting\nlearning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme\nthat overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple\ntechniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of\n8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using\ncommodity hardware, our implementation achieves ~90% scaling efficiency when\nmoving from 8 to 256 GPUs.

We propose greedy heuristics for real-time ride matching that offer\ndifferent trade-offs between optimality and speed. Simulations on New York City\n(NYC) taxi trip data show that our heuristics are up to 90% optimal and 10^5\ntimes faster than the (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm.\n  Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by\nmatching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings\nare typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased\nprofit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not\nclear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would\nencourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction\nof savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the\ndecisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount\noffered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm\nIDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the\nprovider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the\noptimal discount factor in under 16 iterations.\n  Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy\nbased on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept. Such\nrestricted policies offer a better ride experience, increasing the provider's\nmarket share, but at the cost of decreased average per-ride profit due to the\nreduced number of matched rides. We construct a model that captures these\nopposing effects, wherein simulations based on NYC data show that a 7% increase\nin market share would suffice to offset the decreased average per-ride profit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 16:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

As datasets in applications\ngrow larger and larger, scalability has emerged as a central problem for MCMC\nmethods. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and related stochastic\ngradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods offer scalability by using stochastic\ngradients in each step of the simulated dynamics. While these methods are\nasymptotically unbiased if the stepsizes are reduced in an appropriate fashion,\nin practice constant stepsizes are used. This introduces a bias that is often\nignored. In this paper we study the mean squared error of Lipschitz functionals\nin strongly log- concave models with i.i.d. data of growing data set size and\nshow that, given a batchsize, to control the bias of SGLD the stepsize has to\nbe chosen so small that the computational cost of reaching a target accuracy is\nroughly the same for all batchsizes. Using a control variate approach, the cost\ncan be reduced dramatically. The analysis is performed by considering the\nalgorithms as noisy discretisations of the Langevin SDE which correspond to the\nEuler method if the full data set is used.

This brings great challenge to its optimal\noperation due to the difficulty of implementing a unified control. This paper\naddresses the distributed optimal control of DC microgrids, which intends to\nbreak the restriction of diversity to some extent. Firstly, we formulate the\noptimal power flow (OPF) problem of stand-alone DC microgrids as an exact\nsecond order cone program (SOCP) and prove the uniqueness of the optimal\nsolution. Then a dynamic solving algorithm based on primal-dual decomposition\nmethod is proposed, the convergence of which is proved theoretically as well as\nthe optimality of its equilibrium point. It should be stressed that the\nalgorithm can provide control commands for the three types of microgrids: (i)\npower control, (ii) voltage control and (iii) droop control. This implies that\neach microgrid does not need to change its original control strategy in\npractice, which is less influenced by the diversity of microgrids. Moreover,\nthe control commands for power controlled and voltage controlled microgrids\nsatisfy generation limits and voltage limits in both transient process and\nsteady state. Finally, a six-microgrid DC system based on the microgrid\nbenchmark is adopted to validate the effectiveness and plug-n-play property of\nour designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 17:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

In the case of phase\nmeasuring profilometry (PMP), the projected patterns are composed of a rolling\nsinusoidal wave, but as a set of time-multiplexed patterns, PMP requires the\ntarget surface to remain motionless or for scanning to be performed at such\nhigh rates that any movement is small. But high speed scanning places a\nsignificant burden on the projector electronics to produce contone patterns\ninside of short exposure intervals. Binary patterns are, therefore, of great\nvalue, but converting contone patterns into binary comes with significant risk.\nAs such, this paper introduces a contone-to-binary conversion algorithm for\nderiving binary patterns that best mimic their contone counterparts.\nExperimental results will show a greater than 3 times reduction in pattern\nnoise over traditional halftoning procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 17:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

Various\ntheories that aim to explain the presence of such ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs)\nhave since been proposed. A key question that will help to differentiate\nbetween models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and\nwhat their abundance as a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our\nprevious study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to galaxy groups. We measure the\nabundance of UDGs in 325 spectroscopically-selected groups from the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We make use of the overlapping imaging from the\nESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), from which we can identify galaxies with mean\nsurface brightnesses within their effective radii down to ~25.5 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ in the r-band. We are able to measure a significant overdensity\nof UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun,\na regime where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can\ndetect. We combine measurements of the abundance of UDGs in haloes that cover\nthree orders of magnitude in halo mass, finding that their numbers scale quite\nsteeply with halo mass; N_UDG (R<R200) $\\propto$ M200^(1.11+/-0.07). To better\ninterpret this, we also measure the mass-richness relation for brighter\ngalaxies down to $M^*_r$+2.5 in the same GAMA groups, and find a much shallower\nrelation of N_Bright (R<R200) $\\propto$ M200^(0.78+/-0.05). This shows that\nUDGs are relatively more abundant, compared to bright galaxies, in massive\nclusters than in groups. We discuss implications, but whether this difference\nis related to a higher destruction rate of UDGs in groups, or whether massive\nhaloes have a positive effect on their formation, is not yet clear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 11:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

As designed, each pixel\nin the camera sees exactly one pixel from the projector; however, there are\nexceptions to this when the scanned surface has a complicated geometry with\nstep edges and other discontinuities in depth or where the target surface has\nspecularities that reflect light away from the camera. These situations are\ngenerally referred to multipath where a given camera pixel receives light from\nmultiple positions from the projector. In the case of bimodal multipath, the\ncamera pixel receives light from exactly two positions from the projector which\noccurs when light bounce back from a reflective surface or along a step edge\nwhere the edge slices through a pixel so that the pixel sees both a foreground\nand background surface. In this paper, we present a general mathematical model\nand address the bimodal multipath issue in a phase measuring profilometry\nscanner to measure the constructive and destructive interference between the\ntwo light paths, and by taking advantage of this interesting cue, separate the\npaths and make two separated depth measurements.

We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical\nReversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network;\noutput is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The\nframework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum\ngates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of\nsingle-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in\nthe final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each\nsingle-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using\navailable resources.

Similar to the SM, the dark SU(2) is spontaneously broken\nwhile the dark SU(3) confines at low energies. At the renormalizable level, the\ndark sector contains massless fermions - dark leptons - and stable massive\nparticles - dark protons. We find that dark protons with masses between 10-100\nTeV satisfy all current cosmological and astrophysical observations concerning\ndark matter even if dark protons are a symmetric thermal relic.

We use images from the\nNAC camera to study a bright outburst observed in the southern hemisphere on\nJuly 29, 2015. The high spatial resolution of the NAC is needed to localize the\nsource point of the outburst on the surface of the nucleus. The heliocentric\ndistance is 1.25 au and the spacecraft-comet distance is 186 km. Aiming to\nbetter understand the physics that led to the outgassing, we used the Direct\nSimulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to study the gas flow close to the nucleus\nand the dust trajectories. The goal is to understand the mechanisms producing\nthe outburst. We reproduce the opening angle of the outburst in the model and\nconstrain the outgassing ratio between the outburst source and the local\nregion.

The\nunderlying theory is the GS equation that describes two-dimensional\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium as widely applied in fusion plasmas. The\ngeometry is such that the arbitrary cross section of the torus has rotational\nsymmetry about the rotation axis $Z$, with a major radius $r_0$. The magnetic\nfield configuration is thus determined by a scalar flux function $\\Psi$ and a\nfunctional $F$ that is a single-variable function of $\\Psi$. The algorithm is\nimplemented through a two-step approach: i) a trial-and-error process by\nminimizing the residue of the functional $F(\\Psi)$ to determine an optimal $Z$\naxis orientation, and ii) for the chosen $Z$, a $\\chi^2$ minimization process\nresulting in the range of $r_0$. Benchmark studies of known analytic solutions\nto the toroidal GS equation with noise additions are presented to illustrate\nthe two-step procedures and to demonstrate the performance of the numerical GS\nsolver, separately.

We start by analyzing the\nsecond-, fourth- and sixth-order coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the\nenergy per particle in powers of the isospin asymmetry for Gogny forces. These\ncoefficients provide information about the departure of the symmetry energy\nfrom the widely used parabolic law. The neutron star core-crust transition is\nevaluated by looking at the onset of thermodynamical instability of the liquid\ncore. The calculation is performed with the exact (i.e., without Taylor\nexpansion) Gogny EoS for the core, and also with its Taylor expansion in order\nto assess the influence of isospin expansions on locating the inner edge of\nneutron star crusts. It is found that the properties of the core-crust\ntransition derived from the exact EoS differ from the predictions of the Taylor\nexpansion even when the expansion is carried through sixth order in the isospin\nasymmetry. Gogny forces, using the exact EoS, predict the ranges $0.094 \\text{\nfm}^{-3} \\lesssim \\rho_t \\lesssim 0.118\\text{ fm}^{-3}$ for the transition\ndensity and $0.339 \\text{ MeV fm}^{-3} \\lesssim P_t \\lesssim 0.665 \\text{ MeV\nfm}^{-3}$ for the transition pressure.

We review the foundations of the\npopular Landauer-B\\\"uttiker(LB)+DFT approach. This formalism, when using\napproximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) potential with steps at integer\noccupation, correctly captures the Kondo plateau in the zero bias conductance\nat zero temperature but completely fails to capture the transition to the\nCoulomb blockade (CB) regime as temperature increases. To overcome the\nlimitations of LB+DFT the quantum transport problem is treated from a\ntime-dependent (TD) perspective using TDDFT, an exact framework to deal with\nnonequilibrium situations. The steady-state limit of TDDFT shows that in\naddition to an xc potential in the junction, there also exists an xc correction\nto the applied bias. Open shell molecules in the CB regime provide the most\nstriking examples of the importance of the xc bias correction. Using the\nAnderson model as guidance we estimate these corrections in the limit of zero\nbias. For the general case we put forward a steady-state DFT which is based on\nthe one-to-one correspondence between the pair of basic variables steady\ndensity on and steady current across the junction and the pair local potential\non and bias across the junction. Like TDDFT, this framework also leads to both\nan xc potential in the junction and an xc correction to the bias. Unlike in\nTDDFT, these potentials are independent of history. We highlight the universal\nfeatures of both xc potential and xc bias corrections for junctions in the CB\nregime and provide an accurate parametrization for the Anderson model at\narbitrary temperatures and interaction strengths thus providing a unified DFT\ndescription for both Kondo and CB regimes and the transition between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 20:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

On one hand, our subjective experience is one of a rich visual world,\nwhich we perceive effortlessly. However, when we actually test perception,\nobservers know surprisingly little. A number of tasks, from search, through\ninattentional blindness, to change blindness, suggest that there is\nsurprisingly little awareness or perception without attention. Meanwhile,\nanother set of tasks, such as multiple object tracking, dual-task performance,\nand visual working memory tasks suggest that both attention and working memory\nhave low capacity. These two components together - poor perception without\nattention, and greatly limited capacity for attention and memory - imply that\nperception is impoverished.\n  How can we make sense of this awareness puzzle, of the riddle of our rich\nsubjective experience coupled with poor performance on experimental tasks? I\nsuggest that, looked at in the right way, there is in fact no awareness puzzle.\nIn particular, I will argue that the tasks that show limits are inherently\ndifficult tasks, and that there exists a unified explanation for both the rich\nsubjective experience and the apparent limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 20:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

However, in a more\ndetailed analysis one may always find small but non-negligible non-Coulombic\ninteractions in molecular systems originating from the finite size of nuclei,\nmagnetic interactions, etc. While such small modifications of the Coulombic\ninteractions do not seem to alter the nature of a molecular system in real\nworld seriously, they are a serious obstacle for quantum chemical theories and\nmethodologies which their formalism is strictly confined to the Coulombic\ninteractions. Although the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has\nbeen formulated originally for the Coulombic systems, some recent studies have\ndemonstrated that apart from basin energy of an atom in a molecule, its\ntheoretical ingredients are not sensitive to the explicit form of the potential\nenergy operator. In this study, it is demonstrated that the basin energy may be\ndefined not only for coulombic systems but for all real-space subsystems of\nthose systems that are described by any member of the set of the homogeneous\npotential energy functions. On the other hand, this extension opens the door\nfor seeking novel real-space subsystems, apart from atoms in molecules, in\nnon-Coulombic systems. These novel real-space subsystems call for an extended\nformalism that goes beyond the orthodox QTAIM, which is not confined to the\nCoulombic systems nor to the atoms in molecules as the sole real-space\nsubsystems. It is termed the quantum theory of real-space open subsystems\n(QTROS) and its potential applications are detailed. The harmonic trap model,\ncontaining non-interacting fermions or bosons, is considered as an example for\nthe QTROS analysis. The QTROS analysis of bosonic systems is particularly quite\nunprecedented, not attempted before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 20:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Although MOBA is currently one of the\nmost played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less\nautonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these\ncharacteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance\ndynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid\nthat players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a\ndynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to\ncreate a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player\nperformance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is\ndone by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some\ngame features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial\nintelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments\nwere performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting\ndynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative\nexperiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater\ninfluence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 23:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

There are two natural categorical definitions of\nsameness of behavior: $S$ and $S'$ are bisimilar if there exist an LMP $ T$ and\nmeasure preserving maps forming a diagram of the shape $ S\\leftarrow T\n\\rightarrow{S'}$; and they are behaviorally equivalent if there exist some $ U$\nand maps forming a dual diagram $ S\\rightarrow U \\leftarrow{S'}$.\n  These two notions differ for general measurable spaces but Doberkat\n(extending a result by Edalat) proved that they coincide for analytic Borel\nspaces, showing that from every diagram $S\\rightarrow U \\leftarrow{S'}$ one can\nobtain a bisimilarity diagram as above.

Firstly we wish to establish how the neck detection\nlemma allows us to detect necks where the cross sections will be diffeomorphic\nto $S^{n-1}$. We then want to see how we are able to glue these cross sections\ntogether with full control on their parametrisation - for this we will show we\ncan use a harmonic spherical parametrisation using the techniques from\nHamiltons paper, Four-manifolds with Positive Isotropic Curvature. We then\nintroduce the notion of a normal and maximal necks, this allows us to obtain\nuniqueness, existence and overlapping properties for normal parametrisations on\n$(\\epsilon,k)$-cylindrical hypersurface necks. Lastly given a neck\n$N:S^{n-1}\\times[a,b]\\to\\mathcal{M}$ we want to see that in the case that\neither $a=\\infty$ or $b=\\infty$ that this forces them to both to be $\\infty$\nand that we are left with a solid tube $S^{n-1}\\times S^1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 03:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

A new cooperative multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT NOMA\nprotocol is proposed, where a user with a strong channel condition acts as an\nenergy-harvesting (EH) relay to help a user with a poor channel condition. The\npower splitting (PS) scheme is adopted at the EH relay. By jointly optimizing\nthe PS ratio and the beamforming vectors, the design objective is to maximize\nthe data rate of the \"strong user\" while satisfying the QoS requirement of the\n\"weak user\". It boils down to a challenging nonconvex problem. To resolve this\nissue, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is applied to relax the\nquadratic terms related with the beamformers, and then it is solved to its\nglobal optimality by two-dimensional exhaustive search. We prove the rank-one\noptimality, which establishes the equivalence between the relaxed problem and\nthe original one. To further reduce the high complexity due to the exhaustive\nsearch, an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA)\nis proposed, which can at least attain its stationary point efficiently. In\nview of the potential application scenarios, e.g., IoT, the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) case of the cooperative SWIPT NOMA system is also studied.\nThe formulated problem is proved to be strictly unimodal with respect to the PS\nratio. Hence, a golden section search (GSS) based algorithm with closed-form\nsolution at each step is proposed to find the unique global optimal solution.\nIt is worth pointing out that the SCA method can also converge to the optimal\nsolution in SISO cases. In the numerical simulation, the proposed algorithm is\nnumerically shown to converge within a few iterations, and the SWIPT-aided NOMA\nprotocol outperforms the existing transmission protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 07:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

This breakdown results in a set\nof pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that includes one Standard Model (SM)\nsinglet scalar, a SM-like Higgs doublet and an SU(3)_C triplet of scalar\nfields, T. In the E6CHM the Z^L_{2} symmetry, which is a discrete subgroup of\nthe U(1)_L associated with lepton number conservation, can be used to forbid\noperators which lead to rapid proton decay. The remaining baryon number\nviolating operators are sufficiently strongly suppressed because of the large\nvalue of the scale f. We argue that in this variant of the E6CHM a sizeable\nbaryon number asymmetry can be induced if CP is violated.

What is crucial is that to\ncapture long range dependencies we must consider very large Hankel matrices.\nThus the computation of the SVD becomes a critical bottleneck.

The novelty lies in the way that this subset is\nselected: we exploit a maximal bipartite matching combinatorial algorithm to\nlook for a sub-block with full structural rank, and show how computation of\nthis sub-block can be further improved by exploiting the specific structure of\nHankel matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 07:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

Hence we are able to systematically show that\nlubrication forces when the particles are very close to each other play as\nimportant a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions in determining their\nmany-body behaviour. We find that motility-induced phase separation is\nsuppressed by near-field interactions, leading to open gel-like clusters rather\nthan dense clusters. Interestingly, we find a globally polar ordered phase\nappears for neutral swimmers with no force dipole that is enhanced by near\nfield lubrication forces in which the collision process rather than long-range\ninteraction dominates the alignment mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 09:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The spectra from UPd$_3$ and URu$_2$Si$_2$,are similar, strongly\nsuggesting a predominant $5f^2$ configuration for URu$_2$Si$_2$. The\nvalence-band resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) provides information on\nthe U $P_3$ transitions (at about $18$~eV) between the U $5f$ and U $6p$\nstates, as well as transitions of between $3$ and $7$~eV from the valence band\ninto the unoccupied $5f$ states. These transitions are primarily involving\nmixed ligand states (O $2p$ or Pd, Ru $4d$) and U $5f$ states. Calculations are\nable to reproduce both these low-energy transitions reasonably well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 12:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

Deleting the condition on the letters\ncommon to a row and a column gives a double array. We propose the term\n\\emph{sesqui-array} for such an array when only the condition on pairs of\ncolumns is deleted. Thus all triple arrays are sesqui-arrays.\n  In this paper we give three constructions for sesqui-arrays. The first gives\n$(n+1)\\times n^2$ arrays on $n(n+1)$ letters for $n\\geq 2$. (Such an array for\n$n=2$ was found by Bagchi.) This construction uses Latin squares. The second\nuses the \\emph{Sylvester graph}, a subgraph of the Hoffman--Singleton graph, to\nbuild a good block design for $36$ treatments in $42$ blocks of size~$6$, and\nthen uses this in a $7\\times 36$ sesqui-array for $42$ letters.\n  We also give a construction for $K\\times(K-1)(K-2)/2$ sesqui-arrays on\n$K(K-1)/2$ letters. This construction uses biplanes. It starts with a block of\na biplane and produces an array which satisfies the requirements for a\nsesqui-array except possibly that of having no repeated letters in a row or\ncolumn. We show that this condition holds if and only if the \\emph{Hussain\nchains} for the selected block contain no $4$-cycles. A sufficient condition\nfor the construction to give a triple array is that each Hussain chain is a\nunion of $3$-cycles; but this condition is not necessary, and we give a few\nfurther examples.\n  We also discuss the question of which of these arrays provide good designs\nfor experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 12:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 13:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

Our\nstrategy is to expand the Hubble parameter around the redshift $z=0$ up to a\ngiven order and to adopt cosmographic bounds as initial settings to determine\nthe corresponding $f(z)\\equiv f(T(H(z)))$ function. In this perspective, we\ndistinguish two cases: the first expansion is up to the jerk parameter, the\nsecond expansion is up to the snap parameter. We show that inside the observed\nredshift domain $z\\leq1$, only the net strength of $f(z)$ is modified passing\nfrom jerk to snap, whereas its functional behavior and shape turn out to be\nidentical. As first step, we set the cosmographic parameters by means of the\nmost recent observations. Afterwards, we calibrate our numerical solutions with\nthe concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. In both cases, there is a good agreement\nwith the cosmological standard model around $z\\leq 1$, with severe\ndiscrepancies outer of this limit. We demonstrate that the effective dark\nenergy term evolves following the test-function: $f(z)=\\mathcal A+\\mathcal\nBz^2e^{\\mathcal Cz}$. Bounds over the set $\\left\\{\\mathcal A, \\mathcal B,\n\\mathcal C\\right\\}$ are also fixed by statistical considerations, comparing\ndiscrepancies between $f(z)$ with data. The approach opens the possibility to\nget a wide class of test-functions able to frame the dynamics of $f(T)$ without\npostulating any model \\emph{a priori}. We thus re-obtain the $f(T)$ function\nthrough a back-scattering procedure once $f(z)$ is known. We figure out the\nproperties of our $f(T)$ function at the level of background cosmology, to\ncheck the goodness of our numerical results. Finally, a comparison with\nprevious cosmographic approaches is carried out giving results compatible with\ntheoretical expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 14:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Radio observations using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis\nTelescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 36, 16, 6, and 3 cm\nreveal a complex morphology. The pulsar is embedded in the \"head\" of the nebula\nwith fan-shaped diffuse emission. This is connected to a circular bubble of 20\"\nradius and a collimated tail extending over 1'. Polarization measurements show\na highly ordered magnetic field in the nebula. It wraps around the edge of the\nhead and shows an azimuthal configuration near the pulsar, then switches\ndirection quasi-periodically near the bubble and in the tail. Together with the\nflat radio spectrum observed, we suggest that this system is most plausibly a\npulsar wind nebula (PWN), with the head as a bow shock that has a low Mach\nnumber and the bubble as a shell expanding in a dense environment. The bubble\ncould act as a magnetic bottle trapping the relativistic particles. A\ncomparison with other bow-shock PWNe with higher Mach numbers shows similar\nstructure and B-field geometry, implying that pulsar velocity may not be the\nmost critical factor in determining the properties of these systems.\n  We also derive analytic expressions for the projected standoff distance and\nshape of an inclined bow shock. It is found that the projected distance is\nalways larger than the true distance in three dimensions. On the other hand,\nthe projected shape is not sensitive to the inclination after rescaling with\nthe projected standoff distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 14:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

In the physical sense, this\njumping of the Riccati-type solutions of the governing ODE could be associated\nwith the effect of sudden acceleration/deceleration in the satellite rotation\naround the chosen principle axis at a definite moment of parametric time. This\nmeans that there exists not only a chaotic satellite rotation regime (as per\nthe results of J. Wisdom et al.

Its earliest sign are red lesions, a general term that groups both\nmicroaneurysms and hemorrhages. In daily clinical practice, these lesions are\nmanually detected by physicians using fundus photographs. However, this task is\ntedious and time consuming, and requires an intensive effort due to the small\nsize of the lesions and their lack of contrast. Computer-assisted diagnosis of\nDR based on red lesion detection is being actively explored due to its\nimprovement effects both in clinicians consistency and accuracy. Several\nmethods for detecting red lesions have been proposed in the literature, most of\nthem based on characterizing lesion candidates using hand crafted features, and\nclassifying them into true or false positive detections.

Because of their volatility, nitrogen-bearing molecules are\nkey to study the dense and cold gas present in pre-stellar cores. The NH_3\nrotational transition detected with Herschel-HIFI provides a unique combination\nof sensitivity and spectral resolution to further investigate physical and\nchemical processes in pre-stellar cores. Here we present the velocity-resolved\nHerschel-HIFI observations of the ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) line at 572 GHz and study\nthe abundance profile of ammonia across the pre-stellar core L1544 to test\ncurrent theories of its physical and chemical structure.\n  Recently calculated collisional coefficients have been included in our\nnon-LTE radiative transfer code to reproduce Herschel observations. A gas-grain\nchemical model, including spin-state chemistry and applied to the (static)\nphysical structure of L1544 is also used to infer the abundance profile of\northo-NH_3 . The hyperfine structure of ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) is resolved for the\nfirst time in space. All the hyperfine components are strongly self-absorbed.\nThe profile can be reproduced if the core is contracting in quasi-equilibrium,\nconsistent with previous work, and if the NH_3 abundance is slightly rising\ntoward the core centre, as deduced from previous interferometric observations\nof para-NH_3(1,1). The chemical model overestimates the NH_3 abundance at radii\nbetween ~ 4000 and 15000 AU by about two orders of magnitude and underestimates\nthe abundance toward the core centre by more than one order of magnitude. Our\nobservations show that chemical models applied to static clouds have problems\nin reproducing NH_3 observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 11:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range\nfor both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of\nthe {\\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev. Combining this result with\nfits to the CMB power spectrum, produces different results for particle vs.\nbrane-world dark radiation.

However, measurement of the temperature history in the RCM reaction\nchamber is challenging. Thus, the temperature is generally calculated by the\nisentropic relations between pressure and temperature, assuming that the\nadiabatic core hypothesis holds. To estimate the uncertainty in the calculated\ntemperature, an uncertainty propagation analysis must be carried out. Our\nprevious analyses assumed that the uncertainties of the parameters in the\nequation to calculate the temperature were normally distributed and\nindependent, but these assumptions do not hold for typical RCM operating\nprocedures. In this work, a Monte Carlo method is developed to estimate the\nuncertainty in the calculated temperature, while taking into account the\ncorrelation between parameters and the possibility of non-normal probability\ndistributions. In addition, the Monte Carlo method is compared to an analysis\nthat assumes normally distributed, independent parameters. Both analysis\nmethods show that the magnitude of the initial pressure and the uncertainty of\nthe initial temperature have strong influences on the magnitude of the\nuncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty estimation methods studied here provide a\nreference value for the uncertainty of the reference temperature in an RCM and\ncan be generalized to other similar facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 15:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

Understanding the\neffects of reddening and redshift on the observed colors are complicated and\ndependent on the intrinsic spectrum, the filter curves, and the wavelength\ndependence of reddening. We present ultraviolet and optical data of a growing\nsample of SNe Ia observed with the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope on the Swift\nspacecraft and use this sample to re-examine the near-UV (NUV) colors of SNe\nIa. We find that a small amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.2 mag) could account for\nthe difference between groups designated as NUV-blue and NUV-red, and a\nmoderate amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.5 mag) could account for the whole\nNUV-optical differences. The reddening scenario, however, is inconsistent with\nthe mid-UV colors and color evolution. The effect of redshift alone only\naccounts for part of the variation. Using a spectral template of SN2011fe we\ncan forward model the effects of redshift and reddening and directly compare\nwith the observed colors. We find that some SNe are consistent with reddened\nversions of SN2011fe, but most SNe Ia are much redder in the uvw1-v color than\nSN2011fe reddened to the same b-v color. The absolute magnitudes show that two\nof five NUV-blue SNe Ia are blue because their near-UV luminosity is high, and\nthe other three are optically fainter. We also show that SN2011fe is not a\n\"normal\" SN Ia in the UV, but has colors placing it at the blue extreme of our\nsample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 21:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

We estimate the yearly rate of yield improvement\nof hybrid corn (measured as bushel per acre) by using both information on\nyields contained in US patent documents for patented hybrid corn varieties and\non field-test data of several hybrid corn varieties performed at US State\nlevel. We have used a generalization of Moore's law to fit productivity trends\nand obtain the performance improvement rate by analyzing time series of hybrid\ncorn performance for a period covering the last thirty years. The linear\nregressions results obtained from different data sources indicate that the\nestimated improvement rates per year are between 1.2 and 2.4 percent. In\nparticular, using yields reported in a sample of patents filed between 1985 and\n2010, we estimated an improvement rate of 0.015 (R2 = 0.74, Pvalue = 1.37 x\n10^-8). Moreover, we apply two predicting models developed by Benson and Magee\n(2015) and Triulzi and Magee (2016) that only use patent metadata to estimate\nthe rate of improvement. We compare these predicted values to the rate\nestimated using US States field-test data. We find that, due to a turning point\nin patenting practices which begun in 2008, only the predicted rate (rate =\n0.015) using patents filed before 2008 is consistent with the empirical rate.\nFinally, we also investigate at the micro level - on the basis of 70 patents\n(granted between 1986 and 2015) - whether the number of citations received by a\npatent is correlated with performance achieved by the patented variety. We find\nthat the relative performance (yield ratio) of the patented seed is positively\ncorrelated with the total number of citations received by the patent (until\nDecember 2015) but not the citations received within 3 years after the granted\nyear, with the patent application year used as control variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 15:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The simulation results on IEEE 300 bus system show that uncertainty\ncoming from wind energy have severe impact on grid vulnerability to cascading\noverload failures.
