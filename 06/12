Methods: There are 29\nhealthy volunteers divers assigned into SCUBA diving of 12m-depth underwater\n(the Experimental Group, EG)and chamber dive under 2.2 ATA for 20min (the\nControl Group, CG) matched with the factors of the age,gender,BMI and Forced\nVital Capacity (FVC).Ventilation functions were measured by spirometer before\ndiving and in 1h and 24h of post-hyperbaric exposure. Used independent samples\nT tests to compare the differences between the EG and CG.Analyzed of variance\nthrough repeated measurement data of different time point before or after high\npressure exposure by SPSS 20.0. Results: The Inspiratory Reserve Volume(IRV)\nrises while the Expiratory Reserve Volume(ERV) falls significantly in 1h after\nhigh pressure release(p<0.05).So as with the Inspiratory Capacity (IC) and the\nVital Capacity (VC) increased accordingly. The Ratio of FEV1.0 to VC (FEV1.0%t)\nis higher in CG than EG (t=-2.189,p=0.033) due to the change of VC. But the\neffects did not last for 24 h after high pressure relief. Conclusions:\nVentilation is restricted during the 20min of hyperbaric exposure whether under\n12m-depth water or in a 2.2ATA hyperbaric chamber.

Methods: To handle large appearance variation\nwithin kidney images and improve computational efficiency, we build a graph of\nimage pixels close to kidney boundary instead of building a graph of the whole\nimage. To make the kidney segmentation robust to weak boundaries, we adopt\nlocalized regional information to measure similarity between image pixels for\ncomputing edge weights to build the graph of image pixels. The localized graph\nis dynamically updated and the GC based segmentation iteratively progresses\nuntil convergence. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared with\nstate of the art image segmentation methods based on clinical kidney US images\nof 85 subjects.

It is found that different\nfrom conventional magnetic materials, the tunneling conductance through the TI\nsurface acquires an extra component determined by the in-plane spin texture,\nexclusively associated with spin momentum locking. Importantly, this extra\nconductance unconventionally depends on the spatial azimuthal angle of the\nmagnetized STM tip, which is never carried out in previous STM theory.

In particular, our construction gives the first\ncapacity-achieving locally list-decodable codes (over constant-sized alphabet);\nthe first capacity achieving globally list-decodable codes with nearly linear\ntime list decoding algorithm (once more, over constant-sized alphabet); and a\nrandomized construction of binary codes on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound that can\nbe uniquely decoded in near-linear-time, with higher rate than was previously\nknown.\n  Our techniques are actually quite simple, and are inspired by an approach of\nGopalan, Guruswami, and Raghavendra (Siam Journal on Computing, 2011) for\nlist-decoding tensor codes. We show that tensor powers of (globally)\nlist-recoverable codes are \"approximately\" locally list-recoverable, and that\nthe \"approximately\" modifier may be removed by pre-encoding the message with a\nsuitable locally decodable code. Instantiating this with known constructions of\nhigh-rate globally list-recoverable codes and high-rate locally decodable codes\nfinishes the construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 17:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Coulomb\ninteractions between electrons were shown to induce a logarithmic\nrenormalization of the Dirac dispersion. With a rapid expansion of the list of\ncompounds and quasiparticle bands with linear band touching, the concept of\nbosonic Dirac materials has emerged. We consider a specific case of\nferromagnets consisting of the Van der Waals-bonded stacks of honeycomb layers,\ne.g chromium trihalides CrX3 (X = F, Cl, Br and I), that display two spin wave\nmodes with energy dispersion similar to that for the electrons in graphene. At\nthe single particle level, these materials resemble their fermionic\ncounterparts. However, how different particle statistics and interactions\naffect the stability of Dirac cones has yet to be determined. To address the\nrole of interacting Dirac magnons, we expand the theory of ferromagnets beyond\nthe standard Dyson theory to a case of non-Bravais honeycomb layers. We\ndemonstrate that magnon-magnon interactions lead to a significant\nmomentum-dependent renormalization of the bare band structure in addition to\nstrongly momentum-dependent magnon lifetimes. We show that our theory\nqualitatively accounts for hitherto unexplained anomalies in a nearly half\ncentury old magnetic neutron scattering data for CrBr3.

A common approach to event\nattribution uses climate model output under factual (real-world) and\ncounterfactual (world that might have been without anthropogenic greenhouse gas\nemissions) scenarios to estimate the probabilities of the event of interest\nunder the two scenarios. Event attribution is then quantified by the ratio of\nthe two probabilities. While this approach has been applied many times in the\nlast 15 years, the statistical techniques used to estimate the risk ratio based\non climate model ensembles have not drawn on the full set of methods available\nin the statistical literature and have in some cases used and interpreted the\nbootstrap method in non-standard ways.

Electromagnetic\nequilibrium, coupled with the high entropy of the early universe, guarantees\nthat significant numbers of electron-positron pairs are present, and dominate\nover the number of ionization electrons to temperatures much lower than the\nvacuum electron rest mass.

Here we proposed to use these new operators to generalize the\nusual diffusion equation.

We obtained the exact expressions for the\nprobability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions\nemerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion\nequation is solved without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion\nboundary conditions. We have further shown that these new fractional diffusion\nequations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic resetting, and to\nfractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order.

We focus especially on\nmanifestations of power in the dialog structure --- both, in a shallow sense\nthat disregards the textual content of messages (e.g., how often do the\nparticipants contribute, how often do they get replies etc.), as well as the\nstructure that is expressed within the textual content (e.g., who issues\nrequests and how are they made, whose requests get responses etc.).

Various methods have been developed for variable selection in recent\nyears. Well-known examples are forward stepwise regression (FSR) and least\nangle regression (LARS), among others. These methods typically add variables\ninto the model one by one. For such selection procedures, it is crucial to find\na stopping criterion that controls model complexity. One of the most commonly\nused techniques to this end is cross-validation (CV) which, in spite of its\npopularity, has two major drawbacks: expensive computational cost and lack of\nstatistical interpretation. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a\nflexible and efficient test-based variable selection approach that can be\nincorporated into any sequential selection procedure. The test, which is on the\noverall signal in the remaining inactive variables, is based on the maximal\nabsolute partial correlation between the inactive variables and the response\ngiven active variables. We develop the asymptotic null distribution of the\nproposed test statistic as the dimension tends to infinity uniformly in the\nsample size. We also show that the test is consistent. With this test, at each\nstep of the selection, a new variable is included if and only if the $p$-value\nis below some pre-defined level. Numerical studies show that the proposed\nmethod delivers very competitive performance in terms of variable selection\naccuracy and computational complexity compared to CV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 04:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 01:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

However, phase recovery involves\nsolving a system of quadratic equations, indicating that it is a challenging\nnonconvex optimization problem. To tackle phase retrieval in an effective and\nefficient manner, we apply coordinate descent (CD) such that a single unknown\nis solved at each iteration while all other variables are kept fixed. As a\nresult, only minimization of a univariate quartic polynomial is needed which is\neasily achieved by finding the closed-form roots of a cubic equation. Three\ncomputationally simple algorithms referred to as cyclic, randomized and greedy\nCDs, based on different updating rules, are devised. It is proved that the\nthree CDs globally converge to a stationary point of the nonconvex problem, and\nspecifically, the randomized CD locally converges to the global minimum and\nattains exact recovery at a geometric rate with high probability if the sample\nsize is large enough. The cyclic and randomized CDs are also modified via\nminimization of the $\\ell_1$-regularized quartic polynomial for phase retrieval\nof sparse signals. Furthermore, a novel application of the three CDs, namely,\nblind equalization in digital communications, is proposed. It is demonstrated\nthat the CD methodology is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques in terms\nof computational efficiency and/or recovery performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 05:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

The non-parametric\nindependence problem raises the question on how one can use these samples to\nreasonably draw inference on whether the marginal random elements are\nindependent or not. We will try to answer this question by utilizing the\nso-called distance covariance functional in metric spaces developed by Russell\nLyons. We show that, if the marginal spaces are so-called metric spaces of\nstrong negative type (e.g. seperable Hilbert spaces), then the distance\ncovariance functional becomes a direct indicator of independence. That is, one\ncan directly determine whether the marginals are independent or not based\nsolely on the value of this functional. As the functional formally takes the\nsimultaneous distribution as argument, its value is not known in the posed\nnon-parametric independence problem.

Discounted mitigation expenditures are shown to be a convex function of\ncumulative CO2 emissions.

A\nquasi-stationary solution to this problem can be obtained for a special case,\nyielding decarbonization rate that is proportional to annual CO2 emissions.\nMinimum-expenditure trajectories in scenarios where CO2 emissions decrease must\nbegin with rapid decarbonization at rate decreasing with time.

However, no direct comparative study of these two processes\ncurrently exists in the literature. We present 2D adiabatic hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the interaction of a Mach 10 shock with a cloud of density\ncontrast $\\chi = 10$ and compare our results with those of a commensurate\nwind-cloud simulation. We then investigate the effect of varying the wind\nvelocity, effectively altering the wind Mach number $M_{wind}$, on the cloud's\nevolution. We find that there are significant differences between the two\nprocesses: 1) the transmitted shock is much flatter in the shock-cloud\ninteraction; 2) a low-pressure region in the wind-cloud case deflects the flow\naround the edge of the cloud in a different manner to the shock-cloud case; 3)\nthere is far more axial compression of the cloud in the case of the shock. As\n$M_{wind}$ increases, the normalised rate of mixing is reduced. Clouds in winds\nwith higher $M_{wind}$ also do not experience a transmitted shock through the\ncloud's rear and are more compressed axially. In contrast with shock-cloud\nsimulations, the cloud mixing time normalised by the cloud-crushing time-scale\n$t_{cc}$ increases for increasing $M_{wind}$ until it plateaus (at $t_{mix}\n\\simeq 25 \\, t_{cc}$) at high $M_{wind}$, thus demonstrating the expected Mach\nscaling. In addition, clouds in high Mach number winds are able to survive for\nlong durations and are capable of being moved considerable distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 08:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

Second, we identify a sparse\nhuman-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on\nthe sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV\nsnapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to\nvelocity fields is shown to be orders of magnitudes more accurate than optimal\nmodal expansions of the same order. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal\ndecomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically\ncorrelated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model,\nadding interpretability.

Standard\nclustering algorithms usually need to know the number of clusters and are very\nsensitive to initialization, which makes them difficult to use in a fully\ndecentralized setup. In this respect, this paper proposes a decentralized\nmodel-based clustering algorithm that overcomes these issues. The proposed\nalgorithm is based on a novel theoretical framework that relies on hypothesis\ntesting and robust M-estimation.

The p-value of this\ntest makes it possible to define a new type of score function, particularly\nsuitable for devising an M-estimation of the centroids.

This equation was derived in [11] as the limit dynamics of a\nsingularly perturbed Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with Coriolis force, when\nthe Mach, Rossby and Weber numbers go to zero at the same rate. The scope of\nthe present paper is twofold. First of all, we investigate well-posedness of\nsuch a model on the whole space $\\R^2$: we prove that it is well-posed in $H^s$\nfor any $s\\geq3$, globally in time. Interestingly enough, we show that this\nequation owns two levels of energy estimates, for which one gets existence and\nuniqueness of weak solutions with different regularities (namely, $H^3$ and\n$H^4$ regularities); this fact can be viewed as a remainder of the so called\nBD-entropy structure of the original system. In the second part of the paper we\ninvestigate the long-time behaviour of these solutions. We show that they\nconverge to the solution of the corresponding linear parabolic type equation,\nwith same initial datum and external force. Our proof is based on dispersive\nestimates both for the solutions to the linear and non-linear problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 10:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Similar to the loop-induced Higgs decay channels $H\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma, Z\\gamma$, the $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$ process also starts at one-loop\norder provided that the tiny electron mass is neglected. In this work, we\ncalculate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to this associated\n$H+\\gamma$ production process, which mainly stem from the gluonic dressing to\nthe top quark loop.

Two luminous LAEs appear physically\nlinked with projected distance of 1.1 pMpc and velocity difference of ~ 170\nkm/s.

We consider\npoints $X$ in a relaxed metric space, where the triangle inequality holds\nwithin a constant factor. The {\\em cost} of clustering $X$ by $Q$ is\n$V(Q)=\\sum_{x\\in X} d_{xQ}$. Two basic tasks, parametrized by $k \\geq 1$, are\n{\\em cost estimation}, which returns (approximate) $V(Q)$ for queries $Q$ such\nthat $|Q|=k$ and {\\em clustering}, which returns an (approximate) minimizer of\n$V(Q)$ of size $|Q|=k$. With very large data sets $X$, we seek efficient\nconstructions of small samples that act as surrogates to the full data for\nperforming these tasks.

These structures\nappear as charged flexible clouds (shielded by the background plasma) in the\nphase space with their own inertia, depending on the number of trapped\nelectrons. According to simulation studies, electron holes tend to merge in\npairs until one accumulative hole remains in the simulation box. This tendency\nhas been analytically and qualitatively explained in the frame of the energy\nconservation principle. However, electron holes accompanying IA solitons should\nnot merge due to stability of IA solitons against mutual collisions. In this\nreport based on a fully kinetic simulation approach, detailed study of the\ncollisions of IA solitons reveals the behavior of electron holes under these\ntwo conflicting predictions, i.e. stability against mutual collisions and\nmerging tendency. Four main results are reported here. Firstly, we find that\namong the three different types of collisions possible for electron holes, just\ntwo of them happen for electron holes accompanying IA solitons. We present\ndifferent collisions, e.g. two large/small and large versus small holes, to\ncover all the these three different types of collisions.

The\ntime-domain cross-relation method is not suitable for blind room impulse\nresponse identification, due to the near-common zeros of the long impulse\nresponses. We extend the cross-relation method to the short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) domain, in which the time-domain impulse responses are\napproximately represented by the convolutive transfer functions (CTFs) with\nmuch less coefficients. The CTFs suffer from the common zeros caused by the\noversampled STFT. We propose to identify CTFs based on the STFT with the\noversampled signals and the critical sampled CTFs, which is a good compromise\nbetween the frequency aliasing of the signals and the common zeros problem of\nCTFs. In addition, a normalization of the CTFs is proposed to remove the gain\nambiguity across sub-bands. In the STFT domain, the identified CTFs is used for\nmultichannel equalization, in which the sparsity of speech signals is\nexploited.

We show that as a consequence\nof a finite logarithmic Jensen's gap, approximate capacity region can be\nobtained for fast fading interference channels (FF-IC) for several scenarios.\nWe illustrate three instances where a constant capacity gap can be obtained as\na function of the logarithmic Jensen's gap. Firstly for an FF-IC with neither\nfeedback nor instantaneous channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), if\nthe fading distribution has finite logarithmic Jensen's gap, we show that a\nrate-splitting scheme based on average interference-to-noise ratio (inr) can\nachieve its approximate capacity.

We prove that the logarithmic\nJensen's gap is finite for common fading models, including Rayleigh and\nNakagami fading, thereby obtaining the approximate capacity region of FF-IC\nwith these fading models. For Rayleigh fading the capacity gap is obtained as\n1.83 bits per channel use for non-feedback case and 2.83 bits per channel use\nfor feedback case.

Numerical operations on big\ndatasets can be intolerably slow; sketching algorithms address this issue by\ngenerating a smaller surrogate dataset. Typically, inference proceeds on the\ncompressed dataset. Sketching algorithms generally use random projections to\ncompress the original dataset and this stochastic generation process makes them\namenable to statistical analysis. We argue that the sketched data can be\nmodelled as a random sample, thus placing this family of data compression\nmethods firmly within an inferential framework. In particular, we focus on the\nGaussian, Hadamard and Clarkson-Woodruff sketches, and their use in single pass\nsketching algorithms for linear regression with huge $n$. We explore the\nstatistical properties of sketched regression algorithms and derive new\ndistributional results for a large class of sketched estimators. A key result\nis a conditional central limit theorem for data oblivious sketches. An\nimportant finding is that the best choice of sketching algorithm in terms of\nmean square error is related to the signal to noise ratio in the source\ndataset.

This function guides the optimization process\nand measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective\nat a new point. GPs assume continous input variables. When this is not the\ncase, such as when some of the input variables take integer values, one has to\nintroduce extra approximations. A common approach is to round the suggested\nvariable value to the closest integer before doing the evaluation of the\nobjective. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process\nand describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are\ninteger-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the\nutility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard\nBO methods on problems involving integer-valued variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Spectroscopic observations of lensed\nhigh-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are of particular interest since they\ncan be used to test for evolution of their intrinsic properties. The use of SNe\nIa for probing the cosmic expansion history has proven to be an extremely\npowerful method for measuring cosmological parameters.

Although topic\nmodels often perform well on traditional training vs. test set evaluations, it\nis often the case that the results of a topic model do not align with human\ninterpretation. This interpretability fallacy is largely due to the\nunsupervised nature of topic models, which prohibits any user guidance on the\nresults of a model. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised method called\ntopic supervised non-negative matrix factorization (TS-NMF) that enables the\nuser to provide labeled example documents to promote the discovery of more\nmeaningful semantic structure of a corpus. In this way, the results of TS-NMF\nbetter match the intuition and desired labeling of the user. The core of TS-NMF\nrelies on solving a non-convex optimization problem for which we derive an\niterative algorithm that is shown to be monotonic and convergent to a local\noptimum. We demonstrate the practical utility of TS-NMF on the Reuters and\nPubMed corpora, and find that TS-NMF is especially useful for conceptual or\nbroad topics, where topic key terms are not well understood. Although\nidentifying an optimal latent structure for the data is not a primary objective\nof the proposed approach, we find that TS-NMF achieves higher weighted Jaccard\nsimilarity scores than the contemporary methods, (unsupervised) NMF and latent\nDirichlet allocation, at supervision rates as low as 10% to 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 04:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

Single IFs span M\\\"uller cells (MC)\nlengthwise; cylindrical bundles of IFs (IFBs) appear inside the cone inner\nsegment (CIS) at the outer limiting membrane (OLM) level. IFBs adjoin the cone\ncytoplasmatic membrane, following lengthwise regularly spaced, forming a\nskeleton of the CIS, located above the OLM. IFBs follow along the cone outer\nsegment (COS), with single IFs separating from the IFB, touching and entering\nin-between the light-sensitive disks of the cone membrane. We propose a\nmechanism of exciton transfer from the inner retinal surface to the visual\npigments in the photoreceptor cells. This includes excitation transfer in\ndonor-acceptor systems, from the IF donors to the rhodopsin acceptors, with\ntheoretic efficiency over 80%. This explains high image contrast in fovea and\nfoveola in daylight, while the classical mechanism that describes M\\\"uller\ncells as optical lightguides operates in night vision, with loss of resolution\ntraded for sensitivity. Our theory receives strong confirmation in morphology\nand function of the cones and pigment cells. In daylight the lateral surface of\nthe photosensor disks is blocked from the (scattered or oblique) light by the\npigment cells. Thus the light energy can only get to the cone via intermediate\nfilaments that absorb photons in the M\\\"uller cell endfeet and conduct excitons\nto the cone. Thus, the disks are consumed at their lateral surfaces, moving to\nthe apex of the cone, with new disks produced below. An alternative hypothesis\nof direct light passing through the cone with its organelles and hitting the\nlowest disk contradicts morphological evidence, as thus all of the other disks\nwould have no useful function in daylight vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 18:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}
