The nonlocal nature of the fractional diffusion operators\nmakes substantially more difficult the mathematical analysis of these models\nand the establishment of suitable numerical schemes. This paper proposes and\nanalyzes the first finite difference method for solving {\\em\nvariable-coefficient} fractional differential equations, with two-sided\nfractional derivatives, in one-dimensional space. The proposed scheme combines\nfirst-order forward and backward Euler methods for approximating the left-sided\nfractional derivative when the right-sided fractional derivative is\napproximated by two consecutive applications of the first-order backward Euler\nmethod. Our finite difference scheme reduces to the standard second-order\ncentral difference scheme in the absence of fractional derivatives. The\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution for the proposed scheme are proved,\nand truncation errors of order $h$ are demonstrated, where $h$ denotes the\nmaximum space step size. The numerical tests illustrate the global $O(h)$\naccuracy of our scheme, except for nonsmooth cases which, as expected, have\ndeteriorated convergence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 16:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 18:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

It may use a parser to interpret the question to a\nstructured query, execute that on a knowledge graph (KG), and return direct\nentity responses. QA systems based on precise parsing tend to be brittle: minor\nsyntax variations may dramatically change the response. Moreover, KG coverage\nis patchy. At the other extreme, a large corpus may provide broader coverage,\nbut in an unstructured, unreliable form. We present AQQUCN, a QA system that\ngracefully combines KG and corpus evidence. AQQUCN accepts a broad spectrum of\nquery syntax, between well-formed questions to short `telegraphic' keyword\nsequences. In the face of inherent query ambiguities, AQQUCN aggregates signals\nfrom KGs and large corpora to directly rank KG entities, rather than commit to\none semantic interpretation of the query. AQQUCN models the ideal\ninterpretation as an unobservable or latent variable. Interpretations and\ncandidate entity responses are scored as pairs, by combining signals from\nmultiple convolutional networks that operate collectively on the query, KG and\ncorpus. On four public query workloads, amounting to over 8,000 queries with\ndiverse query syntax, we see 5--16% absolute improvement in mean average\nprecision (MAP), compared to the entity ranking performance of recent systems.\nOur system is also competitive at entity set retrieval, almost doubling F1\nscores for challenging short queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 16:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 10:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

Essentially, the history effect\namounts to the acknowledgement that at any given time the mass flux across the\nbubble is conditioned by the preceding time-history of the concentration at the\nbubble boundary. Considering the canonical problem of an isolated spherical\nbubble at rest, we show that the contribution of the history effect in the\ncurrent interfacial concentration gradient is fully contained within a memory\nintegral of the interface concentration.

To study the physical characteristics of the dust, we\nmake use of archival data from ATLASGAL, Herschel, and MSX, while the ionized\ngas was studied making use of NVSS data.

To investigate the stellar cluster\n[BDS2003]6 we use IR spectroscopic data obtained with the ARCoIRIS\nspectrograph, and new available IR Ks band observations from VVVX survey. The\nnew ASTE observations allowed the molecular gas component in the velocity range\nfrom 30 km/s to 46 km/s, associated with Sh2-39, to be studied in detail. We\nhave identified four molecular clumps, that were likely formed by the expansion\nof the ionization front, and determined some of their physical and dynamical\nproperties. Clumps having HCO+ and 870 micron counterparts show evidence of\ngravitational collapse. We identified several candidate YSOs across the\nmolecular component. Their spatial distribution, as well as the fragmentation\ntime derived for the collected layers of the molecular gas, suggest that\nmassive star formation might have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula\nvia the collect and collapse mechanism. The spectroscopical distance obtained\nfor the stellar cluster [BDS2003]6, placed over one of the collapsing clumps,\nreveals that this cluster is physically associated with the neabula and gives\nmore support to the triggered massive star formation scenario. A radio\ncontinuum data analysis indicates that the nebula is older and expands at lower\nvelocity than typical Galactic IR bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 18:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Visuospatial\nskills are attained by observing spatial relationships among objects through\ndemonstrations. The proposed Visuospatial Skill Learning (VSL) is a goal-based\napproach that focuses on achieving a desired goal configuration of objects\nrelative to one another while maintaining the sequence of operations. VSL is\ncapable of learning and generalizing multi-operation skills from a single\ndemonstration, while requiring minimum prior knowledge about the objects and\nthe environment. In contrast to many existing approaches, VSL offers\nsimplicity, efficiency and user-friendly human-robot interaction. We also show\nthat VSL can be easily extended towards 3D object manipulation tasks, simply by\nemploying point cloud processing techniques. In addition, a robot learning\nframework, VSL-SP, is proposed by integrating VSL, Imitation Learning, and a\nconventional planning method. In VSL-SP, the sequence of performed actions are\nlearned using VSL, while the sensorimotor skills are learned using a\nconventional trajectory-based learning approach. such integration easily\nextends robot capabilities to novel situations, even by users without\nprogramming ability. In VSL-SP the internal planner of VSL is integrated with\nan existing action-level symbolic planner. Using the underlying constraints of\nthe task and extracted symbolic predicates, identified by VSL, symbolic\nrepresentation of the task is updated. Therefore the planner maintains a\ngeneralized representation of each skill as a reusable action, which can be\nused in planning and performed independently during the learning phase. The\nproposed approach is validated through several real-world experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 18:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

The performance of these primitives is central\nto the overall performance of succinct data structures.\n  Traditionally, the select operation is the harder to implement efficiently,\nand most prior implementations of select on machine words use 50--80 machine\ninstructions. (In contrast, rank on machine words can be implemented in only a\nhandful of instructions on machines that support POPCOUNT.) However, recently\nPandey et al. gave a new implementation of machine-word select that uses only\nfour x86 machine instructions; two of which were introduced in Intel's Haswell\nCPUs.\n  In this paper, we investigate the impact of this new implementation of\nmachine-word select on the performance of general bit-vector-select.

In contrast to the homojunction APDs, no trap-induced shifts were\nobserved for the heterostructure APDs. A gain of 12 was demonstrated for\nselective optical excitation of the InAsP segment. Additional electron\nbeam-induced current measurements were carried out to investigate the effect of\nlocal excitation along the nanowire on the I-V characteristics.

Various applications for electronic\ndevices are closely related to their thermal transport properties. In this\nwork, the strain dependence of phonon transport in monolayer SiC with a perfect\nplanar hexagonal honeycomb structure is investigated by solving the linearized\nphonon Boltzmann equation. It is found that room-temperature lattice thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa_L$) of monolayer SiC is two orders of magnitude lower\nthan that of graphene. The low $\\kappa_L$ is due to small group velocities and\nshort phonon lifetimes, which can also be explained by polarized covalent bond\ndue to large charge transfer from Si to C atoms. In considered strain range, it\nis proved that the SiC monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable. With\nincreased tensile strain, the $\\kappa_L$ of SiC monolayer shows an unusual\nnonmonotonic up-and-down behavior, which is due to the competition between the\nchange of phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of low frequency phonon\nmodes. At low strains ($<$8\\%), the phonon lifetimes enhancement induces the\nincreased $\\kappa_L$, while at high strains ($>$8\\%) the reduction of group\nvelocities as well as the decrease of the phonon lifetimes are the major\nmechanism responsible for decreased $\\kappa_L$.

However, when working with stochastic\nprocesses in the space of bounded functions and their weak convergence in the\nHoffmann-J{\\o}rgensen sense, an obstacle occurs: due to possible\nnon-measurability, neither laws nor conditional laws are well-defined. Starting\nfrom an equivalent formulation of weak convergence based on the bounded\nLipschitz metric, a classical circumvent is to formulate bootstrap consistency\nin terms of the latter distance between what might be called a\n\\emph{conditional law} of the (non-measurable) bootstrap process and the law of\nthe limiting process. The main contribution of this note is to provide an\nequivalent formulation of bootstrap consistency in the space of bounded\nfunctions which is more intuitive and easy to work with. Essentially, the\nequivalent formulation consists of (unconditional) weak convergence of the\noriginal process jointly with two bootstrap replicates. As a by-product, we\nprovide two equivalent formulations of bootstrap consistency for statistics\ntaking values in separable metric spaces: the first in terms of (unconditional)\nweak convergence of the statistic jointly with its bootstrap replicates, the\nsecond in terms of convergence in probability of the empirical distribution\nfunction of the bootstrap replicates.

In this work, we aim to automatically\nrender aging faces in a personalized way. Basically, for each age group, we\nlearn an aging dictionary to reveal its aging characteristics (e.g., wrinkles),\nwhere the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from two\nneighboring aging dictionaries form a particular aging pattern cross these two\nage groups, and a linear combination of all these patterns expresses a\nparticular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into\nconsideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging\ndictionaries, each person may have extra personalized facial characteristics,\ne.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging\nor even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular person,\nyet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age\ngroups. To this end, we propose a novel Bi-level Dictionary Learning based\nPersonalized Age Progression (BDL-PAP) method. Here, bi-level dictionary\nlearning is formulated to learn the aging dictionaries based on face pairs from\nneighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages\nof the proposed BDL-PAP over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized\nage progression, as well as the performance gain for cross-age face\nverification by synthesizing aging faces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2017 07:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

Separate energy and data buffers are kept at the relay to store the\nharvested energy and decoded data packets, respectively. In this paper, we\noptimize a time switching policy that switches between the EH mode and DD mode\nto maximize the system throughput or minimize the average transmission delay.\nBoth static and dynamic time switching policies are derived. In particular,\nstatic policies are the ones where EH or DD mode is selected with a\npre-determined probability. In contrast, in a dynamic policy, the mode is\nselected dynamically according to the states of data and energy buffers. We\nprove that the throughput-optimal static and dynamic policies keep the relay\ndata buffer at the boundary of stability. More specifically, we show that the\nthroughput-optimal dynamic policy has a threshold-based structure. Moreover, we\nprove that the delay-optimal dynamic policy also has a threshold-based\nstructure and keeps at most one packet at the relay. We notice that the\ndelay-optimal and throughput-optimal dynamic policies coincide in most cases.\nHowever, it is not true for optimal static policies.

Recently, strong\ninterest has emerged in Join-the-Idle-Queue (JIQ) algorithms, which rely on\ntokens issued by idle servers in dispatching tasks and outperform power-of-$d$\npolicies. Specifically, JIQ strategies involve minimal information exchange,\nand yet achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit. The latter\nproperty prevails in a multiple-dispatcher scenario when the loads are strictly\nequal among dispatchers. For various reasons it is not uncommon however for\nskewed load patterns to occur. We leverage product-form representations and\nfluid limits to establish that the blocking and wait then no longer vanish,\neven for arbitrarily low overall load. Remarkably, it is the least-loaded\ndispatcher that throttles tokens and leaves idle servers stranded, thus acting\nas bottleneck.\n  Motivated by the above issues, we introduce two enhancements of the ordinary\nJIQ scheme where tokens are either distributed non-uniformly or occasionally\nexchanged among the various dispatchers.

However, computing PPR is\ninfeasible for large networks like Twitter, so efficient estimation algorithms\nare necessary.\n  In this work, we analyze the relationship between PPR estimation complexity\nand clustering. First, we devise algorithms to estimate PPR for many\nsource/target pairs. In particular, we propose an enhanced version of the\nexisting single pair estimator $\\texttt{Bidirectional-PPR}$ that is more useful\nas a primitive for many pair estimation. We then show that the common\nunderlying graph can be leveraged to efficiently and jointly estimate PPR for\nmany pairs, rather than treating each pair separately using the primitive\nalgorithm. Next, we show the complexity of our joint estimation scheme relates\nclosely to the degree of clustering among the sources and targets at hand,\nindicating that estimating PPR for many pairs is easier when clustering occurs.\nFinally, we consider estimating PPR when several machines are available for\nparallel computation, devising a method that leverages our clustering findings,\nspecifically the quantities computed $\\textit{in situ}$, to assign tasks to\nmachines in a manner that reduces computation time.
