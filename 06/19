The sparest one among\nthese solutions is significant in many applications. This problem can be\nmodeled as the $l_0$-minimization, However, to find the sparsest solution of an\nunderdetermined linear equations is NP-hard. Therefore, an important approach\nto solve the following $l_p$-minimization ($0<p\\leq1$), The purpose of this\nproblem is to find a $p$-norm minimization solution $(0<p\\leq1)$ instead of the\nsparest one.\n  In order to study the equivalence relationship between $l_0$-minimization and\n$l_p$-minimization, most of related work adopt Restricted Isometry Property\n(RIP) and Restricted Isometry Constant (RIC). On the premise of RIP and RIC,\nthose work only solve the situation when the solution $\\breve{x}$ of\n$l_0$-minimization satisfies that $\\|\\breve{x}\\|_0<k$ where $k$ is a known\nfixed constant with $k<\\frac{spark(A)}{2}$. One of the results in this paper is\nto give an analytic expression $p^*$ such that $l_p$-minimization is equivalent\nto $l_0$-minimization for every $\\|\\breve{x}\\|_0<\\frac{spark(A)}{2}$.\n  In this paper, we also consider the case where the matrix $A$ is a\nVandermonde matrix and we present an analytic expression $p^*$ such that the\nsolution of $l_p$-minimization also solve $l_0$-minimization. Compared with the\nsimilar results based on RIP and RIC, we do not need the uniqueness assumption,\ni.e., the solution $x^*$ of $l_0$-minimization do not have to be assumed to be\nthe unique solution which is the main breakthrough in our result. Another\nsuperiority of our result is its computability, i.e., each part in the analytic\nexpression can be easily calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 17:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 00:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

All three schemes evolve the state of a neuron through a\nseries of checkpoints: equally spaced in the first scheme and determined\nneuron-wise by spike events in the latter two. The time-driven and the hybrid\nscheme determine whether the membrane potential of a neuron crosses a threshold\nat the end of of the time interval between consecutive checkpoints. Threshold\ncrossing can, however, occur within the interval even if this test is negative.\nSpikes can therefore be missed. The present work derives, implements, and\nbenchmarks a method for perfect retrospective spike detection. This method can\nbe applied to neuron models with affine or linear subthreshold dynamics. The\nidea behind the method is to propagate the threshold with a time-inverted\ndynamics, testing whether the threshold crosses the neuron state to be evolved,\nrather than vice versa. Algebraically this translates into a set of\ninequalities necessary and sufficient for threshold crossing. This test is\nslower than the imperfect one, but faster than an alternative perfect tests\nbased on bisection or root-finding methods. Comparison confirms earlier results\nthat the imperfect test rarely misses spikes (less than a fraction $1/10^8$ of\nmissed spikes) in biologically relevant settings.

Over time, \"the fittest wins\"\nand becomes the dominant architecture until the environment (workload) changes.\nIn our initial prototype, we demonstrate solutions that can seamlessly evolve\n(back and forth) between a key-value store and a column-store architecture in\norder to adapt to changing workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 20:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

One of the main challenges in training\nthese networks is data imbalance, which is particularly problematic in medical\nimaging applications such as lesion segmentation where the number of lesion\nvoxels is often much lower than the number of non-lesion voxels. Training with\nunbalanced data can lead to predictions that are severely biased towards high\nprecision but low recall (sensitivity), which is undesired especially in\nmedical applications where false negatives are much less tolerable than false\npositives. Several methods have been proposed to deal with this problem\nincluding balanced sampling, two step training, sample re-weighting, and\nsimilarity loss functions.

In order to be applicable for high temperatures, line lists for\nmolecules like methane must contain billions of transitions, which makes their\ndirect (line-by-line) application in radiative transfer calculations\nimpracticable. Here we suggest a new, hybrid line list format to mitigate this\nproblem, based on the idea of temperature-dependent absorption continuum.\n  The line list is partitioned into a large set of relatively weak lines and a\nsmall set of important, stronger lines. The weaker lines are then used either\nto construct a temperature-dependent (but pressure-independent) set of\nintensity cross sections or are blended into a greatly reduced set of\nsuper-lines. The strong lines are kept in the form of temperature independent\nEinstein A coefficients.\n  A line list for methane is constructed as a combination of 17 million strong\nabsorption lines relative to the reference absorption spectra and a background\nmethane continuum in two temperature-dependent forms, of cross sections and\nsuper-lines. This approach eases the use of large high temperature line lists\nsignificantly as the computationally expensive calculation of pressure\ndependent profiles only need to be performed for a relatively small number of\nlines. Both the line list and cross sections were generated using a new 34\nbillion methane line list (34to10), which extends the 10to10 line list to\nhigher temperatures (up to 2000 K). The new hybrid scheme can be applied to any\nlarge line lists containing billions of transitions. We recommend to use\nsuper-lines generated on a high resolution grid based on resolving power (R =\n1,000,000) to model the molecular continuum as a more flexible alternative to\nthe temperature dependent cross sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 20:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In light nuclei, the mechanism has been discussed in terms of shell\neffects associated with occupations of s-orbits. The objective of this work is\nto reveal mechanisms behind the formation of central depression in nucleonic\ndensities in light and heavy nuclei. We introduce several measures of the\ninternal nucleonic density. Through the statistical analysis, we study the\ninformation content of these measures with respect to nuclear matter\nproperties. We apply nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme functionals.\nUsing the statistical tools of linear least square regression, we inspect\ncorrelations between various measures of central depression and model\nparameters, including nuclear matter properties.

We have to\nobserve and model the vector magnetic field to understand the structures and\nphysical mechanisms of these solar activities. Vector magnetic fields on the\nphotosphere are routinely observed via the polarized light, and inferred with\nthe inversion of Stokes profiles. To analyze these vector magnetic fields, we\nneed first to remove the 180$^\\circ$ ambiguity of the transverse components and\ncorrect the projection effect. Then, the vector magnetic field can be served as\nthe boundary conditions for a force-free field modeling after a proper\npreprocessing. The photospheric velocity field can also be derived from a time\nsequence of vector magnetic fields. Three-dimensional magnetic field could be\nderived and studied with theoretical force-free field models, numerical\nnonlinear force-free field models, magnetohydrostatic models, and\nmagnetohydrodynamic models. Magnetic energy can be computed with\nthree-dimensional magnetic field models or a time series of vector magnetic\nfield. The magnetic topology is analyzed by pinpointing the positions of\nmagnetic null points, bald patches, and quasi-separatrix layers. As a well\nconserved physical quantity, magnetic helicity can be computed with various\nmethods, such as the finite volume method, discrete flux tube method, and\nhelicity flux integration method. This quantity serves as a promising parameter\ncharacterizing the activity level of solar active regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 03:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The destination keeps track of the system status through the\nreceived updates. We use the metric Age of Information (AoI), the time that has\nelapsed since the last received update was generated, to measure the\n\"freshness\" of the status information available at the destination. We assume\nenergy arrives randomly at the sensor according to a Poisson process, and each\nstatus update consumes one unit of energy. Our objective is to design optimal\nonline status update policies to minimize the long-term average AoI, subject to\nthe energy causality constraint at the sensor. We consider three scenarios,\ni.e., the battery size is infinite, finite, and one unit only, respectively.\n  For the infinite battery scenario, we adopt a best-effort uniform status\nupdate policy and show that it minimizes the long-term average AoI. For the\nfinite battery scenario, we adopt an energy-aware adaptive status update\npolicy, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the battery size goes\nto infinity. For the last scenario where the battery size is one, we first show\nthat within a broadly defined class of online policies, the optimal policy\nshould have a renewal structure, i.e., the status update epochs form a renewal\nprocess, and the length of each renewal interval depends on the first energy\narrival over that interval only. We then focus on a renewal interval, and prove\nthat if the AoI in the system is below a threshold when the first energy\narrives, the sensor should store the energy and hold status update until the\nAoI reaches the threshold, otherwise, it updates the status immediately. We\nanalytically characterize the long-term average AoI under such a\nthreshold-based policy, and explicitly identify the optimal threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 03:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 19:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

We aim to determine which of the known\nplanetary systems are dynamically capable of hosting rocky planets in their\nhabitable zones, with the goal of helping to focus future planet search\nprograms. We perform an extensive suite of numerical simulations to identify\nregions in the habitable zones of single Jovian planet systems where Earth mass\nplanets could maintain stable orbits, specifically focusing on the systems in\nthe Catalog of Earth-like Exoplanet Survey Targets (CELESTA). We find that\nsmall, Earth-mass planets can maintain stable orbits in cases where the\nhabitable zone is largely, or partially, unperturbed by a nearby Jovian, and\nthat mutual gravitational interactions and resonant mechanisms are capable of\nproducing stable orbits even in habitable zones that are significantly or\ncompletely disrupted by a Jovian. Our results yield a list of 13 single Jovian\nplanet systems in CELESTA that are not only capable of supporting an Earth-mass\nplanet on stable orbits in their habitable zone, but for which we are also able\nto constrain the orbits of the Earth-mass planet such that the induced radial\nvelocity signals would be detectable with next generation instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

Along these lines we suggest a framework for proving\nconditional lower bounds based on the well-known 3SUM conjecture. Our framework\ncreates a \\emph{compact representation} of an instance of the 3SUM problem\nusing hashing and domain specific encoding. This compact representation admits\nfalse solutions to the original 3SUM problem instance which we reveal and\neliminate until we find a true solution. In other words, from all\n\\emph{witnesses} (candidate solutions) we figure out if an \\emph{honest} one (a\ntrue solution) exists. This enumeration of witnesses is used to prove\nconditional lower bound on \\emph{reporting} problems that generate all\nwitnesses. In turn, these reporting problems are reduced to various decision\nproblems. These help to enumerate the witnesses by constructing appropriate\nsearch data structures. Hence, 3SUM-hardness of the decision problems is\ndeduced.\n  We utilize this framework to show conditional lower bounds for several\nvariants of convolutions, matrix multiplication and string problems. Our\nframework uses a strong connection between all of these problems and the\nability to find \\emph{witnesses}.\n  While these specific applications are used to demonstrate the techniques of\nour framework, we believe that this novel framework is useful for many other\nproblems as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

Coupling these improvements with careful\ntuning of our integrator, the time per accepted trajectory in the production of\nour 2+1 flavor $G$-parity ensembles with physical pion and kaon masses has been\ndecreased by a factor of 4.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 09:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 22:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

A useful technique for showing such lower bounds is to prove them\nconditionally based on well-studied hardness assumptions such as 3SUM, APSP,\nSETH, etc. This line of research helps to obtain a better understanding of the\ncomplexity inside P.\n  A related question asks to prove conditional space lower bounds on data\nstructures that are constructed to solve certain algorithmic tasks after an\ninitial preprocessing stage. This question received little attention in\nprevious research even though it has potential strong impact.\n  In this paper we address this question and show that surprisingly many of the\nwell-studied hard problems that are known to have conditional polynomial time\nlower bounds are also hard when concerning space. This hardness is shown as a\ntradeoff between the space consumed by the data structure and the time needed\nto answer queries. The tradeoff may be either smooth or admit one or more\nsingularity points.\n  We reveal interesting connections between different space hardness\nconjectures and present matching upper bounds. We also apply these hardness\nconjectures to both static and dynamic problems and prove their conditional\nspace hardness.\n  We believe that this novel framework of polynomial space conjectures can play\nan important role in expressing polynomial space lower bounds of many important\nalgorithmic problems.

These\nmethods work fine for a large slip length coefficient but lead to conditioning\nand stability issues when it approaches zero. We introduce a novel method for\nthe weak imposition of the generalized Navier condition which remains\nwell-posed and stable for arbitrary choice of slip length, including zero.

The analysis proves\nstability for all flow regimes and all choices of slip lengths. Also an\nL2-optimal estimate for the velocity error is shown, which was not conducted in\nthe previously mentioned work. A numerical example is carried out for varying\nslip lengths to verify the robustness and stability of the method with respect\nto the choice of slip length.

This equation involves a\nlogarithmic nonlinearity associated with an effective temperature and a source\nof dissipation. Fundamentally, this wave equation arises from the\nnondifferentiability of the trajectories of the dark matter particles whose\norigin may be due to ordinary quantum mechanics, classical ergodic (or almost\nergodic) chaos, or to the fractal nature of spacetime at the cosmic scale. The\ngeneralized Schr\\\"odinger equation involves a coefficient ${\\cal D}$, possibly\ndifferent from $\\hbar/2m$, whose value for dark matter halos is ${\\cal\nD}=1.02\\times 10^{23}\\, {\\rm m^2/s}$. We suggest that the cold dark matter\ncrisis may be solved by the fractal (nondifferentiable) structure of spacetime\nat the cosmic scale, or by the chaotic motion of the particles on a very long\ntimescale, instead of ordinary quantum mechanics. The equilibrium states of the\ngeneralized Schr\\\"odinger equation correspond to configurations with a\ncore-halo structure. The quantumlike potential generates a solitonic core that\nsolves the cusp problem of the classical cold dark matter model. The\nlogarithmic nonlinearity accounts for the presence of an isothermal halo that\nleads to flat rotation curves. The damping term ensures that the system relaxes\ntowards an equilibrium state. This property is guaranteed by an $H$-theorem\nsatisfied by a Boltzmann-like free energy functional. In our approach, the\ntemperature and the friction arise from a single formalism.

Problems like k-SAT can be viewed as\nspecial cases of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which is the\nproblem of determining whether a set of constraints is satisfiable. In this\npaper we study thef worst-case time complexity of NP-complete CSPs. Our main\ninterest is in the CSP problem parameterized by a constraint language Gamma\n(CSP(Gamma)), and how the choice of Gamma affects the time complexity. It is\nbelieved that CSP(Gamma) is either tractable or NP-complete, and the algebraic\nCSP dichotomy conjecture gives a sharp delineation of these two classes based\non algebraic properties of constraint languages. Under this conjecture and the\nETH, we first rule out the existence of subexponential algorithms for\nfinite-domain NP-complete CSP(Gamma) problems. This result also extends to\ncertain infinite-domain CSPs and structurally restricted CSP(Gamma) problems.\nWe then begin a study of the complexity of NP-complete CSPs where one is\nallowed to arbitrarily restrict the values of individual variables, which is a\nvery well-studied subclass of CSPs. For such CSPs with finite domain D, we\nidentify a relation SD such that (1) CSP({SD}) is NP-complete and (2) if\nCSP(Gamma) over D is NP-complete and solvable in O(c^n) time, then CSP({SD}) is\nsolvable in O(c^n) time, too. Hence, the time complexity of CSP({SD}) is a\nlower bound for all CSPs of this particular kind. We also prove that the\ncomplexity of CSP({SD}) is decreasing when |D| increases, unless the ETH is\nfalse. This implies, for instance, that for every c>1 there exists a\nfinite-domain Gamma such that CSP(Gamma) is NP-complete and solvable in O(c^n)\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 12:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

For the Boolean satisfiability problem\n(SAT), and the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), there exist many results\nconcerning upper and lower bounds for kernelizability of specific problems, but\nit is safe to say that we lack general methods to determine whether a given SAT\nproblem admits a kernel of a particular size. This could be contrasted to the\ncurrently flourishing research program of determining the classical complexity\nof finite-domain CSP problems, where almost all non-trivial tractable classes\nhave been identified with the help of algebraic properties. In this paper, we\ntake an algebraic approach to the problem of characterizing the kernelization\nlimits of NP-hard SAT and CSP problems, parameterized by the number of\nvariables. Our main focus is on problems admitting linear kernels, as has,\nsomewhat surprisingly, previously been shown to exist. We show that a CSP\nproblem has a kernel with O(n) constraints if it can be embedded (via a domain\nextension) into a CSP problem which is preserved by a Maltsev operation. We\nalso study extensions of this towards SAT and CSP problems with kernels with\nO(n^c) constraints, c>1, based on embeddings into CSP problems preserved by a\nk-edge operation, k > c. These results follow via a variant of the celebrated\nfew subpowers algorithm. In the complementary direction, we give indication\nthat the Maltsev condition might be a complete characterization of SAT problems\nwith linear kernels, by showing that an algebraic condition that is shared by\nall problems with a Maltsev embedding is also necessary for the existence of a\nlinear kernel unless NP is included in co-NP/poly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

This weakly supervised object localisation problem\nhas been tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object\nclass is localised independently from other classes. In this paper, a novel\nframework based on Bayesian joint topic modelling is proposed, which differs\nsignificantly from the existing ones in that: (1) All foreground object classes\nare modelled jointly in a single generative model that encodes multiple object\nco-existence so that \"explaining away\" inference can resolve ambiguity and lead\nto better learning and localisation. (2) Image backgrounds are shared across\nclasses to better learn varying surroundings and \"push out\" objects of\ninterest. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly labelled and\nunlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on the Internet\nto be exploited for learning. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation enables the\nexploitation of various types of prior knowledge to compensate for the limited\nsupervision offered by weakly labelled data, as well as Bayesian domain\nadaptation for transfer learning. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC,\nImageNet and YouTube-Object videos datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour Bayesian joint model for weakly supervised object localisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The motor is\ntailored for use in millimeter-wave half-wave plate (HWP) polarimeters, where a\nHWP is rapidly rotated in front of a polarization analyzer or\npolarization-sensitive detector. This polarimetry technique is commonly used in\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization studies. The SMB we use is\ncomposed of fourteen yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) disks and a contiguous\nneodymium iron boron (NdFeB) ring magnet. The motor is a hollow-shaft motor\nbecause the HWP is ultimately installed in the rotor. The motor presented here\nhas a 100 mm diameter rotor aperture. However, the design can be scaled up to\nrotor aperture diameters of approximately 500 mm. Our motor system is composed\nof four primary subsystems: (i) the rotor assembly, which includes the NdFeB\nring magnet, (ii) the stator assembly, which includes the YBCO disks, (iii) an\nincremental encoder, and (iv) the drive electronics. While the YBCO is cooling\nthrough its superconducting transition, the rotor is held above the stator by a\nnovel hold and release mechanism (HRM). The encoder subsystem consists of a\ncustom-built encoder disk read out by two fiber optic readout sensors. For the\ndemonstration described in this paper, we ran the motor at 50 K and tested\nrotation frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz. The feedback system was able to\nstabilize the the rotation speed to approximately 0.4%, and the measured rotor\norientation angle uncertainty is less than 0.15 deg. Lower temperature\noperation will require additional development activities, which we will\ndiscuss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 14:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 02:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 15:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

The proof parallels the derivation of the latter, with the\nbeta-beta bounds used in place of the golden formula.\n  The beta-beta (achievability) bound is also shown to be useful in cases where\nthe capacity-achieving output distribution is not a product distribution due\nto, e.g., a cost constraint or structural constraints on the codebook, such as\northogonality or constant composition.

Many optimizations depend on the data that is being\nprocessed. Software-based microarchitectural attacks exploit effects of these\noptimizations. Microarchitectural side-channel attacks leak secrets from\ncryptographic computations, from general purpose computations, or from the\nkernel. This leakage even persists across all common isolation boundaries, such\nas processes, containers, and virtual machines. Microarchitectural fault\nattacks exploit the physical imperfections of modern computer systems.\nShrinking process technology introduces effects between isolated hardware\nelements that can be exploited by attackers to take control of the entire\nsystem. These attacks are especially interesting in scenarios where the\nattacker is unprivileged or even sandboxed.\n  In this thesis, we focus on microarchitectural attacks and defenses on\ncommodity systems. We investigate known and new side channels and show that\nmicroarchitectural attacks can be fully automated. Furthermore, we show that\nthese attacks can be mounted in highly restricted environments such as\nsandboxed JavaScript code in websites.

We study parametric estimators of the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) derived from a widely used class of latent\nthreshold crossing models and show they yield LATE estimates algebraically\nequivalent to the instrumental variables (IV) estimator. Our leading example is\nHeckman's (1979) two-step (\"Heckit\") control function estimator which, with\ntwo-sided non-compliance, can be used to compute estimates of a variety of\ncausal parameters. Equivalence with IV is established for a semi-parametric\nfamily of control function estimators and shown to hold at interior solutions\nfor a class of maximum likelihood estimators. Our results suggest differences\nbetween structural and IV estimates often stem from disagreements about the\ntarget parameter rather than from functional form assumptions per se. In cases\nwhere equivalence fails, reporting structural estimates of LATE alongside IV\nprovides a simple means of assessing the credibility of structural\nextrapolation exercises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 14:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 04:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 01:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 23:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) that\nstabilizes skyrmions is an anti-symmetric exchange interaction favoring\nnon-collinear orientation of neighboring spins. It has been shown that material\nsystems with high DMI can lead to very efficient domain wall and skyrmion\nmotion by spin-orbit torques. To engineer such devices, it is important to\nquantify the DMI for a given material system. Here we extract the DMI at the\nHeavy Metal (HM) /Ferromagnet (FM) interface using two complementary\nmeasurement schemes namely asymmetric domain wall motion and the magnetic\nstripe annihilation. By using the two different measurement schemes, we find\nfor W(5 nm)/Co20Fe60B20(0.6 nm)/MgO(2 nm) the DMI to be 0.68 +/- 0.05 mJ/m2 and\n0.73 +/- 0.5 mJ/m2, respectively. Furthermore, we show that this DMI stabilizes\nskyrmions at room temperature and that there is a strong dependence of the DMI\non the relative composition of the CoFeB alloy. Finally we optimize the layers\nand the interfaces using different growth conditions and demonstrate that a\nhigher deposition rate leads to a more uniform film with reduced pinning and\nskyrmions that can be manipulated by Spin-Orbit Torques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 14:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

This paper presents and compares several\nstabilized versions of the communication-hiding pipelined Conjugate Gradients\nmethod.

When fluidised materials\nflow down an incline, the dynamics of the motion differ from their\nnon-fluidised counterparts because the granular agitation is no longer required\nto support the weight of the flowing layer. Instead, the weight is borne by the\nimposed gas flow and this leads to a greatly increased flow mobility. In this\npaper, a framework is developed to model this two phase motion by incorporating\na kinetic theory description for the particulate stresses generated by the\nflow. In addition to calculating numerical solutions for fully developed flows,\nit is shown that for sufficiently thick flows there is often a local balance\nbetween the production and dissipation of the granular temperature. This\nphenomenon permits an asymptotic reduction of the full governing equations and\nthe identification of a simple state in which the volume fraction of the flow\nis uniform. The results of the model are compared with new experimental\nmeasurements of the internal velocity profiles of steady granular flows down\nslopes. The distance covered with time by unsteady granular flows down slopes\nand along horizontal surfaces and their shapes are also measured and compared\nwith theoretical predictions developed for flows that are thin relative to\ntheir streamwise extent. For the horizontal flows, it was found that resistance\nfrom the sidewalls was required in addition to basal resistance to capture\naccurately the unsteady evolution of the front position and the depth of the\ncurrent and for situations in which side-wall drag dominates, similarity\nsolutions are found for the experimentally-measured motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 14:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Therefore, it is challenging to apply\nSDN ideas in the context of mobile networks. In this paper, we propose methods\nto overcome these challenges and make SDN more suitable for the mobile\nenvironment. Our main idea is to combine centralized SDN and distributed\ncontrol in a hybrid design that takes the best of the two paradigms; (i) global\nnetwork view and control programmability of SDN and (ii) robustness of\ndistributed protocols.

Recursively, currently active nodes\ncan activate their neighbours according to a probability distribution on the\nset of edges.

These calculated reaction cross-sections are\ncorrelated with the different target groups of the NED nuclei. The average\nvalue of various parameters are also calculated and compared with the\ncorresponding experimental results. The number of shower particles emitted in\nan interaction is also calculated and showed good agreement with the\nexperimental result. We observed that the total reaction cross-section\nincreases with increasing the target mass number in case of all the considered\nprojectiles. In addition, it shows that the average value of reaction\ncross-section with nuclear medium effect is in good agreement with the\nexperimental results for projectiles 56^Fe, 84^Kr, 132^Xe, although results of\nprojectiles 197^Au and 238^U are not in agreement with the experimental\nobservations. This study sheds some light on the energy dependence of the\nnuclear reaction cross-section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 06:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

The smoothed square well form becomes\nexactly zero smoothly at a finite distance, in contrast to the Woods-Saxon\nform. If the smoothing range is four times the diffuseness of the Woods-Saxon\nshape both the central and the spin-orbit terms of the Woods-Saxon shape are\nreproduced reasonably well. The bound single particle energies in a Woods-Saxon\npotential can be well reproduced with those in the smoothed square well\npotential. The same is true for the complex energies of the narrow resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 11:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Novel methods of cassava disease detection are\nneeded to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image\nrecognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease\ndetection. New transfer learning methods offer an avenue for this technology to\nbe easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images\ntaken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep\nconvolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest\ndamage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown\nleaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage\n(GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic\ndisease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not\nused in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning\napproach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and\neasily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 15:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 19:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Recent\nadvances in information and communications technology (ICT) have led to\nunprecedented improvements in such areas as mobile handheld devices (i.e.,\nsmartphones), the electric power industry (i.e., smart grids), transportation\ninfrastructure, and vehicle area networks. Given the trend towards\ninterconnectivity, it is only a matter of time before vehicles communicate with\none another and with infrastructure. In fact, several pilots of such\nvehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (e.g. traffic lights and\nparking spaces) communication systems are already operational. This survey of\nautonomous and self-organized traffic signaling control has been undertaken\nwith these potential developments in mind. Our research results indicate that,\nwhile many sophisticated techniques have attempted to improve the scheduling of\ntraffic signal control, either real-time sensing of traffic patterns or a\npriori knowledge of traffic flow is required to optimize traffic. Once this is\nachieved, communication between traffic signals will serve to vastly improve\noverall traffic efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 21:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}
