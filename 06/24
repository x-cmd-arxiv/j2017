The MBI system models nonlinear\nelectromagnetism and does not display birefringence. The key element in our\nproof lies in the observation that there exists a first-order differential\ntransformation which brings solutions of the spin $\\pm 1$ Teukolsky equations,\nsatisfied by the extreme components of the field, into solutions of a \"good\"\nequation (the Fackerell-Ipser Equation).

We show that all important system parameters, i.e., the\nemitter-field detuning and the coupling strength of the emitter to the mode,\ncan be tuned over a wide range. Remarkably, assuming realistic experimental\nconditions, our approach allows one to explore the regimes of ultra-strong\ncoupling, deep strong coupling, and dispersive deep strong coupling. The states\nof the bosonic mode and the TLS can be prepared and read out using standard\ncold-atom techniques. Moreover, we show that our scheme enables the\nimplementation of important generalizations, namely, the driven QRM, the QRM\nwith quadratic coupling as well as the case of many TLSs coupled to one mode\n(Dicke model). The proposed cold-atom based implementation will facilitate\nexperimental studies of a series of phenomena predicted for the QRM in extreme,\nso far unexplored physical regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the\nbinary eccentricity and initial disk orientation) for the disk to evolve toward\npolar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disk has a non-negligible\nangular momentum compared to the binary, the final \"polar alignment\"\ninclination angle is reduced from $90^\\circ$. For typical protoplanetary disk\nparameters, the timescale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disk\nlifetime, suggesting that highly-inclined disks and planets may exist orbiting\neccentric binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 18:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Offline social network topologies are typically\nestimated by surveying actors and asking them to list their neighbours. While\nidentifying close friends and family (i.e., strong ties) can typically be done\nreliably, listing all of one's acquaintances (i.e., weak ties) is subject to\nerror due to respondent fatigue. This issue is commonly circumvented through\nthe use of so-called \"fixed choice\" surveys where respondents are asked to name\na fixed, small number of their weak ties (e.g., two or ten). Of course, the\nresulting crude observed network will omit many ties, and using this crude\nnetwork to infer properties of the network, such as its degree distribution or\nclustering coefficient, will lead to biased estimates. This paper develops\nestimators, based on the method of moments, for a number of network\ncharacteristics including those related to the first and second moments of the\ndegree distribution as well as the network size, using fixed-choice survey\ndata. Experiments with simulated data illustrate that the proposed estimators\nperform well across a variety of network topologies and measurement scenarios,\nand the resulting estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained\ndirectly using the crude observed network, which are commonly used in the\nliterature.

The goal\nof each problem is to minimize the aggregate cost of the individual travelers'\npaths and the shared route under various constraints.

Our proposed\nmethod achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it,\neffectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima)\nwhich can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a\nsmaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This\nsimplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve\nas good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed\ngraph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of\nlevels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the\noriginal graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the\nstate-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk,\nLINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical\nparadigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as\nevaluated on both classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP,\nBlogCatalog, CiteSeer, and Arxiv, where we achieve a performance gain over the\noriginal implementations by up to 14% Macro F1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 19:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 18:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

For fully-connected layers LM's performance\nscales inversely proportionally with the precision of the weights. LM targets\narea- and bandwidth-constrained System-on-a-Chip designs such as those found on\nmobile devices that cannot afford the multi-megabyte buffers that would be\nneeded to store each layer on-chip. Accordingly, given a data bandwidth budget,\nLM boosts energy efficiency and performance over an equivalent bit-parallel\naccelerator.

As with 21cm data, the forest has the advantage of spectral\ninformation, potentially yielding many lensed \"slices\" at different redshifts.\nWe perform an illustrative idealized test, generating a high resolution angular\ngrid of quasars (of order arcminute separation), and lensing the\nLyman-alphaforest spectra at redshifts z=2-3 using a foreground density field.\nWe find that standard quadratic estimators can be used to reconstruct images of\nthe foreground mass distribution at z~1.

We detected activity cycles in 67 stars. Secondary cycles\nwere also detected in 32 stars. The lack of correlation between $P_{ cyc}$ and\n$P_{ rot}$ suggest that these stars belong to the Transitional Branch and that\nthe dynamo acting in these stars is different from the solar one. This\nstatement is also supported by the analysis of the butterfly diagrams.\n  We computed the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_{ S}$ between $P_{ cyc}$,\n<IQR> and different stellar parameters. We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is\nuncorrelated with all the investigated parameters. The <IQR> index is\npositively correlated with the convective turn-over time-scale, the magnetic\ndiffusivity time-scale $\\tau_{ diff}$, and the dynamo number $D_{ N}$, whereas\nit is anti-correlated with the effective temperature $T_{ eff}$, the\nphotometric shear $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm phot}$ and the radius $R_{ C}$ at which\nthe convective zone is located.\n  We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is about constant and that <IQR> decreases with the\nstellare age in the range 4-95 Myr. We investigated the magnetic activity of AB\nDor A by merging ASAS time-series with previous long-term photometric data. We\nestimated the length of the AB Dor A primary cycle as $P_{ cyc} = 16.78 \\pm 2\n\\rm yr$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 10:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

More recently, autoencoders have proven their strength in\nvarious scenarios, playing a fundamental role in unsupervised learning. In this\npaper, we instigate how to exploit the semantic information encoded in a\nknowledge graph to build connections between units in a Neural Network, thus\nleading to a new method, SEM-AUTO, to extract and weigh semantic features that\ncan eventually be used to build a recommender system. As adding content-based\nside information may mitigate the cold user problems, we tested how our\napproach behave in the presence of a few rating from a user on the Movielens 1M\ndataset and compare results with BPRSLIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 13:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 17:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

The reason is that\nthe region is unresolved and the reverberation mapping results imply complex\nvelocity field. We adopt a theory-motivated approach to identify the principal\nmechanism responsible for this complex phenomenon. We consider the possibility\nthat the role of dust is essential. We assume that the local radiation pressure\nacting on the dust in the accretion disk atmosphere launches the outflow of\nmaterial, but higher above the disk the irradiation from the central parts\ncause the dust evaporation and a subsequent fall back. This failed radiatively\naccelerated dusty outflow (FRADO) is expected to represent the material forming\nlow ionization lines. In this paper we formulate simple analytical equations\ndescribing the cloud motion, including the evaporation phase. The model is\nfully described just by the basic parameters: black hole mass, accretion rate,\nblack hole spin and the viewing angle. We study how the spectral line generic\nprofiles correspond to this dynamics. We show that the virial factor calculated\nfrom our model strongly depends on the black hole mass in case of enhanced dust\nopacity, and thus it then correlates with the line width. This could explain\nwhy the virial factor measured in galaxies with pseudo-bulges differs from that\nobtained from objects with classical bulges although the trend predicted by the\ncurrent version of the model is opposite to the observed trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 13:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 08:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

For example, the game Pok\\'emon GO spread rapidly because of\nthe aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information\npropagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is\na dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our\nmodel in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or\nIC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world\nnetworks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a\nmean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of\nmacroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's\nbehavior with the curiosity.

The results indicate that the\ncuriosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with\nthe spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial\nnetworks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the\nmaximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition\npoint. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and\nideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling.\nOur results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion\nprocess and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 15:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

As a first step, and following the\nguidelines of the existing literature, we use the supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) data to model the wind turbine power curve (WTPC). We\nexplore various parametric and non-parametric approaches for the modeling of\nthe WTPC, such as parametric logistic functions, and non-parametric piecewise\nlinear, polynomial, or cubic spline interpolation functions.

We further enhance the accuracy of our proposed model, by incorporating\nadditional environmental factors that affect the power output, such as the\nambient temperature, and the wind direction.
