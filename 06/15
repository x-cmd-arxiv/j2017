Implementing the\nuniversal boundary conditions at the GUT scale we target phenomenologically\ninteresting regions of UMSSM where the necessary radiative contributions to the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson mass are significantly small and LSP is always the\nlightest neutralino. We find that the smallest amount of radiative\ncontributions is about 50 GeV in UMSSM, this result is much lower than that\nobtained in MSSM, which is around 90 GeV. Additionally, we examine the Higgs\nboson properties in these models to check if it can behave similar to the SM\nHiggs boson under the current experimental constraints. We find that\nenforcement of smaller radiative contribution mostly restricts the U(1)'\nbreaking scale as v_S <~ 10 TeV. Besides, such low contributions demand h_S ~\n0.2 - 0.45. Because of the model dependency in realizing these radiative\ncontributions theta_E_6 < 0 are more favored, if one seeks for the solutions\nconsistent with the current dark matter constraints. As to the mass spectrum,\nwe find that stop and stau can be degenerate with the LSP neutralino in the\nrange from 300 GeV to 700 GeV; however, the dark matter constraints restrict\nthis scale as m_stop, m_stau >~ 500$ GeV. Such degenerate solutions also\npredict stop-neutralino and stau-neutralino coannihilation channels, which are\neffective to reduce the relic abundance of neutralino down to the ranges\nconsistent with the current dark matter observations. Finally, we discuss the\neffects of heavy M_Z' in the fine-tuning. Even though the radiative\ncontributions are significantly low, the required fine-tuning can still be\nlarge. We comment about reinterpretation of the fine-tuning measure in the\nUMSSM framework, which can yield efficiently low results for the fine-tuning at\nthe electroweak scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 16:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

However, this dynamic language\nfeature imposes significant challenges to static analysis, because the\nbehaviour of reflection-rich software is logically complex and statically hard\nto predict, especially when manipulated frequently by statically unknown string\nvalues. As a result, existing static analysis tools either ignore reflection or\nhandle it partially, resulting in missed, important behaviours, i.e., unsound\nresults. Therefore, improving or even achieving soundness in (static)\nreflection analysis -- an analysis that infers statically the behaviour of\nreflective code -- will provide significant benefits to many analysis clients,\nsuch as bug detectors, security analyzers and program verifiers.

It also has practical\nsignificance for identifying information processing tasks for which those\nphenomena provide a quantum advantage. Using the framework of generalized\nnoncontextuality as our notion of classicality, we find one such nonclassical\nfeature within the phenomenology of quantum minimum error state discrimination.\nNamely, we identify quantitative limits on the success probability for minimum\nerror state discrimination in any experiment described by a noncontextual\nontological model. These constraints constitute noncontextuality inequalities\nthat are violated by quantum theory, and this violation implies a quantum\nadvantage for state discrimination relative to noncontextual models.\nFurthermore, our noncontextuality inequalities are robust to noise and are\noperationally formulated, so that any experimental violation of the\ninequalities is a witness of contextuality, independently of the validity of\nquantum theory. Along the way, we introduce new methods for analyzing\nnoncontextuality scenarios, and demonstrate a tight connection between our\nminimum error state discrimination scenario and a Bell scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 17:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 20:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

The key idea is that models such as CNNs can be learned from the\nnoisy visual data available on the web. In this work we aim to exploit web data\nfor video understanding tasks such as action recognition and detection. One of\nthe main problems in webly-supervised learning is cleaning the noisy labeled\ndata from the web. The state-of-the-art paradigm relies on training a first\nclassifier on noisy data that is then used to clean the remaining dataset. Our\nkey insight is that this procedure biases the second classifier towards samples\nthat the first one understands. Here we train two independent CNNs, a RGB\nnetwork on web images and video frames and a second network using temporal\ninformation from optical flow. We show that training the networks independently\nis vastly superior to selecting the frames for the flow classifier by using our\nRGB network. Moreover, we show benefits in enriching the training set with\ndifferent data sources from heterogeneous public web databases. We demonstrate\nthat our framework outperforms all other webly-supervised methods on two public\nbenchmarks, UCF-101 and Thumos'14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 17:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

The\nsimulated striations develop within a dense, stagnated sheet in the mid plane\nof the post-shock region where magnetically-induced converging flows collide.\nWe show analytically that the secondary flows are an inevitable consequence of\nthe jump conditions of oblique MHD shocks. They produce the stagnated,\nsheet-like sub-layer through a secondary shock when, roughly speaking, the\nAlfv\\'enic speed in the primary converging flows is supersonic, a condition\nthat is relatively easy to satisfy in interstellar clouds. The dense sub-layer\nis naturally threaded by a strong magnetic field that lies close to the plane\nof the sub-layer. The substantial magnetic field makes the sheet highly\nanisotropic, which is the key to the striation formation. Specifically,\nperturbations of the primary inflow that vary spatially perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field can easily roll up the sheet around the field lines without\nbending them, creating corrugations that appear as magnetically-aligned\nstriations in column density maps. On the other hand, perturbations that vary\nspatially along the field lines curve the sub-layer and alter its orientation\nrelative to the magnetic field locally, seeding special locations that become\nslanted overdense filaments and prestellar cores through enhanced mass\naccumulation along field lines. In our scenario, the dense sub-layer unique to\nmagnetized oblique shocks is the birthplace for both magnetically-aligned\ndiffuse striations and massive star-forming structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We can constrain the strength of the new gravitational\nterms through observations of inflationary imprints in the actual universe. In\nthis paper we analyze the effects on slow-roll models due to a Chern-Simons\nterm coupled to the inflaton field through a generic coupling function\n$f(\\phi)$. A well known result is the polarization of primordial gravitational\nwaves (PGW) into left and right eigenstates, as a consequence of parity\nbreaking. In such a scenario the modifications to the power spectrum of PGW are\nsuppressed under the conditions that allow to avoid the production of ghost\ngravitons at a certain energy scale, the so-called Chern-Simons mass $M_{CS}$.\nIn general it has been recently pointed out that there is very little hope to\nefficiently constrain chirality of PGW on the basis solely of two-point\nstatistics from future CMB data, even in the most optimistic cases. Thus we\nsearch if significant parity breaking signatures can arise at least in the\nbispectrum statistics. We find that the tensor-tensor-scalar bispectra $\\langle\n\\gamma \\gamma \\zeta \\rangle$ for each polarization state are the only ones that\nare not suppressed. Their amplitude, setting the level of parity breaking\nduring inflation, is proportional to the second derivative of the coupling\nfunction $f(\\phi)$ and they turn out to be maximum in the squeezed limit.

This Letter shows that adopting a\ndifferent spectral slope can result in an order of magnitude difference in the\ninferred CGM metallicity. Specifically, a harder UVB spectrum leads to a higher\nestimated gas metallicity for a given set of observed ionic column densities .\nTherefore, such systematic uncertainties must be folded into the error budget\nfor metallicity estimates of ionized gas.

The training sensor data is generated in simulation, a major\nadvantage over previous work that uses real robot experience, which is costly\nto obtain. Despite being trained in simulation, our approach works well on real\nnoisy sensor images. We compare our controller in simulated and real robot\nexperiments to a strong baseline for grasp pose detection, and find that our\napproach significantly outperforms the baseline in the presence of kinematic\nnoise, perceptual errors and disturbances of the object during grasping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 19:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 21:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 20:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Many of these violations can be\nattributed to the electromagnetic interaction but the question of how much of\nthe violation is due to it remains open. A schematic model based on clustering\nof quarks in the interior of the confinement region of the two-nucleon system\nis introduced and evaluated. In this model the Coulomb interaction is the\nsource of all isospin breaking. It draws on a picture of the quark density\nbased on the diquark-quark model of hadron structure which has been\ninvestigated by a number of groups. The model produces three isospin breaking\npotentials connecting This illustrative model suggests that the breaking seen\nin the low-energy NN interaction may be understood in terms of the Coulomb\nforce between members of diquark clusters. It allows the prediction of the\ncharge symmetry breaking interaction and the $nn$ scattering length from the\nwell measured $np$ singlet scattering length. Values of the $nn$ scattering\nlength around $-18$ fm are favored. Since the model is based on the quark\npicture, it can be easily extended, in the SU(3) limit, to calculate isospin\nbreaking in the strange sector in the corresponding channels. A natural\nconsequence of isospin breaking from diquark clustering is that the breaking in\nthe strange sector, as measured by the separation energy difference between\n$_{\\Lambda}^4$H and $_{\\Lambda}^4$He, is several times larger than that seen in\nthe comparison of three-nucleon mirror nuclei as observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 21:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The dominant stratospheric products are CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$,\nwhich are relatively stable photochemically. Model-data comparisons suggest\nthat interplanetary dust grains deliver an important component of the external\noxygen to Jupiter and Uranus but fall far short of the amount needed to explain\nthe CO abundance currently seen in the middle stratospheres of Saturn and\nNeptune. Our results are consistent with the theory that all of the giant\nplanets have experienced large cometary impacts within the last few hundred\nyears. Our results also suggest that the low background H$_2$O abundance in\nJupiter's stratosphere is indicative of effective conversion of meteoric oxygen\nto CO during or immediately after the ablation process -- photochemistry alone\ncannot efficiently convert the H$_2$O into CO on the giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 22:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Moreover, it is not separated\nfrom the rest of the cell by a membrane. Nevertheless, it occupies only a small\nfraction of the cell called the nucleoid. The mechanisms leading to such\ncompaction are the matter of ongoing debates. The present work aims at\nexploring a newly proposed mechanism, according to which the formation of the\nnucleoid would result from the demixing of the DNA and non-binding globular\nmacromolecules of the cytoplasm, like ribosomes. To this end, a coarse-grained\nmodel of prokaryotic cells was developed and demixing was analyzed as a\nfunction of the size and number of crowders. The model suggests that compaction\nof the DNA is actually governed by the volume occupancy ratio of the crowders\nand remains weak almost up to the jamming critical density. Strong compaction\nis however observed just before jamming, suggesting that crowding and\nelectrostatic repulsion work synergetically in this limit. Finally, simulations\nperformed with crowders with different sizes indicate that the DNA and the\nlargest crowders demix preferentially. Together with the recent observation of\nthe gradual compaction of long DNA molecules upon increase of the concentration\nof BSA proteins and silica nanoparticles, this work supports the demixing\nmechanism as a key player for the formation of the nucleoid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 06:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The basic idea is to iteratively replace the original\n(non-convex, highly dimensional) learning problem with a sequence of (strongly\nconvex) approximations, which are both accurate and simple to optimize.\nDifferently from similar ideas (e.g., quasi-Newton algorithms), the\napproximations can be constructed using only first-order information of the\nneural network function, in a stochastic fashion, while exploiting the overall\nstructure of the learning problem for a faster convergence. We discuss several\nuse cases, based on different choices for the loss function (e.g., squared loss\nand cross-entropy loss), and for the regularization of the NN's weights.

This assumes that\nthe observed PAH features are excited predominantly by SF. With current\nground-based telescopes and the upcoming JWST, much smaller spatial scales can\nbe probed and we aim at testing this assumption in the range of few tens to few\nhundreds of pc. For that, we spatially map the emitted 11.3{\\mu}m PAH surface\nflux as a function of distance from 0.4-4 arcsec from the centre in 28 nearby\nAGN using ground-based high-angular resolution mid-IR spectroscopy. We detect\nand extract the 11.3{\\mu}m PAH feature in 13 AGN. The fluxes within each\naperture are scaled to a luminosity-normalised distance from the nucleus to be\nable to compare intrinsic spatial scales of AGN radiation spanning about 2\norders of magnitude in luminosity. For this, we establish an empirical relation\nbetween the absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity and the sublimation radius in\nthese sources. Once normalised, the radial profiles of the emitted PAH surface\nflux show similar radial slopes, with a power-law index of approximately -1.1,\nand similar absolute values, consistent within a factor of a few of each other\nas expected from the uncertainty in the intrinsic scale estimate. We interpret\nthis as evidence that the profiles are caused by a common compact central\nphysical process, either the AGN itself or circumnuclear SF linked in strength\nto the AGN power. A photoionisation-based model of an AGN exciting dense clouds\nin its environment can reproduce the observed radial slope and confirms that\nthe AGN radiation field is strong enough to explain the observed PAH surface\nfluxes within ~10-500 pc of the nucleus. Our results advice caution in the use\nof PAH emission as a SF tracer within a kpc around AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 10:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

In this work we report efficient four-wave mixing over micron-scale\ninteraction lengths at telecoms wavelengths. We use an integrated plasmonic gap\nwaveguide on silicon that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic\npolymer in the gap. Our approach is so effective because the gap waveguide\nintensifies light by efficiently nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a\nfew tens of nanometres, generating a nonlinear response so strong that\nefficient four-wave mixing accumulates in just a micron.

Rutile CrO$_2$ is a half-metallic spintronic material\nwith Curie temperature 394 K and can have nearly-full spin polarization at room\ntemperature. Here, we find through first-principles investigation that when a\nbiaxial compressive stress is applied on rutile CrO$_2$, the density of states\nat the Fermi level decreases with the in-plane compressive strain, there is a\nstructural phase transition to an orthorhombic phase at the strain of -5.6\\%,\nand then appears an electronic phase transition to a semiconductor phase at\n-6.1\\%. Further analysis shows that this structural transition, accompanying\nthe tetragonal symmetry breaking, is induced by the stress-driven distortion\nand rotation of the oxygen octahedron of Cr, and the half-metal-semiconductor\ntransition originates from the enhancement of the crystal field splitting due\nto the structural change. Importantly, our systematic total-energy comparison\nindicates the ferromagnetic Curie temperature remains almost independent of the\nstrain, near 400 K. This biaxial stress can be realized by applying biaxial\npressure or growing the CrO$_2$ epitaxially on appropriate substrates.

On the smaller domain the Fourier series exhibits redundancy, and\nit has the mathematical structure of a frame rather than a basis. It is not\ntrivial to construct approximations in this frame using function evaluations in\npoints that belong to the domain only, but one way to do so is through a\ndiscrete least squares approximation. The corresponding system is extremely\nill-conditioned, due to the redundancy in the frame, yet its solution via a\nregularized SVD is known to be accurate to very high (and nearly spectral)\nprecision. Still, this computation requires ${\\mathcal O}(N^3)$ operations.

The cost improves to ${\\mathcal O}(N \\log^2N)$ operations for simpler\ntensor-product domains.

We show that the fluorescence enhancement due to the coupling between\noptical emitter and sphere can be tuned by the aspect ratio of the core-shell\nnanosphere and by the distance between the quantum emitter and its surface. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that both the enhancement and quenching of the\nfluorescence intensity are associated with plasmonic Fano resonances induced by\nnear- and far-field interactions. These Fano resonances have asymmetry\nparameters whose signs depend on the orientation of the dipole with respect to\nthe spherical nanoshell. We also show that if the atomic dipole is oriented\ntangentially to the nanoshell, the interaction exhibits saddle points in the\nnear-field energy flow. This results in a Lorentzian fluorescence enhancement\nresponse in the near field and a Fano line-shape in the far field. The\nsignatures of this interaction may have interesting applications for sensing\nthe presence and the orientation of optical emitters in close proximity to\nplasmonic nanoshells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 13:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 21:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

This paper introduces Sobolev\nTraining for neural networks, which is a method for incorporating these target\nderivatives in addition the to target values while training.

However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for\nassembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid\ncore, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate\nbudding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions,\nas well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a\ntransition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed\nbudding which occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions.\nThe simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to\nsignificantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This\npolydispersity can be qualitatively explained by a theoretical model accounting\nfor the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein\nshell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads\nto a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially\nbudded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of\nbudded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could\nestablish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid\ninteractions.

The energy-resolved\nlight curve, the time-resolved X-ray spectra provided by the EPIC cameras on\nboard and the first high-resolution spectrum of this source, provided by the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer, were analysed. An X-ray pulse of $9350\\pm 160$\ns was measured, confirming the secular spin up of this source. We also fit the\npulse-phase-resolved spectra with Comptonisation models. These models imply a\nvery small ($r\\sim 3$ km) and hot ($kT\\sim 2-3$ keV) emitting region and\ntherefore point to a hot spot over the neutron star (NS) surface as the most\nreliable explanation for the X-ray pulse.

Thus, 4U 0114$+$65 could be a wind-accreting\nmagnetar. We also observed two episodes of low luminosity.

The light curve displays two types of dips seen during the\nhigh-flux intervals. The short dips, with durations of tens of seconds, are\nproduced through absorption by wind clumps.

In the first case, even energy levels\n(pertaining to antisymmetric bound states) remain invariant with $\\lambda$\nalthough odd energy levels (pertaining to symmetric bound states) decrease as\n$\\lambda$ increases. In the second, all energy levels decrease when the form\nfactor $\\lambda$ increases. A similar study has been performed for the so\ncalled nonlocal $\\delta'$ interaction, requiring a coupling constant\nrenormalization, which implies the replacement of the form factor $\\lambda$ by\na renormalized form factor $\\beta$. In terms of $\\beta$, even energy levels are\nunchanged. However, we show the existence of level crossings: after a fixed\nvalue of $\\beta$ the energy of each odd level, with the natural exception of\nthe first one, becomes lower than the constant energy of the previous even\nlevel. Finally, we consider an interaction of the type\n$-a\\delta(x)+b\\delta'(x)$, and analyse in detail the discrete spectrum of the\nresulting self-adjoint Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 15:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

An important consideration in using\nsimulated MCMC draws for inference is that the sampling algorithm has converged\nto the distribution of interest. Since the distribution is typically of a\nnon-standard form, convergence cannot generally be proven and, instead, is\nassessed with convergence diagnostics. Although parameters used in the MCMC\nframework are typically continuous, there are many situations in which\nsimulating a categorical variable is desired.

Traditional convergence diagnostics are designed\nfor continuous variables and may be inappropriate for categorical variables. In\nthis paper two convergence diagnostic methods are considered which are\nappropriate for MCMC data. The diagnostics discussed in the paper utilize\nchi-squared test statistics for dependent data. Performance of the convergence\ndiagnostics is evaluated under various simulations.

To improve TL\nparameter estimates, various algorithms have been proposed in the past to\nidentify TL parameters based on measurements from Phasor Measurement Units\n(PMUs). These methods are based on the positive sequence TL models and can\ngenerate accurate positive sequence impedance parameters for a fully-transposed\nTL when measurement noise is absent; however these methods may generate\nerroneous parameters when the TLs are not fully transposed or when measurement\nnoise is present. PMU field-measure data are often corrupted with noise and\nthis noise is problematic for all parameter identification algorithms,\nparticularly so when applied to short transmission lines. This paper analyzes\nthe limitations of the positive sequence TL model when used for parameter\nestimation of TLs that are untransposed and proposes a novel method using\nlinear estimation theory to identify TL parameters more reliably. This method\ncan be used for the most general case: short or long lines that are fully\ntransposed or untransposed and have balanced or unbalance loads. Besides the\npositive or negative sequence impedance parameters, the proposed method can\nalso be used to estimate the zero sequence parameters and the mutual impedances\nbetween different sequences. This paper also examines the influence of noise in\nthe PMU data on the calculation of TL parameters. Several case studies are\nconducted based on simulated data from ATP to validate the effectiveness of the\nnew method. Through comparison of the results generated by this novel method\nand several other methods, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 04:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The effects found can be used to support self-management.\n  We demonstrate the practical usefulness of AIRA by performing analysis on\nlongitudinal self-reported data about psychological variables. To evaluate its\neffectiveness and efficacy, we ran its algorithms on two data sets ($N=4$ and\n$N=5$), and discuss the results. Furthermore, we compare AIRA's output to the\nresults of a previously published study and show that the results are\ncomparable. By automating Impulse Response Function Analysis, AIRA fulfills the\nneed for accurate individualized models of health outcomes at a low resource\ncost with the potential for upscaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

This is achieved by inserting a\nzero thickness metasurface inside bulk nodes of the Yee-cell region, giving\nrise to three distinct cell configurations - Symmetric Cell (SC), Asymmetric\nCell (AC) and Tight Asymmetric Cell (TAC). In addition, the metasurface is\nmodelled using electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities exhibiting a\nbroadband Lorentzian response. As a result, the proposed model guarantees a\nphysical and causal response from the metasurface. Several full- wave results\nare shown, and compared with analytical Fourier propagation methods showing\nexcellent results, for both 1D and 2D fields simulations. It is found that the\nTAC provides the fastest convergence among the three methods with minimum\nerror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 23:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

The\nbioavailability of these drugs can be increased by formulating these drugs as\nan amorphous drug delivery system. Use of porous media like mesoporous silica\nhas been investigated as a potential means to increase the solubility of poorly\nsoluble drugs and to stabilize the amorphous drug delivery system. These\nmaterials have nanosized capillaries and the large surface area which enable\nthe materials to accommodate high drug loading and promote the controlled and\nfast release. Therefore, mesoporous silica has been used as a carrier in the\nsolid dispersion to form an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). Mesoporous silica\nis also being used as an adsorbent in a conventional solid dispersion, which\nhas many useful aspects. This review focuses on the use of mesoporous silica in\nASD as potential means to increase the dissolution rate and to provide or\nincrease the stability of the ASD. First, an overview of mesoporous silica and\nthe classification is discussed. Subsequently, methods of drug incorporation,\nthe stability of dispersion and, much more are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 13:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}
