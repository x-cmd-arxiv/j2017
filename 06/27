The bottleneck has been the ability to adiabatically\ndrive an electron coherently across a large portion of the Brillouin zone in a\nsolid where the scattering is strong and complicated. We break through this\nbottleneck and show that high-order sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors\nis intimately affected by Berry phases. Electron-hole recollisions and HSG\noccur when a near-band gap laser beam excites a semiconductor that is driven by\nsufficiently strong terahertz (THz)-frequency electric fields. We carried out\nexperimental and theoretical studies of HSG from three GaAs/AlGaAs quantum\nwells. The observed HSG spectra contain sidebands up to the 90th order, to our\nknowledge the highest-order optical nonlinearity observed in solids. The\nhighest-order sidebands are associated with electron-hole pairs driven\ncoherently across roughly 10% of the Brillouin zone around the \\Gamma point.\nThe principal experimental claim is a dynamical birefringence: the sidebands,\nwhen the order is high enough (> 20), are usually stronger when the exciting\nnear-infrared (NIR) and the THz electric fields are polarized perpendicular\nthan parallel; the sideband intensities depend on the angles between the THz\nfield and the crystal axes in samples with sufficiently weak quenched disorder;\nand the sidebands exhibit significant ellipticity that increases with\nincreasing sideband order, despite nearly linear excitation and driving fields.\nWe explain dynamical birefringence by generalizing the three-step model for\nhigh order harmonic generation. The hole accumulates Berry phases due to\nvariation of its internal state as the quasi-momentum changes under the THz\nfield. Dynamical birefringence arises from quantum interference between\ntime-reversed pairs of electron-hole recollision pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

For model-theoretic\nlogics there is a standard framework of relative expressiveness, based on the\ncapacity of characterizing structures, and a straightforward formal criterion\nissuing from it. The problem is that it only allows the comparison of those\nlogics defined within the same class of models. The urge for a broader\nframework of expressiveness is not new.

Further, we obtain a hyperbolic monodomain model in the case that\nthe intracellular and extracellular conductivity tensors have the same\nanisotropy ratio. In one spatial dimension, the hyperbolic monodomain model is\nequivalent to a cable model that includes axial inductances, and the relaxation\ntimes of the Cattaneo fluxes are strictly related to these inductances. A\npurely linear analysis shows that the inductances are negligible, but models of\ncardiac electrophysiology are highly nonlinear, and linear predictions may not\ncapture the fully nonlinear dynamics. In fact, contrary to the linear analysis,\nwe show that for simple nonlinear ionic models, an increase in conduction\nvelocity is obtained for small and moderate values of the relaxation time.

As a\nresult, galaxies on the MS can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram\nwhile still forming stars. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to\nretrieve the SFR of galaxies from SED fitting is studied. Due to mathematical\nlimitations, the exp-declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR which\nstarts to be problematic at z>2. The exp-rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the\nopposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model\nstarburst galaxies, but not low values such as those expected at low redshift\nfor massive galaxies. We show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR\nof MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are,\nhowever, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS but\nall the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies.

This gradient is also produced on real\ndata, using a sample of GOODS-South galaxies at 1.5<z<1.2.

This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR\nof MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all z.

We explore here this new phenomenology for which we\ndevise the tools. We calculate the effective dark matter distribution resulting\nfrom the smearing by mediator propagation. We derive the fluxes of mediators\nand their decay particles. We study how the $J$-factor, which naturally appears\nin the calculation of the dark matter induced gamma ray signal, is modified in\nthe presence of mediators. We also derive the anisotropy which the cosmic ray\npositron flux exhibits in this scenario. We finally comment upon a recent\nproposal based on long-lived mediators where the effective dark matter density\nat the Earth is increased such as to explain the cosmic ray positron anomaly.\nWe conclude that this scenario is barely tenable as regards the very dense dark\nmatter spike which it requires at the Galactic center. The associated positron\nanisotropy is very small and undetectable, except at high energies where it\nreaches a level of order $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 18:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 16:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 10:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

This task is inherently linked to estimating the system's\nunderlying causal structure.

When\nconsidering linear models, the implementation of ICP is relatively\nstraightforward. However, the nonlinear case is more challenging due to the\ndifficulty of performing nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In\nthis work, we present and evaluate an array of methods for nonlinear and\nnonparametric versions of ICP for learning the causal parents of given target\nvariables. We find that an approach which first fits a nonlinear model with\ndata pooled over all environments and then tests for differences between the\nresidual distributions across environments is quite robust across a large\nvariety of simulation settings. We call this procedure \"invariant residual\ndistribution test\". In general, we observe that the performance of all\napproaches is critically dependent on the true (unknown) causal structure and\nit becomes challenging to achieve high power if the parental set includes more\nthan two variables.

The model\nemploys an utility function as in the the MNL, and a dominance relation between\nproducts. When consumers are offered an assortmentS , they first discard all\ndominated products in S and then select one of the remaining products using the\nstandard MNL. This model may violate the regularity condition, which states\nthat the probability of choosing a product cannot increase if the offer set is\nenlarged. Therefore, the 2SLM falls outside the large family of discrete choice\nmodels based on random utility which contains almost all choice models studied\nin revenue management. We prove that the assortment problem under the 2SLM is\npolynomial-time solvable. Moreover, we show that the capacitated assortment\noptimization problem is NP-hard and but it admits polynomial-time algorithms\nfor the relevant special cases cases where (1) the dominance relation is\nattractiveness-correlated and (2) its transitive reduction is a forest. The\nproofs exploit a strong connection between assortments under the 2SLM and\nindependent sets in comparability graphs. Finally, we study the associated\njoint pricing and assortment problem under this model. First, we show that well\nknown optimal pricing policy for the MNL can be arbitrarily bad. Our main\nresult in this section is the development of an efficient algorithm for this\npricing problem. The resulting optimal pricing strategy is simple to describe:\nit assigns the same price for all products, except for the one with the highest\nattractiveness and as well as for the one with the lowest attractiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 21:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 04:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Starting\nwith the static equilibrium figure, modified to include tide and differential\nrotation, and using the Newtonian creep approach, we find the dynamical\nequilibrium figure of the deformed body, which allows us to calculate the tidal\npotential and the forces acting on the tide generating body, as well as the\nrotation and orbital elements variations. In the particular case of the\ntwo-layer model, we study the tidal synchronization when the gravitational\ncoupling and the friction in the interface between the layers is added. For\nhigh relaxation factors (low viscosity), the stationary solution of each layer\nis synchronous with the orbital mean motion (n) when the orbit is circular, but\nthe spin rates increase if the orbital eccentricity increases. For low\nrelaxation factors (high viscosity), as in planetary satellites, if friction\nremains low, each layer can be trapped in different spin-orbit resonances with\nfrequencies n/2,n,3n/2,... . We apply the theory to Titan.

This\nresult is further extended to related confined time-dependent oscillators in\nwhich the boundary's motion is known to give rise to geometric phases: for a\nGaussian state remaining localized far from the boundaries, the effect of the\ngeometric phases is washed out and the particle dynamics shows no traces of a\nnonlocal influence that would be induced by the moving boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 19:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 00:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Although most\ninvestigators believe that the geology indicates the presence of surface water,\ndisagreement has persisted regarding how warm and wet the surface must have\nbeen and how long such conditions may have existed. Although the geologic\nevidence is most easily explained by a persistently warm climate, the perceived\ndifficulty that climate models have in generating warm surface conditions has\nseeded various models that assume a cold and glaciated early Mars punctuated by\ntransient warming episodes. However, I use a single-column radiative-convective\nclimate model to show that it is relatively more straightforward to satisfy\nwarm and relatively unglaciated early Mars conditions, requiring only about 1\npercent H2 and 3 bar CO2 or about 20 percent H2 and 0.55 bar CO2. In contrast,\nthe reflectivity of surface ice greatly increases the difficulty to transiently\nwarm an initially frozen surface. Surface pressure thresholds required for warm\nconditions increase about 10 to 60 percent for transient warming models,\ndepending on ice cover fraction. No warm solution is possible for ice cover\nfractions exceeding 40, 70, and 85 percent for mixed snow and ice and 25, 35,\nand 49 percent for fresher snow and ice at H2 concentrations of 3, 10, and 20\npercent, respectively. If high temperatures (298 to 323 K) were required to\nproduce the observed surface clay amounts on a transiently warm early Mars\n(Bishop et al), I show that such temperatures would have required surface\npressures that exceed available paleopressure constraints for nearly all H2\nconcentrations considered (1 to 20 percent). I then argue that a warm and\nsemi-arid climate remains the simplest and most logical solution to Mars\npaleoclimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 01:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

In particular, finding more\nefficient ways to generate spin current has been an important issue and studied\nactively. For example, representative methods of spin current generation\ninclude spin polarized current injections from ferromagnetic metals, spin Hall\neffect, and spin battery. Here we theoretically propose a new mechanism of spin\ncurrent generation based on nonlinear phenomena. By using Boltzmann transport\ntheory, we show that a simple application of the electric field $\\bf{E}$\ninduces spin current proportional to $\\bf{E^2}$ in noncentrosymmetric\nspin-orbit coupled systems. We demonstrate that the nonlinear spin current of\nthe proposed mechanism is supported in the surface state of three-dimensional\ntopological insulators and two-dimensional semiconductors with the Rashba\nand/or Dresselhaus interaction. In the latter case, the angular dependence of\nthe nonlinear spin current can be manipulated by the direction of the electric\nfield and by the ratio of the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. We find that\nthe magnitude of the spin current largely exceeds those in the previous methods\nfor a reasonable magnitude of the electric field. Furthermore, we show that\napplication of AC electric fields (e.g. terahertz light) leads to the\nrectifying effect of the spin current where DC spin current is generated.

Deep\nlearning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in\nanalyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to\nechocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view,\nmulti modality format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer\nassisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can\nlearn to recognize standard views. To this end, we anonymized 834,267\ntransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51\npercent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them\naccording to standard views. Images covered a range of real world clinical\nvariation. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used\nsupervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty\npercent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved\nfor validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images\nfrom each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent\noverall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution\nimages, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5\npercent for board-certified echocardiographers. Confusional matrices, occlusion\nexperiments, and saliency mapping showed that the model finds recognizable\nsimilarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image\nfeatures. In conclusion, deep neural networks can classify essential\nechocardiographic views simultaneously and with high accuracy.

For Majorana fermions, only the anapole moment can be\nnonzero, a consequence of the fact that these particles are their own\nantiparticles. Using the framework of quantum field theory, we perform a\nscattering calculation which probes the anapole moment with a spinless charged\nparticle. In the limit of low-momentum transfer, we confirm that the anapole\ncan be classically likened to a point-like toroidal solenoid whose magnetic\nfield is confined to the origin. Such a toroidal current distribution can be\nused to demonstrate the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Queueing models\nwhich are widely used in operations management give us a mathematical\nrepresentation of the operational efforts needed to contain the spread of\ninfestation.

However, the\nDirac points in existing 2D materials, including graphene, are vulnerable\nagainst spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, based on first-principles calculations\nand theoretical analysis, we propose a new family of stable 2D materials, the\nHfGeTe-family monolayers, which represent the first example to host so-called\nspin-orbit Dirac points (SDPs) close to the Fermi level. These Dirac points are\nspecial in that they are formed only under significant SOC, hence they are\nintrinsically robust against SOC. We show that the existence of a pair of SDPs\nare dictated by the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry of the system, which are\nvery robust under various types of lattice strains. The energy, the dispersion,\nand the valley occupation around the Dirac points can be effectively tuned by\nstrain. We construct a low-energy effective model to characterize the Dirac\nfermions around the SDPs.

Recent work has\nshown that the shot noise in the halo power spectrum becomes increasingly\nsub-Poissonian at high mass. Interestingly, while the halo model predicts a\nshot noise power spectrum in qualitative agreement with the data, it leads to\nan unphysical white noise in the cross halo-matter and matter power spectrum.\nIn this work, we show that absorbing all the halo model sources of shot noise\ninto the halo fluctuation field leads to meaningful predictions for the shot\nnoise contributions to halo clustering statistics and remove the unphysical\nwhite noise from the cross halo-matter statistics. Our prescription\nstraightforwardly maps onto the general bias expansion, so that the\nrenormalized shot noise terms can be expressed as combinations of the halo\nmodel shot noises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Poissonian\ncontributions are related to volume integrals over correlation functions and\ntheir response to long-wavelength density perturbations. This leads to a new\nclass of consistency relations for discrete tracers, which appear to be\nsatisfied by our reformulation of the halo model.

Although there is an increasingly vast literature on\napplications, methods, theory and algorithms related to GPs, the overwhelming\nmajority of this literature focuses on the case in which the input domain\ncorresponds to a Euclidean space. However, particularly in recent years with\nthe increasing collection of complex data, it is commonly the case that the\ninput domain does not have such a simple form. For example, it is common for\nthe inputs to be restricted to a non-Euclidean manifold, a case which forms the\nmotivation for this article. In particular, we propose a general extrinsic\nframework for GP modeling on manifolds, which relies on embedding of the\nmanifold into a Euclidean space and then constructing extrinsic kernels for GPs\non their images. These extrinsic Gaussian processes (eGPs) are used as prior\ndistributions for unknown functions in Bayesian inferences.

Let\n$(S,m)$ be a finite area \\emph{nonorientable} hyperbolic surface. We show that\nthe set of measured laminations with a closed one--sided leaf has a peculiar\nstructure. As a consequence, the action of the mapping class group on the\nprojective space of measured laminations is not minimal.

Operating at the diffraction-limit, it is\nnotoriously difficult to efficiently couple such devices directly with large\ntelescopes. We demonstrate that with careful control of both the non-ideal\npupil geometry of a telescope and residual wavefront errors, efficient coupling\nwith single-mode devices can indeed be realised. A fibre injection was built\nwithin the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument.\nLight was coupled into a single-mode fibre operating in the near-IR (J-H bands)\nwhich was downstream of the extreme adaptive optics system and the pupil\napodising optics. A coupling efficiency of 86% of the theoretical maximum limit\nwas achieved at 1550 nm for a diffraction-limited beam in the laboratory, and\nwas linearly correlated with Strehl ratio. The coupling efficiency was constant\nto within <30% in the range 1250-1600 nm. Preliminary on-sky data with a Strehl\nratio of 60% in the H-band produced a coupling efficiency into a single-mode\nfibre of ~50%, consistent with expectations. The coupling was >40% for 84% of\nthe time and >50% for 41% of the time. The laboratory results allow us to\nforecast that extreme adaptive optics levels of correction (Strehl ratio >90%\nin H-band) would allow coupling of >67% (of the order of coupling to multimode\nfibres currently). For Strehl ratios <20%, few-port photonic lanterns become a\nsuperior choice but the signal-to-noise must be considered. These results\nillustrate a clear path to efficient on-sky coupling into a single-mode fibre,\nwhich could be used to realise modal-noise-free radial velocity machines,\nvery-long-baseline optical/near-IR interferometers and/or simply exploit\nphotonic technologies in future instrument design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 12:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 20:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

By approximating the Hessian\nof the cost and solving each iteration in an inexact manner, we are able to\nsolve each iteration with relatively low cost while still maintaining a fast\nconvergent rate. The core of the algorithm is solving a weighted Poisson\nequation, where different efficient preconditioners may be employed. We utilize\nincomplete Cholesky factorization, which yields an efficient and\nstraightforward solver for our problem. Several illustrative examples are\npresented for both the matrix and vector-valued cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 17:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Although electric dipoles are highly attractive\nto couple spin qubits electrically over long distances, mechanisms identified\nto control two-qubit couplings do not permit single-qubit operations while\ntwo-qubit couplings are off. Here we identify a mechanism to modulate\nelectrical coupling of spin qubits that overcomes this drawback for hole spin\nqubits in acceptors,that is based on the electrical tuning of the direction of\nthe spin-dependent electric dipole by a gate. In this way, inter-qubit coupling\ncan be turned off electrically by tuning to a \"magic angle\" of vanishing\nelectric dipole-dipole interactions, while retaining the ability to manipulate\nthe individual qubits. This effect stems from the interplay of the $\\rm T_d$\nsymmetry of the acceptor state in the Si lattice with the magnetic field\norientation, and the spin-3/2 characteristic of hole systems. Magnetic field\ndirection also allows to greatly suppress spin relaxation by phonons that limit\nsingle qubit performance, while retaining sweet spots where the qubits are\ninsensitive to charge noise.

The many possible navigation scenarios, as well\nas the interplay between signs and human navigation, can make the manual design\nprocess overwhelming and non-trivial. As a result, creating a wayfinding design\nfor a typical layout can take months to several years. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Way to Go! approach for automatically generating a wayfinding\ndesign for a given layout. The designer simply has to specify some navigation\nscenarios; our approach will automatically generate an optimized wayfinding\ndesign with signs properly placed considering human agents' visibility and\npossibility of making mistakes during a navigation. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in generating wayfinding designs for different\nlayouts such as a train station, a downtown and a canyon. We evaluate our\nresults by comparing different wayfinding designs and show that our optimized\nwayfinding design can guide pedestrians to their destinations effectively and\nefficiently.

The belief\npropagation algorithm and the cavity method are exploited to solve the model on\nthe sparse topology provided by Bethe lattices. It is found that the\ndiscretized version of the XY model, the so-called $Q$-state clock model,\nprovides a reliable and efficient proxy for the continuous model with an error\ngoing to zero exponentially in $Q$, so implying a remarkable speedup in\nnumerical simulations. Interesting results regard the low-temperature solution\nof the spin glass XY model, which is by far more unstable toward the replica\nsymmetry broken phase with respect to what happens in discrete models.\nMoreover, even the random field XY model with ferromagnetic couplings exhibits\na replica symmetry broken phase, at variance with both the fully connected\nversion of the same model and the diluted random field Ising model, as a\nfurther evidence of a more pronounced glassiness of the diluted XY model. Then,\nthe instabilities of the spin glass XY model in an external field are\ncharacterized, recognizing different critical lines according to the different\nsymmetries of the external field.

By transforming the single-particle\nHamiltonian into a corner-modified banded block-Toeplitz matrix, a key step is\na bipartition of the lattice, which splits the eigenvalue problem into a system\nof bulk and boundary equations. The eigensystem inherits most of its solutions\nfrom an auxiliary, infinite translation-invariant Hamiltonian that allows for\nnon-unitary representations of translation symmetry. A reformulation of the\nboundary equation in terms of a boundary matrix ensures compatibility with the\nboundary conditions, and determines the allowed energy eigenstates. We show how\nthe boundary matrix captures the interplay between bulk and boundary\nproperties, leading to efficient indicators of bulk-boundary correspondence.\nRemarkable consequences of our generalized Bloch theorem are the engineering of\nHamiltonians that host perfectly localized, robust zero-energy edge modes, and\nthe predicted emergence, e.g. in Kitaev's chain, of localized excitations whose\namplitudes decay exponentially with a power-law prefactor. We further show how\nthe theorem yields diagonalization algorithms for the class of Hamiltonians\nunder consideration, and use the proposed bulk-boundary indicator to\ncharacterize the topological response of a multi-band time-reversal invariant\ns-wave superconductor under twisted boundary conditions, showing how a\nfractional Josephson effect can occur without a fermionic parity switch.\nFinally, we establish connections to the transfer matrix method and\ndemonstrate, using the paradigmatic Kitaev's chain example, that a\nnon-diagonalizable transfer matrix signals the presence of solutions with a\npower-law prefactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

Infrared dark clouds represent the earliest stages of high-mass star\nformation. Detailed observations of their physical conditions on all physical\nscales are required to improve our understanding of their role in fueling star\nformation.\n  Methods. We investigate the large-scale structure of the IRDC G035.39-00.33,\nprobing the dense gas with the classical ammonia thermometer. This allows us to\nput reliable constraints on the temperature of the extended, pc-scale dense gas\nreservoir and to probe the magnitude of its non-thermal motions. Available\nfar-infrared observations can be used in tandem with the observed ammonia\nemission to estimate the total gas mass contained in G035.39-00.33.\n  Results. We identify a main velocity component as a prominent filament,\nmanifested as an ammonia emission intensity ridge spanning more than 6 pc,\nconsistent with the previous studies on the Northern part of the cloud. A\nnumber of additional line-of-sight components are found, and a large scale,\nlinear velocity gradient of ~0.2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is found along the ridge\nof the IRDC. In contrast to the dust temperature map, an ammonia-derived\nkinetic temperature map, presented for the entirety of the cloud, reveals local\ntemperature enhancements towards the massive protostellar cores. We show that\nwithout properly accounting for the line of sight contamination, the dust\ntemperature is 2-3 K larger than the gas temperature measured with NH$_3$.\n  Conclusions. While both the large scale kinematics and temperature structure\nare consistent with that of starless dark filaments, the kinetic gas\ntemperature profile on smaller scales is suggestive of tracing the heating\nmechanism coincident with the locations of massive protostellar cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

This status is known as\nquantum supremacy (or quantum advantage), where one of the promising approaches\nis through the sampling of chaotic quantum circuits. Sampling of ideal chaotic\nquantum circuits has been argued to require an exponential time for classical\ndevices. A major question is whether quantum supremacy can be maintained under\nnoise without error correction, as the implementation of fault-tolerance would\ncost lots of extra qubits and quantum gates. Here we show that, for a family of\nchaotic quantum circuits subject to Pauli errors, there exists an\nnon-exponential classical algorithm capable of simulating the noisy chaotic\nquantum circuits with bounded errors. This result represents a serious\nchallenge to a previous result in the literature suggesting the failure of\nclassical devices in simulating noisy chaotic circuits with about 48 qubits and\ndepth 25. Moreover, even though our model does not cover all types of\nexperimental errors, from a practical point view, our result describes a\nwell-defined setting where quantum supremacy can be tested against the\nchallenges of classical rivals, in the context of chaotic quantum circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}
