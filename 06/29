In this paper, we give a simple\nproof of the area law for entanglement entropy in one dimension under the\ncondition of exponentially decaying correlations. Our proof dramatically\nreduces the previously known bound on the entanglement entropy, bringing it,\nfor the first time, into a realistic regime.

This paper proposes a novel signaling scheme for\ngrant-free massive access, where each device encodes its identity and/or\ninformation in a sparse set of tones. Such transmissions are implemented in the\nform of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Under some mild\nconditions and assuming device delays to be bounded unknown multiples of symbol\nintervals, sparse OFDMA is proved to enable arbitrarily reliable asynchronous\ndevice identification and message decoding with a codelength that is O(K(log K\n+ log S + log N)), where N denotes the device population, K denotes the actual\nnumber of active devices, and log S is essentially equal to the number of bits\na device can send (including its identity). By exploiting the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT), the computational complexity for discovery and decoding can be\nmade to be sub-linear in the total device population. To prove the concept, a\nspecific design is proposed to identify up to 100 active devices out of\n$2^{38}$ possible devices with up to 20 symbols of delay and moderate\nsignal-to-noise ratios and fading.

Manual processes are not scalable, are prone to human\nerrors, and strain an already taxed healthcare workforce. This study introduces\nDECU (Deep Eye-CU): an autonomous mulitmodal multiview system, which addresses\nthese issues by autonomously monitoring healthcare environments and enabling\nthe recording and analysis of patient sleep poses and motion. DECU uses three\nRGB-D cameras to monitor patient motion in a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\nThe algorithms in DECU estimate pose direction at different temporal\nresolutions and use keyframes to efficiently represent pose transition\ndynamics. DECU combines deep features computed from the data with a modified\nversion of Hidden Markov Model to more flexibly model sleep pose duration,\nanalyze pose patterns, and summarize patient motion. Extensive experimental\nresults are presented. The performance of DECU is evaluated in ideal (BC:\nBright and Clear/occlusion-free) and natural (DO: Dark and Occluded) scenarios\nat two motion resolutions in a mock-up and a real ICU. The results indicate\nthat deep features allow DECU to match the classification performance of\nengineered features in BC scenes and increase the accuracy by up to 8% in DO\nscenes. In addition, the overall pose history summarization tracing accuracy\nshows an average detection rate of 85% in BC and of 76% in DO scenes.

This is\nproblematic, however, because single-atom active sites are extremely difficult\nto characterize with existing experimental techniques. Over the last 40 years,\nsurface science has provided the fundamental insights to understand\nheterogeneous catalysis, but model systems in which metal atoms are stable on\nwell-characterized metal-oxide substrates at reaction temperatures are scarce.\nIn this perspective, I discuss what is already known about isolated metal atoms\nadsorbed on model metal-oxide surfaces, and how this information can be used to\nunderstand SAC. A key issue is that, although the highly-idealised model\nsystems studied in surface science may not be representative of a real working\ncatalyst, they do very much resemble what can be calculated using\nstate-of-the-art theoretical modelling. Thus, surface science offers an\nopportunity to rigorously benchmark the theoretical approach to modelling SAC\nin future. Perhaps more excitingly, several groups have developed model systems\nwhere metal adatoms remain stable at elevated temperatures. To date however,\nthere has been no clear demonstration of catalytic activity. The perspective\ncloses with a brief discussion of the prospect for STM experiments under\nrealistic reaction conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 20:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

However, multi-modality treatment\npolicies are mostly empirical in current practice, and are therefore subject to\nindividual clinicians' experiences and intuition. We present a novel\nformulation of optimal multi-modality cancer management using a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process approach.

Achieving this goal will not only require\nsufficient detector array sensitivity but also unprecedented control of all\nsystematic errors inherent to CMB polarization measurements. Since polarization\nmeasurements derive from differences between observations at different times\nand from different sensors, detector response mismatches introduce leakages\nfrom intensity to polarization and thus lead to a spurious $B$ mode signal.\nBecause the expected primordial $B$ mode polarization signal is dwarfed by the\nknown unpolarized intensity signal, such leakages could contribute\nsubstantially to the final error budget for measuring $r.$ Using simulations we\nestimate the magnitude and angular spectrum of the spurious $B$ mode signal\nresulting from bandpass mismatch between different detectors. It is assumed\nhere that the detectors are calibrated, for example using the CMB dipole, so\nthat their sensitivity to the primordial CMB signal has been perfectly matched.\nConsequently the mismatch in the frequency bandpass shape between detectors\nintroduces difference in the relative calibration of galactic emission\ncomponents.

The both proposed methods have been applied to the LIGO events\nGW150914, GW151226 and LVT151012, together with the matching of the results\nwith the currently known electromagnetic follow-ups to these GW events.\n  The conclusion of this research is that there are opportunities for verifying\ndifferent predictions of the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation by means of\nthe analysis of the polarization states of the detected gravitational waves.\n  All in all, this work provides a new test of the theoretical assumptions\nabout the nature of gravity as well as about the processes in relativistic\ncompact objects of various types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 22:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

Standard nonlinear regression models, which may work quite well\nfor prediction, have two notable weaknesses when used to estimate heterogeneous\ntreatment effects. First, they can yield badly biased estimates of treatment\neffects when fit to data with strong confounding. The Bayesian causal forest\nmodel presented in this paper avoids this problem by directly incorporating an\nestimate of the propensity function in the specification of the response model,\nimplicitly inducing a covariate-dependent prior on the regression function.\nSecond, standard approaches to response surface modeling do not provide\nadequate control over the strength of regularization over effect heterogeneity.\nThe Bayesian causal forest model permits treatment effect heterogeneity to be\nregularized separately from the prognostic effect of control variables, making\nit possible to informatively \"shrink to homogeneity\". We illustrate these\nbenefits via the reanalysis of an observational study assessing the causal\neffects of smoking on medical expenditures as well as extensive simulation\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 04:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 07:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 06:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

The excitation\nmoves along the chain by coherent nearest-neighbor hopping $\\Omega$, under the\naction of static disorder $W$ and dephasing $\\gamma$. The system is open due to\nthe coupling of the last site with an external acceptor system (sink), where\nthe excitation can be trapped with a rate $\\Gamma_{\\rm trap}$, which determines\nthe opening strength. While it is known that dephasing can help transport in\nthe localized regime, here we show that dephasing can enhance energy transfer\neven in the ballistic regime.

In the ballistic regime, the\noptimal dephasing decreases as $1/N$ or $1/\\sqrt{N}$ respectively for weak and\nmoderate static disorder.

This unified members of a family within a single\nL-R self-conjugate multiplet. It also explained: the quantization of electric\ncharge, the co-existence of quarks and leptons, and that of their three forces,\nwhile providing the appealing possibility that nature is fundamentally\nleft-right symmetric. The minimal extension of $G(2,2,4)$ to a simple group is\ngiven by the symmetry $SO(10)$ that came a year later. The advantages of the\ncore symmetry $G(2,2,4)$, including those listed above (which are of course\nretained by $SO(10)$), are noted. These include the introductions of: (i){ \\it\nthe right-handed neutrino as a compelling member of each family}, (ii) (B-L) as\na local symmetry, and (iii) the relation $ m(\\nu^\\tau)_{Dirac} = m_{top}$.\nThese three features, as well as the gauge coupling unification scale, are\ncrucially needed to understand the tiny mass-scales of the neutrino\noscillations within the seesaw mechanism, and to implement successfully the\nmechanism of baryogenesis via leptogenesis. Implications of a well-motivated\nclass of models based on supersymmetric $SO(10)$ or a string-unified $G(2,2,4)$\nsymmetry in 4D for (a) gauge coupling unification, (b) fermion masses and\nmixings, (c) neutrino osillations, (d) baryogenesis via leptogenesis, and last\nbut not least (e) proton decay are presented.

The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging\nOperation (APOLLO) has for years achieved median range precision at the ~2 mm\nlevel. Yet residuals in model-measurement comparisons are an order-of-magnitude\nlarger, raising the question of whether the ranging data are not nearly as\naccurate as they are precise, or if the models are incomplete or\nill-conditioned. This paper describes a new absolute calibration system (ACS)\nintended both as a tool for exposing and eliminating sources of systematic\nerror, and also as a means to directly calibrate ranging data in-situ. The\nsystem consists of a high-repetition-rate (80 MHz) laser emitting short (< 10\nps) pulses that are locked to a cesium clock. In essence, the ACS delivers\nphotons to the APOLLO detector at exquisitely well-defined time intervals as a\n\"truth\" input against which APOLLO's timing performance may be judged and\ncorrected. Preliminary analysis indicates no inaccuracies in APOLLO data beyond\nthe ~3 mm level, suggesting that historical APOLLO data are of high quality and\nmotivating continued work on model capabilities.

If\nall this gas collapsed under the influence of gravity and formed stars in a\nlocal free-fall time, the star formation rate in the Galaxy would exceed that\nobserved by more than an order of magnitude. Other star-forming galaxies behave\nsimilarly. Yet observations and simulations both suggest that the molecular gas\nis indeed gravitationally collapsing, albeit hierarchically. Prompt stellar\nfeedback offers a potential solution to the low observed star formation rate if\nit quickly disrupts star-forming clouds during gravitational collapse. However,\nthis requires that molecular clouds must be short-lived objects, raising the\nquestion of how so much gas can be observed in the molecular phase. This can\noccur only if molecular clouds form as quickly as they are destroyed,\nmaintaining a global equilibrium fraction of dense gas. We therefore examine\ncloud formation timescales. We first demonstrate that supernova and superbubble\nsweeping cannot produce dense gas at the rate required to match the cloud\ndestruction rate. On the other hand, Toomre gravitational instability can reach\nthe required production rate. We thus argue that, although dense, star-forming\ngas may last only around a single global free-fall time, the dense gas in\nstar-forming galaxies can globally exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium\nbetween formation by gravitational instability, and disruption by stellar\nfeedback. At redshift z >~ 2, the Toomre instability timescale decreases,\nresulting in a prediction of higher molecular gas fractions at early times, in\nagreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 03:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 09:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 11:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The\nunprecedented, high spatial resolution ALMA observations taken toward HL Tau\nand subsequent radiative transfer modeling reveal that a high degree of dust\nsettling is currently achieved at the outer part of the HL Tau disk. Previous\nobservations however suggest a high disk accretion rate onto the central star.\nThis configuration is not necessarily intuitive in the framework of the\nconventional viscous disk model, since efficient accretion generally requires a\nhigh level of turbulence, which can suppress dust settling considerably. We\ndevelop a simplified, semi-analytical disk model to examine under what\ncondition these two properties can be realized in a single model. Recent,\nnon-ideal MHD simulations are utilized to realistically model the angular\nmomentum transport both radially via MHD turbulence and vertically via\nmagnetically induced disk winds. We find that the HL Tau disk configuration can\nbe reproduced well when disk winds are properly taken into account. While the\nresulting disk properties are likely consistent with other observational\nresults, such an ideal situation can be established only if the plasma $\\beta$\nat the disk midplane is $\\beta_0 \\simeq 2 \\times 10^4$ under the assumption of\nsteady accretion. Equivalently, the vertical magnetic flux at 100 au is about\n0.2 mG.

Previous state-of-the-art systems on Drug Name Recognition (DNR)\nand Clinical Concept Extraction (CCE) have focused on a combination of text\n\"feature engineering\" and conventional machine learning algorithms such as\nconditional random fields and support vector machines. However, developing good\nfeatures is inherently heavily time-consuming. Conversely, more modern machine\nlearning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved\ncapable of automatically learning effective features from either random\nassignments or automated word \"embeddings\". Objectives. (i) To create a highly\naccurate DNR and CCE system that avoids conventional, time-consuming feature\nengineering. (ii) To create richer, more specialized word embeddings by using\nhealth domain datasets such as MIMIC-III. (iii) To evaluate our systems over\nthree contemporary datasets. Methods.

In practice, decisions about allocation are\nmade dynamically, using routinely updated assessments. We present a novel tool\nfor evaluating risk prediction models that, unlike traditional methods,\ncaptures the dynamic nature of decision-making. Methods: Predicted risk is used\nas a score to rank incident deaths versus patients who survive, with the goal\nof ranking the deaths higher. The mean rank across deaths at a given time\nmeasures time-specific predictive accuracy; when assessed over time, it\nreflects time-varying accuracy. Results: Applying this approach to CF Registry\ndata on patients followed from 1993-2011, we show that traditional methods do\nnot capture the performance of models used dynamically in the clinical setting.\nPreviously proposed multivariate risk scores perform no better than forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage of predicted normal (FEV1%)\nalone. Despite its value for survival prediction, FEV1% has a low sensitivity\nof 45% over time (for fixed specificity of 95%), leaving room for improvement\nin prediction. Finally, prediction accuracy with annually-updated FEV1% shows\nminor differences compared to FEV1% updated every 2 years, which may have\nclinical implications regarding the optimal frequency of updating clinical\ninformation. Conclusions: It is imperative to continue to develop models that\naccurately predict survival in CF. Our proposed approach can serve as the basis\nfor evaluating the predictive ability of these models by better accounting for\ntheir dynamic clinical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 07:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

If accurate predictions are developed, then a prognostic mode can\nidentify patients at greatest risk for future adverse events, and may be used\nclinically to define populations appropriate for targeted intervention. In\npractice, a prognostic model is often used to guide decisions at multiple time\npoints over the course of disease, and classification performance, i.e.\nsensitivity and specificity, for distinguishing high-risk versus low-risk\nindividuals may vary over time as an individual's disease status and prognostic\ninformation change. In this tutorial, we detail contemporary statistical\nmethods that can characterize the time-varying accuracy of prognostic survival\nmodels when used for dynamic decision-making. Although statistical methods for\nevaluating prognostic models with simple binary outcomes are well established,\nmethods appropriate for survival outcomes are less well known and require\ntime-dependent extensions of sensitivity and specificity to fully characterize\nlongitudinal biomarkers or models.

When\npartial prior support information is available, a sufficient condition based on\nthe high order block RIP is derived to guarantee stable and robust recovery of\nblock sparse signals via the weighted $\\ell_2/\\ell_1$ minimization. We then\nshow if the accuracy of arbitrary prior block support estimate is at least\n$50\\%$, the sufficient recovery condition by the weighted $\\ell_2/\\ell_{1}$\nminimization is weaker than that by the $\\ell_2/\\ell_{1}$ minimization, and the\nweighted $\\ell_2/\\ell_{1}$ minimization provides better upper bounds on the\nrecovery error in terms of the measurement noise and the compressibility of the\nsignal.

At the two vertices the so-called Kirchhoff\nboundary conditions are imposed. The configuration of the graph is\ncharacterized by two lengths, $L_1$ and $L_2$, and we are interested in the\nexistence and properties of standing waves of given frequency $\\omega$. For\nevery $\\omega>0$ only solutions supported on the circle exist (cnoidal\nsolutions), and only for a rational value of $L_1/L_2$; they can be extended to\nevery $\\omega\\in \\mathbb{R}$. We study, for $\\omega<0$, the solutions periodic\non the circle but with nontrivial components on the half-lines. The problem\nturns out to be equivalent to a nonlinear boundary value problem in which the\nboundary condition depends on the spectral parameter $\\omega$.

The shape and position of the heliospheric\nboundary, the heliopause, in space depend on the parameters of interacting\nplasma flows. The interplay between the asymmetrizing effect of the\ninterstellar magnetic field and charge exchange between ions and neutral atoms\nplays an important role in the SW-LISM interaction. By performing\nthree-dimensional, MHD plasma / kinetic neutral atom simulations, we determine\nthe width of the outer heliosheath - the LISM plasma region affected by the\npresence of the heliosphere - and analyze quantitatively the distributions in\nfront of the heliopause. It is shown that charge exchange modifies the LISM\nplasma to such extent that the contribution of a shock transition to the total\nvariation of plasma parameters becomes small even if the LISM velocity exceeds\nthe fast magnetosonic speed in the unperturbed medium.

We show that the solution for a constant twist outside the tube\nis a good approximation to the case where the magnetic twist is proportional to\n$1/r$, namely the error is in all cases less than $5.4\\%$.The solution is in\nexcellent agreement with solutions to simpler models of twisted magnetic flux\ntubes, i.e. without external magnetic twist. It is shown that axisymmetric\nAlfv\\'{e}n waves are naturally coupled with magnetic twist as the azimuthal\ncomponent of the velocity perturbation is nonzero. We compared our theoretical\nresults with observations and comment on what the Doppler signature of these\nmodes is expected to be. Lastly, we argue that the character of axisymmetric\nwaves in twisted magnetic flux tubes can lead to false positives in identifying\nobservations with axisymmetric Alfv\\'{e}n waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 10:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

They noticed that\nbecause $S_{tot}/N$ shall contain the mixing entropy per particle $k_B s_m$ and\n$S_v/N$ shall not, the configurational entropy per particle $S_c/N$ shall\ndiverge in the thermodynamic limit for continuous polydispersity due to the\ndiverging $s_m$. They also provided a resolution for this paradox and related\nproblems-it relies on a careful redefining of $S_c$ and $S_v$. Here, we note\nthat the relation $S_{tot}=S_c+S_v$ is essentially a geometric relation in the\nphase space and shall hold without redefining $S_c$ and $S_v$. We also note\nthat the total entropy per particle $S_{tot}/N$ diverges with $N \\to \\infty$\nwith continuous polydispersity as well. The usual way to avoid this and other\ndifficulties with $S_{tot}/N$ is to work with the excess entropy $\\Delta\nS_{tot}$ (relative to the ideal gas of the same polydispersity). Speedy [Mol.\nPhys., 1998, 95, 169] applied this approach to the relation above and wrote\nthis relation as $\\Delta S_{tot}=S_c+\\Delta S_v$. This form has flows as well,\nbecause $S_v/N$ does not contain the $k_B s_m$ term and the latter is\nintroduced into $\\Delta S_v/N$ instead.

We also investigated possible Ba enhancement, as this element has\nbecome increasingly interesting in the last years following the evidence of Ba\nover-abundance in young clusters, the origin of which is still unknown. Using\nX-shooter@VLT, we analyzed the spectra of 89 cluster members, both class II and\nIII stars.

For\nsix class II stars we also measured the Fe and Ba abundances using the spectral\nsynthesis and the code MOOG. The veiling contribution was taken into account\nfor all three elements. We find a dispersion in the strength of the Li line at\nlow Teff and identify three targets with severe Li depletion. The nuclear age\ninferred for these highly Li-depleted stars is around 15 Myr, which exceeds the\nisochronal one. As in other star-forming regions, no metal-rich members are\nfound in Lupus, giving support to a recent hypothesis that the Fe abundance\ndistribution of most of the nearby young regions could be the result of a\ncommon and widespread star formation episode involving the Galactic thin disk.\nWe find that Ba is over-abundant by ~0.7 dex with respect to the Sun. Since\ncurrent theoretical models cannot reproduce this Ba abundance pattern, we\ninvestigated whether this unusually large Ba content might be related to\neffects due to stellar parameters, stellar activity, and accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 11:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In this paper a novel electrochemical phase-field model is presented\nthat captures the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithium-insertion in\nTiO$_2$-anatase, a well-known and intensively studied Li-ion battery electrode\nmaterial. Previous experimental work on lithiated anatase TiO$_2$ provided all\nparameters necessary for the phase-field simulations, giving the opportunity to\ngain fundamental insight in the lithiation of anatase and validate this\nphase-field model. The phase-field model captures the essential experimentally\nobserved phenomena, rationalising the impact of C-rate, particle size, surface\narea, and the memory effect on the performance of anatase as a Li-ion battery\nelectrode. Thereby a comprehensive physical picture of the lithiation of\nanatase TiO$_2$ is provided. The results of the simulations demonstrate that\nthe performance of anatase is limited by the formation of the poor Li-ion\ndiffusion in the Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of the particles. Unlike\nother electrode materials, the kinetic limitations of individual anatase\nparticles limit the performance of full electrodes. Hence, rather than\nimproving the ionic and electronic network in electrodes, improving the\nperformance of anatase TiO$_2$ electrodes requires preventing the formation of\na blocking Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of particles. Additionally, the\nqualitative agreement of the phase-field model, containing only parameters from\nliterature, with a broad spectrum of experiments demonstrates the capabilities\nof phase-field models for understanding Li-ion electrode materials, and its\npromise for guiding the design of electrodes through a thorough understanding\nof material properties and their interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 11:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 08:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

Recent high angular resolution polarimetric continuum observations\nof circumstellar disks provide new insights into their magnetic field.

We investigate which constraints for magnetic fields in circumstellar\ndisks can be obtained from Zeeman observations of the $113~\\mathrm{GHz}$ CN\nlines.

The arguably\nmost elementary kind of information combining is the addition of two binary\nrandom variables (a CNOT gate), and the resulting quantities play an important\nrole in Belief propagation and Polar coding. We investigate this problem in the\nsetting where quantum side information is available, which has been recognized\nas a hard setting for entropy power inequalities.\n  Our main technical result is a non-trivial, and close to optimal, lower bound\non the combined entropy, which can be seen as an almost optimal \"quantum Mrs.\nGerber's Lemma\". Our proof uses three main ingredients: (1) a new bound on the\nconcavity of von Neumann entropy, which is tight in the regime of low pairwise\nstate fidelities; (2) the quantitative improvement of strong subadditivity due\nto Fawzi-Renner, in which we manage to handle the minimization over recovery\nmaps; (3) recent duality results on classical-quantum-channels due to Renes et\nal. We furthermore present conjectures on the optimal lower and upper bounds\nunder quantum side information, supported by interesting analytical\nobservations and strong numerical evidence.\n  We finally apply our bounds to Polar coding for binary-input\nclassical-quantum channels, and show the following three results: (A) Even\nnon-stationary channels polarize under the polar transform. (B) The blocklength\nrequired to approach the symmetric capacity scales at most sub-exponentially in\nthe gap to capacity. (C) Under the aforementioned lower bound conjecture, a\nblocklength polynomial in the gap suffices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 17:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

This process is arguably driven by social influence, social\nlearning and by external effects like media. Observations of such processes\ndate back to the seminal studies by Rogers and Bass, and their mathematical\nmodelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple contagion,\nidentifies adoption spreading with an epidemic process. The other one, named\ncomplex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds and successfully\nexplains the emergence of large cascades of adoption resulting in a rapid\nspreading often seen in empirical data. The observation of real world adoption\nprocesses has become easier lately due to the availability of large digital\nsocial network and behavioural datasets. This has allowed simultaneous study of\nnetwork structures and dynamics of online service adoption, shedding light on\nthe mechanisms and external effects that influence the temporal evolution of\nbehavioural or innovation adoption. These advancements have induced the\ndevelopment of more realistic models of social spreading phenomena, which in\nturn have provided remarkably good predictions of various empirical adoption\nprocesses. In this chapter we review recent data-driven studies addressing\nreal-world service adoption processes. Our studies provide the first detailed\nempirical evidence of a heterogeneous threshold distribution in adoption. We\nalso describe the modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and\ndata-driven simulations. Our objective is to understand the effects of\nidentified social mechanisms on service adoption spreading, and to provide\npotential new directions and open questions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 14:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

The\nfirst two cases seem to belong to a class of transitions, where the initial and\nfinal states are relatively close to each other, and the distribution function\nfor the differential expressions is short ranged, with a tail of only a few\ndozens of strongly varying genes. In the latter case, cancer, the initial and\nfinal states are far apart and separated by a low-fitness barrier. The\ndistribution function shows a very heavy tail, with thousands of silenced and\nover-expressed genes.

In particular, we look at the evolution of the velocity\nanisotropy. Our simulations show that at early phases, the velocity anisotropy\nis determined by the tidal field of the dwarf galaxy and subsequently the\nclusters will adapt to the new tidal environment, losing any signature of their\noriginal environment in a few relaxation times. At 10 Gyr, GCs exhibit a\nvariety of velocity anisotropy profiles, namely, isotropic velocity\ndistribution in the inner regions and either isotropy or radial/tangential\nanisotropy in the intermediate and outer regions. Independently of an accreted\norigin, the velocity anisotropy primarily depends on the strength of the tidal\nfield cumulatively experienced by a cluster.

The\nelementary case of 2 mode parametric resonance of order 1 involves the\nexcitation of a spectral tone of a parametrically driven mode at a sub-harmonic\nfrequency of the higher directly driven mode. Historically, such examples of\nparametric resonance have been predominantly researched in a system of micro-\nand nanoelectromechanical resonators. Here, in this paper, we break this\nconvention by showcasing a collection of experimental signatures in support of\nthe concept of \"N-mode parametric resonance\" using a number of elementary\nmicroelectromechanical devices. Specifically, we present observations of 2, 3,\n(2+3) and (3+3) mode parametric resonances demonstrating co-existence of\ndifferent regimes within the same device. In addition, we also present\nobservations of intrinsic \"Four-Wave Mixing\" of parametric excitations. This\npaper presents contributions towards the existence proof for such multimode\nparametric resonances which can also be exploited for engineering benefit\nwithin the field of \"micro and nanoelectromechanical resonators\". The\nexperimental results further point towards the possibility of the ultimate\nobservation of N-mode parametric resonance in such physical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 16:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Examples of these effects have already been\nexploited by past missions such as SMART-1, as well as are proposed to benefit\nfuture missions to Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune, and disposal strategies from\nEarth's High Eccentric or Libration Point Orbits. This paper revises three\ntotally different descriptions of the effects of the third body gravitational\nperturbation. These are the averaged dynamics of the classical third body\nperturbing function, the Opik's close encounter theory and the Keplerian map\napproach. The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases\nof a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing\nextremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks\nsolutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at\ndistances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body. The paper\nattempts to gain insight into the accuracy of these different perturbative\ntechniques into each of these scenarios, as compared with the motion in the\nCircular Restricted Three Body Problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 10:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}
