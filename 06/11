Despite the\nactive user engagement on these online video-sharing platforms, most of recent\nresearch on online media platforms have restricted themselves to networking\nbased social media sites, like Facebook or Twitter. We depart from previous\nstudies in the online media space that have focused exclusively on demand-side\nuser engagement, by modeling the supply-side of the crowd-contributed videos on\nthis platform. The current study is among the first to perform a large-scale\nempirical study using longitudinal video upload data from a large online video\nplatform. The modeling and subsequent prediction of video uploads is made\ncomplicated by the heterogeneity of video types (e.g. popular vs. niche video\ngenres), and the inherent time trend effects associated with media uploads. We\nidentify distinct genre-clusters from our dataset and employ a self-exciting\nHawkes point-process model on each of these clusters to fully specify and\nestimate the video upload process. Additionally, we go beyond prediction to\ndisentangle potential factors that govern user engagement and determine the\nvideo upload rates, which improves our analysis with additional explanatory\npower. Our findings show that using a relatively parsimonious point-process\nmodel, we are able to achieve higher model fit, and predict video uploads to\nthe platform with a higher accuracy than competing models. The findings from\nthis study can benefit platform owners in better understanding how their\nsupply-side users engage with their site over time. We also offer a robust\nmethod for performing media upload prediction that is likely to be\ngeneralizable across media platforms which demonstrate similar temporal and\ngenre-level heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 16:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

An immediate consequence of the Seifert framing is\nthat the continuum definition of helicity for a superfluid is trivially zero at\nall times.

This incredibly challenging problem has been studied for\nmore than four decades and has been only recently shown to be NP-Hard. In this\npaper we present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that computes a\n$14$-approximation of the minimum weight triangulation -- a constant that is\nsignificantly smaller than what has been previously known.\n  In our algorithm, we use grids to partition the edges into levels where\nshorter edges appear at smaller levels and edges with similar lengths appear at\nthe same level. We then triangulate the point set incrementally by introducing\nedges in increasing order of their levels. We introduce the edges of any level\n$i+1$ in two steps. In the first step, we add edges using a variant of the\nwell-known ring heuristic to generate a partial triangulation\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$. In the second step, we greedily add non-intersecting\nlevel $i+1$ edges to $\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$ in increasing order of their length\nand obtain a partial triangulation $\\mathcal{A}_{ i+1}$. The ring heuristic is\nknown to yield only an $O(\\log n)$-approximation even for a convex polygon and\nthe greedy heuristic achieves only a $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation.\nTherefore, it is surprising that their combination leads to an improved\napproximation ratio of $14$.\n  For the proof, we identify several useful properties of $\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$\nand combine it with a new Euler characteristic based technique to show that\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}_i$ has more edges than $\\mathcal{T}_i$; here $\\mathcal{T}_i$\nis the partial triangulation consisting of level $\\le i$ edges of some minimum\nweight triangulation.

The ballistic character of Weyl fermion transport inside the\nsemimetal tip, combined with the ideal focusing of the Weyl fermions (by\nVeselago lens) on the surface of the tip may create a very narrow electron beam\nfrom the tip to the surface of the studied material.

It discusses the above-mentioned\nchallenges for full 6D object pose estimation in RGB-D images comparing the\nperformances of several 6D detectors in order to answer the following\nquestions: What is the current position of the computer vision community for\nmaintaining \"automation\" in robotic manipulation? What next steps should the\ncommunity take for improving \"autonomy\" in robotics while handling objects? Our\nfindings include: (i) reasonably accurate results are obtained on\ntextured-objects at varying viewpoints with cluttered backgrounds. (ii) Heavy\nexistence of occlusion and clutter severely affects the detectors, and\nsimilar-looking distractors is the biggest challenge in recovering instances'\n6D. (iii) Template-based methods and random forest-based learning algorithms\nunderlie object detection and 6D pose estimation. Recent paradigm is to learn\ndeep discriminative feature representations and to adopt CNNs taking RGB images\nas input. (iv) Depending on the availability of large-scale 6D annotated depth\ndatasets, feature representations can be learnt on these datasets, and then the\nlearnt representations can be customized for the 6D problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 21:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 19:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

We present Poseidon, an efficient\ncommunication architecture for distributed DL on GPUs.

In the\nend, the auction yielded $19.8 billion, $10.05 billion of which was paid to 175\nbroadcasters for voluntarily relinquishing their licenses across 14 UHF\nchannels. Stations that continued broadcasting were assigned potentially new\nchannels to fit as densely as possible into the channels that remained. The\ngovernment netted more than $7 billion (used to pay down the national debt)\nafter covering costs. A crucial element of the auction design was the\nconstruction of a solver, dubbed SATFC, that determined whether sets of\nstations could be \"repacked\" in this way; it needed to run every time a station\nwas given a price quote. This paper describes the process by which we built\nSATFC. We adopted an approach we dub \"deep optimization\", taking a data-driven,\nhighly parametric, and computationally intensive approach to solver design.\nMore specifically, to build SATFC we designed software that could pair both\ncomplete and local-search SAT-encoded feasibility checking with a wide range of\ndomain-specific techniques. We then used automatic algorithm configuration\ntechniques to construct a portfolio of eight complementary algorithms to be run\nin parallel, aiming to achieve good performance on instances that arose in\nproprietary auction simulations. To evaluate the impact of our solver in this\npaper, we built an open-source reverse auction simulator. We found that within\nthe short time budget required in practice, SATFC solved more than 95% of the\nproblems it encountered. Furthermore, the incentive auction paired with SATFC\nproduced nearly optimal allocations in a restricted setting and substantially\noutperformed other alternatives at national scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 03:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

As in the previous 2010 and 2012 versions of the map, photometry\nwith an accuracy better than $0.05^m$ in the $J$ and $K_s$ bands for more than\n70 million stars from the 2MASS catalogue is used in the new version. However,\nthe data reduction technique is considerably more complicated. As before, an\nanalysis of the distribution of stars near the main-sequence turnoff on the\n$(J-K_s)$ - $K_s$ diagram, where they form a distribution maximum, provides a\nbasis for the method. The shift of this maximum, i.e., the $mode(J-K_s)$, along\n$(J-K_s)$ and $K_s$, given the spatial variations of the mean de-reddened color\n$(J-K_s)_0$ of these stars, is interpreted as a growth of the reddening with\nincreasing distance. The main distinction of the new method is that instead of\nthe fixed mean absolute magnitude, de-reddened color, distance, and reddening\nfor each cell, the individual values of these quantities are calculated for\neach star by iterations when solving the system of equations relating them.\nThis has allowed one to increase the random accuracy of the map to $0.01^m$ and\nits spatial resolution to 20 pc in coordinates and distance and to $1^{\\circ}$\nin longitude and latitude. Comparison with other reddening estimates for the\nsame spatial cells and Gaia DR1 TGAS stars shows that the constructed map is\none of the best maps for the space under consideration.

The main purpose of the map is to analyze the\ncharacteristics of Galactic structures, clouds, and cloud complexes. For this\npurpose, the reddening map within each spatial cell has also been computed by\nanalyzing the reddening along each line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 10:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

This leads to the large-scale service system that is divided\ninto several adaptive and self-organizing subsystems through scheduling of\nbatch customers and regrouping of service resources, which make the middle\nlayer of this service system more effectively managed and strengthened under a\ndynamic, real-time and even reward optimal framework.

Such subpopulations can be identified by\nconsidering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all\ncases in the population occurring before the epidemic peak (Bp), the\ncorresponding proportion after the epidemic peak (Ap), to calculate the\nrelative risk for a subpopulation, RR=Bp/Ap.

We also demonstrate\nits practicality, by developing an approximation technique to reduce kernel\ncomputation time, and show that our proposal compares favorably to existing\nkernels for PDs on several benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 14:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 08:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 14:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

While the SBL linewidth formula exhibits power and\noptical Q factor dependences that are identical to the Schawlow-Townes formula,\na source of noise not present in two-level lasers, phonon occupancy of the\nBrillouin mechanical mode, is predicted to be the dominant SBL linewidth\ncontribution. Moreover, the quantum-limit of the SBL linewidth is predicted to\nbe twice the Schawlow-Townes limit on account of phonon participation. To help\nconfirm this theory the SBL fundamental linewidth is measured at cryogenic\ntemperatures in a silica microresonator. Its temperature dependence and the SBL\nlinewidth theory are combined to predict the number of thermo-mechanical quanta\nat three temperatures. The result agrees with the Bose-Einstein phonon\noccupancy of the microwave-rate Brillouin mode in support of the SBL linewidth\ntheory prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 14:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In particular, they can experience \"fast\" self-induced flavor\nconversions almost immediately above the core. Very recently, a novel method\nhas been proposed to investigate these phenomena, in terms of the dispersion\nrelation for the complex frequency and wave number ($\\omega$,$k$) of\ndisturbances in the mean field of the $\\nu_e\\nu_x$ flavor coherence. We discuss\na systematic approach to such instabilities, originally developed in the\ncontext of plasma physics, and based of the time-asymptotic behavior of the\nGreen's function of the system. Instabilities are typically seen to emerge for\ncomplex $\\omega$, and can be further characterized as convective (moving away\nfaster than they spread) and absolute (growing locally), depending on\n$k$-dependent features. Stable cases emerge when $k$ (but not $\\omega$) is\ncomplex, leading to disturbances damped in space, or when both $\\omega$ and $k$\nare real, corresponding to complete stability. The analytical classification of\nboth unstable and stable modes leads not only to qualitative insights about\ntheir features but also to quantitative predictions about the growth rates of\ninstabilities. Representative numerical solutions are discussed in a simple\ntwo-beam model of interacting neutrinos. As an application, we argue that\nsupernova and binary neutron star mergers exhibiting a \"crossing\" in the\nelectron lepton number would lead to an absolute instability in the flavor\ncontent of the neutrino gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 15:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 10:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 07:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

On the other hand, model free\nsolutions suffer sample inefficiency and require too many interactions with the\nenvironment, which is infeasible in practice.
