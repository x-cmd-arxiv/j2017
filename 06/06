Post-synthesis simulations using\nMentor Modelsim in a 28nm process with a clock frequency of 500 MHz show that\nthe VGG19 network achieves over 450 GOp/s. By exploiting sparsity, NullHop\nachieves an efficiency of 368%, maintains over 98% utilization of the MAC\nunits, and achieves a power efficiency of over 3TOp/s/W in a core area of\n6.3mm$^2$. As further proof of NullHop's usability, we interfaced its FPGA\nimplementation with a neuromorphic event camera for real time interactive\ndemonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 16:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 10:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

We specifically study universally consistent\nfunction learning, where the objective is to obtain low long-run average loss\nfor any target function, when the data follow a given stochastic process. We\nare then interested in the question of whether there exist learning rules\nguaranteed to be universally consistent given only the assumption that\nuniversally consistent learning is possible for the given data process. The\nreasoning that motivates this criterion emanates from a kind of optimist's\ndecision theory, and so we refer to such learning rules as being optimistically\nuniversal. We study this question in three natural learning settings:\ninductive, self-adaptive, and online.

Because a RKHS can be very flexible, it is\ncommon to impose a regularization term in the optimization to prevent\noverfitting. Standard RKHS learning employs the squared norm penalty of the\nlearning function. Despite its success, many challenges remain. In particular,\none cannot directly use the squared norm penalty for variable selection or data\nextraction. Therefore, when there exists noise predictors, or the underlying\nfunction has a sparse representation in the dual space, the performance of\nstandard RKHS learning can be suboptimal. In the literature,work has been\nproposed on how to perform variable selection in RKHS learning, and a data\nsparsity constraint was considered for data extraction. However, how to learn\nin a RKHS with both variable selection and data extraction simultaneously\nremains unclear. In this paper, we propose a unified RKHS learning method,\nnamely, DOuble Sparsity Kernel (DOSK) learning, to overcome this challenge. An\nefficient algorithm is provided to solve the corresponding optimization\nproblem. We prove that under certain conditions, our new method can\nasymptotically achieve variable selection consistency. Simulated and real data\nresults demonstrate that DOSK is highly competitive among existing approaches\nfor RKHS learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 17:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

We consider the case when $B$ databases are\noutdated (unsynchronized), or even worse, adversarial (Byzantine), and\ntherefore, can return incorrect answers. In the PIR problem with Byzantine\ndatabases (BPIR), a user wishes to retrieve a specific message from a set of\n$M$ messages with zero-error, irrespective of the actions performed by the\nByzantine databases. We consider the $T$-privacy constraint in this paper,\nwhere any $T$ databases can collude, and exchange the queries submitted by the\nuser. We derive the information-theoretic capacity of this problem, which is\nthe maximum number of \\emph{correct symbols} that can be retrieved privately\n(under the $T$-privacy constraint) for every symbol of the downloaded data. We\ndetermine the exact BPIR capacity to be\n$C=\\frac{N-2B}{N}\\cdot\\frac{1-\\frac{T}{N-2B}}{1-(\\frac{T}{N-2B})^M}$, if $2B+T\n< N$.

The result shows that for the\nunsynchronized PIR problem, if the user does not have any knowledge about the\nfraction of the messages that are mis-synchronized, the single-round capacity\nis the same as the BPIR capacity.

In the canonical\ntruncated disk model of moderately low accretion rate systems, gas in the inner\nregion of the accretion disk occupies a hot, radiatively inefficient phase,\nwhich leads to a geometrically thick disk, while the gas in the outer region\noccupies a cooler, radiatively efficient phase that resides in the standard\ngeometrically thin disk. Observationally, there is strong empirical evidence to\nsupport this phenomenological model, but a detailed understanding of the\ndynamics of truncated disks is lacking. We present a well-resolved viscous,\nhydrodynamic simulation that uses an ad hoc cooling prescription to drive a\nthermal instability and, hence, produce the first sustained truncated accretion\ndisk. With this simulation, we perform a study of the dynamics, angular\nmomentum transport, and energetics of a truncated disk. We find that time\nvariability introduced by the quasi-periodic transition of gas from efficient\ncooling to inefficient cooling impacts the evolution of the simulated disk. A\nconsequence of the thermal instability is that an outflow is launched from the\nhot/cold gas interface which drives large, sub-Keplerian convective cells in\nthe disk atmosphere. The convective cells introduce a viscous $\\theta-\\phi$\nstress that is less than the generic $r-\\phi$ viscous stress component, but\ngreatly influences the evolution of the disk. In the truncated disk, we find\nthat the bulk of the accreted gas is in the hot phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 18:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

As an alternative, a unipolar induction model is proposed, where the\nmagnetic field is stationary in space and the stellar unipolar electric field\n$\\vec E_{*}$ on the surface is uploaded to the magnetosphere. Through the\nPoynting vector, the star and the magnetosphere form a coupled system where the\ntotal angular momentum, consisting the mechanical one of the star, the\nelectromagnetic one of the magnetosphere, and the mechanical one of the plasma\nin the magnetosphere, is conserved. The stellar interaction with the accretion\ndisk is through the projection of the unipolar electric field $\\vec E_{*}$ onto\nthe disk via the equipotential field lines, generating a disk current and\nconsequently toroidal fields with opposite signs on both sides of the disk,\nwith return current loops via the stellar surface. As a result, magnetic flux\nis added to the magnetospheric field in the northern and southern hemispheres\nwith the disk current sheet as the boundary condition. This makes the star-disk\nsystem an astrophysical site where intense magnetic fields are generated\nthrough the rotational energy of the star. Angular momentum extraction from\nthis star-disk system happens as the magnetic flux in the magnetosphere\nincreases to the point that exceeds the current carrying capacity of the disk,\nleading to a mega scale magnetic eruption sending Poynting fluxes to space\neither isotropically or beamed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 19:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Several\ndata-level techniques have been proposed to alleviate this issue by up-sampling\nminority samples or under-sampling majority samples. However, some informative\nsamples may be neglected by random under-sampling and adding synthetic positive\nsamples through up-sampling adds to training complexity. In this paper, a new\nensemble learning algorithm called Progressive Boosting (PBoost) is proposed\nthat progressively inserts uncorrelated groups of samples into a Boosting\nprocedure to avoid loss of information while generating a diverse pool of\nclassifiers. Base classifiers in this ensemble are generated from one iteration\nto the next, using subsets from a validation set that grows gradually in size\nand imbalance. Consequently, PBoost is more robust to unknown and variable\nlevels of skew in operational data, and has lower computation complexity than\nBoosting ensembles in literature. In PBoost, a new loss factor is proposed to\navoid bias of performance towards the negative class. Using this loss factor,\nthe weight update of samples and classifier contribution in final predictions\nare set based on the ability to recognize both classes. Using the proposed loss\nfactor instead of standard accuracy can avoid biasing performance in any\nBoosting ensemble. The proposed approach was validated and compared using\nsynthetic data, videos from the FIA dataset that emulates face\nre-identification applications, and KEEL collection of datasets.

This\nincludes the two black holes being imaged at sub-horizon resolution by the\nEvent Horizon Telescope. In these disks, the mean free path for Coulomb\ninteractions between charged particles is large, and the accreting matter is a\nnearly collisionless plasma. Despite this, numerical simulations have so far\nmodeled these accretion flows using ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Here, we\npresent the first global, general relativistic, 3D simulations of accretion\nflows onto a Kerr black hole including the non-ideal effects most likely to\naffect the dynamics of the disk: the anisotropy between the pressure parallel\nand perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the heat flux along magnetic field\nlines. We show that for both standard and magnetically arrested disks, the\npressure anisotropy is comparable to the magnetic pressure, while the heat flux\nremains dynamically unimportant. Despite this large pressure anisotropy,\nhowever, the time-averaged structure of the accretion flow is strikingly\nsimilar to that found in simulations treating the plasma as an ideal fluid. We\nargue that these similarities are largely due to the interchangeability of the\nviscous and magnetic shear stresses as long as the magnetic pressure is small\ncompared to the gas pressure, and to the sub-dominant role of pressure/viscous\neffects in magnetically arrested disks.

Here we present a\n\"Forward Global Calibration Method (FGCM)\" for photometric calibration of the\nDES, and we present results of its application to the first three years of the\nsurvey (Y3A1). The FGCM combines data taken with auxiliary instrumentation at\nthe observatory with data from the broad-band survey imaging itself and models\nof the instrument and atmosphere to estimate the spatial- and time-dependence\nof the passbands of individual DES survey exposures. \"Standard\" passbands are\nchosen that are typical of the passbands encountered during the survey. The\npassband of any individual observation is combined with an estimate of the\nsource spectral shape to yield a magnitude $m_b^{\\mathrm{std}}$ in the standard\nsystem.

Yet, in situations where\nparticle-particle correlations become important, the product Ansatz fails. To\ninclude correlations nonperturbatively, we consider a new set of states: the\nparticle-correlated state of $N=l\\times n$ bosons is derived by symmetrizing\nthe $n$-fold product of an $l$-particle quantum state. The particle-correlated\nstates can be simulated efficiently for large $N$, because their parameter\nspaces, which depend on $l$, do not grow with $n$. Here we formulate and\ndevelop in great detail the pure-state case for $l=2$, where the many-body\nstate is constructed from a two-particle pure state. These paired wave\nfunctions, which we call pair-correlated states (PCS), were introduced by A. J.\nLeggett [Rev. Mod. Phys. ${\\bf 73}$, 307 (2001)] as a\nparticle-number-conserving version of the Bogoliubov approximation. We present\nan iterative algorithm that solves for the reduced (marginal) density matrices\n(RDMs), i.e., the correlation functions, associated with PCS in time $O(N)$.\nThe RDMs can also be derived from the normalization factor of PCS, which is\nderived analytically in the large-$N$ limit. To test the efficacy of PCS, we\nanalyze the ground state of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model by minimizing the\nenergy of the PCS~state, both in its exact form and in its large-$N$\napproximate form, and comparing with the exact ground state. For $N=1\\,000$,\nthe relative errors of the ground-state energy for both cases are within\n$10^{-5}$ over the entire parameter region from a single condensate to a Mott\ninsulator.

However, we\nhave recently shown that the singlet $S^2$-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock\nwave function can in fact be written in a coupled cluster-like wave function:\nthat is, the spin-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function can be\nwritten as a polynomial of a double-excitation operator acting on some\nclosed-shell reference determinant. Here, we extend this result and show that\nthe spin-projected generalized Hartree-Fock wave function (which has both $S^2$\nand $S_z$ projection) is likewise a polynomial of low-order excitation\noperators acting on a closed-shell determinant, and provide a closed-form\nexpression for the resulting polynomial coefficients.

Finally, the overlap between consecutive windows hinders a\nprecise statistical assessment. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by\nexplicitly modeling the spectral dynamics through integrating the multitaper\nmethod with state-space models in a Bayesian estimation framework.

For\nsuch software, testing is usually performed manually by handcrafting test\nsuites based on specific design techniques and domain-specific experience. To\nsupport developers in testing, different approaches for producing good test\nsuites have been proposed. In the last couple of years combinatorial testing\nhas been explored with the goal of automatically combining the input values of\nthe software based on a certain strategy. Pairwise testing is a combinatorial\ntechnique used to generate test suites by varying the values of each pair of\ninput parameters to a system until all possible combinations of those\nparameters are created. There is some evidence suggesting that these kinds of\ntechniques are efficient and relatively good at detecting software faults.\nUnfortunately, there is little experimental evidence on the comparison of these\ncombinatorial testing techniques with, what is perceived as, rigorous manually\nhandcrafted testing. In this study we compare pairwise test suites with test\nsuites created manually by engineers for 45 industrial programs. The test\nsuites were evaluated in terms of fault detection, code coverage and number of\ntests. The results of this study show that pairwise testing, while useful for\nachieving high code coverage and fault detection for the majority of the\nprograms, is almost as effective in terms of fault detection as manual testing.\nThe results also suggest that pairwise testing is just as good as manual\ntesting at fault detection for 64% of the programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 07:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

The\neffectiveness of the state-of-the-art techniques is greatly diminished because\nthey require a large number of objective evaluations, which makes them\nimpractical for problems of the above kind. Bayesian global optimization (BGO),\nhas managed to deal with these challenges in solving single-objective\noptimization problems and has recently been extended to multi-objective\noptimization (MOO). BGO models the objectives via probabilistic surrogates and\nuses the epistemic uncertainty to define an information acquisition function\n(IAF) that quantifies the merit of evaluating the objective at new designs.\nThis iterative data acquisition process continues until a stopping criterion is\nmet. The most commonly used IAF for MOO is the expected improvement over the\ndominated hypervolume (EIHV) which in its original form is unable to deal with\nparametric uncertainties or measurement noise. In this work, we provide a\nsystematic reformulation of EIHV to deal with stochastic MOO problems. The\nprimary contribution of this paper lies in being able to filter out the noise\nand reformulate the EIHV without having to observe or estimate the stochastic\nparameters. An addendum of the probabilistic nature of our methodology is that\nit enables us to characterize our confidence about the predicted Pareto front.\nWe verify and validate the proposed methodology by applying it to synthetic\ntest problems with known solutions.

It has a\ngrowing impact on electric power systems as it dramatically modifies the way\nelectricity is produced. To ensure a safe and smooth transition towards a\npan-European electricity production dominated by renewable sources, it is of\nparamount importance to anticipate how production dispatches will evolve, to\nunderstand how increased fluctuations in power generations can be absorbed at\nthe pan-European level and to evaluate where the resulting changes in power\nflows will require significant grid upgrades. To address these issues, we\nconstruct an aggregated model of the pan-European transmission network which we\ncouple to an optimized, few-parameter dispatch algorithm to obtain time- and\ngeographically-resolved production profiles. We demonstrate the validity of our\ndispatch algorithm by reproducing historical production time series for all\npower productions in fifteen different European countries. Having calibrated\nour model in this way, we investigate future production profiles at later\nstages of the energy transition - determined by planned future production\ncapacities - and the resulting interregional power flows. We find that large\npower fluctuations from increasing penetrations of renewable sources can be\nabsorbed at the pan-European level via significantly increased electricity\nexchanges between different countries. We identify where these increased\nexchanges will require additional power transfer capacities. We finally\nintroduce a physically-based economic indicator which allows to predict future\nfinancial conditions in the electricity market. We anticipate new economic\nopportunities for dam hydroelectricity and pumped-storage plants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 09:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The typical approach to\ndesigning the mechanical response of an ideal origami machine is to include\nmechanisms where mechanical constraints transform applied forces into a desired\nmotion along a narrow set of degrees of freedom. In fact, to date, most design\napproaches focus on building up complex mechanisms from simple ones in ways\nthat preserve each individual mechanism's degree of freedom (DOF), with\nexamples ranging from simple robotic arms to homogenous arrays of identical\nvertices, such as the well-known Miura-ori. However, such approaches typically\nrequire tight fabrication tolerances, and often suffer from parasitic\ncompliance. In this work, we demonstrate a technique in which\nhigh-degree-of-freedom mechanisms associated with single vertices are\nheterogeneously combined so that the coupled phase spaces of neighboring\nvertices are pared down to a controlled range of motions. This approach has the\nadvantage that it produces mechanisms that retain the DOF at each vertex, are\nrobust against fabrication tolerances and parasitic compliance, but\nnevertheless effectively constrain the range of motion of the entire machine.\nWe demonstrate the utility of this approach by mapping out the configuration\nspace for the modified Miura-ori vertex of degree 6, and show that when strung\ntogether, their combined configuration spaces create mechanisms that isolate\ndeformations, constrain the configuration topology of neighboring vertices, or\nlead to sequential bistable folding throughout the entire origami sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 10:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

It is known that if $f$ depends on all its\nvariables, then the set of its extremal points completely specifies $f$ within\nthe universe of threshold functions. However, in some cases, $f$ can be\nspecified by a smaller set. The minimum number of points in such a set is the\nspecification number of $f$. It was shown in [S.-T. Hu. Threshold Logic, 1965]\nthat the specification number of a threshold function of $n$ variables is at\nleast $n+1$. In [M. Anthony, G. Brightwell, and J. Shawe-Taylor.

That work of Lenz and Ising\nmarked the start of a scientific direction that, over nearly 100 years,\ndelivered extraordinary successes in explaining collective behaviour in a vast\nvariety of systems, both within and beyond the natural sciences. The broadness\nof the appeal of the Ising model is reflected in the variety of talks presented\nat the Ising lectures ( http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/ising/ ) over the past two\ndecades but requires that we restrict this report to a small selection of\ntopics.

If the graviton has a small mass, the gravitational force at large\ndistances decreases more rapidly, which could contribute to explain the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. The massive spin-2 particles are\ncommonly described by the known Fierz-Pauli action which is formulated in terms\nof a symmetric tensor $h_{\\mu\\nu}=h_{\\nu\\mu}$. However, the Fierz-Pauli theory\nis not the only possible description of massive spin-2 particles via a rank-2\ntensor.

To achieve the\nsensitivity required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets in the NIR, simultaneous\nmonitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the\nimpact of variable telluric lines on radial velocity measurements and transit\nlight curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic\nMonitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch\naperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple\nObservatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to\ntrace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations\nwith the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red\ntelescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data\nanalysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken\nwith CAMAL.

Instead, we use a fully convolutional neural network as the segmentor\nto generate segmentation label maps, and propose a novel adversarial critic\nnetwork with a multi-scale $L_1$ loss function to force the critic and\nsegmentor to learn both global and local features that capture long- and\nshort-range spatial relationships between pixels.

On the basis of the main idea of HPM, we construct the appropriate\nhomotopy what leads to the problem of solving the set of linear equations.\nFirst of all, we consider the simple example of the Schwarzschild metric for\nwhich the approximate geodesics solutions are known, in order to compare the\nHPM solution for orbits with those obtained earlier. Moreover, we obtain an\napproximate HPM solution for the Reissner-Nordstorm spacetime of a charged\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 15:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

The classification of these phases has been\nknown for a long time, however, their transitions to the disordered isotropic\nliquid phase remain largely unexplored, except for a few symmetries. In this\nwork, we utilize a recently introduced non-Abelian gauge theory to explore the\nnature of the underlying nematic-isotropic transition for all three-dimensional\npolyhedral nematics. The gauge theory can readily be applied to nematic phases\nwith an arbitrary point-group symmetry, including those where traditional\nLandau methods and the associated lattice models may become too involved to\nimplement owing to a prohibitive order-parameter tensor of high rank or (the\nabsence of) mirror symmetries. By means of exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe find that the nematic-isotropic transition is generically first-order for\nall polyhedral symmetries. Moreover, we show that this universal result is\nfully consistent with our expectation from a renormalization group approach, as\nwell as with other lattice models for symmetries already studied in the\nliterature. We argue that extreme fine tuning is required to promote those\ntransitions to second order ones. We also comment on the nature of phase\ntransitions breaking the $O(3)$ symmetry in general cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 15:10:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

The signal was\nmeasured on January 4, 2017 at 10:11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of\nthe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second\nobserving run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm\nrate less than 1 in 70,000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are\n$31.2^{+8.4}_{-6.0}\\,M_\\odot$ and $19.4^{+5.3}_{-5.9}\\,M_\\odot$ (at the 90%\ncredible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement\nof the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the\nspin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, $\\chi_\\mathrm{eff} =\n-0.12^{+0.21}_{-0.30}.$ This result implies that spin configurations with both\ncomponent spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are\ndisfavored. The source luminosity distance is $880^{+450}_{-390}~\\mathrm{Mpc}$\ncorresponding to a redshift of $z = 0.18^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. We constrain the\nmagnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and\nperform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed\nin vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to $m_g \\le 7.7\n\\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{eV}/c^2$.

Conventional MTL\nworks under the offline or batch setting, and suffers from expensive training\ncost and poor scalability. To address such inefficiency issues, online learning\ntechniques have been applied to solve MTL problems. However, most existing\nalgorithms of online MTL constrain task relatedness into a presumed structure\nvia a single weight matrix, which is a strict restriction that does not always\nhold in practice. In this paper, we propose a robust online MTL framework that\novercomes this restriction by decomposing the weight matrix into two\ncomponents: the first one captures the low-rank common structure among tasks\nvia a nuclear norm and the second one identifies the personalized patterns of\noutlier tasks via a group lasso. Theoretical analysis shows the proposed\nalgorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to the best linear model\nin hindsight. Even though the above framework achieves good performance, the\nnuclear norm that simply adds all nonzero singular values together may not be a\ngood low-rank approximation. To improve the results, we use a log-determinant\nfunction as a non-convex rank approximation.

In particular, machine learning approaches have\nattracted increasing attentions recently. However, in addition to the known\ndrug-target interactions, most of the machine learning methods require extra\ncharacteristic information such as chemical structures, genome sequences,\nbinding types and so on.

Each kinetochore has to establish a\ntight bipolar attachment to the spindle apparatus before sister-chromatid\nseparation is initiated. The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) links the\nbiophysical attachment status of the kinetochores to mitotic progression, and\nensures that even a single misaligned kinetochore keeps the checkpoint active.\nThe mechanism by which this is achieved is still elusive. Current computational\nmodels of the human SAC disregard important biochemical properties by omitting\nany kind of feedback loop, proper kinetochore signals, and other spatial\nproperties such as the stability of the system and diffusion effects. To allow\nfor more realistic in silico study of the dynamics of the SAC model, a minimal\nmathematical framework for SAC activation and silencing is introduced. A\nnonlinear ordinary differential equation model successfully reproduces\nbifurcation signaling switches with attachment of all 92 kinetochores and\nactivation of APC/C by kinetochore-driven feedback. A partial differential\nequation model and mathematical linear stability analyses indicate the\ninfluence of diffusion and system stability. The conclusion is that\nquantitative models of the human SAC should account for the positive feedback\non APC/C activation driven by the kinetochores which is essential for SAC\nsilencing. Experimental diffusion coefficients for MCC sub-complexes are found\nto be insufficient for rapid APC/C inhibition.

If collections of such personal activities were made\npublicly available, they could be used to personalize a diverse range of\nservices, including targeted advertisement or recommendations. However, there\nwould be an accompanying risk of privacy violations. The pioneering work of\nNarayanan et al.\\ demonstrated that even if the identifiers are eliminated, the\npublic release of user ratings can allow for the identification of users by\nthose who have only a small amount of data on the users' past ratings.\n  In this paper, we assume the following setting. A collector collects user\nratings, then anonymizes and distributes them. A recommender constructs a\nrecommender system based on the anonymized ratings provided by the collector.\nBased on this setting, we exhaustively list the models of recommender systems\nthat use anonymized ratings. For each model, we then present an item-based\ncollaborative filtering algorithm for making recommendations based on\nanonymized ratings. Our experimental results show that an item-based\ncollaborative filtering based on anonymized ratings can perform better than\ncollaborative filterings based on 5--10 non-anonymized ratings. This surprising\nresult indicates that, in some settings, privacy protection does not\nnecessarily reduce the usefulness of recommendations. From the experimental\nanalysis of this counterintuitive result, we observed that the sparsity of the\nratings can be reduced by anonymization and the variance of the prediction can\nbe reduced if $k$, the anonymization parameter, is appropriately tuned. In this\nway, the predictive performance of recommendations based on anonymized ratings\ncan be improved in some settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 07:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}
