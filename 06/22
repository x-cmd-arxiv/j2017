Recently deep learning based models\nhave been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\\&MLP paradigm. In these\nmethods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional\nembedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a\ngroup-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way,\nuser features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in\nregardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a\nbottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\\&MLP methods to capture\nuser's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this\nchallenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the\nrepresentation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a\ncertain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the\nexpressive ability of model greatly.

This ensures that our\ndescription of inflation is both conformally and reparameterization covariant.\nOur formulation gives rise to extensions of the usual Hubble and potential\nslow-roll parameters to generalized fully frame-covariant forms, which allow us\nto provide manifestly frame-invariant predictions for cosmological observables,\nsuch as the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, the spectral indices $n_{\\cal R}$ and\n$n_T$, their runnings $\\alpha_{\\cal R}$ and $\\alpha_T$, the non-Gaussianity\nparameter $f_{NL}$, and the isocurvature fraction $\\beta_{\\rm iso}$. We examine\nthe role of the field space curvature in the generation and transfer of\nisocurvature modes, and we investigate the effect of boundary conditions for\nthe scalar fields at the end of inflation on the observable inflationary\nquantities. We explore the stability of the trajectories with respect to the\nboundary conditions by using a suitable sensitivity parameter. To illustrate\nour approach, we first analyze a simple minimal two-field scenario before\nstudying a more realistic nonminimal model inspired by Higgs inflation. We find\nthat isocurvature effects are greatly enhanced in the latter scenario and must\nbe taken into account for certain values in the parameter space such that the\nmodel is properly normalized to the observed scalar power spectrum $P_{\\cal\nR}$. Finally, we outline how our frame-covariant approach may be extended\nbeyond the tree-level approximation through the Vilkovisky-De Witt formalism,\nwhich we generalize to take into account conformal transformations, thereby\nleading to a fully frame-invariant effective action at the one-loop level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 17:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 10:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 13:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Although complex vertical\nheterostructures were fabricated via van der Waals stacking of different 2D\nmaterials, atomically sharp multi-junctions in lateral heterostructures is a\nquite challenging task, but a viable route towards the development of\ncommercial applications. Previously reported approaches to obtain\nsingle-junction lateral heterostructures of the type MoX2-WX2 (X= S and/or Se),\ninvolve either a single-step or a two-step growth process. However, these\nmethods lack the flexibility to control the lateral width of the TMD domain as\nwell as its composition. Here, we report a simple and yet scalable synthesis\napproach for the fabrication of lateral multi-junction heterostructures based\non the combination of different TMD monolayers [MoX2-WX2 (X2 = S2, Se2 or\nSSe)]. Atomically sharp lateral junctions are sequentially synthesized from\nsolid precursors by changing only the reactive gas environment in the presence\nof water vapor. This allows to selectively control the water-induced oxidation,\nvolatilization and hence the relative amount of a specific metal oxide vapor,\nleading to the selective edge-epitaxial growth of either MoX2 or WX2. Spatially\ndependent photoluminescence and atomic-resolution images confirm the high\ncrystallinity of the monolayers and the seamless lateral connectivity between\nthe different TMD domains.

There are only three potential\nexplanations of this fact. If the BH spin magnitudes are large then (i) either\nboth BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin\nangular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in\nmagnitude. Or, (iii) the BH spin magnitudes are small. We test the third\nhypothesis within the framework of the classical isolated binary evolution\nscenario of the BH-BH merger formation. We test three models of angular\nmomentum transport in massive stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional\ncurrents (as employed in the Geneva code), an efficient transport by the\nTayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (as implemented in the MESA code), and a\nvery-efficient transport (as proposed by Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH\nspins. We allow for binary evolution to increase the BH spins through accretion\nand account for the potential spin-up of stars through tidal interactions.\nAdditionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin BH masses,\ninclude revisions to the history of star formation and to the chemical\nevolution across cosmic time. We find that we can match simultaneously the\nobserved BH-BH merger rate density, BH masses, and effective spins. Models with\nefficient angular momentum transport are favored. The updated stellar-mass\nweighted gas-phase metallicity evolution now used in our models appears to be a\nkey in better reproducing the LIGO/Virgo merger rate estimate. Mass losses\nduring the pair-instability pulsation supernova phase are likely overestimated\nif the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive than 50 Msun. We also estimate\nrate of BH-NS mergers from recent LIGO/Virgo observations.

To examine TWA 3A's\ntime-variable accretion behavior, we have conducted a two-year, optical\nphotometric monitoring campaign, obtaining dense orbital phase coverage (~20\nobservations per orbit) for ~15 orbital periods. From U-band measurements we\nderive the time-dependent binary mass accretion rate, finding bursts of\naccretion near each periastron passage.

During the gate operation, the qutrit remains\nin the ground state; thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed.\nThis proposal requires only two basic operations and neither classical pulse\nnor measurement is needed; therefore the gate realization is simple. Numerical\nsimulations show that high-fidelity implementation of this gate is feasible\nwith current circuit QED technology.

This\nproperty is a quantitative relation between the geometry of the degeneration of\na Calabi-Yau variety $X$ and the monodromy action on the cohomology of $X$: a\nCalabi-Yau variety $X$ satisfies the monodromy property if poles of the motivic\nzeta function $Z_{X,\\omega}(T)$ induce monodromy eigenvalues on the cohomology\nof $X$.\n  In this thesis, we focus on $K3$ surfaces allowing a triple-point-free model,\ni.e., $K3$ surfaces allowing a strict normal crossings model such that three\nirreducible components of the special fiber never meet simultaneously. Crauder\nand Morrison classified these models into two main classes: so-called flowerpot\ndegenerations and chain degenerations. This classification is very precise,\nwhich allows to use a combination of geometrical and combinatorial techniques\nto check the monodromy property in practice.\n  The first main result is an explicit computation of the poles of\n$Z_{X,\\omega}(T)$ for a $K3$ surface $X$ allowing a triple-point-free model and\na volume form $\\omega$ on $X$. We show that the motivic zeta function can have\nmore than one pole. This is in contrast with previous results: so far, all\nCalabi-Yau varieties known to satisfy the monodromy property have a unique\npole. We prove that $K3$ surfaces allowing a flowerpot degeneration satisfy the\nmonodromy property. We also show that the monodromy property holds for $K3$\nsurfaces with a certain chain degeneration. We don't know whether all $K3$\nsurfaces with a chain degeneration satisfy the monodromy property, and we\ninvestigate what characteristics a $K3$ surface $X$ not satisfying the\nmonodromy property should have.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 19:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

In finite regions of the\nparameter space we observe periodic equilibrium states in which the average\nopinion densities are reversed with respect to naive expectations. Such\nequilibria occur in two cases: (i) when the frequencies of the competing\nmessages are different but close to each other; (ii) when the frequencies are\nequal and the relative time shift of the messages does not exceed half a\nperiod. We interpret the observed phenomena as a result of the interplay\nbetween the external fields and the internal dynamics of the agents and\nconclude that, depending on the model parameters, the naming game is consistent\nwith scenarios of first- or second-mover advantage (to borrow an expression\nfrom the jargon of business strategy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 19:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 09:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

Recently, online approaches have been introduced,\nwhere multiscale basis functions are adaptively constructed in some regions to\nreduce the error significantly. In multiscale methods, it is desired to have\nonly 1-2 iterations to reduce the error to a desired threshold. Using\nGeneralized Multiscale Finite Element Framework, it was shown that by choosing\nsufficient number of offline basis functions, the error reduction can be made\nindependent of physical parameters, such as scales and contrast.

In the distributed\ncyber-physical systems (CPS), often each sensor node used for measurement only\nknows partial independent rows of the least-squares system. To compute the\nleast-squares solution they need to gather all these measurement at a\ncentralized location and then compute the solution. These data collection and\ncomputation are inefficient because of bandwidth and time constraints and\nsometimes are infeasible because of data privacy concerns. Thus distributed\ncomputations are strongly preferred or demanded in many of the real world\napplications e.g.: smart-grid, target tracking etc. To compute least squares\nfor the large sparse system of linear equation iterative methods are natural\ncandidates and there are a lot of studies regarding this, however, most of them\nare related to the efficiency of centralized/parallel computations while and\nonly a few are explicitly about distributed computation or have the potential\nto apply in distributed networks.

A substitute for the [OII]\n3727 doublet is developed, permitting oxygen abundance estimates of SDSS dwarf\ngalaxies at all redshifts with the Direct Te method.

Properties of MDF are\nscrutinised with regard to broken symmetry and meson spectrum to discern their\nsuitability for numerical studies of QCD. Interactions induce anisotropic\noperator mixing for MDF. Hence, restoration of broken symmetries in the\ncontinuum limit requires three counterterms, one of which is power-law\ndivergent. Counterterms and operator mixing are studied perturbatively for two\nvariants of MDF. Two independent non-perturbative procedures for removal of the\npower-law divergence are developed by means of a numerical study of hadronic\nobservables for one variant of MDF in quenched approximation.

Other published results, on the\nother hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of\nyielding more accu- rate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this\npaper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified\nframework.

A unifying\nmathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each\ntraining method provides better validation results, being parallel training\nbetter in what is believed to be more realistic scenarios.

In this paper,\nwe establish a theory for the latter to clarify and quantify the longstanding\nopen question: the dependence of bubbles evolution on the dominant factors of\narbitrary density ratio, broadband initial perturbations and various material\nproperties (e.g., viscosity, miscibility, surface tensor). Evolution of the\nmost important characteristic quantities, i.e., the diameter of dominant bubble\n$D$ and the height of bubble zone $h$, is derived: (i) the $D$ expands\nself-similarly with steady aspect ratio $\\beta \\equiv D/h \\thickapprox (1{\\rm{\n+ }}A)/4$, depending only on dimensionless density ratio $A$, and (ii) the $h$\ngrows quadratically with constant growth coefficient $\\alpha \\equiv h/(Ag{t^2})\n\\thickapprox [2\\phi/{\\ln}(2{\\eta _{\\rm{0}}})]^2$, depending on both\ndimensionless initial perturbation amplitude ${\\eta _{\\rm{0}}}$ and\nmaterial-property-associated linear growth rate ratio\n$\\phi\\equiv\\Gamma_{actual}/\\Gamma_{ideal}\\leqslant1$.

The results are presented for\ndifferent particle size and associated to their possible signatures in disk\nobservations. Gap clearing in the dust spatial distribution could be due to the\ninteraction with a giant gaseous vortex and their associated spiral waves,\nwithout the gravitational assistance of a planet.

(2012). We also investigated the structure of the\nfootpoints of reconnected field lines. By comparing the distribution of\nreconstructed field lines and the observed flare ribbons, the trigger structure\nof the flare can be inferred. Our simulation suggests that the data-constrained\nsimulation taking into account both the large-scale magnetic structure and the\nsmall-scale magnetic disturbance such as emerging fluxes is a good way to find\nout a flare productive active region for space weather prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 02:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

Another hypothesis is that the wall fading is due to\nthe suppression of driver source (p-mode oscillation), resulting from the\nnearby avalanche of downward particles along reconnected brightening loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 03:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

We here take this research a step further by introducing a most\nsalient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic\nthat is key to understand much of the social phenomenology these days. We\nconsider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact\nstrategically with their neighbors but their preferences and payoffs for the\npossible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves\nunder evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely\ncoordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence\nof the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response\ndynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional\nimitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted\nequilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete Information, and we\ndemonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function\nparameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with available\nexperimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees\nbetter with the experiment that standard economic theories, and draw hints as\nto how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Specifically, we express the generating\nfunction using the path integral along Keldysh contour and obtain exact\nsolution of the generating function using the Grassmann algebra. With this\nformalism, we calculate the transient energy current and higher order cumulants\nfor both single and double quantum dot (QD) systems in the transient regime. To\nexamine finite bandwidth effect of leads to FCS of energy transport, we have\nused an exact solvable model with a Lorentizian linewidth where all\nnon-equilibrium Green's functions can be solved exactly in the time domain. It\nis found that the transient energy current exhibits damped oscillatory\nbehavior. For the single quantum dot system the frequency of oscillation is\nindependent of bandwidth of the leads while the decay rate of the oscillation\namplitude is determined by the lifetime of resonant state which increases as\nthe bandwidth decreases. At short times, a universal scaling of maximum\namplitude of normalized cumulants is identified for the single QD system. For\nthe double QD system, the damped oscillation of energy current is dominated by\nRabi oscillation with frequency approximately proportional to the coupling\nconstant between two quantum dots. In general, the transient energy current\nincreases when the coupling between two QDs is stronger. However, when the\ninterdot coupling is larger than half of the external bias the transient energy\ncurrent is suppressed significantly.

The number of cluster is then inferred\na posteriori from the data.\n  The present paper makes the following contributions in the context of sparse\nfinite mixture modelling. First, it is illustrated that the concept of sparse\nfinite mixture is very generic and easily extended to cluster various types of\nnon-Gaussian data, in particular discrete data and continuous multivariate data\narising from non-Gaussian clusters. Second, sparse finite mixtures are compared\nto Dirichlet process mixtures with respect to their ability to identify the\nnumber of clusters. For both model classes, a random hyper prior is considered\nfor the parameters determining the weight distribution. By suitable matching of\nthese priors, it is shown that the choice of this hyper prior is far more\ninfluential on the cluster solution than whether a sparse finite mixture or a\nDirichlet process mixture is taken into consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 15:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 07:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

Enforcing these policies is crucial to avoid\nfrauds and malicious use, but it may lead to situations where a workflow\ninstance cannot be completed without the violation of the policy. The Workflow\nSatisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an assignment of users\nto tasks in a workflow such that every task is executed and the policy is not\nviolated. The WSP is inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a\npractical application in reconciling business compliance and business\ncontinuity.

While its implementations(e.g., Pregel, Giraph, and Hama) achieve high\nscalability, frequent synchronization and communication among the workers can\ncause substantial parallel inefficiency. To help address this critical concern,\nthis paper introduces the GraphHP(Graph Hybrid Processing) platform which\ninherits the friendly vertex-centric BSP programming interface and optimizes\nits synchronization and communication overhead.\n  To achieve the goal, we first propose a hybrid execution model which\ndifferentiates between the computations within a graph partition and across the\npartitions, and decouples the computations within a partition from distributed\nsynchronization and communication. By implementing the computations within a\npartition by pseudo-superstep iteration in memory, the hybrid execution model\ncan effectively reduce synchronization and communication overhead while not\nrequiring heavy scheduling overhead or graph-centric sequential algorithms. We\nthen demonstrate how the hybrid execution model can be easily implemented\nwithin the BSP abstraction to preserve its simple programming interface.\nFinally, we evaluate our implementation of the GraphHP platform on classical\nBSP applications and show that it performs significantly better than the\nstate-of-the-art BSP implementations.

A fundamental problem is establishing its\nconsistency for the distribution of a sample mean, as a prototypical statistic.\nWe use a structural relationship with subsampling to characterize the bootstrap\nin a new and general manner. While subsampling and block bootstrap differ, the\nblock bootstrap distribution of a sample mean equals that of a $k$-fold\nself-convolution of a subsampling distribution. Motivated by this, we provide\nsimple necessary and sufficient conditions for a convolved subsampling\nestimator to produce a normal limit that matches the target of bootstrap\nestimation. These conditions may be linked to consistency properties of an\noriginal subsampling distribution, which are often obtainable under minimal\nassumptions.

Here we\ninvestigate the shear viscosity of homogeneous, population-imbalanced Fermi\ngases with tunable attractive interactions at finite temperatures by using a\npairing fluctuation theory for thermodynamical quantities and a gauge-invariant\nlinear response theory for transport coefficients. In the unitary and BEC\nregimes, the shear viscosity increases with the polarization because the excess\nmajority fermions cause gapless excitations acting like a normal fluid. In the\nweak BEC regime the excess fermions also suppress the noncondensed pairs at low\npolarization, and we found a minimum in the ratio of shear viscosity and\nrelaxation time. To help constrain the relaxation time from linear response\ntheory, we derive an exact relation connecting some thermodynamic quantities\nand transport coefficients at the mean-field level for unitary Fermi\nsuperfluids with population imbalance. An approximate relation beyond\nmean-field theory is proposed and only exhibits mild deviations from numerical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 10:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

The phenomenon provides the possibility for\nmanipulation of particles which are immersed in the fluid. The analysis shows\nthat the amplitude of the established eddy currents produced by stationary\nsurface waves does not depend on the fluid viscosity in the free surface case.\nThe currents become parametrically larger being inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the fluid viscosity in the case when the fluid surface is\ncovered by an almost incompressible thin liquid (i.e. shear elasticity is zero)\nfilm formed by an insoluble agent with negligible internal viscous losses as\ncompared to the dissipation in the fluid bulk. Here we extend the theory for a\nthin insoluble film with zero shear elasticity and small shear and dilational\nviscosities on the case of an arbitrary elastic compression modulus. We find\nboth contributions into the Lagrangian motion of passive tracers, which are the\nadvection by the Eulerian vertical vorticity and the Stokes drift. Whereas the\nStokes drift contribution preserves its value for the free surface case outside\na thin viscous sublayer, the Eulerian vertical vorticity strongly depends on\nthe fluid viscosity at high values of the film compression modulus. The Stokes\ndrift acquires a strong dependence on the fluid viscosity inside the viscous\nsublayer, however, the change is compensated by an opposite change in the\nEulerian vertical vorticity. As a result, the vertical dependence of the\nintensity of eddy currents is given by a sum of two decaying exponents with\nboth decrements being of the order of the wave number. The decrements are\nnumerically different, so the Eulerian contribution becomes dominant at some\ndepth for the surface film with any compression modulus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 13:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 08:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 20:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

We compare\nthe production of electron-positron pairs and gamma-photons via quantum\nelectrodynamics processes in the relativistic transparent and opaque regimes,\nand find that the target transparency can significantly enhance the\nelectron-positron pair production due to the formation of stable standing wave\n(SW). An optimum foil density of 200 - 280 n_c (n_c is the laser critical\ndensity) is found for enhancing electron-positron pair production when laser\nintensity reaches a few 10e23 W/cm2. At such foil density, laser energy\nconversion to electron-positron pairs is approximately four times higher than\nat foil density of 710n_c, whereas laser energy conversion to gamma-photons\nkeeps almost the same. Consequently, high dense electron-positron plasma with a\nmaximum intensity above 10e20 W/cm2 is produced.

The resulting\nsmearing effect in the density is a rather generic feature, occurring when\nsolitonic structures are exposed to quantum fluctuations. Here, we show that\nthis filling owes its existence to the dynamical building of an antidark\nstructure developed in the next-to-leading order orbital. We further\ndemonstrate that the aforementioned beyond mean-field dynamics can be\nexperimentally detected using the variance of single shot measurements.\nAdditionally, a variety of excitations including vortices, oblique dark\nsolitons, and open ring dark soliton-like structures building upon higher-lying\norbitals is observed. We demonstrate that signatures of the higher-lying\norbital excitations emerge in the total density, and can be clearly captured by\ninspecting the one-body coherence. In the latter context, the localization of\none-body correlations exposes the existence of the multi-orbital\nvortex-antidark structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

The consideration is made with the use of a quasi-classical\ndescription of the gravitational shift that lies in the frame of nonmetric\ntheories of gravity. It is assumed that the cosmological potential is formed by\nall matter of the Universe (including dark matter and dark energy) and that it\nis spatially uniform on planet scales. It is obvious that the cosmological\npotential, $\\Phi_\\text{CP}$, is several orders of magnitude greater than\nEarth's gravitational potential $\\varphi_\\text{E}$ (where\n$|\\varphi_\\text{E}/c^2|\\sim 10^{-9}$ on Earth's surface). In our method, the\ntick rates of identical atomic clocks are compared at two points with different\ngravitational potentials, i.e. at different heights.

An opposite approach to end-to-end is feature\nlearning, which firstly trains a feature learning model, and then constructs a\nback-end classifier separately to perform SV. Recently, both approaches\nachieved significant performance gains on SV, mainly attributed to the smart\nutilization of deep neural networks.

Although these datasets can be fitted by\ndifferent functions at different income ranges, the Tsallis distribution has\nrecently been found capable of fitting the whole distribution by means of only\ntwo parameters. This procedure showed clearly such oscillatory feature in the\nentire income range feature, but made it particularly visible at the tail of\nthe distribution. Although log-periodic functions fitted to the data are\ncapable of describing this behavior, a different approach to naturally disclose\nsuch oscillatory characteristics is to allow the Tsallis $q$-parameter to\nbecome complex. In this paper we use this idea in order to describe the\nbehavior of the CCDF of the Brazilian personal income recently studied\nempirically by Soares et al.\\ (2016). Typical elements of periodic motion, such\nas amplitude and angular frequency coupled to this income analysis, were\nobtained by means of this approach.

We consider a tree, a square grid and as a real grid topology, the\nGerman transmission grid. We identify ranges of parameters with different\ntransient dynamics: the disturbance decays exponentially in time, superimposed\nby oscillations with the fast decay rate of a single node, or with a smaller\ndecay rate without oscillations. Most remarkably, as the grid inertia is\nlowered, nodes may become correlated, slowing down the propagation from\nballistic to diffusive motion, decaying with a power law in time. Applying\nlinear response theory, we show that tree grids have a spectral gap leading to\nexponential relaxation as protected by topology and independent on grid size.\nMeshed grids are found to have a spectral gap which decreases with increasing\ngrid size, leading to slow power law relaxation and collective diffusive\npropagation of disturbances. We conclude by discussing consequences if no\nmeasures are undertaken to preserve the grid inertia in the energy transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 19:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 09:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 17:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}
