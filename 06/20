One of the fundamental issues for ab initio calculations is\nthat hybrid interfaces combining materials with Wannier-Mott excitons and those\nwith Frenkel excitons can easily require thousands of atoms to encompass the\nexciton-wave function. The problem is further exacerbated by a large\npermittivity difference at the interface, which requires meso-scale boundary\nconditions to accurately predict electrostatic potentials. For these reasons,\nwe have constructed a model of excited states at hybrid interfaces based on an\neffective mass Schroedinger equation. In this continuum model, carrier wave\nfunctions are represented by their envelope function rather than resolving the\natomic scale variations. Electrostatic interactions are accounted for using the\nPoisson equation. For our model system, we use a pentacene/silicon interface.\nBecause carrier mobility is low in pentacene relative to silicon, the hole is\nfrozen such that it only interacts with the electron though an immobile\npositive charge density. The inputs to this model are as follows: dielectric\npermittivities, electron effective masses, interfacial width, band alignment,\nand the hole wave function. We find that the energetic favorability of charge\ntransfer states relative to bulk excitons is most easily controlled by band\nalignment. However, when both states have similar energies, interface proximity\nand electrostatics become important secondary means of tuning the relative\nstability of these states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

This microflare shows heating of\nmaterial to several million Kelvin, observed in Soft X-rays (SXRs) with\nHinode/XRT, and was faintly visible in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) with SDO/AIA.\nFor three of the four NuSTAR observations of this region (pre-, decay, and post\nphases) the spectrum is well fitted by a single thermal model of 3.2-3.5 MK,\nbut the spectrum during the impulsive phase shows additional emission up to 10\nMK, emission equivalent to A0.1 GOES class. We recover the differential\nemission measure (DEM) using SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT, and NuSTAR, giving\nunprecedented coverage in temperature. We find the pre-flare DEM peaks at ~3 MK\nand falls off sharply by 5 MK; but during the microflare's impulsive phase the\nemission above 3 MK is brighter and extends to 10 MK, giving a heating rate of\nabout $2.5 \\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

Although various scenarios have\nbeen suggested to date, the tether-cutting reconnection scenario proposed by\nMoore et al.(2001) is one of the widely accepted models to explain the onset\nprocess of solar eruptions. Although the tether-cutting reconnection scenario\nproposed that sigmoidal field formed by the internal reconnection is the\nmagnetic field in pre-eruptive state, the stability of the sigmoidal field has\nnot yet been investigated quantitatively. In this paper, in order to elucidate\nthe stability problem of pre-eruptive state, we developed a simple numerical\nanalysis, in which the sigmoidal field is modeled by a double arc electric\ncurrent loop and its stability is analyzed. As a result, we found that the\ndouble arc loop is more easily destabilized than the axisymmetric torus, and it\nbecomes unstable even if the external field does not decay with altitude, which\nis in contrast to the axisymmetric torus instability. This suggests that the\ntether-cutting reconnection may well work as the onset mechanism of solar\neruptions, and if so the critical condition for eruption under certain geometry\nmay be determined by a new type of instability rather than the torus\ninstability. Based on them, we propose a new type of instability called double\narc instability (DAI). We discuss the critical conditions for DAI and derive a\nnew parameter $\\kappa$ defined as the product of the magnetic twist and the\nnormalized flux of tether-cutting reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 18:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

In contrast, in AI and robotics, a robot's body plan is usually\ndesigned by hand, and control policies are then optimized for that fixed\ndesign. The task of simultaneously co-optimizing the morphology and controller\nof an embodied robot has remained a challenge. In psychology, the theory of\nembodied cognition posits that behavior arises from a close coupling between\nbody plan and sensorimotor control, which suggests why co-optimizing these two\nsubsystems is so difficult: most evolutionary changes to morphology tend to\nadversely impact sensorimotor control, leading to an overall decrease in\nbehavioral performance. Here, we further examine this hypothesis and\ndemonstrate a technique for \"morphological innovation protection\", which\ntemporarily reduces selection pressure on recently morphologically-changed\nindividuals, thus enabling evolution some time to \"readapt\" to the new\nmorphology with subsequent control policy mutations. We show the potential for\nthis method to avoid local optima and converge to similar highly fit\nmorphologies across widely varying initial conditions, while sustaining fitness\nimprovements further into optimization. While this technique is admittedly only\nthe first of many steps that must be taken to achieve scalable optimization of\nembodied machines, we hope that theoretical insight into the cause of\nevolutionary stagnation in current methods will help to enable the automation\nof robot design and behavioral training -- while simultaneously providing a\ntestbed to investigate the theory of embodied cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 18:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

Randomized experiments are often costly and impractical and in\ninstrumental variable regression the number of instruments has to exceed the\nnumber of causal predictors. It was recently shown in Peters et al. [2016] that\ncausal inference for the full model is possible when data from distinct\nobservational environments are available, exploiting that the conditional\ndistribution of a response variable is invariant under the correct causal\nmodel. Two shortcomings of such an approach are the high computational effort\nfor large-scale data and the assumed absence of hidden confounders. Here we\nshow that these two shortcomings can be addressed if one is willing to make a\nmore restrictive assumption on the type of interventions that generate\ndifferent environments. Thereby, we look at a different notion of invariance,\nnamely inner-product invariance. By avoiding a computationally cumbersome\nreverse-engineering approach such as in Peters et al.

We discuss\nidentifiability conditions for the causal parameter and derive asymptotic\nconfidence intervals in the low-dimensional setting.

Prior to\ngravitational collapse, kinematical backreaction ($Q_D$) justifies this\napproach in a Newtonian context. However, the final stages of a gravitational\ncollapse event are sudden; a globally imposed expansion rate thus forces at\nleast one expanding region to suddenly decelerate. This is relativistically\nunrealistic. Instead, we allow non-collapsed domains to evolve in volume\naccording to the $Q_D$ Zel'dovich Approximation (QZA). We study the inferred\naverage expansion under this \"silent\" virialisation hypothesis. We set standard\n(mpgrafic) EdS cosmological $N$-body initial conditions. Using RAMSES, we call\nDTFE to estimate the initial values of the three invariants of the extrinsic\ncurvature tensor in Lagrangian domains $D$. We integrate the Raychaudhuri\nequation in each domain using inhomog, adopt the stable clustering hypothesis\n(VQZA), and average spatially. We adopt an early-epoch--normalised EdS\nreference-model Hubble constant $H_1^{bg} = 37.7$ km/s/Mpc and an effective\nHubble constant $H_0^{eff} = 67.7$ km/s/Mpc. From 2000 simulations at\nresolution $256^3$, a unity effective scale factor is reached at 13.8~Gyr (16%\nabove EdS) for an averaging scale of $L_{13.8}=2.5^{+0.1}_{-0.4}$\nMpc/$h^{eff}$.

Here, we present in detail the physics implemented\nin SkyNet with a focus on a self-consistent transition to and from nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium (NSE) to non-equilibrium nuclear burning, our\nimplementation of electron screening, and coupling of the network to an\nequation of state. We also present comprehensive code tests and comparisons\nwith existing nuclear reaction networks. We find that SkyNet agrees with\npublished results and other codes to an accuracy of a few percent.\nDiscrepancies, where they exist, can be traced to differences in the physics\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 22:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 18:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Robotic harvesting offers an\nattractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more\nregular and selective harvesting, optimising crop quality, scheduling and\ntherefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a\nnovel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. We\ndemonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a\ngrasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To\nreduce the complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on\npicking sweet peppers in a protected cropping environment where plants are\ngrown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in protected cropping\nenvironments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.\nThe results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and\ndetach crop from the plant within a real protected cropping system. The novel\ncontributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging\nimprovements in sweet pepper picking success rates compared with the\nstate-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting sweet pepper peduncles and\nimproving the total harvesting cycle time for each sweet pepper.

Some current researches are focusing on modelling\nindividual and collective geographical preferences for spatial item\nrecommendation based on users' check-in records, but they fail to explore the\nphenomenon of user interest drift across geographical regions, i.e., users\nwould show different interests when they travel to different regions. Besides,\nthey ignore the influence of public comments for subsequent users' check-in\nbehaviors. Specifically, it is intuitive that users would refuse to check in to\na spatial item whose historical reviews seem negative overall, even though it\nmight fit their interests. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend the right\nitem to the right user at the right location. In this paper, we propose a\nlatent probabilistic generative model called LSARS to mimic the decision-making\nprocess of users' check-in activities both in home-town and out-of-town\nscenarios by adapting to user interest drift and crowd sentiments, which can\nlearn location-aware and sentiment-aware individual interests from the contents\nof spatial items and user reviews. Due to the sparsity of user activities in\nout-of-town regions, LSARS is further designed to incorporate the public\npreferences learned from local users' check-in behaviors. Finally, we deploy\nLSARS into two practical application scenes: spatial item recommendation and\ntarget user discovery. Extensive experiments on two large-scale location-based\nsocial networks (LBSNs) datasets show that LSARS achieves better performance\nthan existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 01:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

The framework for this high-order ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) solver is typically described wherein a low-order approximation (such as\nforward or backward Euler) is lifted to higher order accuracy by applying the\nsame low-order method to an error equation and then adding in the resulting\ndefect to correct the solution. Our focus is not on solving the error equation\nto increase the order of accuracy, but on rewriting the solver as an iterative\nPicard integral equation solver. In doing so, our chief finding is that it is\nnot the low-order solver that picks up the order of accuracy with each\ncorrection, but it is the underlying quadrature rule of the right hand side\nfunction that is solely responsible for picking up additional orders of\naccuracy. Our proofs point to a total of three sources of errors that SDC\nmethods carry: the error at the current time point, the error from the previous\niterate, and the numerical integration error that comes from the total number\nof quadrature nodes used for integration. The second of these two sources of\nerrors is what separates SDC methods from Picard integral equation methods; our\nfindings indicate that as long as difference between the current and previous\niterate always gets multiplied by at least a constant multiple of the time step\nsize, then high-order accuracy can be found even if the underlying \"solver\" is\ninconsistent the underlying ODE.

The diffusion profile\ncan be described by the ensemble average propagator (EAP), which is inferred\nfrom observed diffusion signals. However, accurate EAP estimation using the\nnumber of diffusion gradients that is clinically practical can be challenging.\nIn this work, we propose a deep learning algorithm for EAP estimation, which is\nnamed learning-based ensemble average propagator estimation (LEAPE). The EAP is\ncommonly represented by a basis and its associated coefficients, and here we\nchoose the SHORE basis and design a deep network to estimate the coefficients.\nThe network comprises two cascaded components. The first component is a\nmultiple layer perceptron (MLP) that simultaneously predicts the unknown\ncoefficients. However, typical training loss functions, such as mean squared\nerrors, may not properly represent the geometry of the possibly non-Euclidean\nspace of the coefficients, which in particular causes problems for the\nextraction of directional information from the EAP. Therefore, to regularize\nthe training, in the second component we compute an auxiliary output of\napproximated fiber orientation (FO) errors with the aid of a second MLP that is\ntrained separately. We performed experiments using dMRI data that resemble\nclinically achievable $q$-space sampling, and observed promising results\ncompared with the conventional EAP estimation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 03:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Comparing results using Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates in the\ncontext of the proposed framework it is argued that: i)~observability does not\nplay a significant role in phase synchronization, although it is granted that\nit might be relevant for complete synchronization; and ii)~a practical\ndifficulty is faced when phase synchronization is aimed at but the control\naction is not a direct function of the phase error. A procedure for overcoming\nsuch a problem is proposed. The only assumption made is that the phase can be\nestimated using the arctangent function. The main aspects of the paper are\nillustrated using the Poincar\\'e equations, van der Pol and R\\\"ossler\noscillators in dynamical regimes for which the phase is well defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 05:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Although the SGD iteration is\ncomputationally cheap and the practical performance of this method may be\nsatisfactory under certain circumstances, there is recent evidence of its\nconvergence difficulties and instability for unappropriate parameters choice.\nTo avoid these drawbacks naturally introduced by the SGD scheme, the stochastic\nproximal point algorithms have been recently considered in the literature. We\nintroduce a new variant of the stochastic proximal point method (SPP) for\nsolving stochastic convex optimization problems subject to (in)finite\nintersection of constraints satisfying a linear regularity type condition. For\nthe newly introduced SPP scheme we prove new nonasymptotic convergence results.\nIn particular, for convex and Lipschitz continuous objective functions, we\nprove nonasymptotic estimates for the rate of convergence in terms of the\nexpected value function gap of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^{1/2})$, where $k$ is the\niteration counter. We also derive better nonasymptotic bounds for the rate of\nconvergence in terms of expected quadratic distance from the iterates to the\noptimal solution for smooth strongly convex objective functions, which in the\nbest case is of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$. Since these convergence rates can be\nattained by our SPP algorithm only under some natural restrictions on the\nstepsize, we also introduce a restarting variant of SPP method that overcomes\nthese difficulties and derive the corresponding nonasymptotic convergence\nrates. Numerical evidence supports the effectiveness of our methods in\nreal-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

We present a detailed two-dimensional simulation,\nincluding thermal cooling, of a bubble formed by the wind of a star. We also\nstudy the first interaction of the wind bubble with the jet using a\nthree-dimensional simulation in which the star enters the jet. Stability\nanalysis is carried out for the shocked wind structure, to evaluate the\ndistances over which the jet-dragged wind, which forms a tail, can propagate\nwithout mixing with the jet flow. The two-dimensional simulations point at\nquick wind bubble expansion and fragmentation after about one bubble shock\ncrossing time. Three-dimensional simulations and stability analysis point at\nlocal mixing in the case of strong perturbations and relatively small density\nratios between the jet and the jet dragged-wind, and to a possibly more stable\nshocked wind structure at the phase of maximum tail mass flux. Analytical\nestimates also indicate that very early stages of the star jet-penetration time\nmay be also relevant for mass loading. The combination of these and previous\nresults from the literature suggest highly unstable interaction structures and\nefficient wind-jet flow mixing on the scale of the jet interaction height,\npossibly producing strong inhomogeneities within the jet.

Nowadays, automatic misinformation identification has drawn\nattention from academic and industrial communities. For an event on social\nmedia usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly based\non global statistical features. However, information on social media is full of\nnoisy and outliers, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most of microblogs\nabout an event have little contribution to the identification of\nmisinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless\ninformation. Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for a\nreliable misinformation identification method. In this paper, we propose an\nAttention-based approach for Identification of Misinformation (AIM). Based on\nthe attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with largest attention\nvalues for misinformation identification. The attention mechanism in AIM\ncontains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention\nis calculated based textual features of each microblog. Dynamic attention is\nrelated to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the\nbeginning of the event. To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on\nthe Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, and the experimental results show\nthat the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 08:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

In particular, we study\nwhether they establish resonant chains, whether these chains are prone to\ninstabilities and if giant planet cores form through embryo merging, thus\noccurring more rapidly than by pebble accretion alone.\n  Methods: For the first time, we perform self-consistent global-scale\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations of a two-fluid protoplanetary disk\nconsisting of gas and pebbles, the latter being accreted by embedded embryos.\nAccretion heating, along with other radiative processes, is accounted for to\ncorrectly model the Type-I migration.\n  Results: We track the evolution of four super-Earth-like embryos, initially\nlocated in a region where the disk structure allows for a convergent migration.\nGenerally, embryo merging is facilitated by rapidly increasing embryo masses\nand breaks the otherwise oligarchic growth. Moreover, we find that the orbital\neccentricity of each embryo is considerably excited ($\\simeq0.03$) due to the\npresence of an asymmetric underdense lobe of gas, a so-called `hot trail',\nproduced by accretion heating of the embryo's vicinity.

To extract\nthe network of interactions among oscillators, amplitude and phase\nperturbations are impulsively introduced to the oscillators and the ensuing\ndynamics are analyzed.

Each pixel has a global impact on the reconstruction and optimal data\nlocations are strongly correlated with their corresponding colour values. These\nfacts make it hard to predict which feature works best.\n  In this paper we discuss quantisation strategies based on popular methods\nsuch as k-means. We are lead to the central question which kind of feature\nvectors are best suited for image compression. To this end we consider choices\nsuch as the pixel values, the histogram or the colour map.\n  Our findings show that the number of colours can be reduced significantly\nwithout impacting the reconstruction quality.

Modern wireless communication networks are required to\naccommodate significantly varied types of mobile devices, differing in\navailable computational power or number of equipped antennas. Additionally, the\ndensity of the networks increases rapidly, and many communication protocols\ndiverge from the classical direct point-to-point transmission in favor of\nallowing for intermediate relays to process and forward data.

Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty\ndetection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called\none-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns\namong sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the\nwhole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set\nof objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database,\npresent also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose\npatterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with\nthe model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with\nspurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of\ngenuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample\nof heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky\nand in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also\nallowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and\ncompact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with\nstandard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by\naccounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are\notherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds\nflexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the\nreliability and representativeness of the training samples.

Unlike some experimental results,\nsimulations show that disordered packings of pinacoids (eight-face convex\npolyhedron) achieve higher solid fraction values than amorphous packings of\nspherical or rounded particles, thus fulfilling the analogue of Ulam's\nconjecture stated by Jiao and co-workers for random packings [Y.

This seeming\ndiscrepancy between experimental and numerical results is believed to lie with\ndifficulties in overcoming interparticle friction through experimental\ndensification processes. Moreover, solid fraction is shown to increase further\nwith bidispersity and peak when the volume proportion of small particles\nreaches $30\\%$. Contrarywise, substituting up to $50\\%$ of flat pinacoids for\nisometric ones yields solid fraction decrease, especially when flat particles\nare also elongated. Nevertheless, particle shape seems to play a minor role on\npacking solid fraction compared to polydispersity. Additional investigations\nfocused on the packing microstructure confirm that pinacoid packings fulfill\nthe isostatic conjecture and that they are free of order except beyond $30$ to\n$50\\%$ of flat or flat \\& elongated polyhedra in the packing. This order\nincrease progressively takes the form of a nematic phase caused by the\nreorientation of flat or flat \\& elongated particles to minimize the packing\npotential energy. Simultaneously, this reorientation seems to increase the\nsolid fraction value slightly above the maximum achieved by monodisperse\nisometric pinacoids, as well as the coordination number. Finally, partial\nsubstitution of elongated pinacoids for isometric ones has limited effect on\npacking solid fraction or order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 13:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

One popular\napproach is to use L2,1 norm function as a robust error/loss function. However,\nthe robustness of L2,1 norm function is not well understood so far. In this\npaper, we propose a new Vector Outlier Regularization (VOR) framework to\nunderstand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Our VOR function\ndefines a data point to be outlier if it is outside a threshold with respect to\na theoretical prediction, and regularize it-pull it back to the threshold line.\nWe then prove that L2,1 function is the limiting case of this VOR with the\nusual least square/L2 error function as the threshold shrinks to zero. One\ninteresting property of VOR is that how far an outlier lies away from its\ntheoretically predicted value does not affect the final regularization and\nanalysis results. This VOR property unmasks one of the most peculiar property\nof L2,1 norm function: The effects of outliers seem to be independent of how\noutlying they are-if an outlier is moved further away from the intrinsic\nmanifold/subspace, the final analysis results do not change. VOR provides a new\nway to understand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Applying\nVOR to matrix factorization leads to a new VORPCA model.

The\nused approach is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo\nstress correlation function into the correlation functions between the atomic\nlevel stresses. Previously we used the approach to study an iron-like single\ncomponent system of particles. The role of vibrational motion has been\naddressed through the demonstration of the relationship between viscosity and\nthe shear waves propagating over large distances. In our previous\nconsiderations, however, we did not discuss the role of the structural\nrelaxation. Here we suggest that the contribution to viscosity from the\nstructural relaxation can be taken into account through the consideration of\nthe contribution from the atomic stress auto-correlation term only. This\nconclusion, however, does not mean that only the auto-correlation term\nrepresents the contribution to viscosity from the structural relaxation.\nPreviously the role of the structural relaxation for viscosity has been\naddressed through the considerations of the transitions between inherent\nstructures and within the mode-coupling theory by other authors. In the present\nwork, we study the structural relaxation through the considerations of the\nparent liquid and the atomic level stress correlations in it. The comparison\nwith the results obtained on the inherent structures also is made. Our results\nsuggest that in the supercooled liquid regime the vibrational contribution to\nviscosity extends over the times which are much larger than the Einstein's\nvibrational period and much larger than the times which it takes for the shear\nwaves to propagate over the model systems. Besides addressing the atomic level\nshear stress correlations, we also studied correlations between the atomic\nlevel pressure elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 08:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

We have previously shown, through 2D (axisymmetric) non-ideal MHD\nsimulations, that removing very small grains (VSGs: ~10 \\AA$~$to few 100 \\AA)\ncan greatly enhance ambipolar diffusion and enable the formation of RSDs. Here\nwe extend the simulations of disk formation enabled by VSG removal to 3D.

As a\nresult, the bulk neutral envelope matter can collapse without dragging much\nmagnetic flux into the disk-forming region, which lowers the magnetic braking\nefficiency. We find that the initial disks enabled by VSG removal tend to be\nToomre-unstable, which leads to the formation of prominent spiral structures\nthat function as centrifugal barriers. The piling-up of infall material near\nthe centrifugal barrier often produces dense fragments of tens of Jupiter\nmasses, especially in cores that are not too strongly magnetized. Some\nfragments accrete onto the central stellar object, producing bursts in mass\naccretion rate.

Using a large data set with many thousands of\npublication profiles of individual researchers, this study tests the ability of\nthe JIF (in its normalized variant) to identify, at the beginning of their\ncareers, those candidates who will be successful in the long run. Instead of\nbare JIFs and citation counts, the metrics used here are standardized according\nto Web of Science subject categories and publication years. The results of the\nstudy indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) is able to discriminate\nbetween researchers who published papers later on with a citation impact above\nor below average in a field and publication year - not only in the short term,\nbut also in the long term. However, the low to medium effect sizes of the\nresults also indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) should not be\nused as the sole criterion for identifying later success: other criteria, such\nas the novelty and significance of the specific research, academic\ndistinctions, and the reputation of previous institutions, should also be\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 15:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

There are few papers\nabout this question. This work investigates the relationship between the air\npollution and solar activity by using the geophysical and environmental data\nduring the period of 2000-2016. It is quite certain that the solar activity may\nimpact on the air pollution, but the relationship is very weak and indirect.\nThe Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, Kendalls rank correlation,\nand conditional probability were adopted to analyze the air pollution index\n(API), air quality index (AQI), sunspot number (SSN), radio flux at wavelength\nof 10.7 cm (F10.7), and total solar irradiance (TSI). The analysis implies that\nthe correlation coefficient between API and SSN is weak ($-0.17<r<0.32$) with\ncomplex variation. The main results are: (1) For cities with higher air\npollution, the probability of high API will be increased along with SSN, then\nreach to a maximum, and then decreased; (2) For cities with lower air\npollution, the API has lower correlation with SSN; (3) The relationship between\nAPI and F10.7, or API and TSI are also similar as API and SSN. The solar\nactivities take direct effect on TSI and the energetic particle flux, and\nindirect and long-term effect on lower atmosphere and weather near the Earth.\nAll of these factors contribute to the air pollution on the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 00:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

These constraints are realized because excessive bremsstrahlung\nradiation of the dark photon can lead to rapid cooling of the SN1987A\nprogenitor core, in contradiction to the observed neutrinos from that event.\nThe models we consider are of interest as phenomenological models of strongly\nself-interacting dark matter. We clarify several possible ambiguities in the\nliterature and identify errors in prior analyses. We find constraints on the\ndark photon mixing parameter that are in rough agreement with the early\nestimates of Dent et al., but only because significant errors in their analyses\nfortuitously canceled. Our constraints are in good agreement with subsequent\nanalyses by Rrapaj & Reddy and Hardy & Lasenby. We estimate the dark photon\nbremsstrahlung rate using one-pion exchange (OPE), while Rrapaj & Reddy use a\nsoft radiation approximation (SRA) to exploit measured nuclear scattering cross\nsections. We find that the differences between mixing parameter constraints\nobtained through the OPE approximation or the SRA approximation are roughly a\nfactor of $\\sim 2-3$. Hardy & Laseby include plasma effects in their\ncalculations finding significantly weaker constraints on dark photon mixing for\ndark photon masses below $\\sim 10\\, \\mathrm{MeV}$. We do not consider plasma\neffects. Lastly, we point out that the properties of the SN1987A progenitor\ncore remain somewhat uncertain and that this uncertainty alone causes\nuncertainty of at least a factor of $\\sim 2-3$ in the excluded values of the\ndark photon mixing parameter. Further refinement of these estimates is\nunwarranted until either the interior of the SN1987A progenitor is more well\nunderstood or additional, large, and heretofore neglected effects, are\nidentified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 13:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 18:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

We reexamine this\nproblem by integrating the contact forces between each element of the string\nand the pulley and show that although the pulley does behave as if the tensions\nwere acting on it, this comes only as the end result of a detailed analysis.

The bandpass filtering\nfunction of the IMPF is implemented based on phase modulation and\nphase-modulation to intensity-modulation conversion, to translate the spectral\nresponse of an optical filter, which is the MDR in the IMPF, to the spectral\nresponse of a microwave filter. By injecting a CW light from a laser diode (LD)\nto the PM, a passband IMPF with a broad tuning range is demonstrated. Thanks to\nthe ultra-narrow notch of the MDR, a passband IMPF with a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.3\nGHz is realized. By thermally tuning the MDR, the center frequency of the IMPF\nis tuned from 7 to 25 GHz, achieving a tuning range of 18 GHz at a power\nconsumption of 1.58 mW.
