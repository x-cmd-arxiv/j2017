Their\nability to store and retrieve information on demand makes repeat-until-success\nstrategies scalable. Warm alkali-metal vapours are interesting candidates for\nthe implementation of such memories, thanks to their long storage times and\nexperimental simplicity. Operation with the Raman protocol enables high\ntime-bandwidth products, which allows for multiple synchronisation trials of\nprobabilistically operating quantum gates via memory-based temporal\nmultiplexing. This makes the Raman memory a promising tool, whose broad\nspectral bandwidth facilitates direct interfacing with other photonic\nprimitives, such as single photon sources. Here, such a light-matter interface\nis implemented in a warm caesium vapour. Firstly, we study the storage of\npolarisation-encoded information in the memory. High quality polarisation\npreservation for bright coherent state input signals can be achieved, when\noperating the Raman memory in a dual-rail configuration inside a polarisation\ninterferometer. Secondly, heralded single photons are stored in the memory. To\nthis end, the memory is operated on-demand by feed-forward of source heralding\nevents, which is a key technological capability. Prior to storage, single\nphotons are produced in a spontaneous parametric down conversion source, whose\nbespoke design spectrally tailors the photons to the memory acceptance line.\nThe faithful retrieval of stored single photons is found to be currently\nlimited by noise in the memory, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3 in the\nmemory output. Nevertheless, a clear influence of the input's quantum nature is\nobserved in the retrieved light by measuring signal's photon statistics.\nFinally, the memory noise processes are examined in detail. Four-wave-mixing\nnoise is determined as the sole important noise source for the Raman memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2017 16:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

Here we investigate how the uncertainty in the orientation of a\nscale dependent background magnetic field influences the ability to resolve\nanisotropy. Therefore we introduce a quantitative measure, the angle\nuncertainty, which characterizes the uncertainty of the orientation of the\nbackground magnetic field which turbulent structures are exposed to. The angle\nuncertainty can be used as a condition to estimate the ability to resolve\nanisotropy with certain accuracy. We apply our description to resolve spectral\nanisotropy in fast solar wind data. We show that if the angle uncertainty grows\ntoo large, the power of the turbulent fluctuations is attributed to false local\nmagnetic field angles, which may lead to an incorrect estimation of spectral\nindices. In our results an apparent robustness of the spectral anisotropy to\nfalse local magnetic field angles is observed, which can be explained by a\nstronger increase of power for lower frequencies when the scale of the local\nmagnetic field is increased. The frequency dependent angle uncertainty is a\nmeasure which can be applied to any turbulent system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2017 18:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Virtual constraints are relations on the\nstate variables of a mechanical model that are imposed through a time-invariant\nfeedback controller.

A second role is to induce a low dimensional\nsystem, the zero dynamics, that captures the underactuated aspects of a robot's\nmodel, without any approximations. To enhance intuition, the relation between\nphysical constraints and virtual constraints is first established.

The customers choose their time of\npurchase to maximize their payoff that depends on their valuation of the\nproduct, the purchase price, and the utility they derive from past purchases of\nothers, termed the network effect. We first show that the optimal price\nsequence is non-decreasing. Therefore, by postponing purchase to future rounds,\ncustomers trade-off a higher utility from the network effects with a higher\nprice. We then show that a customer's equilibrium strategy can be characterized\nby a threshold rule in which at each round a customer purchases the product if\nand only if her valuation exceeds a certain threshold. This implies that\ncustomers face an inference problem regarding the valuations of others, i.e.,\nobserving that a customer has not yet purchased the product, signals that her\nvaluation is below a threshold. We consider a block model of network\ninteractions, where there are blocks of buyers subject to the same network\neffect. A natural benchmark, this model allows us to provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the optimal price sequence asymptotically as the number of\nagents goes to infinity, which notably is linearly increasing in time with a\nslope that depends on the network effect through a scalar given by the sum of\nentries of the inverse of the network weight matrix.

Despite the looming financial crisis, there has been increasing\npressure for educational institutions to deliver better services using minimal\nresources.

When used for the purpose of statistical inference, logistic models\nproduce p-values for the regression coefficients by using an approximation to\nthe distribution of the likelihood-ratio test. Indeed, Wilks' theorem asserts\nthat whenever we have a fixed number $p$ of variables, twice the log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) $2\\Lambda$ is distributed as a $\\chi^2_k$ variable in the limit of\nlarge sample sizes $n$; here, $k$ is the number of variables being tested. In\nthis paper, we prove that when $p$ is not negligible compared to $n$, Wilks'\ntheorem does not hold and that the chi-square approximation is grossly\nincorrect; in fact, this approximation produces p-values that are far too small\n(under the null hypothesis). Assume that $n$ and $p$ grow large in such a way\nthat $p/n\\rightarrow\\kappa$ for some constant $\\kappa < 1/2$. We prove that for\na class of logistic models, the LLR converges to a rescaled chi-square, namely,\n$2\\Lambda~\\stackrel{\\mathrm{d}}{\\rightarrow}~\\alpha(\\kappa)\\chi_k^2$, where the\nscaling factor $\\alpha(\\kappa)$ is greater than one as soon as the\ndimensionality ratio $\\kappa$ is positive. Hence, the LLR is larger than\nclassically assumed. For instance, when $\\kappa=0.3$,\n$\\alpha(\\kappa)\\approx1.5$. In general, we show how to compute the scaling\nfactor by solving a nonlinear system of two equations with two unknowns. Our\nmathematical arguments are involved and use techniques from approximate message\npassing theory, non-asymptotic random matrix theory and convex geometry. We\nalso complement our mathematical study by showing that the new limiting\ndistribution is accurate for finite sample sizes. Finally, all the results from\nthis paper extend to some other regression models such as the probit regression\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 05:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

In this\nscenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive\nmolecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by\nnumerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be\naccumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject\nr-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed\nwith the ICM.

This process has the effect of\nsmoothing out a program. Our compiler framework models intermediate values in\nthe program as random variables, by using mean and variance statistics. Our\napproach breaks the input program into parts and relates the statistics of the\ndifferent parts, under the smoothing process. We give several approximations\nthat can be used for the different parts of the program. These include the\napproximation of Dorn et al., a novel adaptive Gaussian approximation, Monte\nCarlo sampling, and compactly supported kernels. Our adaptive Gaussian\napproximation is accurate up to the second order in the standard deviation of\nthe smoothing kernel, and mathematically smooth. We show how to construct a\ncompiler that applies chosen approximations to given parts of the input\nprogram. Because each expression can have multiple approximation choices, we\nuse a genetic search to automatically select the best approximations. We apply\nthis framework to the problem of automatically bandlimiting procedural shader\nprograms. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex shaders, including\nshaders with parallax mapping, animation, and spatially varying statistics. The\nresulting smoothed shader programs outperform previous approaches both\nnumerically, and aesthetically, due to the smoothing properties of our\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 06:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

Many\nmeasurements involve only several discrete photon energies known a priori,\nallowing single event decomposition of pile-up and spectroscopic photon\ncounting. We designed a pulse function and demonstrated that the signal\namplitude and rise time are obtained for each pulse by fitting, thus removing\nthe need for pulse shaping. By avoiding pulse shaping, rise times of tens of\nnanoseconds resulted in reduced pulse pile-up and allowed decomposition of\nremaining pulse pile-up at photon separation times down to hundreds of\nnanoseconds while yielding time-of-arrival information with precision of 10\nnanoseconds. Waveform fitting yields simultaneously high energy resolution and\nhigh counting rates (2 orders of magnitude higher than current digital pulse\nprocessors).

One of the\nmain reason behind errors at the higher levels is the presence of inconsistent\nnodes that are introduced due to the arbitrary process of creating these\nhierarchies by domain experts.

A recently explored solution\nspace lies in compressing (approximating or simplifying) deep neural networks\nin some manner before use on the device. We propose a new compression solution,\ncalled DeepIoT, that makes two key contributions in that space. First, unlike\ncurrent solutions geared for compressing specific types of neural networks,\nDeepIoT presents a unified approach that compresses all commonly used deep\nlearning structures for sensing applications, including fully-connected,\nconvolutional, and recurrent neural networks, as well as their combinations.\nSecond, unlike solutions that either sparsify weight matrices or assume linear\nstructure within weight matrices, DeepIoT compresses neural network structures\ninto smaller dense matrices by finding the minimum number of non-redundant\nhidden elements, such as filters and dimensions required by each layer, while\nkeeping the performance of sensing applications the same. Importantly, it does\nso using an approach that obtains a global view of parameter redundancies,\nwhich is shown to produce superior compression. We conduct experiments with\nfive different sensing-related tasks on Intel Edison devices. DeepIoT\noutperforms all compared baseline algorithms with respect to execution time and\nenergy consumption by a significant margin. It reduces the size of deep neural\nnetworks by 90% to 98.9%. It is thus able to shorten execution time by 71.4% to\n94.5%, and decrease energy consumption by 72.2% to 95.7%. These improvements\nare achieved without loss of accuracy.

Searching for biosignatures in the\nsupposedly thin atmospheres of these planets is a challenging goal that\nrequires a careful selection of the targets. Under the assumption of a\nrocky-dominated nature for Kepler-452b, we considered it as a test case to\ncalculate a temperature-dependent habitability index, $h_{050}$, designed to\nmaximize the potential presence of biosignature-producing activity (Silva et\nal.\\ 2016).

After fixing the planetary data according to the\nexperimental results (Jenkins et al.\\ 2015), we changed the surface gravity,\nCO$_2$ abundance, surface pressure, orbital eccentricity, rotation period, axis\nobliquity and ocean fraction within the range of validity of our model.

However, these\nnon-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without\nconsidering visual signals or attention. Imposing attention mechanism on\nnon-visual words could mislead and decrease the overall performance of video\ncaptioning. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical LSTM with adjusted\ntemporal attention (hLSTMat) approach for video captioning.

Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously\nconsider both low-level visual information and high-level language context\ninformation to support the video caption generation.

A baseline case is\nestablished, prior to shoulder formation, and the stochastic model is shown to\nbe capable of simultaneously matching the time averaged profile measurement as\nwell as the PDF shape and autocorrelation function from the ion-saturation\ncurrent time series at the outer wall. Aspects of the stochastic model are then\nvaried with the aim of producing a profile shoulder with statistical\nmeasurements consistent with experiment. This is achieved through a strong\nlocalised reduction in the density sink acting on the filaments within the\nmodel. The required reduction of the density sink occurs over a highly\nlocalised region with the timescale of the density sink increased by a factor\nof 25. This alone is found to be insufficient to model the expansion and\nflattening of the shoulder region as the density increases, which requires\nadditional changes within the stochastic model. An example is found which\nincludes both a reduction in the density sink and filament acceleration and\nprovides a consistent match to the experimental data as the shoulder expands,\nthough the uniqueness of this solution can not be guaranteed. Within the\ncontext of the stochastic model, this implies that the localised reduction in\nthe density sink can trigger shoulder formation, but additional physics is\nrequired to explain the subsequent evolution of the profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 08:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The diffeomorphism class of such a threefold is known to\nbe determined up to finitely many possibilities by the integral middle\ncohomology and two integral forms on the integral second cohomology, namely the\ncubic cup-product form and the linear form given by cup-product with the second\nChern class. The motivating question for this paper is whether knowledge of\nthese cubic and linear forms determines the threefold up to finitely many\nfamilies, that is the moduli of such threefolds is bounded. If this is true,\nthen in particular the middle integral cohomology would be bounded by knowledge\nof these two forms on the second cohomology. Crucial to this question is the\nstudy of rigid rational surfaces on the threefold, which are the irreducible\nsurfaces for which no multiple moves and which do not disappear under a general\ndeformation of the complex structure of the threefold. If for instance there\nare no such surfaces, then the answer to the motivating question is yes\n(Theorem 0.1). In particular, for given cubic and linear forms on the second\ncohomology, there must exist such surfaces for large enough third Betti number\n(Corollary 0.2). The paper starts by proving general results on these rigid\nrational surfaces and boundedness of the family of threefolds. The basic\nprinciple is that if the cohomology classes of these surfaces are also known,\nthen boundedness should hold (Theorem 4.5). The second half of the paper\nrestricts to the case of Picard number 2, where it is shown that knowledge of\nthe cubic and linear forms does indeed bound the family of Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds (Theorem 0.3). As far as the author is aware, this is the first\nnon-trivial case where a general boundedness result for Calabi-Yau threefolds\nhas been proved (without the assumption of a special structure).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 10:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 15:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 14:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 11:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 17:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 13:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 17:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Based on the current data, we\nconclude that BD+03 2562 has a bona fide planetary companion while for HD\n103485 we cannot totally exclude that the best explanation for the RV signal\nmodulations is not the existence of a planet but stellar activity. If, the\ninterpretation remains that both stars have planetary companions they represent\nsystems orbiting very evolved stars with very low metallicities, a challenge to\nthe conditions required for the formation of massive giant gas planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 11:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Albeit its\nsignificant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art\napproaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move\na significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of\nchallenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output\nexamples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their\nparse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than\npreviously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is\nalmost 0%.\n  We tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by\nthree novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep\nlearning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a\nnon-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space.\nThus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific\nnon-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve\ngeneralizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our\nnon-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn\nhow to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the\nmodel effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold\nboot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search\nalgorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our\nnovel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test\naccuracy on test inputs that are 500x longer than the training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 11:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 04:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 04:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 00:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

We show\nhow to choose correctly the interactions, to minimise the effects of the\nunderlying grid so that hemispherical droplets form. We also include the\neffects of surface roughness to examine the effects of contact-line pinning on\nthe dynamics. When there is a `lid' above the system, which prevents\nevaporation, equilibrium drops form on the surface, which we use to determine\nthe contact angle and how it varies as the parameters of the model are changed.\nThis enables us to relate the interaction parameters to the materials used in\napplications.

Meanwhile, possible dissipation mechanisms (e.g., internal\nshocks or magnetic reconnection) could accelerate cosmic-rays (CRs) to\nultra-high energies and then produce neutrinos via hadronuclear and\nphotohadronic processes, which are referred to as prompt neutrinos.

Two\nvariable polynomials corresponding to different R-symmetry representations are\nconstructed. The Ward identities for superconformal symmetry are obtained as\nsimple differential equations. The general solution is presented in terms of a\nconstant, a single variable function and a two variable function. An\ninterpretation in terms of the operator product expansion is given for the case\nof fields of equal dimension and for the so called (next-to)extremal cases. The\nresult is shown to accommodate long multiplets, semishort and short multiplets\nwith protected dimension.

In this paper we present an application of the\nmetriplectic formalism of interest for the theory of control: a suitable torque\nis applied to a free rigid body, which is expressed through a metriplectic\nextension of its \"natural\" Poisson algebra. On practical grounds, the effect is\nto drive the body to align its angular velocity to rotation about a stable\nprincipal axis of inertia, while conserving its kinetic energy in the process.\nOn theoretical grounds, this example shows how the non-Hamiltonian part of a\nmetriplectic system may include convergence to a limit cycle, the first example\nof a non-zero dimensional attractor in this formalism. The method suggests a\nway to extend metriplectic dynamics to systems with general attractors, e.g.\nchaotic ones, with the hope of representing bio-physical, geophysical and\necological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2017 17:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Here we have identified several low cost ways\ntoward this goal by comparatively investigating three typical strategies\nspanning from mechanical, chemical, to electrochemical principles, for removing\nthe gallium-based liquid metal circuits or thin films. Regarding the mechanical\napproach, we constructed an eraser for removing the liquid metal thin films.

In the chemical category, we adopted alkalis and acids\nto remove the finely printed liquid metal circuits and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\nsolution was particularly revealed to be rather efficient in making a chemical\neraser. In the electrochemical strategy, we applied a 15 V voltage to a liquid\nmetal thin film (covered with water) and successfully removed the target metal\npart.

The\nstructure of their niche has profound repercussions by both selecting their\ninternal architecture and also inducing adaptive responses to environmental\ncues and stimuli. Adaptive, collective behaviour underpinned by specialized\noptimization strategies is ubiquitously found in the natural world. This\nexceptional success originates from the processes of fitness and selection.\nHere we prove that a universal physical mechanism of a nonequilibrium\ntransition underlies the collective organization of information-processing\norganisms. As cognitive agents build and update an internal, cognitive\nrepresentation of the causal structure of their environment, complex patterns\nemerge in the system, where the onset of pattern formation relates to the\nspatial overlap of cognitive maps. Studying the exchange of information among\nthe agents reveals a continuous, order-disorder transition. As a result of the\nspontaneous breaking of translational symmetry, a Goldstone mode emerges, which\npoints at a collective mechanism of information transfer among cognitive\norganisms. Taken together, the characteristics of this phase transition\nconsolidate different results in cognitive and biological sciences in a\nuniversal manner.

A natural idea is to factorize each speech frame into\nindependent factors, though it turns out to be even more difficult than\ndecoding each individual factor. A major encumbrance is that the speaker trait,\na major factor in speech signals, has been suspected to be a long-term\ndistributional pattern and so not identifiable at the frame level. In this\npaper, we demonstrated that the speaker factor is also a short-time spectral\npattern and can be largely identified with just a few frames using a simple\ndeep neural network (DNN). This discovery motivated a cascade deep\nfactorization (CDF) framework that infers speech factors in a sequential way,\nand factors previously inferred are used as conditional variables when\ninferring other factors. Our experiment on an automatic emotion recognition\n(AER) task demonstrated that this approach can effectively factorize speech\nsignals, and using these factors, the original speech spectrum can be recovered\nwith high accuracy.

Our theoretical results\nhave shown existence of an inverse proportionality between accuracy of\ndetermination the Hubble constant and accuracy of calculation a coordinates of\ngalaxies leading to ambiguity results obtained at cosmological observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2017 08:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

This\narticle presents a changepoint detection framework for identifying periodic\nsubsequences of event times. The opening event of each subsequence can be\ninterpreted as a human action which then generates an automated, periodic\nprocess. Difficulties arising from the presence of duplicate and missing data\nare addressed.

In current\nFP experimental setup, the dark-field images with high-angle illuminations are\neasily submerged by stray light and background noise due to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio, thus significantly degrading the reconstruction quality\nand also imposing a major restriction on the synthetic numerical aperture (NA)\nof the FP approach. To this end, an overall and systematic data preprocessing\nscheme for noise removal from FP's raw dataset is provided, which involves\nsampling analysis as well as underexposed/overexposed treatments, then followed\nby the elimination of unknown stray light and suppression of inevitable\nbackground noise, especially Gaussian noise and CCD dark current in our\nexperiments. The reported non-parametric scheme facilitates great enhancements\nof the FP's performance, which has been demonstrated experimentally that the\nbenefits of noise removal by these methods far outweigh its defects of\nconcomitant signal loss. In addition, it could be flexibly cooperated with the\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms, producing a stronger robustness of the FP\napproach in various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2017 16:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}
