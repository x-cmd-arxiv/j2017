Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized\nmatings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\\gamma$ ranges from $0$ to\n$2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated\nspace-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling\nSLE$_{\\kappa}$ for $\\kappa =16/\\gamma^2$ (in the annealed sense) and that\nsimple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the\nquenched sense).\n  This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal embedding of\na random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been\nconjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained\napproximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps,\nbipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for\nproving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well.\n  To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting)\ntheorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE. There is a natural\nway to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into \"cells\" corresponding to\nvertices of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the\norigin-containing cell, in particular proving moments for the ratio of its\nsquared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the\norigin-containing cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire\nconfiguration. Ultimately, we use these properties to show (with the help of a\ngeneral theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells\nconverges to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte\nembedding result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 16:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 17:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 16:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 12:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 21:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

It may therefore be used to explore the stability and\nconfinement of gauge singlet hadrons, though not to describe scattering\nprocesses that require colour interactions.

Our method is\ntrained and evaluated using 209 files with crackles classified by expert\nlisteners. Our analysis pipeline is based on features extracted from small\nwindows in audio files. We evaluated several feature extraction methods and\nclassifiers. We evaluated the pipeline using a training set of 175 crackle\nwindows and 208 normal windows. We did 100 cycles of cross validation where we\nshuffled training sets between cycles. For all the division between training\nand evaluation was 70%-30%.\n  We found and evaluated a 5-dimenstional vector with four features from the\ntime domain and one from the spectrum domain. We evaluated several classifiers\nand found SVM with a Radial Basis Function Kernel to perform best. Our approach\nhad a precision of 86% and recall of 84% for classifying a crackle in a window,\nwhich is more accurate than found in studies of health personnel. The\nlow-dimensional feature vector makes the SVM very fast. The model can be\ntrained on a regular computer in 1.44 seconds, and 319 crackles can be\nclassified in 1.08 seconds.\n  Our approach detects and visualizes individual crackles in recorded audio\nfiles. It is accurate, fast, and has low resource requirements. It can be used\nto train health personnel or as part of a smartphone application for Bluetooth\nstethoscopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 16:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 22:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

This transformation leads to the action\nwith vertices being off-shell continuations of the MHV amplitudes. We show that\nthe solution to the field transformation expressing one of the new fields in\nterms of the Yang-Mills field is a certain type of the Wilson line. More\nprecisely, it is a straight infinite gauge link with a slope extending to the\nlight-cone minus and the transverse direction. One of the consequences of that\nfact is that certain MHV vertices reduced partially on-shell are gauge\ninvariant -- a fact discovered before using conventional light-front\nperturbation theory. We also analyze the diagrammatic content of the field\ntransformations leading to the MHV action. We found that the diagrams for the\nsolution to the transformation (given by the Wilson line) and its inverse\ndiffer only by light-front energy denominators.

We\nstudy the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation,\np_f, on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of ratings required to make\n`good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative\nratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity.

Numerical investigations\nsuggest that turbulence eases the condition for explosion, but how is not fully\nunderstood. We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and\nshow that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about\n30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we\nidentify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Contrary to prior\nsuggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the\ncondition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram\npressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent\ndissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant\nthermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source of this\nTD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from\nthe higher potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a\nturbulence model in conjunction with an explosion condition enables insight\nthat is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex multi-dimensional\nsimulations. An explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain why\nstars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to explore how turbulence\nenables explosion. Though we find that turbulent dissipation is a significant\ncontributor to successful supernova explosions, it is important to note that\nthis work is to some extent qualitative. Therefore, we suggest ways to further\nverify and validate our predictions with multi-dimensional simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 20:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 21:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

However, both in-situ formation\nand disk migration, in their simplest flavors, predict WJs to be in\nlow-eccentricity orbits, in contradiction with many observed WJs that are\nmoderately eccentric (e=0.2-0.7). This paper examines the possibility that the\nWJ eccentricities are raised by secular interactions with exterior giant planet\ncompanions, following in-situ formation or migration on a circular orbit.\nEccentricity growth may arise from an inclined companion (through Lidov-Kozai\ncycles), or from an eccentric, nearly coplanar companion (through apsidal\nprecession resonances). We quantify the necessary conditions (in terms of the\neccentricity, semi-major axis and inclination) for external perturbers of\nvarious masses to raise the WJ eccentricity. We also consider the sample of\neccentric WJs with detected outer companions, and for each system, identify the\nrange of mutual inclinations needed to generate the observed eccentricity. For\nmost systems, we find that relatively high inclinations (at least $\\sim\n40^\\circ$) are needed so that Lidov-Kozai cycles are induced; the observed\nouter companions are typically not sufficiently eccentric to generate the\nobserved WJ eccentricity in a low-inclination configuration. The results of\nthis paper place constraints on possibly unseen external companions to\neccentric WJs. Observations that probe mutual inclinations of giant planet\nsystems will help clarify the origin of eccentric WJs and the role of external\ncompanions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 20:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Gas phase\nabundances of three HII regions in the lower halos of the edge-on galaxies NGC\n3628 and NGC 4522 are determined by analysing optical long-slit spectra. The\nobserved regions have projected distances to the midplane of their host from\n1.4 to 3 kpc.

A common perception is that\nderiving more than a few elemental abundances ([Fe/H], [$\\alpha$/Fe], perhaps\n[C/H], [N/H]) requires medium-to-high spectral resolution, $R \\gtrsim 10,000$,\nmostly to overcome the effects of line blending. In recent work (Rix et al.\n2016; Ting et al. 2016) we presented an efficient and practical way to model\nthe full stellar spectrum, even when fitting a large number of stellar labels\nsimultaneously. In this paper we quantify to what precision the abundances of\nmany different elements can be recovered, as a function of spectroscopic\nresolution and wavelength range. In the limit of perfect spectral models and\nspectral normalization, we show that the precision of elemental abundances is\nnearly independent of resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of\ndetector pixels; low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel\nand generally larger wavelength range in a single setting. We also show that\nestimates of most stellar labels are not strongly correlated with one another\nonce $R \\gtrsim 1,000$. Modest errors in the line spread function, as well as\nsmall radial velocity errors, do not affect these conclusions, and data driven\nmodels indicate that spectral (continuum) normalization can be achieved well\nenough in practice. These results, to be confirmed with an analysis of observed\nlow-resolution data, open up new possibilities for the design of large\nspectroscopic stellar surveys and for the re-analysis of archival\nlow-resolution datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 22:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 01:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

However,\nexisting GLBs scale poorly with the number of rounds and the number of arms,\nlimiting their utility in practice. This paper proposes new, scalable solutions\nto the GLB problem in two respects. First, unlike existing GLBs, whose\nper-time-step space and time complexity grow at least linearly with time $t$,\nwe propose a new algorithm that performs online computations to enjoy a\nconstant space and time complexity. At its heart is a novel Generalized Linear\nextension of the Online-to-confidence-set Conversion (GLOC method) that takes\n\\emph{any} online learning algorithm and turns it into a GLB algorithm. As a\nspecial case, we apply GLOC to the online Newton step algorithm, which results\nin a low-regret GLB algorithm with much lower time and memory complexity than\nprior work. Second, for the case where the number $N$ of arms is very large, we\npropose new algorithms in which each next arm is selected via an inner product\nsearch. Such methods can be implemented via hashing algorithms (i.e.,\n\"hash-amenable\") and result in a time complexity sublinear in $N$. While a\nThompson sampling extension of GLOC is hash-amenable, its regret bound for\n$d$-dimensional arm sets scales with $d^{3/2}$, whereas GLOC's regret bound\nscales with $d$. Towards closing this gap, we propose a new hash-amenable\nalgorithm whose regret bound scales with $d^{5/4}$. Finally, we propose a fast\napproximate hash-key computation (inner product) with a better accuracy than\nthe state-of-the-art, which can be of independent interest.

These\nmethods utilize a periodic assumption of the training samples to construct a\ncirculant data matrix, which implicitly increases the training samples and\nreduces both storage and computational complexity.The periodic assumption also\nintroduces unwanted boundary effects. Recently, Spatially Regularized\nCorrelation Filters (SRDCF) solved this issue by introducing penalization on\ncorrelation filter coefficients depending on their spatial location.

Unlike prior analyses,\ntime-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channel is considered. The outage analysis\nthus involves the probability distribution analysis of a product of multiple\ncorrelated shifted Gamma random variables and is more challenging than prior\nanalyses. Based on the finding of the conditional independence of the received\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the outage probability is exactly derived by\nusing conditional Mellin transform. Specifically, the outage probability of\nHARQ-IR under time-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channels can be written as a\nweighted sum of outage probabilities of HARQ-IR over independent Nakagami\nfading channels, where the weightings are determined by a negative multinomial\ndistribution. This result enables not only an efficient truncation\napproximation of the outage probability with uniform convergence but also\nasymptotic outage analysis to further extract clear insights which have never\nbeen discovered for HARQ-IR even under fast fading channels. The asymptotic\noutage probability is then derived in a simple form which clearly quantifies\nthe impacts of transmit powers, channel time correlation and information\ntransmission rate. It is proved that the asymptotic outage probability is an\ninverse power function of the product of transmission powers in all HARQ\nrounds, an increasing function of the channel time correlation coefficients,\nand a monotonically increasing and convex function of information transmission\nrate.

In the characteristic\nzero setting, the method provides a different construction of the\nChari-Pressley (also Kus-Littelmann) bases and the Chari-Venkatesh bases for\nlocal Weyl modules for the current $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-algebra. Our construction\nallows us to obtain new bases for the local Weyl modules for truncated current\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-algebras with very particular properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 01:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

To take up\nvariant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe\nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants\nof vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of\nreceptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution.\nCompetition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient\ndiversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates,\nwhereas species such as B.~thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex\nglycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide\nopportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another\nimportant process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such\nfluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information\nabout environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often\nadjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular\ncarbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake\nreceptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to\ncontrol the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring\nrelates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence.\nControl theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation\nto the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning\nstudies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory\nwiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify\nenvironmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in\ncellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence.

These vulnerabilities usually manifest as memory access violations\ncaused by tainted program input. Although fuzzers have helped uncover a\nmajority of taint-style vulnerabilities in software to date, they are limited\nby (i) extent of test coverage; and (ii) the availability of fuzzable test\ncases. Therefore, fuzzing alone cannot provide a high assurance that all\ntaint-style vulnerabilities have been uncovered. In this paper, we use static\ntemplate matching to find recurrences of fuzzer-discovered vulnerabilities. To\ncompensate for the inherent incompleteness of template matching, we implement a\nsimple yet effective match-ranking algorithm that uses test coverage data to\nfocus attention on those matches that comprise untested code. We prototype our\napproach using the Clang/LLVM compiler toolchain and use it in conjunction with\nafl-fuzz, a modern coverage-guided fuzzer. Using a case study carried out on\nthe Open vSwitch codebase, we show that our prototype uncovers corner cases in\nmodules that lack a fuzzable test harness. Our work demonstrates that static\nanalysis can effectively complement fuzz testing, and is a useful addition to\nthe security assessment tool-set. Furthermore, our techniques hold promise for\nincreasing the effectiveness of program analysis and testing, and serve as a\nbuilding block for a hybrid vulnerability discovery framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 08:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Twenty years ago Stewart published the first consistent\ntheory with purely inelastic impacts and an impulsive friction model analogous\nto Coulomb friction. In this paper we demonstrate that the consistent impact\nmodel can exhibit multiple solutions with a varying degree of dissipation even\nin the single-contact case. Replacing the impulsive friction model based on\nCoulomb friction by a model based on the maximum dissipation principle resolves\nthe non-uniqueness in the single-contact impact problem. The paper constructs\nthe alternative impact model and presents integral equations describing\nrigid-body dynamics with a non-impulsive and non-compliant contact model and an\nassociated purely inelastic impact model maximizing dissipation. An analytic\nsolution is derived for the single-contact impact problem. The models are then\nembedded into a time-stepping scheme. The macroscopic behaviour is compared to\nCoulomb friction in a large-scale granular flow problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 09:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

Precise measurements of\nthe properties of the top quark and the Higgs boson, as well as searches for\nBeyond the Standard Model physics require a highly performant CLIC detector. In\nparticular the vertex detector must provide a single point resolution of only a\nfew micrometers while not exceeding the envisaged material budget of around\n0.2% X0 per layer. Beam-beam interactions and beamstrahlung processes impose an\nadditional requirement on the timestamping capabilities of the vertex detector\nof about 10 ns. These goals can only be met by using novel techniques in the\nsensor and ASIC design as well as in the detector construction.\n  The R\\&D program for the CLIC vertex detector explores various technologies\nin order to meet these demands. The feasibility of planar sensors with a\nthickness of 50-150 um, including different active edge designs, are evaluated\nusing Timepix3 ASICs. First prototypes of the CLICpix readout ASIC, implemented\nin 65 nm CMOS technology and with a pixel size of 25x25 um^2, have been\nproduced and tested in particle beams. An updated version of the ASIC with a\nlarger pixel matrix and improved precision of the time-over-threshold and\ntime-of-arrival measurements has been submitted. Different hybridization\nconcepts have been developed for the interconnection between the sensor and\nreadout ASIC, ranging from small-pitch bump bonding of planar sensors to\ncapacitive coupling of active HV-CMOS sensors. Detector simulations based on\nGeant4 and TCAD are compared with experimental results to assess and optimize\nthe performance of the various designs.\n  This contribution gives an overview of the R&D program undertaken for the\nCLIC vertex detector and presents performance measurements of the prototype\ndetectors currently under investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 09:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

We study the correlation at low radio frequencies using two new\nsurveys - the First Alternative Data Release of the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS\nADR1) at 148 MHz and LOFAR's first all-sky survey, the Multifrequency Snapshot\nSky Survey (MSSS) at 140 MHz. We find a scaling relation $P_{\\rm cav} \\propto\nL_{148}^{\\beta}$, with a logarithmic slope of $\\beta = 0.51 \\pm 0.14$, which is\nin good agreement with previous results based on data at 327 MHz. The large\nscatter present in this correlation confirms the conclusion reached at higher\nfrequencies that the total radio luminosity at a single frequency is a poor\npredictor of the total jet power. We show that including measurements at 148\nMHz alone is insufficient to reliably compute the bolometric radio luminosity\nand reduce the scatter in the correlation. For a subset of four well-resolved\nsources, we examine the detected extended structures at low frequencies and\ncompare with the morphology known from higher frequency images and Chandra\nX-ray maps. In Perseus we discuss details in the structures of the radio\nmini-halo, while in the 2A 0335+096 cluster we observe new diffuse emission\nassociated with multiple X-ray cavities and likely originating from past\nactivity. For A2199 and MS 0735.6+7421, we confirm that the observed\nlow-frequency radio lobes are confined to the extents known from higher\nfrequencies. This new low-frequency analysis highlights the fact that existing\ncavity power to radio luminosity relations are based on a relatively narrow\nrange of AGN outburst ages. We discuss how the correlation could be extended\nusing low frequency data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) in\ncombination with future, complementary deeper X-ray observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 09:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The occurrence of both growth modes mentioned above is in\ncompliance with the wettability criterion of Bauer. The positive wetting\nfunction required for the occurrence of the Volmer-Weber growth is originated\nby the vertical displacements of the atoms close to the edges of the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) islands as a result of the relaxation of the lattice\nmisfit. The monolayer high islands become unstable against bilayer islands,\nbilayer islands in turn become unstable against trilayer islands, etc. beyond\nsome critical islands sizes. Monolayer islands appear as necessary precursors\nof three-dimensional (3D) islands. The critical island size for mono-bilayer\ntransformation increases steeply with decreasing lattice misfit and diverges at\na critical value of the misfit. This value divides the regions of Frank-van der\nMerwe and Stranski-Krastanov modes in a phase diagram of coordinates\nwetting-misfit. The transformation of monolayer to multilayer islands takes\nplace either by consecutive nucleation and growth of 2D islands (layer-by-layer\ntransformation), or by nucleation and lateral (2D) growth of multilayer islands\n(multilayer 2D transformation).

The exact solution, famously, is\ncubicly expensive in the size of the matrix. To alleviate this problem, several\nlinear-time approximations, such as spectral and inducing-point methods, have\nbeen suggested and are now in wide use. These are low-rank approximations that\nchoose the low-rank space a priori and do not refine it over time. While this\nallows linear cost in the data-set size, it also causes a finite, uncorrected\napproximation error. Authors from numerical linear algebra have explored ways\nto iteratively refine such low-rank approximations, at a cost of a small number\nof matrix-vector multiplications. This idea is particularly interesting in the\nmany situations in machine learning where one has to solve a sequence of\nrelated symmetric positive definite linear problems. From the machine learning\nperspective, such deflation methods can be interpreted as transfer learning of\na low-rank approximation across a time-series of numerical tasks.

However,\nthe time intervals between consecutive computerized tomography scans might be\ntoo long to allow early identification of treatment failure.

METHODS: A total of 143\nbreath samples were collected from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer. The\nexhaled breath signature, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nand a nanomaterial-based array of sensors, was correlated with the response to\ntherapy assessed by RECIST: complete response, partial response, stable\ndisease, or progressive disease. RESULTS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nanalysis identified three volatile organic compounds as significantly\nindicating disease control (PR/stable disease), with one of them also\nsignificantly discriminating PR/stable disease from progressive disease. The\nnanoarray had the ability to monitor changes in tumor response across therapy,\nalso indicating any lack of further response to therapy. When one-sensor\nanalysis was used, 59% of the follow-up samples were identified correctly.\nThere was 85% success in monitoring disease control (stable disease/partial\nresponse). CONCLUSION: Breath analysis, using mainly the nanoarray, may serve\nas a surrogate marker for the response to systemic therapy in lung cancer. As a\nmonitoring tool, it can provide the oncologist with a quick bedside method of\nidentifying a lack of response to an anticancer treatment.

The Random Particle Mesh (RPM) method is used to synthesize a\nturbulence field in the stator domain using a URANS simulation characterized by\ntime-periodic turbulence and mean flow. The rotor-stator interaction noise is\npredicted by a two-dimensional CAA computation of the stator cascade. The\nimpact of cyclostationarity is decomposed into various effects investigated\nseparately. This leads to the finding that the periodic turbulent kinetic\nenergy (TKE) and periodic flow have only a negligible effect on the radiated\nsound power. The impact of the periodic integral length scale (TLS) is,\nhowever, substantial. The limits of a stationary representation of the TLS are\ndemonstrated making the CSH method indispensable when background and wake TKE\nare of comparable level. Good agreement of the CSH method with measurements\nobtained from the 2015 AIAA Fan Broadband Noise Prediction Workshop are also\nshown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 10:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Both isentropic and full Euler equations are\nconsidered. The equations are discretized on a staggered grid. This simplifies\nflux computation and guarantees a natural central discretization in the low\nMach limit, thus dramatically reducing the excessive numerical diffusion of\nupwind discretizations. Furthermore, second order accuracy in space is\nautomatically guaranteed. For the time discretization we adopt an\nSemi-IMplicit/EXplicit (S-IMEX) discretization getting an elliptic equation for\nthe pressure in the isentropic case and for the energy in the full Euler\nequations. Such equations can be solved linearly so that we do not need any\niterative solver thus reducing computational cost. Second order in time is\nobtained by a suitable S-IMEX strategy taken from Boscarino et al. in [6].\nMoreover, the CFL stability condition is independent of the Mach number and\ndepends essentially on the fluid velocity.

Investigation of long-term variation of the properties of\nmacrospicules may help to a better understanding of their underlying physics of\ngeneration and role in coronal heating. Taking advantage of the high temporal\nand spatial resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a new dataset, with\nseveral hundreds of macrospicules, was constructed encompassing a period of\nobservations over six years.

Next,\nwavelet analysis is used to provide more detailed information about the\ntemporal behaviour of the various properties of MS.

It is known that optimal\ntransport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were\nspecifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle\nsuch problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using\nOT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i)\nthe computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack\nof smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these\nlosses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first\ntractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an\noptimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key\nideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that\ncan be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic\n(automatic) differentiation of these iterations.

Bifurcation and slow-fast\nanalysis give conditions on the parameter space for the establishment of this\nbi-stability. In the parametric zone of bi-stability, weak-noise amplitudes may\nstrongly inhibit the neuron's spiking activity. Surprisingly, increasing the\nnoise strength leads to a minimum in the spiking activity, after which the\nactivity starts to increase monotonically with increase in noise strength. We\ninvestigate this inhibition and modulation of neural oscillations by weak-noise\namplitudes by looking at the variation of the mean number of spikes per unit\ntime with the noise intensity. We show that this phenomenon always occurs when\nthe initial conditions lie in the basin of attraction of the stable limit\ncycle.

This\nstudy examines the behavior of instabilities with respect to stable/unstable\nsteady states in the laminar regimes for subsonic and transonic conditions\nwhere compressibility plays an important role. It is observed that an increase\nin Mach number destabilizes the flow in the subsonic regime and stabilizes the\nflow in the transonic regime. Biglobal stability analysis is conducted to\nextract 2D and 3D eigenmodes for prescribed spanwise wavelengths about the 2D\nsteady state. The properties of 2D eigenmodes agree well with those observed in\nthe 2D nonlinear simulations. In the analysis of 3D eigenmodes, it is found\nthat an increase of Mach number stabilizes dominant 3D eigenmodes. For a short\ncavity with $L/D=2$, the 3D eigenmodes primarily stem from centrifugal\ninstabilities. For a long cavity with $L/D=6$, other types of eigenmodes appear\nwhose structures extend from the aft-region to the mid-region of the cavity. A\nselected number of 3D DNS are performed at $M_\\infty=0.6$. For $L/D=2$, the\nproperties of 3D structures present in the 3D nonlinear flow correspond closely\nto those obtained from linear stability analysis. However, for $L/D=6$, the 3D\neigenmodes cannot be clearly observed in the 3D DNS, due to the strong\nnonlinearity that develops over the length of the cavity. In addition, it is\nnoted that three-dimensionality in the flow helps alleviate violent\noscillations for the long cavity. The analysis performed in this paper can\nprovide valuable insights for designing effective flow control strategies to\nsuppress undesirable aerodynamic and pressure fluctuations in compressible\nopen-cavity flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 13:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Protection time represents the amount of time the attacker needs\nto execute the attack successfully. In other words, protection time represents\nthe inherent resilience of the system against an attack.

Improved estimates of precipitating\nfluxes of energetic electrons are derived from measurements on board the\nNOAA/POES 18 satellite using a new analysis technique. These fluxes are used to\nquantify the direct impact of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) during\nsolar minimum on middle atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) measured from the Aura\nsatellite. During winter, localized longitudinal density enhancements in the OH\nare observed over northern Russia and North America at corrected geomagnetic\nlatitudes poleward of 55$^{\\circ}$. Although the northern Russia OH enhancement\nis closely associated with increased EEP at these longitudes, the strength and\nlocation of the North America enhancement appear to be unrelated to EEP. This\nOH density enhancement is likely due to vertical motion induced by atmospheric\nwave dynamics that transports air rich in atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen\ndownward into the middle atmosphere, where it plays a role in the formation of\nOH. In the Southern Hemisphere, localized enhancements of the OH density over\nWest Antarctica can be explained by a combination of enhanced EEP due to the\nlocal minimum in Earth's magnetic field strength and atmospheric dynamics.

This paper describes how high\nspeed UDP based data transmission with very low packet error ratios was\nachieved. The near-reliable communications link is used in a data acquisition\n(DAQ) system for the next generation of extremely intense neutron source,\nEuropean Spallation Source. This paper presents measurements of UDP performance\nand reliability as achieved by employing several optimizations. The\nmeasurements were performed on Xeon E5 based CentOS (Linux) servers. The\nmeasured data rates are very close to the 10 Gb/s line rate, and zero packet\nloss was achieved. The performance was obtained utilizing a single processor\ncore as transmitter and a single core as receiver. The results show that\nsupport for transmitting large data packets is a key parameter for good\nperformance.\n  Optimizations for throughput are: MTU, packet sizes, tuning Linux kernel\nparameters, thread affinity, core locality and efficient timers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 15:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 08:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

The experimental\ndiscovery of boundary-layer oscillations (Tollmien-Schlichting waves) in the\nUSA during World War II vindicated a long-disputed theory developed in Germany\nin the 1920s and 1930s. However, the instability which causes these\noscillations marks only the initial phase of the onset of turbulence;\nhigher-order instabilities had to be assumed in order to extend the analysis to\nthe regions of the transition zone where more complex phenomena (such as\n\"turbulent spots\") mark the onset of turbulence. There is still no theory to\ndescribe these processes in a satisfactory manner. The emphasis on the\nfundamental character of the problem, however, tends to obscure the practical\ninterests which motivated the study of boundary-layer instabilities throughout\nits long history. The disputed theories played a role in the quest for \"laminar\nairfoils\" and other practical applications.

In order to address issues in this field, we can take\ninspiration from nature, by studying human locomotion. The Spring-Loaded\nInverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has shown to be a good model for this purpose.\nHowever, the human musculoskeletal system enables us to actively modulate leg\nstiffness, for example when walking in rough terrain with irregular and\nunexpected height variations of the walking surface. This ability of varying\nleg stiffness is not considered in conventional SLIP-based models, and\ntherefore this paper explores the potential role of active leg stiffness\nvariation in bipedal locomotion. It is shown that the conceptual SLIP model can\nbe iteratively extended to more closely resemble a realistic (i.e., non-ideal)\nwalker, and that feedback control strategies can be designed that reproduce the\nSLIP behavior in these extended models. We show that these extended models\nrealize a cost of transport comparable to human walking, which indicates that\nactive leg stiffness variation plays an important role in human locomotion that\nwas previously not captured by the SLIP model. The results of this study show\nthat active leg stiffness adaptation is a promising approach for realizing more\nenergy-efficient and robust bipedal walking robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 15:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Characterizing the structure of these\nbasins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality.\nRecent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed\npoints of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated\nbasins of attraction [D.

Second, a set of initial\nconditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of\nhypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are\ndynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally\ndetermined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the\nfixed point.

In this article,\nwe model the matter field around the intermediate-mass binary black holes by\nmeans of an axion-like scalar field and investigate their joint evolution. In\ndetails, we consider the equal mass binary black holes surrounded by a shell of\naxion-like scalar field both in spherical symmetric and non-spherical symmetric\ncases, and with different strength of the scalar field. Our result shows that\nthe environmental scalar field could essentially modify the dynamics. Firstly,\nin the spherical symmetric case, with increasing of the scalar field strength,\nthe number of circular orbit of the binary black hole is reduced. It means that\nthe scalar field could significantly accelerate the merger process. Secondly,\nonce the scalar field strength exceeds certain critical value, the scalar field\ncould collapse into a third black hole with its mass being larger than the\nbinary. Consequently, the new black hole collapsed from the environmental\nscalar field could accrete the binary promptly and the binary collides head-on\nbetween each other. In this process, there is almost no any quadrupole signal\nproduced, namely the gravitational wave is greatly suppressed. Thirdly, when\nthe scalar field strength is relatively smaller than the critical value, the\nblack hole orbit could develop eccentricity through the accretion of the scalar\nfield. Fourthly, during the initial stage of the inspire, the gravitational\nattractive force from the axion-like scalar field could induce a sudden turn in\nthe binary orbits, hence result in a transient wiggle in the gravitational\nwaveform. Finally, in the non-spherical case, the scalar field could\ngravitationally attract the binary moving toward the mass center of the scalar\nfield and slow down the merger process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 04:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Through these advancements, variable\nranking has emerged as an active and growing research area and it is now\nbeginning to be applied to many new problems. The rationale behind this fact is\nthat many pattern recognition problems are by nature ranking problems. The main\nobjective of a ranking algorithm is to sort objects according to some criteria,\nso that, the most relevant items will appear early in the produced result list.\nRanking methods can be analyzed from two different methodological perspectives:\nranking to learn and learning to rank. The former aims at studying methods and\ntechniques to sort objects for improving the accuracy of a machine learning\nmodel. Enhancing a model performance can be challenging at times. For example,\nin pattern classification tasks, different data representations can complicate\nand hide the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. In\nparticular, hand-crafted features contain many cues that are either redundant\nor irrelevant, which turn out to reduce the overall accuracy of the classifier.\nIn such a case feature selection is used, that, by producing ranked lists of\nfeatures, helps to filter out the unwanted information. Moreover, in real-time\nsystems (e.g., visual trackers) ranking approaches are used as optimization\nprocedures which improve the robustness of the system that deals with the high\nvariability of the image streams that change over time. The other way around,\nlearning to rank is necessary in the construction of ranking models for\ninformation retrieval, biometric authentication, re-identification, and\nrecommender systems. In this context, the ranking model's purpose is to sort\nobjects according to their degrees of relevance, importance, or preference as\ndefined in the specific application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 09:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

As the backbone\ninfrastructure of modern communication networks, the optical fiber transmission\nsystem undergoes a significant capacity growth over decades by exploiting\navailable physical dimensions (time, frequency, quadrature, polarization and\nspace) of the optical carrier for multiplexing. For each dimension, stringent\northogonality must be guaranteed for perfect separation of independent\nmultiplexed signals. To catch up with the ever-increasing capacity requirement,\nit is therefore interesting and important to develop new multiplexing\nmethodologies relaxing the orthogonal constraint thus achieving better spectral\nefficiency and more flexibility of frequency reuse. Inspired by the idea of\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, here we propose a digital domain\npower division multiplexed (PDM) transmission technology which is fully\ncompatible with current dual polarization (DP) coherent optical communication\nsystem. The coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(CO-OFDM) modulation has been employed owing to its great superiority on high\nspectral efficiency, flexible coding, ease of channel estimation and robustness\nagainst fiber dispersion. And a PDM-DP-CO-OFDM has been theoretically and\nexperimentally demonstrated with 100Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)\ntransmission over 1440km standard single mode fibers (SSMFs). Two baseband\nquadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) OFDM signals are overlaid together with\ndifferent power levels. After IQ modulation, polarization multiplexing and long\ndistance fiber transmission, the PDM-DP-CO-OFDM signal has been successfully\nrecovered in the typical polarization diversity coherent receiver by successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 12:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}
