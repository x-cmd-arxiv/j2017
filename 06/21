However, the amount of time needed for\nMCMC to exceed the performance of variational methods can be quite high,\nmotivating more fine-grained tradeoffs. This paper derives a distribution over\nvariational parameters, designed to minimize a bound on the divergence between\nthe resulting marginal distribution and the target, and gives an example of how\nto sample from this distribution in a way that interpolates between the\nbehavior of existing methods based on Langevin dynamics and stochastic gradient\nvariational inference (SGVI).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

In inverse problems that use these networks as\ngenerative priors on data, one must often perform inference of the inputs of\nthe networks from the outputs. Inference is also required for sampling during\nstochastic training on these generative models. This paper considers inference\nin a deep stochastic neural network where the parameters (e.g., weights, biases\nand activation functions) are known and the problem is to estimate the values\nof the input and hidden units from the output. While several approximate\nalgorithms have been proposed for this task, there are few analytic tools that\ncan provide rigorous guarantees in the reconstruction error. This work presents\na novel and computationally tractable output-to-input inference method called\nMulti-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (ML-VAMP). The proposed\nalgorithm, derived from expectation propagation, extends earlier AMP methods\nthat are known to achieve the replica predictions for optimality in simple\nlinear inverse problems. Our main contribution shows that the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) of ML-VAMP can be exactly predicted in a certain large system limit\n(LSL) where the numbers of layers is fixed and weight matrices are random and\northogonally-invariant with dimensions that grow to infinity. ML-VAMP is thus a\nprincipled method for output-to-input inference in deep networks with a\nrigorous and precise performance achievability result in high dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Here we present a detailed study of the compatibility between boundary\nconditions and conservation laws. The conflict between open boundary conditions\nand momentum conservation is well understood, but we examine other symmetries,\nas well: we discuss gauge invariance, inversion, spin, and particle-hole\nsymmetry and their compatibility with open, periodic, and twisted boundary\nconditions. We develop the reasoning in the framework of the one-dimensional\nhalf-filled Hubbard model, whose Hamiltonian displays a variety of symmetries.\nOur discussion includes analytical and numerical results. Our analytical survey\nshows that boundary conditions break one or more symmetries of the\ninfinite-lattice Hamiltonian. The exception is twisted boundary condition with\nthe special torsion $\\Theta=\\pi L/2$, where $L$ is the lattice size. Our\nnumerical results for the ground-state energy at half-filling and the energy\ngap for $L=2$--$7$ show how the breaking of symmetry affects the convergence to\nthe $L\\to\\infty$ limit. We compare the computed energies and gaps with the\nexact results for the infinite lattice drawn from the Bethe-Ansatz solution.\nThe deviations are boundary-condition dependent. The special torsion yields\nmore rapid convergence than open or periodic boundary conditions. For sizes as\nsmall as $L=7$, the numerical results for twisted condition are very close to\nthe $L\\to\\infty$ limit.

We obtain new multislit spectroscopy of six young star-forming\nregions around NGC2865, to determine their redshifts and metallicities. The six\nemission-line regions are located 16-40 kpc from NGC2865 and they have similar\nredshifts. They have ages of ~10Myears and an average metallicity of\n12+log(O/H) ~ 8.6, suggesting a tidal origin for the regions. It is noted that\nthey coincide with an extended HI tail, which has projected density of N$_{HI}$\n< 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and displays a low surface brightness counterpart. These\nregions may represent the youngest of the three populations of star clusters\nalready identified in NGC2865. The high, nearly-solar, oxygen abundances found\nfor the six regions in the vicinity of NGC2865 suggest that they were formed by\npre-enriched material from the parent galaxy, from gas removed during the last\nmajor merger. Given the mass and the location of the HII regions, we can\nspeculate that these young star-forming regions are potential precursors of\nglobular clusters that will be part of the halo of NGC2865 in the future. Our\nresult supports the use of the multi-slit imaging spectroscopy as a useful tool\nfor finding nearly-formed stellar systems around galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

This is illustrated by a new limit on the corresponding cross\nsection that we derive from public IceCube data. In this context, we study\nwhich DM models could produce an observable flux of monochromatic neutrinos\nfrom DM annihilations. To this end, we proceed in two steps. First, within a\nset of simple and minimal assumptions concerning the properties of the DM\nparticle, we determine the models that could give rise to a significant\nannihilation into monochromatic neutrinos at the freeze-out epoch. The list of\nmodels turns out to be very limited as a result of various constraints, in\nparticular direct detection and neutrino masses at loop level. Given the fact\nthat, even if largely improved, the sensitivities will be far from reaching the\nthermal annihilation cross section soon, a signal could only be observed if the\nannihilation into neutrinos today is boosted with respect to the freeze-out\nepoch. This is why, in a second step, we analyze the possibility of having such\na large enhancement from the Sommerfeld effect. For each scenario, we also\ncompute the cross sections into other annihilation products and confront our\nresults with experimental constraints. We find that, within our simple and\nminimal assumptions, the expectation to observe monochromatic neutrinos is only\npossible in very specific scenarios. Some will be confirmed or excluded in the\nnear future because they predict signals slightly below the current\nexperimental sensitivities. We also discuss how these prospects change by\nrelaxing our assumptions as well as by considering other types of sharp\nspectral features.

The role of turbulent magnetic fields\ndepends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the\nstronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the\ngreater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression\nof Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

In this paper, we investigate to what extent the explicit\nmodelling of other agents is necessary to achieve observational learning\nthrough machine learning. Especially, we argue that observational learning can\nemerge from pure Reinforcement Learning (RL), potentially coupled with memory.\nThrough simple scenarios, we demonstrate that an RL agent can leverage the\ninformation provided by the observations of an other agent performing a task in\na shared environment. The other agent is only observed through the effect of\nits actions on the environment and never explicitly modeled. Two key aspects\nare borrowed from observational learning: i) the observer behaviour needs to\nchange as a result of viewing a 'teacher' (another agent) and ii) the observer\nneeds to be motivated somehow to engage in making use of the other agent's\nbehaviour. The later is naturally modeled by RL, by correlating the learning\nagent's reward with the teacher agent's behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

For comparison, we also study the same evaporation rates using\nMOCCA Monte Carlo models for globular cluster evolution. Our results show that\nthe mass evaporation rate is a dynamical value; that is, far from a constant\nsingle number found in earlier analytical work and commonly used in the\nliterature. Moreover, the evaporation rate derived with these simulations is\nhigher than values previously published. These models also show that the value\nof the mass evaporation rate depends on the strength of the tidal field. We\ngive an analytical estimate of the mass evaporation rate as a function of time\nand galactocentric distance xi(R_{GC},t). Upon extrapolating this formula to\nsmaller R_{GC} values, our results provide tentative evidence for a very high\nxi value at small R_{GC}. Our results suggest that the corresponding mass loss\nin the inner Galactic potential could be high and it should be accounted for\nwhen star clusters pass within it. This has direct relevance to nuclear cluster\nformation/growth via the infall of globular clusters through dynamical\nfriction. As an illustrative example, we estimate how the evaporation rate\nincreases for a ~10^5 solar masses globular cluster that decays through\ndynamical friction into the galactic centre.

However, in the mid and far infrared\nranges of the spectrum there exists a viable alternative to metals, polar\ndielectrics and semiconductors in which dielectric permittivity (the real part)\nturns negative in the Reststrahlen region. This feature engenders the so-called\nsurface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) capable of confining the field in a way akin\nto their plasmonic analogues, the SPPs. Since the damping rate of polar phonons\nis substantially less than that of free electrons, it is not unreasonable to\nexpect that phononic devices may outperform their plasmonic counterparts. Yet a\nmore rigorous analysis of the comparative merits of phononics and plasmonics\nreveals a more nuanced answer, namely that while phononic schemes do exhibit\nnarrower resonances and can achieve a very high degree of energy concentration,\nmost of the energy is contained in the form of lattice vibrations so that\nenhancement of the electric field, and hence the Purcell factor, is rather\nsmall compared to what can be achieved with metal nanoantennas.

Diffusion weighted signal is normally\nacquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically\ndistributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the\norientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame.\nThe Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for\nsingle shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell\nschemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the\nHuman Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal\nof optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling\npoints. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical\nCode (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in\nsingle or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design\nsingle or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to\nuniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell\nscheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms\nto solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated\ngreedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt\ngreedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a\nConstrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling\nschemes in dMRI.

In many\nreal-world applications however, models may have to sacrifice predictive power\nin favour of human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature engineering\nbecomes a crucial task, which requires significant and time-consuming human\neffort. Whilst some features are inherently static, representing properties\nthat cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual), others capture\ncharacteristics that could be adjusted (e.g., the daily amount of carbohydrates\ntaken). Nonetheless, once a model is learned from the data, each prediction it\nmakes on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance to be a static\npoint located in the chosen feature space. There are many circumstances however\nwhere it is important to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain\nprediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance\nshould be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter such a prediction when the\nmutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a\ntechnique that exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier to\noffer recommendations for transforming true negative instances into positively\npredicted ones. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using an online\nadvertising application. First, we design a Random Forest classifier that\neffectively separates between two types of ads: low (negative) and high\n(positive) quality ads (instances). Then, we introduce an algorithm that\nprovides recommendations that aim to transform a low quality ad (negative\ninstance) into a high quality one (positive instance). Finally, we evaluate our\napproach on a subset of the active inventory of a large ad network, Yahoo\nGemini.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 22:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

In this work, the limitations of the dEdx calibration\nmethod in terms of energy linearity, scale and resolution are explored. In the\ncase of a calorimeter with varying passive layer thickness as the one planned\nfor CMS, the $dEdx$ method leads to a significant constant term in the\nresolution function and a non-linearity of energy response. For these reasons,\na method based on the calorimeter sampling fraction that exploits the per-event\nmeasured shower depth is presented and shown to deliver superior absolute\nenergy scale, linearity and resolution. Calorimetric designs in which the back\nof the shower is sampled less, offer reduced cost without loss in performance.\nTherefore, a proper calibration as proposed here is crucial in obtaining the\nmost cost- and performance-effective silicon-sampling calorimeter design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 00:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

We begin by\nformulating various model assumptions, each one assuming a different order of\nuser preferences among purchased, clicked-but-not-purchased, and non-clicked\nitems, to study the usefulness of leveraging click records. We implement the\nmodel assumptions using the Bayesian personalized ranking model, which\nmaximizes the area under the curve for bipartite ranking.

WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature\nof ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is\nitself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat\ndifferential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,\ntraits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the\ntemperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the\nmolecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of\nultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be\nsignificantly ablated over the lifetime of its star.

Here we demonstrate the deterministic writing and deleting of single\nisolated skyrmions at room temperature in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo films with a\ndevice-compatible stripline geometry. The process is driven by the application\nof current pulses, which induce spin-orbit torques, and is directly observed\nusing a time resolved nanoscale X-ray imaging technique. We provide a\ncurrent-pulse profile for the efficient and deterministic writing and deleting\nprocess. Using micromagnetic simulations, we also reveal the microscopic\nmechanism of the topological fluctuations that occur during this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 03:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 00:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Our CNN trained only with 4000 synthetic\nimages achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24 on a test set with 55\ndistinct products as objects of interest and 17 distractor objects. A further\nincrease of 12% in the mAP is obtained by adding only 400 real images to these\n4000 synthetic images in the training set. A high degree of photorealism in the\nsynthetic images was not essential in achieving this performance.

In order to discuss this recent observation, we construct a\nnew one-zone GC formation model in which the maximum stellar mass (m_max) in\nthe initial mass function (IMF) of stars in a forming GC depends on the star\nformation rate (SFR), as deduced from independent observations. We investigate\nthe star formation histories of forming GCs. The principal results are as\nfollows. About 30 Myr after the formation of the first generation (1G) of stars\nwithin a particular GC, new stars can be formed from ejecta from asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars of 1G. However, the formation of this second\ngeneration (2G) of stars can last only for [10-20] Myr, because the most\nmassive SNe of 2G expel all of the remaining gas. The third generation (3G) of\nstars are then formed from AGB ejecta ~ 30$ Myr after the truncation of 2G star\nformation. This cycle of star formation followed by its truncation by SNe can\ncontinue until all AGB ejecta is removed from the GC by some physical process.\nThus, it is inevitable that GCs have discrete multiple stellar populations in\nthe [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] diagram. Our model predicts that low-mass GCs are unlikely\nto have discrete multiple stellar populations, and young massive clusters may\nnot have massive OB stars owing to low m_max ([20-30] M_sun) during the\nsecondary star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 08:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

In general, a medium expansion (contraction) brings about dramatic\nchanges in the behavior of diffusive transport properties. Here, we focus on\nsuch effects when the diffusion process is described by the Continuous Time\nRandom Walk (CTRW) model. For the case where the jump length and the waiting\ntime probability density functions (pdfs) are long-tailed, we derive a general\nbifractional diffusion equation which reduces to a normal diffusion equation in\nthe appropriate limit. We then study some particular cases of interest,\nincluding L\\'evy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs. In the former case, we find an\nanalytical exact solution for the Green's function (propagator). When the\nexpansion is sufficiently fast, the contribution of the diffusive transport\nbecomes irrelevant at long times and the propagator tends to a stationary\nprofile in the comoving reference frame. In contrast, for a contracting medium\na competition between the spreading effect of diffusion and the concentrating\neffect of contraction arises. For a subdiffusive CTRW in an exponentially\ncontracting medium, the latter effect prevails for sufficiently long times, and\nall the particles are eventually localized at a single point in physical space.\nThis \"Big Crunch\" effect stems from inefficient particle spreading due to\nsubdiffusion. We also derive a hierarchy of differential equations for the\nmoments of the transport process described by the subdiffusive CTRW model. In\nthe case of an exponential expansion, exact recurrence relations for the\nLaplace-transformed moments are obtained. Our results confirm the intuitive\nexpectation that the medium expansion hinders the mixing of diffusive particles\noccupying separate regions.

However, the binary gravitational binding energy is also affected by an\nusually neglected phenomenon, namely the dark matter dynamical friction (DMDF)\nproduced by the interaction of the binary components with their respective DM\ngravitational wakes. The entity of this effect depends on the orbital period\nand on the local value of the DM density, hence on the position of the binary\nin the Galaxy. We evaluate the DMDF produced by three different DM profiles:\nthe Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), the non-singular-isothermal-sphere (NSIS) and\nthe Ruffini-Arg\\\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) profile based on self-gravitating keV\nfermions. We first show that indeed, due to their Galactic position, the GW\nemission dominates over the DMDF in the NS-NS, NS-WD and WD-WD binaries for\nwhich measurements of the orbital decay exist. Then, we evaluate the conditions\nunder which the effect of DMDF on the binary evolution becomes comparable to,\nor overcomes, the one of the GW emission. We find that, for instance for\n$1.3$--$0.2$ $M_\\odot$ NS-WD, $1.3$--$1.3$~$M_\\odot$ NS-NS, and\n$0.25$--$0.50$~$M_\\odot$ WD-WD, located at 0.1~kpc, this occurs at orbital\nperiods around 20--30 days in a NFW profile while, in a RAR profile, it occurs\nat about 100 days. For closer distances to the Galactic center, the DMDF effect\nincreases and the above critical orbital periods become interestingly shorter.\nFinally, we also analyze the system parameters for which DMDF leads to an\norbital widening instead of orbital decay. All the above imply that a\ndirect/indirect observational verification of this effect in compact-star\nbinaries might put strong constraints on the nature of DM and its Galactic\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 09:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 15:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The latter one can be calculated recursively using the gyroscope\noutputs and the constant attitude matrix can be determined using constructed\nvector observations at different time. Compared with traditional initialization\nmethods, the proposed method does not necessitate the spacecraft being static\nor more than two non-collinear vector observations at the same time. Therefore,\nthe proposed method can promote increased spacecraft autonomy by autonomous\ninitialization of attitude estimators. The effectiveness and prospect of the\nproposed method in spacecraft attitude estimation applications have been\nvalidated through numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 10:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

A tiny Yukawa coupling delays the decay of the charged component\nof the inert doublet into the dark matter candidate, making the former\nlong-lived on the scale of collider detectors.

In the last years there appeared an alternative approach based on the\nsolution of two fundamental \"two-sided exit\" problems from an interval (TSE). A\nspectrally one-sided process will exit smoothly on one side on an interval, and\nthe solution is simply expressed in terms of a \"scale function\" $W$ (Bertoin\n1997). The non-smooth two-sided exit (or ruin) problem suggests introducing a\nsecond scale function $Z$ (Avram, Kyprianou and Pistorius 2004).\n  Since many other problems can be reduced to TSE, researchers produced in the\nlast years a kit of formulas expressed in terms of the \"$W,Z$ alphabet\" for a\ngreat variety of first passage problems. We collect here our favorite recipes\nfrom this kit, including a recent one (94) which generalizes the classic De\nFinetti dividend problem.

The interpretation of the data has therefore been controversial. 1D\nclimate modeling inferred that such hot climates would require very high levels\nof CO2 (2-6 bars). Previous carbon cycle modeling concluded that such stable\nhot climates were impossible and that the carbon cycle should lead to cold\nclimates during the Hadean and the Archean. Here, we revisit the climate and\ncarbon cycle of the early Earth at 3.8 Ga using a 3D climate-carbon model. We\nfind that CO2 partial pressures of around 1 bar could have produced hot\nclimates given a low land fraction and cloud feedback effects. However, such\nhigh CO2 partial pressures should not have been stable because of the\nweathering of terrestrial and oceanic basalts, producing an efficient\nstabilizing feedback. Moreover, the weathering of impact ejecta during the Late\nHeavy Bombardment (LHB) would have strongly reduced the CO2 partial pressure\nleading to cold climates and potentially snowball Earth events after large\nimpacts. Our results therefore favor cold or temperate climates with global\nmean temperatures between around 8{\\deg}C (281 K) and 30{\\deg}C (303 K) and\nwith 0.1-0.36 bar of CO2 for the late Hadean and early Archean.

If the disk luminosity temporary\nincreases by, e.g., limit-cycle oscillations, leading to a powerful radiatively\ndriven wind, strong shock waves propagate in the BLR. Because the dense clouds\nin the AGN BLRs typically have similar densities to those found in Type IIn\nsupernovae, strong radiative shocks emerge and efficiently convert the ejecta\nkinetic energy to radiation. As a result, transients similar to Type IIn\nsupernovae can be observed at AGN central regions. Since a typical black-hole\ndisk wind velocity is ~ 0.1c where c is the speed of light, the ejecta kinetic\nenergy is expected to be ~ 1e52 erg when ~ 1 Msun is ejected. This kinetic\nenergy is transformed to radiation energy in a timescale for the wind to sweep\nup a similar mass to itself in the BLR, which is a few hundred days. Therefore,\nboth luminosities (~ 1e44 erg/s) and timescales (~ 100 days) of the\nsuperluminous transients from AGN central regions match to those expected in\nour interaction model. If CSS100217 and PS16dtm are related to the AGN\nactivities triggered by limit-cycle oscillations, they become bright again in\ncoming years or decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 12:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

We revisit this question thanks to a spectroscopic analysis of\na sample of bright fast-rotating OB stars, with the goal of quantifying the\nefficiency of rotational mixing at high rotation rates. Method: Our sample\nconsists of 40 fast rotators on the main sequence, with spectral types\ncomprised between B0.5 and O4. We compare the abundances of some key element\nindicators of mixing (He, CNO) with the predictions of evolutionary models for\nsingle objects and for stars in interacting binary systems. Results: The\nproperties of half of the sample stars can be reproduced by single evolutionary\nmodels, even in the case of probable or confirmed binaries that can therefore\nbe true single stars in a pre-interaction configuration. The main problem for\nthe rest of the sample is a mismatch for the [N/O] abundance ratio (we confirm\nthe existence of fast rotators with a lack of nitrogen enrichment) and/or a\nhigh helium abundance that cannot be accounted for by models. Modifying the\ndiffusion coefficient implemented in single- star models does not solve the\nproblem as it cannot simultaneously reproduce the helium abundances and [N/O]\nabundance ratios of our targets. Since part of them actually are binaries, we\nalso compared their chemical properties with predictions for post-mass transfer\nsystems. We found that these models can explain the abundances measured for a\nmajority of our targets, including some of the most helium-enriched, but fail\nto reproduce them in other cases.

We\nhereby describe the procedure of combining VMAT and DIBH without a dedicated\nequipment, and report a dosimetric study related on our implemented technique.\nMethods: The DIBH technique is based on voluntary breath hold of the patient\nwhich is controlled by a laser on tattoo marks. Patients were selected\ndepending their ability to breath hold for 25s, and VMAT plans were optimized\nwith an arrangement of 4 arcs with a maximum delivery time of 20s each. A\nretrospective dosimetric study was undertaken on 30 patients treated with this\ntechnique: 10 received local (whole breast) RT (L-RT) with a simultaneous\nintegrated boost (SIB), 10 a locoregional (LR)RT of the chestwall, 10 a LR RT\nof the whole breast with SIB. For these patients, their DIBH-VMAT treatment\nplans were compared to free breathing (FB) VMAT plans, and dose characteristics\nof PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were evaluated. Results: The PTV coverage was\nidentical among plans under DIBH or FB.

Recently, it has been shown\nthat this so-called Ouzo effect, i.e. the spontaneous emulsification of oil\nmicrodroplets, can also be triggered by the preferential evaporation of ethanol\nin an evaporating sessile Ouzo drop, leading to an amazingly rich drying\nprocess with multiple phase transitions [H. Tan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.\nUSA 113(31) (2016) 8642]. Due to the enhanced evaporation near the contact\nline, the nucleation of oil droplets starts at the rim which results in an oil\nring encircling the drop. Furthermore, the oil droplets are advected through\nthe Ouzo drop by a fast solutal Marangoni flow. In this article, we investigate\nthe evaporation of mixture droplets in more detail, by successively increasing\nthe mixture complexity from pure water over a binary water-ethanol mixture to\nthe ternary Ouzo mixture (water, ethanol and anise oil). In particular,\naxisymmetric and full three-dimensional finite element method simulations have\nbeen performed on these droplets to discuss thermal effects and the complicated\nflow in the droplet driven by an interplay of preferential evaporation,\nevaporative cooling and solutal and thermal Marangoni flow. By using image\nanalysis techniques and micro-PIV measurements, we are able to compare the\nnumerically predicted volume evolutions and velocity fields with experimental\ndata. The Ouzo droplet is furthermore investigated by confocal microscopy. It\nis shown that the oil ring predominantly emerges due to coalescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

We begin by\narguing, using a reconstruction of its formalism, that quantum theory can be\nregarded as a universal framework governing an observer's acquisition of\ninformation from physical systems taken as information carriers. We continue by\nobserving that the structure of spacetime is encoded in the communication\nrelations among observers and more generally the information flow in spacetime.\nCombining these insights with an information-theoretic Machian view, we argue\nthat the quantum architecture of spacetime can operationally be viewed as a\nlocally finite network of degrees of freedom exchanging information. An\nadvantage -- and simultaneous limitation -- of an informational perspective is\nits quasi-universality, i.e. quasi-independence of the precise physical\nincarnation of the underlying degrees of freedom. This suggests to exploit\nthese informational insights to develop a largely microphysics independent\ntop-down approach to quantum gravity to complement extant bottom-up approaches\nby closing the scale gap between the unknown Planck scale physics and the\nfamiliar physics of quantum (field) theory and general relativity\nsystematically from two sides.

The objective is to\nmaximize the utility of the accepted items $S$ at the end of the algorithm,\nwhich is given by $f(S)$ for some non-negative monotone submodular function\n$f$.\n  For any small constant $\\epsilon > 0$, we consider the special case that the\nweight of an item on every dimension is at most a $(1-\\epsilon)$ fraction of\nthe total capacity, and give a polynomial-time deterministic\n$O(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon^2})$-competitive algorithm for the problem, where $k$ is\nthe (column) sparsity of the weight vectors. We also show several (almost)\ntight hardness results even when the algorithm is computationally unbounded. We\nshow that under the $\\epsilon$-slack assumption, no deterministic algorithm can\nobtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio, and no randomized algorithm can obtain any\n$o(\\frac{k}{\\log k})$ competitive ratio. For the general case (when $\\epsilon =\n0$), no randomized algorithm can obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio.\n  In contrast to the $(1+\\delta)$ competitive ratio achieved in Kesselheim et\nal.

The\nhigh-level, symbolic task planner decides what needs to be done, while the\nmotion planner checks feasibility and fills up geometric detail. It is known\nhowever that such a decomposition is not effective in general as the symbolic\nand geometrical components are not independent. In this work, we show that it\nis possible to compile task and motion planning problems into classical AI\nplanning problems; i.e., planning problems over finite and discrete state\nspaces with a known initial state, deterministic actions, and goal states to be\nreached. The compilation is sound, meaning that classical plans are valid robot\nplans, and probabilistically complete, meaning that valid robot plans are\nclassical plans when a sufficient number of configurations is sampled. In this\napproach, motion planners and collision checkers are used for the compilation,\nbut not at planning time. The key elements that make the approach effective are\n1) expressive classical AI planning languages for representing the compiled\nproblems in compact form, that unlike PDDL make use of functions and state\nconstraints, and 2) general width-based search algorithms capable of finding\nplans over huge combinatorial spaces using weak heuristics only.

Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the\ntransmitter and receiver need to align their antenna beams before they can\ncommunicate. Existing solutions scan the entire space to find the best\nalignment.

Profile\nmatching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested\nprofile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory\nthat uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the\ninterval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such\nlattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics to\nrepresent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, how\nhuman expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most\naccurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with\nmatching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild\nplausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the\ncomputed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A second\nquestion concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For\nmatching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a\ngiven one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on\ngrounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenance\nof the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profile\ninstances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be\nexploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be\nextended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matching\nwill be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory that\nexploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. It\nwill be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending the\nunderlying lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 15:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 19:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

An Ensemble agent is a compound agent composed of multiple agents, each\nwith its own tasks or goals to achieve. Usually when dealing with real-time\ndecision making, reactive agents are used; that is agents that return a\ndecision based on the current state. While reactive agents are very fast, most\ngames require more than just a rule-based agent to achieve good results.\nDeliberative agents---agents that use a forward model to search future\nstates---are very useful in games with no hard time limit, such as Go or\nBackgammon, but generally take too long for real-time games. The Ensemble\nframework addresses this issue by allowing the agent to be both deliberative\nand reactive at the same time. This is achieved by breaking up the game-play\ninto logical roles and having highly focused components for each role, with\neach component disregarding anything outwith its own role. Reactive agents can\nbe used where a reactive agent is suited to the role, and where a deliberative\napproach is required, branching is kept to a minimum by the removal of all\nextraneous factors, enabling an informed decision to be made within a much\nsmaller time-frame. An Arbiter is used to combine the component results,\nallowing high performing agents to be created from simple, efficient\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

Identification of planetary companions of giant stars is made\ndifficult because of the astrophysical noise, that may produce radial velocity\n(RV) variations similar to those induced by a companion. On the other hand any\nstellar signal is wavelength dependent, while signals due to a companion are\nachromatic. Aims. Our goal is to determine the origin of the Doppler periodic\nvariations observed in the thick disk K giant star TYC 4282-605-1 by HARPS-N at\nthe Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and verify if they can be due to the\npresence of a substellar companion. Methods. Several methods have been used to\nexclude the stellar origin of the observed signal including detailed analysis\nof activity indicators and bisector and the analysis of the photometric light\ncurve. Finally we have conducted an observational campaign to monitor the near\ninfrared (NIR) RV with GIANO at the TNG in order to verify whether the NIR\namplitude variations are comparable with those observed in the visible.\nResults. Both optical and NIR RVs show consistent variations with a period at\n101 days and similar amplitude, pointing to the presence of a companion\norbiting the target. The main orbital properties obtained for our giant star\nwith a derived mass of M=0.97+-0.03M_sun are\nM_Psini=10.78+-0.12MJ;P=101.54+-0.05days;e=0.28+-0.01 and a=0.422+-0.009AU. The\nchemical analysis shows a significant enrichment in the abundance of Nai, Mgi,\nAli and S i while the rest of analyzed elements are consistent with the solar\nvalue demonstrating that the chemical composition corresponds with an old K\ngiant (age = 10.1 Gyr) belonging to local thick disk. Conclusions. We conclude\nthat the substellar companion hypothesis for this K giant is the best\nexplanation for the observed periodic RV variation. This study also shows the\nhigh potential of multi-wavelength RV observations for the validation of planet\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

While\ndevising stochastic models of such processes is relatively easy, analyzing them\nis very challenging from a computational point of view, particularly for large\nnetworks appearing in real applications. One strategy to reduce the complexity\nof their analysis is to rely on approximations, often in terms of a set of\ndifferential equations capturing the evolution of a random node, distinguishing\nnodes with different topological contexts (i.e., different degrees of different\nneighborhoods), like degree-based mean field (DBMF), approximate master\nequation (AME), or pair approximation (PA). The number of differential\nequations so obtained is typically proportional to the maximum degree kmax of\nthe network, which is much smaller than the size of the master equation of the\nunderlying stochastic model, yet numerically solving these equations can still\nbe problematic for large kmax. In this paper, we extend AME and PA, which has\nbeen proposed only for the binary state case, to a multi-state setting and\nprovide an aggregation procedure that clusters together nodes having similar\ndegrees, treating those in the same cluster as indistinguishable, thus reducing\nthe number of equations while preserving an accurate description of global\nobservables of interest.

In this work we\ndemonstrate that commercial silicon CMOS image sensors can be thinned and\nformed into accurate, highly curved optical surfaces with undiminished\nfunctionality. Our key development is a pneumatic forming process that avoids\nrigid mechanical constraints and suppresses wrinkling instabilities. A\ncombination of forming-mold design, pressure membrane elastic properties, and\ncontrolled friction forces enables us to gradually contact the die at the\ncorners and smoothly press the sensor into a spherical shape. Allowing the die\nto slide into the concave target shape enables a threefold increase in the\nspherical curvature over prior approaches having mechanical constraints that\nresist deformation, and create a high-stress, stretch-dominated state. Our\nprocess creates a bridge between the high precision and low-cost but planar\nCMOS process, and ideal non-planar component shapes such as spherical imagers\nfor improved optical systems.

The extent of the wavefront becomes\nevident only in statistical accumulation of many independent detections, with\nprobability given by the Born rule. Drawing on concepts from quantum optics, we\nanalyze a simple model to reverse-engineer how this behavior can come about in\nterms of wave mechanics alone without a measurement axiom. The model detector\nconsists of many molecules, each of which can be resonantly excited by the\nincoming particle and then emit a detection signature (e.g., localized flash of\nlight). Different molecules have different resonant energies because local\nconditions (proximity of other molecules, Doppler shifts, etc.) vary. The\ndetector is thus a quasi-continuum, and the incoming particle preferentially\nexcites the molecule that it matches most closely in energy. (In actuality,\nmolecules can be so numerous that many could closely match the incoming\nparticle in energy; but in that case only one will be the first, and there will\nbe nothing left for the others by the time the first match resonates and then\nemits. The model does not explicitly take into account the temporal advance of\nthe particle wave packet through the detector medium.) The excited molecule can\nemit a detection signature, but that process competes with fluctuation-driven\ndephasing. We estimate the probability that a given molecule is resonantly\nexcited, and we also estimate the probability that a detection signature is\nproduced before being overwhelmed by fluctuations in the detector medium. The\nproduct of these two probabilities is proportional to the absolute-square of\nthe incoming wavefunction at the molecule in question, i.e. the Born rule. We\ndiscuss ways to probe these mechanisms experimentally, and check the model with\nnumbers from a neutron interference experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

Previous studies have documented the importance\nof personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because\nmost of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small\nsample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these\nfactors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538\nundergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our\nwork is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as\ntheir primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from\na single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of\nindividual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative\nindicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators\nresult in better model performance than individual characteristics (including\nboth personality and class attendance).
