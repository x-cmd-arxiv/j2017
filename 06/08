For instance, consider\na student preparing for a series of tests. She would typically take a few\npractice tests to know which areas she needs to improve upon. Based of the\nscores she obtains in these practice tests, she would formulate a strategy for\nmaximizing her scores in the actual tests. We treat this scenario in the\ncontext of an agent exploring a fixed-horizon episodic Markov Decision Process\n(MDP), where the agent can practice on the MDP for some number of episodes (not\nnecessarily known in advance) before starting to incur regret for its actions.\n  During practice, the agent's goal must be to maximize the probability of\nfollowing an optimal policy. This is akin to the problem of Pure Exploration\n(PE). We extend the PE problem of Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) to MDPs and propose\na Bayesian algorithm called Posterior Sampling for Pure Exploration (PSPE),\nwhich is similar to its bandit counterpart. We show that the Bayesian simple\nregret converges at an optimal exponential rate when using PSPE.\n  When the agent starts being evaluated, its goal would be to minimize the\ncumulative regret incurred. This is akin to the problem of Reinforcement\nLearning (RL). The agent uses the Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning\nalgorithm (PSRL) initialized with the posteriors of the practice phase. We\nhypothesize that this PSPE + PSRL combination is an optimal strategy for\nminimizing regret in RL problems with an initial practice phase. We show\nempirical results which prove that having a lower simple regret at the end of\nthe practice phase results in having lower cumulative regret during evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 16:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

The measured\nproton recoil momentum (~< 100 MeV in the deuteron rest frame) specifies the\ndeuteron configuration during the high-energy process and permits a controlled\ntheoretical treatment of nuclear effects. Nuclear and nucleonic structure are\nseparated using methods of light-front quantum mechanics.

However these\nconstraints weaken significantly in the sub-GeV mass region, simply because\nlight dark matter does not have enough energy to trigger detectors regardless\nof the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Even if future experiments\nlower their energy thresholds, they will still be blind to parameter space\nwhere dark matter particles interact with nuclei strongly enough that they lose\nenough energy and become unable to cause a signal above the experimental\nthreshold by the time they reach the underground detector. Therefore in case\ndark matter is in the sub-GeV region and strongly interacting, possible\nunderground scatterings of dark matter with terrestrial nuclei must be taken\ninto account because they affect significantly the recoil spectra and event\nrates, regardless of whether the experiment probes DM via DM-nucleus or\nDM-electron interaction.

The parameters of the zero-range effective field theory can\nbe determined by matching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated by solving\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation for winos interacting through a potential due to the\nexchange of weak gauge bosons. If the wino mass is larger than the critical\nvalue, the resonance is a wino-pair bound state. The power of the zero-range\neffective field theory is illustrated by calculating the rate for formation of\nthe bound state in the collision of two neutral winos through the emission of\ntwo soft photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 16:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

These implementation and model uncertainties should be\naddressed in the early stages of the controller design, otherwise they could\nlead to failure in the controller performance and consequently increase the\ntime and cost required for completing the controller verification and\nvalidation (V&V) with more iterative loops. In this paper, a new control\napproach is developed based on a nonlinear discrete sliding mode controller\n(DSMC) formulation to mitigate the ADC imprecisions and model uncertainties. To\nthis end, a DSMC design is developed against implementation imprecisions by\nincorporating the knowledge of ADC uncertainties on control inputs via an\nonline uncertainty prediction and propagation mechanism. Next, a generic online\nadaptive law will be derived to compensate for the impact of an unknown\nparameter in the controller equations that is assumed to represent the model\nuncertainty. The final proposed controller is an integrated adaptive DSMC with\nrobustness to implementation and model uncertainties that includes (i) an\nonline ADC uncertainty mechanism, and (ii) an online adaptation law. The\nproposed adaptive control approach is evaluated on a nonlinear automotive\nengine control problem in real-time using a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) setup\nwith an actual electronic control unit (ECU). The results reveal that the\nproposed adaptive control technique removes the uncertainty in the model fast,\nand significantly improves the robustness of the controllers to ADC\nimprecisions. This provides up to 60% improvement in the performance of the\ncontroller under implementation and model uncertainties compared to a baseline\nDSMC, in which there are no incorporated ADC imprecisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 17:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

Purpose: To present the new scheme and its\nmicroscopic motivation, and to test it using a Nilsson model calculation with\nthe original shell model orbits and with the new proxy set. Method: We invoke\nan approximate, analytic, treatment of the Nilsson model, that allows the above\nvetting and yet is also transparent in understanding the approximations\ninvolved in the new proxy-SU(3).

Based on a long-term monitoring program\nthe wide sdB sample has been increased, finding an unexpected correlation\nbetween the eccentricity and period. In this article we present the orbital\nsolution and spectral analysis of four new systems, BD-7.5977, EC11031-1348,\nTYC2084-448-1 and TYC3871-835-1, and update the orbital solution of PG1104+243.\nUsing the whole sample of wide sdBs, we aim at finding possible correlations\nbetween orbital and spectral properties, with as goal improving theoretical\nmodels of Roche-lobe overflow. High-resolution spectra were obtained to\ndetermine the radial velocities of both the sdB and MS components. Surface\ngravities and temperatures of both component were derived from photometric\nspectral-energy distributions. Spectral parameters of the cool companion were\nverified using the GSSP code. Furthermore the amount of accreted mass was\nestimated. Orbital parameters matching the earlier observed period-eccentricity\nrelation were found for three systems, while TYC 2084-448-1 is found to have a\nlower eccentricity than expected from the period-eccentricity trend indicated\nby the other systems. Based on new observations, the orbit of PG 1104+243 has a\nsmall but significant eccentricity of 0.04 $\\pm$ 0.02, matching other systems\nwith similar periods. Furthermore, a correlation between accreted mass and\norbital period was found, as well as a possible relation between the initial\nmass-ratio and the final period-eccentricity. The wide sdB-binary sample shows\ninteresting possible correlations between orbital and spectral properties.\nHowever, a larger sample is necessary to statistically validate them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 17:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Radio jets have been argued to be an ideal mechanism for\ndirect interaction between the AGN and the host galaxy. A drawback of previous\nsurveys of AGN is that they are fundamentally limited by the degeneracy between\nredshift and luminosity in flux-density limited samples. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present far-infrared Herschel observations of 74 radio-loud\nquasars (RLQs), 72 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and 27 radio galaxies (RGs),\nselected at 0.9<z<1.1 which span over two decades in optical luminosity. By\ndecoupling luminosity from evolutionary effects, we investigate how the star\nformation rate (SFR) depends on AGN luminosity, radio-loudness and orientation.\nWe find that: 1) the SFR shows a weak correlation with the bolometric\nluminosity for all AGN sub-samples, 2) the RLQs show a SFR excess of about a\nfactor of 1.4 compared to the RQQs, matched in terms of black hole mass and\nbolometric luminosity, suggesting that either positive radio-jet feedback or\nradio AGN triggering are linked to star-formation triggering and 3) RGs have\nlower SFRs by a factor of 2.5 than the RLQ sub-sample with the same BH mass and\nbolometric luminosity. We suggest that there is some jet power threshold at\nwhich radio-jet feedback switches from enhancing star formation (by compressing\ngas) to suppressing it (by ejecting gas). This threshold depends on both galaxy\nmass and jet power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 18:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In this work, we\nreport flux growth in a horizontal configuration with a temperature gradient\nalong the horizontal axis: a liquid transport growth analogous to the vapor\ntransport technique. In a typical liquid transport growth, the charge is kept\nat the hot end of the refractory container and the flux melt dissolves the\ncharge and transfers it to the cold end.

Ideally, systems would employ\nnear-sensor computation to execute these tasks at sensor endpoints to maximize\ndata reduction and minimize data movement. However, near- sensor computing\npresents its own set of challenges such as operating power constraints, energy\nbudgets, and communication bandwidth capacities. In this paper, we propose a\nstochastic- binary hybrid design which splits the computation between the\nstochastic and binary domains for near-sensor NN applications. In addition, our\ndesign uses a new stochastic adder and multiplier that are significantly more\naccurate than existing adders and multipliers. We also show that retraining the\nbinary portion of the NN computation can compensate for precision losses\nintroduced by shorter stochastic bit-streams, allowing faster run times at\nminimal accuracy losses. Our evaluation shows that our hybrid stochastic-binary\ndesign can achieve 9.8x energy efficiency savings, and application-level\naccuracies within 0.05% compared to conventional all-binary designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 19:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

Its\npath-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies\nconceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies, and\nmakes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the\nremittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond.\n  This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its\ninception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect\nthe credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in\nthe current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling\nflag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across\nthose links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly\nconnected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the network's core and provide\nhigh liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base\nof around 112,000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10\nhighly connected gateway wallets.

The analytical part is mainly concerned with\nthe behavior of 2D3C flows in isolation and the connection between the geometry\nof the nonlinear interactions and the resulting energy transfer directions.\nSpecial emphasis is given to the role of helicity. We show that a generic 2D3C\nflow can be described by two stream functions corresponding to the two helical\nsectors of the velocity field.

The coupling between\nseveral 2D3C flows is studied through a set of suitably designed direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS), where we also explore the transition between 2D\nand fully 3D turbulence.

This has been broadly overlooked in the modelling and\ninterpretation of the polarization due to technical problems (e.g., lack of\ntemporal resolution or of time-dependent MHD solar models) and/or because many\npolarization measurements can apparently be explained without dynamics. Here,\nwe show that the temporal evolution is critic for explaining the spectral-line\nscattering polarization because of its sensitivity to rapidly-varying physical\nquantities and the possibility of signal cancellations and attenuation during\nextended time integration. For studying the combined effect of time-varying\nmagnetic fields and kinematics, we solved the 1.5D NLTE problem of the second\nkind in time-dependent 3D R-MHD solar models and we synthesized the Hanle and\nZeeman polarization in forward scattering for the chromospheric {\\lambda}4227\nline.

Android supports multiple\ncommunication methods for apps to cooperate. This creates a security risk of\napp collusion. For instance, a sandboxed app with permission to access\nsensitive data might leak that data to another sandboxed app with access to the\ninternet. In this paper, we present a method to detect potential collusion\nbetween apps. First, we extract from apps all information about their accesses\nto protected resources and communications. Then we identify sets of apps that\nmight be colluding by using rules in first order logic codified in Prolog.\nAfter these, more computationally demanding approaches like taint analysis can\nfocus on the identified sets that show collusion potential. This \"filtering\"\napproach is validated against a dataset of manually crafted colluding apps. We\nalso demonstrate that our tool scales by running it on a set of more than\n50,000 apps collected in the wild. Our tool allowed us to detect a large set of\nreal apps that used collusion as a synchronization method to maximize the\neffects of a payload that was injected into all of them via the same SDK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 21:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

VLE SNe light\ncurves, computed here with the KEPLER code, are distinctively faint, red, and\nlong-lived, making them challenging to find with transient surveys. The\naccompanying shock breakouts are brighter, though briefer, and potentially\neasier to detect. Previous analytic work provides general guidance, but\nnumerical simulations are challenging due to the range of conditions and lack\nof equilibration between color and effective temperatures. We consider previous\nanalytic work and extend discussions of color temperature and opacity to the\nlower energy range explored by these events. Since this is the first\napplication of the CASTRO code to shock breakout, test simulations of normal\nenergy shock breakout of SN1987A are carried out and compared with the\nliterature. A set of breakout light curves and spectra are then calculated for\nVLE SNe with final kinetic energies in the range $10^{47} - 10^{50}$ ergs for\nred supergiants with main sequence masses 15 Msun and 25 Msun.

The two lowest-$J$\nSiS quasi-thermal emission lines trace a much more extended emitting region\nthan previous high-J SiS observations. Their distributions show that the SiS\nquasi-thermal emission consists of two components: one is very compact\n(radius<1.5\", corresponding to <3$\\times 10^{15}$ cm), and the other extends\nout to a radius >11\". An incomplete shell-like structure is found in the\nnorth-east, which is indicative of existing SiS shells. Clumpy structures are\nalso revealed in this CSE. The gain of the SiS (1-0) maser (optical depths of\nabout -5 at the blue-shifted side and, assuming inversion throughout the entire\nline's velocity range, about -2 at the red-shifted side) suggests that it is\nunsaturated. The SiS (1-0) maser can be explained in terms of ro-vibrational\nexcitation caused by infrared pumping, and we propose that infrared continuum\nemission is the main pumping source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 03:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of\ntranslations, rotations, reflections, uniform scalings. Initially, each robot\noccupies a distinct position. When active, a robot operates in standard LCM\ncycles. Robots are asynchronous, oblivious, anonymous, silent and execute the\nsame distributed algorithm. So far, the problem has been mainly addressed by\nassuming chirality, that is robots share a common left-right orientation. We\nare interested in removing such a restriction. While working on the subject, we\nfaced several issues that required close attention. We deeply investigated how\nsuch difficulties were overcome in the literature, revealing that crucial\narguments for the correctness proof of the existing algorithms have been\nneglected. The systematic lack of rigorous arguments with respect to necessary\nconditions required for providing correctness proofs deeply affects the\nvalidity as well as the relevance of strategies proposed in the literature.\nHere we design a new deterministic distributed algorithm that fully\ncharacterizes APF showing its equivalence with the well-known Leader Election\nproblem in the asynchronous model without chirality.

The\ndetermination of these parameters with high accuracy has a widespread impact on\nGalactic and extragalactic measurements. This research is aimed at establishing\nthe confidence with which such parameters can be determined. This is relevant\nfor the data published in the context of the BeSSeL survey collaboration, but\nalso for future observations, in particular from the Southern Hemisphere. In\naddition, some astrophysical properties of the masers can be constrained,\nnotably the luminosity function. We have simulated the population of\nmaser-bearing young stars associated with Galactic spiral structure, generating\nseveral samples and comparing them with the observed samples used in the BeSSeL\nsurvey. Consequently, we checked the determination of Galactic parameters for\nobservational biases introduced by the sample selection.

In fact, the published error estimates appear to be conservative for most\nof the parameters.

Moreover, by modeling future parallax data\nwith larger distance and, thus, greater relative uncertainties for a larger\nnumbers of sources, we found that parallax-distance biasing is an important\nissue. Hence, using fractional parallax uncertainty in the weighting of the\nmotion data is imperative.

There is evidence that children might be learning language by\nsimply disambiguating potential meanings based on multiple exposures to\nutterances in different contexts (cross-situational learning).

Unlike existing methods that mainly utilize semantic context\nfor regularizing or smoothing the prediction map, we design novel supervisions\nfrom semantic context for learning better deep feature representations. Two\ntypes of semantic context, scene names of images and label map statistics of\nimage patches, are exploited to create label hierarchies between the original\nclasses and newly created subclasses as the learning supervisions. Such\nsubclasses show lower intra-class variation, and help CNN detect more\nmeaningful visual patterns and learn more effective deep features.

We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in\nthe dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of\nparameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by\nLHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for\nintegrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$.

A number of biomarkers have been developed to distinguish between\nrecent and long-term HIV infection, based on the antibody response to HIV. To\nquantify the recency of infection at an individual level, we propose\ncharacterising the growth of such biomarkers from observations from a panel of\nindividuals with known seroconversion time, using Bayesian mixed effect models.\nWe combine this knowledge of the growth patterns with observations from a newly\ndiagnosed individual, to estimate the probability seroconversion occurred in\nthe X months prior to diagnosis. We explore, through a simulation study, the\ncharacteristics of different biomarkers that affect our ability to estimate\nrecency, such as the growth rate.

FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and,\ntherefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce\nself-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract\nrepresentations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization,\nneuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit\nvariance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\"\n(SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point\ntheorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that\nare propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and\nunit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This\nconvergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many\nlayers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly\nrobust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an\nupper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients\nare impossible.

These data are both readily\navailable and have the potential to provide valuable information to estimate\nand predict the key transmission features of seasonal and pandemic influenza.\nWe propose an epidemic model that links the underlying unobserved influenza\ntransmission process to data on severe influenza cases. Within a Bayesian\nframework, we infer retrospectively the parameters of the epidemic model for\neach seasonal outbreak from 2012 to 2015, including: the effective reproduction\nnumber; the initial susceptibility; the probability of admission to intensive\ncare given infection; and the effect of school closure on transmission. The\nmodel is also implemented in real time to assess whether early forecasting of\nthe number of admission to intensive care is possible. Our model of admissions\ndata allows reconstruction of the underlying transmission dynamics revealing:\nincreased transmission during the season 2013/14 and a noticeable effect of\nChristmas school holiday on disease spread during season 2012/13 and 2014/15.\nWhen information on the initial immunity of the population is available,\nforecasts of the number of admissions to intensive care can be substantially\nimproved. Readily available severe case data can be effectively used to\nestimate epidemiological characteristics and to predict the evolution of an\nepidemic, crucially allowing real-time monitoring of the transmission and\nseverity of the outbreak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 11:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 17:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

To this end we study observables\nsensitive to UHECR source inhomogeneities but robust to uncertainties on\nmagnetic fields and the UHECR mass composition.

Such protocols become clique-gossip\naveraging algorithms when node states are scalars under averaging rules. We\ngeneralize the classical notion of line graph to capture the essential node\ninteraction structure induced by both the underlying network and the specific\nclique sequence. We prove a fundamental eigenvalue invariance principle for\nperiodic clique-gossip protocols, which implies that any permutation of the\nclique sequence leads to the same spectrum for the overall state transition\nwhen the generalized line graph contains no cycle.

Surprise search is grounded in the divergent\nsearch paradigm and is fabricated within the principles of evolutionary search.\nThe algorithm mimics the self-surprise cognitive process and equips\nevolutionary search with the ability to seek for solutions that deviate from\nthe algorithm's expected behaviour. The predictive model of expected solutions\nis based on historical trails of where the search has been and local\ninformation about the search space. Surprise search is tested extensively in a\nrobot maze navigation task: experiments are held in four authored deceptive\nmazes and in 60 generated mazes and compared against objective-based\nevolutionary search and novelty search. The key findings of this study reveal\nthat surprise search is advantageous compared to the other two search\nprocesses. In particular, it outperforms objective search and it is as\nefficient as novelty search in all tasks examined. Most importantly, surprise\nsearch is faster, on average, and more robust in solving the navigation problem\ncompared to any other algorithm examined. Finally, our analysis reveals that\nsurprise search explores the behavioural space more extensively and yields\nhigher population diversity compared to novelty search. What distinguishes\nsurprise search from other forms of divergent search, such as the search for\nnovelty, is its ability to diverge not from earlier and seen solutions but\nrather from predicted and unseen points in the domain considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 12:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

In the case of Ni, Pd and Zn an unusual line broadening\nin the low temperature NMR spectra reveals the existence of an impurity-induced\nlocal alternating magnetization (LAM), while exponentially decaying\nspin-lattice relaxation rates $T_1^{-1}$ towards low temperatures indicate the\nopening of spin gaps. A distribution of gap magnitudes is proven by a stretched\nspin-lattice relaxation and a variation of $T_1^{-1}$ within the broad\nresonance lines. These observations depend strongly on the impurity\nconcentration and therefore can be understood using the model of finite\nsegments of the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, i.e. pure chain\nsegmentation due to S = 0 impurities.

We present a method based on the tomographic study\nof an edge-on disk. Using ALMA, we observe at 0.5$\"$ resolution the Flying\nSaucer in CO J=2-1 and CS J=5-4. This edge-on disk appears in silhouette\nagainst the CO J=2-1 emission from background molecular clouds in $\\rho$ Oph.\nThe combination of velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk\nand intensity variations in the CO background as a function of velocity provide\na direct measure of the gas temperature as a function of radius and height\nabove the disk mid-plane. The overall thermal structure is consistent with\nmodel predictions, with a cold ($< 15-12 $~K), CO-depleted mid-plane, and a\nwarmer disk atmosphere. However, we find evidence for CO gas along the\nmid-plane beyond a radius of about 200\\,au, coincident with a change of grain\nproperties. Such a behavior is expected in case of efficient rise of UV\npenetration re-heating the disk and thus allowing CO thermal desorption or\nfavoring direct CO photo-desorption.

Two long standing problems have a solution in this context: 1)\nEach degree of freedom on the lattice corresponds to $2^d$ degrees of freedom\nin the continuum, but all these doublers have (in the case of fermions) the\nsame chirality and can be either identified, thus removing the degeneracy, or,\nin some theories with extended supersymmetry, identified with different members\nof the same supermultiplet. 2) The derivative operator, defined on the lattice\nas a suitable periodic function of the lattice momentum, is an addittive and\nconserved quantity, thus assuring that the Leibnitz rule is satisfied. This\nimplies that the product of two fields on the lattice is replaced by a\nnon-local \"star product\" which is however in general non-associative.\nAssociativity of the \"star product\" poses strong restrictions on the form of\nthe lattice derivative operator (which becomes the inverse gudermannian\nfunction of the lattice momentum) and has the consequence that the degrees of\nfreedom of the lattice theory and of the continuum theory are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence, so that the two theories are eventually equivalent.\nRegularization of the ultraviolet divergences on the lattice is not associated\nto the lattice spacing, which does not act as a regulator, but may be obtained\nby a one parameter deformation of the lattice derivative, thus preserving the\nlattice structure even in the limit of infinite momentum cutoff. However this\nregularization breaks gauge invariance and a gauge invariant regularization\nwithin the lattice formulation is still lacking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 14:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We consider\nthe LFSPNs whose continuous markings have no influence to the discrete ones and\nwhose discrete part is continuous time stochastic Petri nets. The underlying\nstochastic model for the discrete part of the LFSPNs is continuous time Markov\nchains (CTMCs). The performance analysis of the continuous part of LFSPNs is\naccomplished via the associated stochastic fluid models (SFMs).

The analysis is based mainly on galaxies selected\nfrom the Galaxy Zoo 2 database and the Catalogue of Southern Ringed Galaxies.\nThe dark gaps between inner and outer rings are of interest because of their\nlikely association with the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points that would be present\nin the gravitational potential of a bar or oval.

The models\nconsidered include a first principles fully-kinetic (FK) description, two\nwidely used reduced models [gyrokinetic (GK) and hybrid-kinetic (HK) with fluid\nelectrons], and a novel reduced gyrokinetic approach (KREHM). Two different ion\nbeta ($\\beta_i$) regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For $\\beta_i=0.5$, good\nagreement between the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion\nto the electron gyroradius, thus providing firm evidence for a kinetic Alfv\\'en\ncascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower spectral\nslopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For\n$\\beta_i=0.1$, a detailed analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight\ndisagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at kinetic scales, even though\nkinetic Alfv\\'en fluctuations likely still play a significant role. The\ndiscrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK\nand HK results seem to suggest the presence of fast magnetosonic and ion\nBernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes, but with a more notable deviation\nfrom GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and strengths of\nreduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the fully-kinetic model\non a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic\neffects at play in turbulent collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 15:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

This study is conducted on the\nAu49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 composition with a liquid-liquid transition\ntemperature slightly lower than Tg. The consequence is that the\nhigh-temperature kinetically fragile liquid freezes into the glass during\nconventional processing and the underlying liquid-liquid transition is thus\naccessed by the system during annealing below Tg. Upon reheating, the reverse\ntransformation is observed by calorimetry. This conclusion is supported by a\nbroad collection of complementary laboratory and synchrotron-based techniques,\nsuch as differential- and fast- scanning calorimetry, and x-ray photon\ncorrelation spectroscopy. Our findings support the big-picture proposed by\nAngell that liquids with different fragility occupy different flanks of an\nunderlying order-disorder transition.
