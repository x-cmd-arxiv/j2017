Improving the efficiency of the\nantihydrogen annihilation detection plays a central role in the final\nsensitivity of the experiments. We propose deep learning as a novel technique\nto analyze antihydrogen annihilation data, and compare its performance with a\ntraditional track and vertex reconstruction method.

Nonetheless, as a\nresult of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical\nJ-factors of dSphs are usually affected by significant errors. In this paper,\nwe study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective targets of interest. In the\nframework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies\nprovides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and,\nconsequently, of their astrophysical J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for\nthese 36 dIrr galaxies. We find a range of values comparable with the J-factors\nof dSph galaxies. However, differently from dSphs an extra astrophysical\ngamma-ray background component is expected in dIrrs, that is due to their\nstar-formation activity. In this paper, we show via a theoretical approach that\nfor galaxies in our sample the extra astrophysical background component is\nnegligible. Therefore, we conclude that dIrr galaxies can be potentially\nconsidered as additional point-like targets for DM searches with gamma-rays.

In contrast, in the 40 Msun, 60 Msun and 120 Msun star cases,\nthe more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels\nthrough the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the\nwind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97 Myrs, 3.97\nMyrs and 3.01 Myrs respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe).\nThe wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these SN\nevents as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up\nremaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The `cloud' as a coherent structure\ndoes not survive the SN from any of these stars, but only in the 120 Msun case\nis the cold molecular material completely destabilised and returned to the\nunstable thermal phase. In the 40 Msun and 60 Msun cases, coherent clumps of\ncold material are ejected from the cloud by the SN, potentially capable of\nfurther star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 16:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The\nlearned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node\nclassification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of\nthe existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and\nstatic networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over\ntime with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of\nreal-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and\ntheir attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new\ncontent patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing\ncharacteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to\ncapture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental\nimportance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are\nthe first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the\ninherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and\nincomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their\nindividual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be\nperformed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network\nembedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline\nmethod for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory\nto maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We\nperform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to\ncorroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 17:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

We use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize\nlong DNA strands deforming and elongating in shear flow near a rotating\nmicrowire, in agreement with numerical simulations. While untethered DNA is\nobserved to elongate substantially, in agreement with our theory and numerical\nsimulations, strong extension of DNA becomes possible by introducing tethering.\nFor the case of tethered polymers, we show that increasing the rotation rate\ncan deterministically spool a substantial portion of the chain into a fully\nstretched, single-file conformation.

Combining the h-index and Nj, we define a\ntwo-dimensional index (H,M) that measures both the output (through H) and the\noutreach (through M) of individual's research. In order to probe the relevance\nof this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a\npanel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different\nresearch themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two\nindices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of\nresearchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects.

We find that the PDF has a simple shape:\nit declines with density as a power-law P~rho**(-2), which is exponentially\nsuppressed on both small and large densities. The proposed double-exponential\napproximation provides an accurate fit to all our N-body results for small\nfiltering scales R< 5Mpc/h with rms density fluctuations sigma>1. In\ncombination with the spherical infall model that works well for small\nfluctuations sigma<1, the PDF is now approximated with just few percent errors\nover the range of twelve orders of magnitude -- a remarkable example of\nprecision cosmology. We find that at 5-10% level the PDF explicitly depends on\nredshift (at fixed sigma) and on cosmological density parameter Omega_m. We\ntest different existing analytical approximations and find that the often used\nlog-normal approximation is always 3-5 times less accurate than either the\ndouble-exponential approximation or the spherical infall model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 18:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

The best sensitivity is achieved to models where the production and\ndecay occur due to different coupling constants, and the lifetime of exotic\nparticles determines the probability of decay within a detector. The lifetimes\nof such particles can be independently limited from standard cosmology, in\nparticular the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we analyze the\nconstraints on the simplest scalar model coupled through the Higgs portal,\nwhere the production occurs via $h\\to SS$, and the decay is induced by the\nsmall mixing angle of the Higgs field $h$ and scalar $S$.

The transmitter has to harvest radio\nfrequency (RF) energy from multiple PBs due to the shortage of embedded power\nsupply before establishing its secure communication. We consider two different\nscenarios. In the first, the PBs and the transmitter belong to the same\noperator, where we formulate the resource allocation problem as the\nminimization of the total transmit power subject to the target secure rate\nconstraint. The solution of this problem yields both the optimal power and\nenergy transfer time allocation. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we\npropose a two-level approach, where the inner level problem can be recast as a\nconvex optimization framework via conic convex reformulation, while the outer\nlevel problem can be handled by using one-dimensional (1D) search. The second\nscenario considers the case where the transmitter and the PBs belong to\ndifferent service suppliers. Hence, we formulate the resource allocation\nproblem where we consider incentives for the PBs to assist the transmitter.\nThis leads to the formulation of a Stackelberg game for the secure\nwireless-powered multiantenna multicasting system. The transmitter has to pay\nfor the energy services from these multiple PBs in order to facilitate secure\ncommunications. In this game, the transmitter and the PB are modelled as leader\nand follower, respectively, in which both of them try to maximize their own\nutility function. The closed-form Stackelberg equilibrium of the formulated\ngame is then derived. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our\nproposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 19:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

Our\nbasic idea is to exploit binary structure directly in pre-trained filter banks\nand produce binary-weight models via tensor expansion.

Two\ngeneral hypotheses exist for the cause of the dichotomy between rocky and\ngas-enveloped planets (or possible water worlds): either low mass planets do\nnot necessarily form thick atmospheres of a few wt. %, or the thick atmospheres\non these planets easily escape driven by x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV)\nemissions from young parent stars. Here we show that a cutoff between rocky and\ngas-enveloped planets due to hydrodynamic escape is most likely to occur at a\nmean radius of 1.76$\\pm$0.38 (2$\\sigma$) $R_{\\oplus}$ around Sun-like stars. We\nexamine the limit in rocky planet radii predicted by hydrodynamic escape across\na wide range of possible model inputs using 10,000 parameter combinations drawn\nrandomly from plausible parameter ranges. We find a cutoff between rocky and\ngas-enveloped planets that agrees with the observed cutoff. The large\ncross-section available for XUV absorption in the extremely distended primitive\natmospheres of low mass planets results in complete loss of atmospheres during\nthe ~100 Myr phase of stellar XUV saturation. In contrast, more massive planets\nhave less distended atmospheres and less escape, and so retain thick\natmospheres through XUV saturation and then indefinitely as the XUV and escape\nfluxes drop over time. The agreement between our model and exoplanet data leads\nus to conclude that hydrodynamic escape plausibly explains the observed upper\nlimit on rocky planet size and few planets (a \"valley\" or \"radius gap\") in the\n1.5-2$R_{\\oplus}$ range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 05:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jul 2017 03:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 18:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

We use an asymptotic approach to predict the effect of surfactant\ndistribution on the deformation of a single droplet as well as the effective\nshear and extensional viscosity for the dilute emulsion. The non-uniform\ndistribution of surfactants due to the bulk flow results in the generation of a\nMarangoni stress which affects both the deformation as well as the bulk\nrheology of the suspension. The present analysis is done for the limiting case\nwhen the surfactant transport is dominated by the surface diffusion relative to\nsurface convection. As an example, we have used two commonly encountered bulk\nflows, namely, uniaxial extensional flow and simple shear flow. With the\nassumption of negligible inertial forces present in either of the phases, we\nare able to show that both the surfactant concentration on the droplet surface\nas well as the ratio of viscosity of the droplet phase with respect to the\nsuspending fluid has a significant effect on the droplet deformation as well as\nthe bulk rheology. It is seen that increase in the non-uniformity in surfactant\ndistribution on the droplet surface results in a higher droplet deformation and\na higher effective viscosity for either of linear flows considered. For the\ncase of simple shear flow, surfactant distribution is found to have no effect\non the inclination angle, however, a higher viscosity ratio predicts the\ndroplet to be more aligned towards the direction of flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 06:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The closeness centrality measure assigns a centrality value to\neach node based on its accessibility to the whole network. In real life\napplications, we are mainly interested in ranking nodes based on their\ncentrality values. The classical method to compute the rank of a node first\ncomputes the closeness centrality of all nodes and then compares them to get\nits rank. Its time complexity is $O(n \\cdot m + n)$, where $n$ represents total\nnumber of nodes, and $m$ represents total number of edges in the network.

Larger\nsatellites therefore continue to rely on proven processors with large feature\nsizes. Software-based concepts have largely been ignored by the space industry\nas they were researched only in theory, and have not yet reached the level of\nmaturity necessary for implementation.

It is important to obtain\neffective ranking results and at the same time obtain the results efficiently\nin a timely manner for providing good user experience and saving computational\ncosts. Valuable prior research has been conducted for learning to efficiently\nrank like the cascade ranking (learning) model, which uses a sequence of\nranking functions to progressively filter some items and rank the remaining\nitems. However, most existing research of learning to efficiently rank in\nsearch is studied in a relatively small computing environments with simulated\nuser queries.\n  This paper presents novel research and thorough study of designing and\ndeploying a Cascade model in a Large-scale Operational E-commerce Search\napplication (CLOES), which deals with hundreds of millions of user queries per\nday with hundreds of servers. The challenge of the real-world application\nprovides new insights for research: 1). Real-world search applications often\ninvolve multiple factors of preferences or constraints with respect to user\nexperience and computational costs such as search accuracy, search latency,\nsize of search results and total CPU cost, while most existing search solutions\nonly address one or two factors; 2). Effectiveness of e-commerce search\ninvolves multiple types of user behaviors such as click and purchase, while\nmost existing cascade ranking in search only models the click behavior. Based\non these observations, a novel cascade ranking model is designed and deployed\nin an operational e-commerce search application. An extensive set of\nexperiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed work to address multiple\nfactors of effectiveness, efficiency and user experience in the real-world\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 09:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

In quantum metrology, where the phase\nof a qubit is used to detect external fields, the clock stability is defined by\nthe qubit coherence time, which determines the spectral linewidth and frequency\nprecision. Here we demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol where the spectral\nprecision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the stability\nof a classical clock. Using this technique, we observe a precision in frequency\nestimation scaling in time $T$, as $T^{-3/2}$ for classical oscillating fields.\nThe narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to\nsense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607\n$\\mu$Hz, 8 orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 09:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

Part of this problem is\nattributable to the continued mixing of truly model-independent measurements\nusing the cosmic-chronomter approach, and model-dependent data extracted from\nBAOs. In this paper, we advance the use of 2-point diagnostics beyond their\ncurrent status, and introduce new variations, which we call Delta h(z_i,z_j),\nthat are more useful for model comparisons.

New forms of managerialism\nhave been introduced into the higher education system, leading to an increasing\ninterest from funding bodies in developing external evaluation tools to\nallocate funds. Rankings rely heavily on bibliometric indicators. But\nbibliometricians have been very critical with their use. Among other, they have\npointed out the over-simplistic view rankings represent when analyzing the\nresearch output of universities, as they consider them as homogeneous ignoring\ndisciplinary differences. Although many university rankings now include league\ntables by fields, reducing the complex framework of universities' research\nactivity to a single dimension leads to poor judgment and decision making. This\nis partly because of the influence disciplinary specialization has on research\nevaluation. This chapter analyzes from a methodological perspective how\nrankings suppress disciplinary differences which are key factors to interpret\ncorrectly these rankings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 10:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

Bootstrap\nlasso+ols is notable for its technical simplicity, good interpretability, and\nperformance that is comparable with that of other more complicated methods.\nHowever, bootstrap lasso+ols depends on the beta-min assumption, a theoretic\ncriterion that is often violated in practice. Thus, we introduce a new method,\ncalled bootstrap lasso+partial ridge, to relax this assumption. Lasso+partial\nridge is a two-stage estimator. First, the lasso is used to select features.\nThen, the partial ridge is used to refit the coefficients. Simulation results\nshow that bootstrap lasso+partial ridge outperforms bootstrap lasso+ols when\nthere exist small, but nonzero coefficients, a common situation that violates\nthe beta-min assumption. For such coefficients, the confidence intervals\nconstructed using bootstrap lasso+partial ridge have, on average, $50\\%$ larger\ncoverage probabilities than those of bootstrap lasso+ols.

By comparing with the locally\nobserved $j_\\star$ vs. $M_\\star$ relations for LTGs and ETGs we estimate the\nfraction $f_j$ of the initial specific angular momentum associated to the\ninfalling gas that is retained in the stellar component: for LTGs we find\n$f_j\\approx 1.11^{+0.75}_{-0.44}$, in line with the classic disc formation\npicture; for ETGs we infer $f_j\\approx 0.64^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$, that can be\ntraced back to a $z<1$ evolution via dry mergers. We also show that the\nobserved scatter in the $j_{\\star}$ vs. $M_{\\star}$ relation for both galaxy\ntypes is mainly contributed by the intrinsic dispersion in the spin parameters\nof the host dark matter halo. The biased collapse plus mergers scenario implies\nthat the specific angular momentum in the stellar components of ETG progenitors\nat $z\\sim 2$ is already close to the local values, in pleasing agreement with\nobservations. All in all, we argue such a behavior to be imprinted by nature\nand not nurtured substantially by the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 13:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Here, we discuss how\nentropy production provides a quantification of the irreversibility in open\nquantum systems through the quantum fluctuation theorem. We start by\nintroducing a two-time quantum measurement scheme, in which the dynamical\nevolution between the measurements is described by a completely positive,\ntrace-preserving (CPTP) quantum map (forward process). By inverting the\nmeasurement scheme and applying the time-reversed version of the quantum map,\nwe can study how this backward process differs from the forward one. When the\nCPTP map is unital, we show that the stochastic quantum entropy production is a\nfunction only of the probabilities to get the initial measurement outcomes in\ncorrespondence of the forward and backward processes. For bipartite open\nquantum systems we also prove that the mean value of the stochastic quantum\nentropy production is sub-additive with respect to the bipartition (except for\nproduct states). Hence, we find a method to detect correlations between the\nsubsystems. Our main result is the proposal of an efficient protocol to\ndetermine and reconstruct the characteristic functions of the stochastic\nentropy production for each subsystem. This procedure enables to reconstruct\neven others thermodynamical quantities, such as the work distribution of the\ncomposite system and the corresponding internal energy. Efficiency and possible\nextensions of the protocol are also discussed.

Although these are attractive, BiFeO3 is not the ideal\nmultiferroic, due to weak magnetization and the difficulty in limiting leakage\ncurrents. Thus there is an ongoing search for alternatives, including such\nmaterials as gallium ferrite (GaFeO3). In the present work we report a\ncomprehensive study of the perovskite PbTi1-xPdxO3 with 0 < x < 0.3. Our study\nincludes dielectric, impedance and magnetization measurements, conductivity\nanalysis and study of crystallographic phases present in the samples with\nspecial attention paid to minor phases, identified as PdO, PbPdO2, and Pd3Pb.\nThe work is remarkable in two ways: Pd is difficult to substitute into ABO3\nperovskite oxides (where it might be useful for catalysis), and Pd is magnetic\nunder only unusual conditions (under strain or internal electric fields). The\nnew material, as a PZT derivative, is expected to have much stronger\npiezoelectric properties than BiFeO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In this letter, we introduce a new method of using a square matrix to\nanalyze periodic nonlinear dynamical systems [1, 2]. Applying the method to the\nNational Synchrotron Light Source II storage ring lattice has helped to\nmitigate the chaotic motion within its dynamic aperture. For a given dynamical\nsystem, the vector space of a square matrix can be separated into different low\ndimension invariant subspaces according to their eigenvalues. When Jordan\ndecomposition is applied to one of the eigenspaces, it yields a set of accurate\naction-angle variables. The distortion of the new action-angle variables\nprovides a measure of the nonlinearity. Our studies show that the common\nconvention of confining the tune-shift with amplitude to avoid the crossing of\nresonance lines may not be absolutely necessary. We demonstrate that the third\norder resonance can be almost perfectly compensated with this technique.

In this\nmanuscript, we study the entrainment of phase oscillators as a function of the\nintrinsic noise in the system.

The\ngeometric approximation procedure consists of three steps. The first step is to\nconstruct weighted graphs (we call information graphs) with vertices\nrepresenting subsystems (e.g. qubits or random variables) and edges\nrepresenting mutual information (or the flow of information) between\nsubsystems. The second step is to deform the adjacency matrices of the\ninformation graphs to that of a (locally) low-dimensional lattice using the\ngraph flow equations introduced in the paper. (Note that the graph flow\nproduces very sparse adjacency matrices and thus might also be used, for\nexample, in machine learning or network science where the task of graph\nsparsification is of a central importance.) The third step is to define an\nemergent metric and to derive an effective description of the metric and\npossibly other degrees of freedom. To illustrate the procedure we analyze\n(numerically and analytically) two information graph flows with geometric\nattractors (towards locally one- and two-dimensional lattices) and metric\nperturbations obeying a geometric flow equation.

We focus here on the case of red giants that are spun\nup by tidal interaction with a planet. When the distance between the planet and\nthe star decreases, the spin period of the star decreases, the orbital period\nof the planet decreases, and the reflex motion of the star increases. We study\nthe change rate of these three quantities when the circular orbit of a planet\nof 15 M$_{J}$ that initially orbits a 2 M$_\\odot$ star at 1 au shrinks under\nthe action of tidal forces during the red giant phase. We use stellar evolution\nmodels coupled with computations of the orbital evolution of the planet, which\nallows us to follow the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the\norbit in a consistent way. We obtain that the reflex motion of the red giant\nstar increases by more than 1 m s$^{-1}$ per year in the last $\\sim$40 years\nbefore the planet engulfment. During this phase, the reflex motion of the star\nis between 660 and 710 m s$^{-1}$. The spin period of the star increases by\nmore than about 10 minutes per year in the last 3000 y before engulfment.\nDuring this period, the spin period of the star is shorter than 0.7 year.\nDuring this same period, the variation in orbital period, which is shorter than\n0.18 year, is on the same order of magnitude. Changes in reflex-motion and spin\nvelocities are very small and thus most likely out of reach of being observed.\nThe most promising way of detecting this effect is through observations of\ntransiting planets, that is, through{\\it } changes of the beginning or end of\nthe transit.

Considering that dark energy\nis homogeneous we recover the well known asymptotic value of the growth index,\nnamely $\\gamma_{\\infty}=\\frac{3(w_{\\infty}-1)}{6w_{\\infty}-5}$, while in the\ncase of clustered dark energy we obtain $\\gamma_{\\infty}\\simeq\n\\frac{3w_{\\infty}(3w_{\\infty}-5)}{(6w_{\\infty}-5)(3w_{\\infty}-1)}$. Finally, we\ngeneralize the growth index analysis in the case where $\\gamma$ is allowed to\nvary with redshift and we find that the form of $\\gamma(z)$ in PADE\nparameterisation extends that of the CPL and $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 15:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}
