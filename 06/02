The self-similarity\nin Java subtyping is interesting and intricate due to the existence of wildcard\ntypes and, accordingly, the existence of three subtyping rules for generic\ntypes: covariant subtyping, contravariant subtyping and invariant subtyping.\nSupporting bounded type variables also adds to the complexity of the subtyping\nrelation in Java and in other generic nominally-typed OO languages such as C#\nand Scala. In this paper we explore defining an operad to model the\nconstruction of the subtyping relation in Java and in similar generic\nnominally-typed OO programming languages. Operads, from category theory, are\nfrequently used to model self-similar phenomena. The Java subtyping operad, we\nhope, will shed more light on understanding the type systems of generic\nnominally-typed OO languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 16:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 17:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

We present a new 2+1-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics model of\ncircumstellar disk evolution, in which the thin-disk model is complemented with\nthe procedure for calculating the vertical distributions of gas volume density\nand temperature in the disk. The reconstruction of the disk vertical structure\nis performed at every time step via the solution of the time-dependent\nradiative transfer equations coupled to the equation of the vertical\nhydrostatic equilibrium.

Our aim is to understand the cause of\nthe non-convergence of the cooling boundary for fragmentation reported in the\nliterature. We run SPH simulations with two different artificial viscosity\nimplementations, and compare them with MFM, which does not employ any\nartificial viscosity. With MFM we demonstrate convergence of the critical\ncooling time scale for fragmentation at \\beta_{crit} =3.. Non-convergence\npersists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes\nhaving reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &\nDehnen 2010). We show how the non-convergence problem is caused by artificial\nfragmentation triggered by excessive dissipation of angular momentum in domains\nwith large velocity derivatives. With increased resolution such domains become\nmore prominent. Vorticity lags behind density due to numerical viscous\ndissipation in these regions, promoting collapse with longer cooling times.\nSuch effect is shown to be dominant over the competing tendency of artificial\nviscosity to diminish with increasing resolution. When the initial conditions\nare first relaxed for several orbits, the flow is more regular, with lower\nshear and vorticity in non-axisymmetric regions, aiding convergence. Yet MFM is\nthe only method that converges exactly. Our findings are of general interest as\nnumerical dissipation via artificial viscosity or advection errors can also\noccur in grid-based codes.

To\nachieve this we have exploited recent advances in sub-mm/mm imaging with\nSCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), which together provide unconfused\nimaging with sufficient dynamic range to provide meaningful coverage of the\nluminosity-redshift plane out to z>4.

Consequently we confirm\nrecent reports that cosmic star-formation density is dominated by UV-visible\nstar formation at z>4. Using both direct (1/Vmax) and maximum likelihood\ndeterminations of the LF, we find that its high-redshift evolution is well\ncharacterized by continued positive luminosity evolution coupled with negative\ndensity evolution (with increasing redshift). This explains why bright sub-mm\nsources continue to be found at z>5, even though their integrated contribution\nto cosmic star-formation density at such early times is very small. The\nevolution of the far-IR galaxy LF thus appears similar in form to that already\nestablished for active galactic nuclei, possibly reflecting a similar\ndependence on the growth of galaxy mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 07:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

To illustrate (a part of) our results, we consider the\ncase that the environment is modeled as classical.

They paradigmatically enlarged the classification of\ntopological materials to gapless systems while simultaneously providing\nexperimental evidence for the long-sought Weyl fermions. Beyond fundamental\nrelevance, their high mobility, strong magnetoresistance, and the possible\nexistence of even more exotic effects, such as the chiral anomaly, make Weyl\nsemimetals a promising platform to develop radically new technology. Fully\nexploiting their potential requires going beyond the mere identification of\nmaterials and calls for a detailed characterization of their functional\nresponse, which is severely complicated by the coexistence of surface- and\nbulk-derived topologically protected quasiparticles, i.e., Fermi arcs and Weyl\npoints, respectively. Here, we focus on the type-II Weyl semimetal class where\nwe find a stoichiometry-dependent phase transition from a trivial to a\nnon-trivial regime. By exploring the two extreme cases of the phase diagram, we\ndemonstrate the existence of a universal response of both surface and bulk\nstates to perturbations. We show that quasi-particle interference patterns\noriginate from scattering events among surface arcs. Analysis reveals that\ntopologically non-trivial contributions are strongly suppressed by spin\ntexture. We also show that scattering at localized impurities generate\ndefect-induced quasiparticles sitting close to the Weyl point energy. These\ngive rise to strong peaks in the local density of states, which lift the Weyl\nnode significantly altering the pristine low-energy Weyl spectrum. Visualizing\nthe microscopic response to scattering has important consequences for\nunderstanding the unusual transport properties of this class of materials.\nOverall, our observations provide a unifying picture of the Weyl phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 18:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal\nportfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal\ndistributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs\nof backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current\ncost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind,\nparticularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average\nelectricity costs that are up to 11% lower than for a homogeneous reference\ndistribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load.

In the event of node failures so that shares\nheld by the failed nodes are lost, the system needs to be repaired by\nreconstructing and reassigning the lost shares to the failed (or replacement)\nnodes. This can be achieved trivially by a trustworthy third-party that\nreceives the shares of the available nodes, recompute and reassign the lost\nshares. The interesting question, studied in the paper, is how to repair\nwithout a trustworthy third-party. The main issue that arises is repair\nsecurity: how to maintain the requirement that any colluding $z$ nodes,\nincluding the failed nodes, cannot learn any information about the message,\nduring and after the repair process? We solve this secure repair problem from\nthe perspective of secure multi-party computation. Specifically, we design\ngeneric repair schemes that can securely repair any (scalar or vector) linear\nsecret sharing schemes. We prove a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of\nsecure repair schemes and show that the proposed secure repair schemes achieve\nthe optimal repair bandwidth up to a small constant factor when $n$ dominates\n$z$, or when the secret sharing scheme being repaired has optimal rate. We\nadopt a formal information-theoretic approach in our analysis and bounds.

The disagreement between accreting and\nnon-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar\nradius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency\nof accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central\nobject.

The relative deviations in\nL_st and R_st in this case can reach 50% for 1.0-Myr-old objects and remain\nnotable even for 10-Myr-old objects. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in\nwhich a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement\nbetween accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still\nremains notable for 1.0-Myr-old objects.

An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a\ntask, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The\ndemonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a\nreference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned\nmodel, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task\nperformance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply\nincreasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this\nend, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between\nthe robot and vision system.

Our new program with HARPS aims to detect mean motion resonant\nplanetary systems around stars which were previously reported to have a single\nbona fide planet, often based only on sparse radial velocity data.

In the real world there exist modern\nsystem devices that are able to detect, recognize, and classify the human\nidentities with reliable and fast recognition rates. Unfortunately most of\nthese systems rely on one modality, and the reliability for two or more\nmodalities are further decreased. The variations of face images with respect to\ndifferent poses are considered as one of the important challenges in face\nrecognition systems. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system\nthat able to detect the human face images that are not only one view face\nimage, but also multi-view face images. Each subject entered to the system\nadjusted their face at front of the three cameras, and then the features of the\nface images are extracted based on Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm.\nWe utilize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and combined classifiers based on both\nLearning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) for\nclassification purposes. The proposed system has been tested using SDUMLA-HMT,\nand CASIA datasets. Furthermore, we collected a database of multi-view face\nimages by which we take the additive white Gaussian noise into considerations.\nThe results indicated the reliability, robustness of the proposed system with\ndifferent poses and variations including noise images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 22:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

This implies that in the\nadiabatic limit the spin current is absent and that spin pumping is entirely a\nnonadiabatic effect. We also find that the nonadiabatic spin current depends\nlinearly on the frequency in the low-frequency regime and exhibits an\noscillation in the high-frequency regime. The oscillation points to an\nenhancement of spin pumping by tuning the frequency of precession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 02:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

When Classical Logic is\nused, updates are typically performed by manipulating the knowledge base on the\nmodel-theoretic level. On the opposite side of the spectrum stand the semantics\nfor updating Answer-Set Programs that need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a\nunifying perspective that could embrace both these branches of research is of\ngreat importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods\nand principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and\nfurther development.\n  This paper bridges the seemingly irreconcilable approaches to updates. It\nintroduces a novel monotonic characterisation of rules, dubbed RE-models, and\nshows it to be a more suitable semantic foundation for rule updates than\nSE-models. Then it proposes a generic scheme for specifying semantic rule\nupdate operators, based on the idea of viewing a program as the set of sets of\nRE-models of its rules; updates are performed by introducing additional\ninterpretations - exceptions - to the sets of RE-models of rules in the\noriginal program. The introduced scheme is used to define rule update operators\nthat are closely related to both classical update principles and traditional\napproaches to rules updates, and serve as a basis for a solution to the\nlong-standing problem of state condensing, showing how they can be equivalently\ndefined as binary operators on some class of logic programs.\n  Finally, the essence of these ideas is extracted to define an abstract\nframework for exception-based update operators, viewing a knowledge base as the\nset of sets of models of its elements, which can capture a wide range of both\nmodel- and formula-based classical update operators, and thus serves as the\nfirst firm formal ground connecting classical and rule updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

We compare the optical afterglow to a large\nensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another\nultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic\nrebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and\nare not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow\nparameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for\nthese parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that\nof classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A\nresulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 09:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 21:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

A rational approach to address the problem of marine oil water\nseparation is to disperse the oil with the aid of surfactants in order to\nminimize the formation of large slicks at the water surface and to maximize the\noil-water interfacial area. Here we investigate the fundamental wetting and\ntransport behavior of such surfactant-stabilized droplets and the flow\nconditions necessary to perform sieving and separation of these stabilized\nemulsions. We show that, for water soluble surfactants, such droplets are\ncompletely repelled by a range of materials (intrinsically underwater\nsuperoleophobic) due to the detergency effect; therefore, there is no need for\nsurface micro/nanotexturing or chemical treatment to repel the oil and prevent\nfouling of the filter. We then simulate and experimentally investigate the\neffect of emulsion flow rate on the transport and impact behavior of such\ndroplets on rigid meshes to identify the minimum pore opening (w) necessary to\nfilter a droplet with a given diameter (d) in order to minimize the pressure\ndrop across the mesh and therefore maximize the filtering efficiency, which is\nstrongly dependent on w. We define a range of flow conditions and droplet sizes\nwhere minimum droplet deformation is to be expected and therefore find that the\ncondition of is sufficient for efficient separation. With this new\nunderstanding, we demonstrate the use of a commercially available\nfilter--without any additional surface engineering or functionalization--to\nseparate oil droplets from a surfactant stabilized emulsion with a flux of\n11,000 L m$^{-2}$ hr$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$.

Magma is\nfocused into this zone by lateral transport. This focusing has typically been\nexplained by dynamic pressure gradients associated with corner flow, or by a\nsub-lithospheric channel sloping upward toward the ridge axis. Here we discuss\na novel mechanism for magmatic focusing: lateral transport driven by gradients\nin compaction pressure within the asthenosphere. These gradients arise from the\nco-variation of melting rate and compaction viscosity. The compaction\nviscosity, in previous models, was given as a function of melt fraction and\ntemperature. In contrast, we show that the viscosity variations relevant to\nmelt focusing arise from grain-size variability and non-Newtonian creep.

Smart Grid","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SY","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential components of the future smart\ngrids with high penetration of renewable energy sources. However, deploying\nindividual ESSs for all energy consumers, especially in large systems, may not\nbe practically feasible mainly due to high upfront cost of purchasing many ESSs\nand space limitation. As a result, the concept of shared ESS enabling all users\ncharge/discharge to/from a common ESS has become appealing. In this paper, we\nstudy the energy management problem of a group of users with renewable energy\nsources and controllable (i.e., demand responsive) loads that all share a\ncommon ESS so as to minimize their sum weighted energy cost. Specifically, we\npropose a distributed algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which\niteratively derives the optimal values of charging/discharging to/from the\nshared ESS, while only limited information is exchanged between users and a\ncentral controller; hence, the privacy of users is preserved. With the optimal\ncharging and discharging values obtained, each user needs to independently\nsolve a simple linear programming (LP) problem to derive the optimal energy\nconsumption of its controllable loads over time as well as that of purchased\nfrom the grid. Using simulations, we show that the shared ESS can achieve lower\nenergy cost compared to the case of distributed ESSs, where each user owns its\nESS and does not share it with others. Next, we propose online algorithms for\nthe real-time energy management, under non-zero prediction errors of load and\nrenewable energy. The proposed algorithms differ in complexity and the\ninformation required to be shared between the users and central controller,\nwhere their performance is also compared via simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 10:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

Two forcing methods are considered: the steady ABC\nsingle wavenumber scheme and the unsteady non-helical or helical Euler scheme.\nThe results are also compared with high resolution data obtained with the\nnegative viscosity scheme. A fine-grained characterization of anisotropy,\nconsisting in measuring some quantities related to the two-point velocity\ncorrelations, is used: we perform a modal decomposition of the spectral\nvelocity tensor into energy, helicity and polarization spectra. Moreover, we\ninclude the explicit dependence of these three spectra on the wavevector\ndirection. The conditions that allow anisotropy to develop in the small scales\ndue to forcing alone are clearly identified. It is shown that, in turbulent\nflows expected to be isotropic, the ABC forcing yields significant energy and\nhelicity directional anisotropy down to the smallest resolved scales, like the\nhelical Euler scheme when an unfavourable forcing scale is used. The\ndirection-and scale-dependent anisotropy is then studied in rotating\nturbulence. It is first shown that, in the ABC-forced simulations the slope of\nthe energy spectrum is altered and the level of anisotropy is similar to that\nobtained at lower Rossby number in Euler-forced runs, a result due both to the\nnature of the forcing itself and to the fact that it allows an inverse cascade\nto develop. Second, we show that, even at low rotation rate, the natural\nanisotropy induced by the Coriolis force is visible at all scales. Finally, we\nidentify two different wavenumber ranges in which anisotropy behaves\ndifferently, and show that if the Rossby number is not too low the\ncharacteristic lenghscale separating them is the one at which rotation and\ndissipation effects balance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 12:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Such large-scale migration poses\nchallenges for policymakers and important questions for researchers. To\ninvestigate the process of migrant integration, we employ a one-month complete\ndataset of telecommunication metadata in Shanghai with 54 million users and 698\nmillion call logs. We find systematic differences between locals and migrants\nin their mobile communication networks and geographical locations. For\ninstance, migrants have more diverse contacts and move around the city with a\nlarger radius than locals after they settle down. By distinguishing new\nmigrants (who recently moved to Shanghai) from settled migrants (who have been\nin Shanghai for a while), we demonstrate the integration process of new\nmigrants in their first three weeks. Moreover, we formulate classification\nproblems to predict whether a person is a migrant. Our classifier is able to\nachieve an F1-score of 0.82 when distinguishing settled migrants from locals,\nbut it remains challenging to identify new migrants because of class imbalance.\nThis classification setup holds promise for identifying new migrants who will\nsuccessfully integrate into locals (new migrants that misclassified as locals).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 13:24:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 03:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 05:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 07:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

By\ncomputing small numbers of eigenvalues in specific regions of the complex\nplane, FEAST is able to naturally parallelize the solution of eigenvalue\nproblems by solving for multiple eigenpairs simultaneously. The traditional\nFEAST algorithm is implemented by directly solving collections of shifted\nlinear systems of equations; in this paper, we describe a variation of the\nFEAST algorithm that uses iterative Krylov subspace algorithms for solving the\nshifted linear systems inexactly. We show that this iterative FEAST algorithm\n(which we call IFEAST) is mathematically equivalent to a block Krylov subspace\nmethod for solving eigenvalue problems. By using Krylov subspaces indirectly\nthrough solving shifted linear systems, rather than directly for projecting the\neigenvalue problem, IFEAST is able to solve eigenvalue problems using very\nlarge dimension Krylov subspaces, without ever having to store a basis for\nthose subspaces. IFEAST thus combines the flexibility and power of Krylov\nmethods, requiring only matrix-vector multiplication for solving eigenvalue\nproblems, with the natural parallelism of the traditional FEAST algorithm. We\ndiscuss the relationship between IFEAST and more traditional Krylov methods,\nand provide numerical examples illustrating its behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 14:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media\nthickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable,\noffering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However,\neach CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each\nof these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic\nultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI)\nin each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the\nmedia-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT.

It is shown\nthat classical hydrodynamic theory predicts the transverse dynamics at relative\nlow temperatures very well when compared to simulation data, however, the\ntheory predictions are, on the same length scale, less accurate for higher\ntemperatures.

The foundation of Brownian motion, laid\nby Einstein, has generally been accepted to be far from being complete since\nthe late 1960s, because it fails to take important hydrodynamic effects into\naccount. The hydrodynamic effects yield a time dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient, and this extends the ordinary hydrodynamics. However, the time\nprofile of the diffusion coefficient across the kinetic and hydrodynamic\nregions is still absent, which prohibits a complete description of Brownian\nmotion in the entire course of time. Here we close this gap.

Directional fields on surfaces\nare known to have a number of critical points, which are properly identified\nwith the Ginzburg-Landau approach: the asymptotic behavior of Ginzburg-Landau\nproblem provides well-distributed critical points over the 2-manifold, whose\nindices are as low as possible.

A higher mass at the event horizon is compulsory in order\nto overcome the huge negative gravitational potential energy surrounding the\nblack holes and allow for the emission of gravitational waves during merging.\nWe estimate the initial mass of the stars which collapsed to form the black\nholes from the horizon mass and obtain the impressive values of 95 and 76 solar\nmasses for these progenitor stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 04:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 02:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

Symmetric decomposition of the\nmatrix of interaction coefficients yields the representation of states by\nself-adjoint matrices and hence a spectral representation. As a result,\ncooperation systems, decision systems and quantum systems all become visible as\nmanifestations of special interaction systems. The treatment of the theory is\npurely mathematical and does not require any special knowledge of physics. It\nis shown how standard notions in cooperative game theory arise naturally in\nthis context. In particular, Fourier transformation of cooperative games\nbecomes meaningful. Moreover, quantum games fall into this framework. Finally,\na theory of Markov evolution of interaction states is presented that\ngeneralizes classical homogeneous Markov chains to the present context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

During training, using the\nprinciple of Bag of Words we extract necessary features of certain domains and\nobjects for classification. Subsequently, matching these feature sets with\nthose of the extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow\nfree background from the foreground, we detect successfully our object of\ninterest from the test domain. The performance of the classification by cubic\nSVM is satisfactorily represented by confusion matrix and ROC curve reflecting\nthe accuracy of each module. After classification, our object of interest is\ntracked in the test domain using species inspired PSO. By combining the\nadaptive learning tools with the efficient classification of description, we\nachieve optimum accuracy in recognition of the moving objects. We evaluate our\nalgorithm benchmark datasets: iLIDS, VIVID, Walking2, Woman. Comparative\nanalysis of our algorithm against the existing state-of-the-art trackers shows\nvery satisfactory and competitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 11:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

From a mobile carrier point of view,\ncontinuous coverage optimization is critical for better user perceptions. The\nmajority of SON contributions introduce novel algorithms that optimize specific\nperformance metrics. However, they require extensive processing delays and\nadvanced knowledge of network statistics that may not be available. In this\nwork, a progressive Autonomous Coverage Optimization (ACO) method combined with\nadaptive cell dimensioning is proposed. The proposed method emphasizes the fact\nthat the effective cell coverage is a variant on actual user distributions. ACO\nalgorithm builds a generic Space-Time virtual coverage map per cell to detect\ncoverage holes in addition to limited or extended coverage conditions.\nProgressive levels of optimization are followed to timely resolve coverage\nissues with maintaining optimization stability. Proposed ACO is verified under\nboth simulations and practical deployment in a pilot cluster for a worldwide\nmobile carrier. Key Performance Indicators show that proposed ACO method\nsignificantly enhances system coverage and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 19:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
