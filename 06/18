However, some spike-timing-related\nstrengths of SNNs are hindered by the sensitivity of spike-timing-dependent\nplasticity (STDP) rules to input spike rates, as fine temporal correlations may\nbe obstructed by coarser correlations between firing rates.

To this purpose, we first consider test fields\npossessing a divergence-free stress-energy tensor satisfying the dominant\nenergy condition, and we prove that a suitable energy norm is uniformly bounded\nin the domain of dependence of the initial slice. In particular, this result\nimplies that free-falling observers co-moving with the dust particles measure a\nfinite energy of the field, even as they cross the Cauchy horizon at points\nlying arbitrarily close to the central singularity. Next, for the case of\nKlein-Gordon fields, we derive point-wise bounds from our energy estimates\nwhich imply that the scalar field cannot diverge at the Cauchy horizon, except\npossibly at the central singular point. Finally, we analyze the behaviour of\nodd-parity, linear gravitational and dust perturbations of the collapsing\nspacetime. Similarly to the scalar field case, we prove that the relevant\ngauge-invariant combinations of the metric perturbations stay bounded away from\nthe central singularity, implying that no divergences can propagate in the\nvacuum region.

First, to efficiently exploit Newton-type\nmethods, we modify the stochastic estimates to include random linear\ncombinations of detectors, drastically reducing the number of adjoint solves.\nSecond, after solving to a modest tolerance, we compute a few simultaneous\nsources and detectors that maximize the Frobenius norm of the sampled Jacobian\nto improve the rate of convergence and obtain more accurate solutions. We\ncomplement these optimized simultaneous sources and detectors by random\nsimultaneous sources and detectors constrained to a complementary subspace. Our\napproach leads to solutions of the same quality as obtained using all sources\nand detectors but at a greatly reduced computational cost, as the number of\nlarge-scale linear systems to be solved is significantly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 22:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

To address these issues,\nHayes and Danezis proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system\ngroups all guards into sets, and each client picks one of these sets and uses\nits guards. Unfortunately, guard sets frequently need nodes added or they are\nbroken up due to fluctuations in network bandwidth. In this paper, we first\nshow that these breakups create opportunities for malicious guards to join many\nguard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they make available to Tor, and this\ngreatly increases the number of clients exposed to malicious guards. To address\nthis problem, we propose a new method for forming guard sets based on Internet\nlocation. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients and guards together more\nreliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary guard sets. This\napproach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access to limited\nlocations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate this\nguard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level\nadversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is\ngood at confining the adversary into few guard sets and thus limiting the\nimpact of attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 23:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

It becomes increasingly\nimportant to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical\ndata. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been\nconjectured to have the geometric property that \"all local optima are\n(approximately) global optima\", and thus they can be solved efficiently by\nlocal search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very\ndifficult.\n  In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random\nover-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in\nunsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In\npractice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex\nobjective. We show that for any small constant $\\epsilon > 0$, among the set of\npoints with function values $(1+\\epsilon)$-factor larger than the expectation\nof the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima.\nPreviously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small\nneighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an\ninitialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent\nalgorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem.\n  Our main technique uses Kac-Rice formula and random matrix theory.

Changes to the grain boundary energy\nare found to be closely correlated with the covalent radii of the impurities\nand the volumetric deformations of polyhedra at the interface. The\nstrengthening energies of each impurity are evaluated as a function of covalent\nradius and electronegativity, followed by first-principles-based tensile tests\non selected impurities. The strengthening of a B-doped grain boundary comes\nfrom an enhancement of the charge density among the adjacent Cu atoms, which\nimproves the connection between the two grains. Alternatively, the detrimental\neffect of O results from the reduction of charge density between the Cu atoms.\nThis work deepens the understanding of the possible beneficial and harmful\neffects of impurities on grain boundaries, providing a guide for materials\nprocessing studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 04:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 18:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 15:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Due to the dynamics of the DC-link control\nand the phase locked loop (PLL), the output impedance matrices of the converter\nand grid are difficult to be diagonally decoupled simultaneously, neither in\nthe dq domain nor in the phase domain. It weakens the effectiveness of\nimpedance-based stability criterion (ISC) in system oscillation analysis. To\nthis end, this paper innovatively proposes the generalized-impedance based\nstability criterion (GISC) to reduce the dimension of the transfer function\nmatrix and simplify system small-signal stability analysis. Firstly, the\nimpedances of the converter and the grid in polar coordinates are formulated,\nand the concept of generalized-impedance of the converter and the grid is put\nforward. Secondly, through strict mathematical derivation, the equation that\nimplies the dynamic interaction between the converter and the grid is then\nextracted from the characteristic equation of the grid-connected converter\nsystem. Using the proposed method, the small-signal instability of system can\nbe interpreted as the resonance of the generalized-impedances of the converter\nand the grid. Besides, the GISC is equivalent to ISC when the dynamics of the\nouter-loop control and PLL are not considered. Finally, the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method is further verified using the MATLAB based digital\nsimulation and RT-LAB based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 09:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The formulation captures dynamic and algebraic power flow\nconstraints of power networks and is shown to be numerically advantageous. The\npaper analytically establishes that the BtG integration yields a reduced total\nsystem cost in comparison with decoupled designs where grid and building\noperators determine their controls separately. The developed framework is\ntested on standard power networks that include thousands of buildings modeled\nusing industrial data. Case studies demonstrate building energy savings and\nsignificant frequency regulation, while these findings carry over in network\nsimulations with nonlinear power flows and mismatch in building model\nparameters. Finally, simulations indicate that the performance does not\nsignificantly worsen when there is uncertainty in the forecasted weather and\nbase load conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 09:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 02:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 21:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Finally,\na simulation-optimization heuristic is also employed to solve this problem.\nComputational comparisons among these approaches show that policy $(s, S)$ and\npolicy $(s, \\overline{Q}, S)$ provide performance close to that of optimal\nsolutions obtained by stochastic dynamic programming, while\nsimulation-optimization heuristic offers advantages in terms of computational\nefficiency. Our numerical tests also show that capital availability as well as\nbusiness overdraft interest rate can substantially affect the retailer's\noptimal lot sizing decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 14:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The blue-shifted component lies toward an\nintensity depression to the northwest of the red-shifted component, where we\nfind that a displacement of 0.8 pc makes the two clouds fit well with each\nother. Furthermore, a new simulation of non-frontal collisions shows that\nobservations from 60 degrees off the collisional axis agreed well with the\nvelocity structure in this region.

We also explore the effect on\nperformance of the number of pre-built circuits at the time of the selection.\nThrough whole-network experiments in Shadow, we show that using circuit RTT\nwith at least three pre-built circuits allows the Tor client to identify fast\ncircuits and improves median time to first byte (TTFB) by 22% over Tor and 15%\nover congestion-aware routing, the state-of-the-art in Tor circuit selection.\nWe evaluate the security of the proposed circuit selection mechanism against\nboth a relay-level and a network-level adversary and find no loss of security\ncompared with Tor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 23:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

We demonstrate that all the solutions\nto the DE (singular ones among them) can be obtained via differentiation of a\npair of the KGE solutions for a doublet of scalar fields. In this way we obtain\na \"spinor analogue\" of the mesonic Yukawa potential and previously unknown\nchains of solutions to the DE and KGE. The pair of scalar \"potentials\" is\ndefined up to a gauge transformation under which the corresponding solution of\nthe DE is invariant. Under transformations of the Lorentz group, canonical\nspinor transformations form only a subclass of more general transformations of\nthe DE solutions, under these the generating scalar potentials undergo\ntransformations of internal symmetry intermixing their components. In\nparticular, under continuous rotation through one full revolution the\ntransforming solutions, as a rule, take their original values (\"spinor\ntwo-valuedness\" is absent). With an arbitrary solution of the DE one can\nassociate, apart from the standard one, a non-canonical set of conserved\nquantities, a positive definite \"energy\" density among others, and with any KGE\nsolution -- a positive definite \"probability density\", etc. Finally, we discuss\na generalization of the proposed procedure to the case when an external\nelectromagnetic field is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 16:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}
