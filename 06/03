The correlators are presented in the\ndecomposed form where the string-induced topological parts are explicitly\nextracted. With this decomposition, the renormalization of the local vacuum\nexpectation values (VEVs) in the coincidence limit is reduced to the one for dS\nspacetime in the absence of the cosmic string. The VEVs of the squared electric\nand magnetic fields, and of the vacuum energy density are investigated. Near\nthe string they are dominated by the topological contributions and the effects\ninduced by the background gravitational field are small. In this region, the\nleading terms in the topological contributions are obtained from the\ncorresponding VEVs for a string on the Minkowski bulk multiplying by the\nconformal factor. At distances from the string larger than the curvature radius\nof the background geometry, the pure dS parts in the VEVs dominate. In this\nregion, for spatial dimensions $D>3$, the influence of the gravitational field\non the topological contributions is crucial and the corresponding behavior is\nessentially different from that for a cosmic string on the Minkowski bulk.\nThere are well-motivated inflationary models which produce cosmic strings. We\nargue that, as a consequence of the quantum-to-classical transition of\nsuper-Hubble electromagnetic fluctuations during inflation, in the\npostinflationary era these strings will be surrounded by large scale stochastic\nmagnetic fields. These fields could be among the distinctive features of the\ncosmic strings produced during the inflation and also of the corresponding\ninflationary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 16:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

Such visual content is produced in large volumes in urban areas, and it\nis a source of information that online users could exploit to learn what has\ngot the interest of the general public on the streets of the cities where they\nlive or plan to visit. A key step to providing users with that information is\nto identify the most popular k spots in specified areas. In this paper, we\npropose a clustering and incremental sampling (C&IS) approach that trades off\naccuracy of top-k results for detection speed. It uses clustering to determine\nareas with high density of visual content, and incremental sampling, controlled\nby stopping criteria, to limit the amount of computational work. It leverages\nspatial metadata, which represent the scenes in the visual content, to rapidly\ndetect the hotspots, and uses a recently proposed Gaussian probability model to\ndescribe the capture intention distribution in the query area. We evaluate the\napproach with metadata, derived from a non-synthetic, user-generated dataset,\nfor regular mobile and 360-degree visual content. Our results show that the\nC&IS approach offers 2.8x-19x reductions in processing time over an optimized\nbaseline, while in most cases correctly identifying 4 out of 5 top locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 17:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

In terms of overall running time (i.e., time required to sample\nvarious settings of hyperparameters plus additional computation time), we are\nat least an order of magnitude faster than Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization.\nWe also outperform Random Search 8x.\n  Additionally, our method comes with provable guarantees and yields the first\nimprovements on the sample complexity of learning decision trees in over two\ndecades.

Domain wall plasmons possess a\nrich phenomenology including a wide range of frequencies (up to the\nmid-infrared), tunable sub-wavelength electro-magnetic confinement lengths, as\nwell as a valley polarization for forward/backward propagating modes. Its\nunusual features render them a new tool for realizing low-dissipation\nplasmonics that transcend the restrictions of the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Reporting, however, is almost always incomplete.\nThis is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from not recognizing the diseased\nto failures in the technical or administrative steps leading to the final\nofficial register in the disease notification system. The reported fraction\nvaries from 9% to 99% and is strongly associated with the disease being\nreported.\n  Methods: In this paper we propose a method to approximately estimate the full\nprevalence (and any other variable or parameter related to transmission\nintensity) of infectious diseases. The model assumes incomplete notification of\nincidence and allows the estimation of the non-notified number of infections\nand it is illustrated by the case of hepatitis C in Brazil. The method has the\nadvantage that it can be corrected iteratively by comparing its findings with\nempirical results.\n  Results: The application of the model for the case of hepatitis C in Brazil\nresulted in a prevalence of notified cases that varied between 163,902 and\n169,382 cases; a prevalence of non-notified cases that varied between 1,433,638\nand 1,446,771; and a total prevalence of infections that varied between\n1,597,540 and 1,616,153 cases.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that that the model proposed can be useful for\nestimation of the actual magnitude of endemic states of infectious diseases,\nparticularly for those where the number of notified cases is only the tip of\nthe iceberg. In addition, the method can be applied to other situations, such\nas the well known underreported incidence of criminality (for example rape),\namong others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 18:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

The non-singular version of all key\nequations of anisotropic dislocation theory are derived as line integrals,\nincluding the Burgers displacement equation with isolated solid angle, the\nPeach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the elastic\ndistortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction\nenergy between two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained\ndirectly, without the use of a stress function. It is shown that all the\nelastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their classical\ncounterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core.

We here simulate ligand-coated\nCdSe nanocrystals using atomistic molecular dynamics, allowing for the\nresolution of novel structural details about the ligand shell. We show that the\nligands on the surface can lie flat to form a highly anisotropic 'wet hair'\nlayer as opposed to the 'spiky ball' appearance typically considered. We\ndiscuss how this can give rise to a dot-to-dot packing distance of one ligand\nlength since the thickness of the ligand shell is reduced to approximately\none-half of the ligand length for the system sizes considered here; these\ndistances imply that energy and charge transfer rates between dots and nearby\nobjects will be enhanced due to the thinner than expected ligand shell. Our\nmodel predicts a non-linear scaling of ligand shell thickness as the ligands\ntransition from 'spiky' to 'wet hair'.

Many methods, including Bayesian intervals and\nthe simple-shift bias-reduction, have been proposed to upgrade the coverage of\nthe confidence intervals, but these methods usually fail to adequately improve\nthe situation at predictor values where the function is sharply curved. In this\npaper, we develop a novel approach to improving the confidence intervals by\nusing a smaller smoothing strength than that of the spline fits.

The interacting diffusions pave a way to\nprobabilistic representations for many important nonlinear/nonlocal PDEs, but\nprovide a great challenge for Monte Carlo simulations. This is due to the\nnonlinear dependence of the bias on the statistical error arising through the\napproximation of the law of the process. This and the fact that\nparticles/diffusions are not independent render classical variance reduction\ntechniques not directly applicable and consequently make simulations of\ninteracting diffusions prohibitive. In this article, we provide an alternative\niterative particle representation, inspired by the fixed point argument by\nSznitman \\cite{sznitman1991topics}. This new representation has the same mean\nfield limit as the classical SIPS. However, unlike classical SIPS, it also\nallows decomposing the statistical error and the approximation bias.

This exponential\ngrowth in the market valueof Bitcoin motivates adversaries to exploit\nweaknesses for profit,and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the\nsystem,propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends.In this paper, we\npresent a systematic survey that covers thesecurity and privacy aspects of\nBitcoin. We start by presenting anoverview of the Bitcoin protocol and its\nmajor components alongwith their functionality and interactions within the\nsystem. Wereview the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its\nunderlyingmajor technologies such as blockchain and PoW based\nconsensusprotocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of\nvarioussecurity threats to the normal functionality of Bitcoin. Wethen discuss\nthe feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions.\nAdditionally, we present current privacyand anonymity considerations in Bitcoin\nand discuss the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the\nanalysis of theexisting privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize\nthecritical open challenges and suggest directions for future researchtowards\nprovisioning stringent security and privacy techniquesfor Bitcoin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 09:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 15:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 18:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Since these SLMs give us\nthe possibility to dynamically varying the complex coefficients of the state\nduring the measurement time, we can generate not only pure states but also\nquantum states compatible with a mixture of pure quantum states. Therefore, by\nusing these apertures varying on time according to a probability distribution,\nwe have experimentally obtained $D$-dimensional quantum states with purities\nthat depend on the parameters of the distribution through a clear analytical\nexpression.

According to this view, neural\nactivities in V1 represent the posterior distribution under the GSM given a\nparticular visual stimulus. Indeed, (approximate) inference under the GSM has\nsuccessfully accounted for various nonlinearities in the mean (trial-average)\nresponses of V1 neurons, as well as the dependence of (across-trial) response\nvariability with stimulus contrast found in V1 recordings. However, previous\nwork almost exclusively relied on numerical simulations to obtain these\nresults.

The manual delineation of WMHs is tedious,\ncostly and time consuming. This is further complicated by the fact that other\npathological features (i.e. stroke lesions) often also appear as hyperintense.\nSeveral automated methods aiming to tackle the challenges of WMH segmentation\nhave been proposed, however cannot differentiate between WMH and strokes. Other\nmethods, capable of distinguishing between different pathologies in brain MRI,\nare not designed with simultaneous WMH and stroke segmentation in mind. In this\nwork we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to\nsegment hyperintensities and differentiate between WMHs and stroke lesions.\nSpecifically, we aim to distinguish between WMH pathologies from those caused\nby stroke lesions due to either cortical, large or small subcortical infarcts.\nAs far as we know, this is the first time such differentiation task has\nexplicitly been proposed. The proposed fully convolutional CNN architecture, is\ncomprised of an analysis path, that gradually learns low and high level\nfeatures, followed by a synthesis path, that gradually combines and up-samples\nthe low and high level features into a class likelihood semantic segmentation.\nQuantitatively, the proposed CNN architecture is shown to outperform other well\nestablished and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overlap with manual\nexpert annotations. Clinically, the extracted WMH volumes were found to\ncorrelate better with the Fazekas visual rating score. Additionally, a\ncomparison of the associations found between clinical risk-factors and the WMH\nvolumes generated by the proposed method, were found to be in line with the\nassociations found with the expert-annotated volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 11:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 11:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

The cluster-to-star\nratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100-1000, at all\ngalactocentric radii and with a slope that does not seem to depend on radius.\nIn dwarf galaxies, the GCs are also more metal-poor than the field stars on\naverage. These observations indicate a strong dependence of either the cluster\nformation efficiency or the cluster destruction rate on metallicity and\nenvironment. We aim to explain these trends by considering various effects that\nmay influence the observed cluster-to-star ratio as a function of metallicity,\nenvironment and cosmological history. We show that both the cluster formation\nefficiency and the maximum cluster mass increase with metallicity, so they\ncannot explain the observed trend. Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric\nradii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular\nclouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly\nefficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.\nThe predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high\nmetallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to\norbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the\nobservations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on\nmetallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be\nexplained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth. As a result,\nwe find that the metallicity-dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio does not\nreflect a GC formation efficiency, but a survival fraction.

One of the crucial resources in\nknowledge economy is time. The ability to force others to adapt to our schedule\neven if it harms their efficiency can be seen as an outcome of social\nstratification. The principal objective of this paper is to use time allocation\nto model and study the global efficiency of social stratification, and to\nreveal whether hierarchy is an emergent property. A multi-agent model with an\nevolving social network is used to verify our hypotheses. The network's\nevolution is driven by the intensity of inter-agent communications, and the\ncommunications as such depend on the preferences and time resources of the\ncommunicating agents. The entire system is to be perceived as a metaphor of a\nsocial network of people regularly filling out agenda for their meetings for a\nperiod of time. The overall efficiency of the network of those scheduling\nagents is measured by the average utilization of the agent's preferences to\nspeak on specific subjects. The simulation results shed light on the effects of\ndifferent scheduling methods, resource availabilities, and network evolution\nmechanisms on communication system efficiency. The non-stratified systems show\nbetter long-term efficiency. Moreover, in the long term hierarchy disappears in\noverwhelming majority of cases.

Modern simulation techniques that combine computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) and discrete element methods (DEM) are capable of describing their\nevolution and provide detailed information on what is happening on the particle\nscale. However, these approaches are limited by small time steps and large\nnumerical costs, which inhibits the investigation of slower long-term processes\nlike heat transfer or chemical conversion.\n  In a recent study (Lichtenegger and Pirker, 2016), we have introduced\nrecurrence CFD (rCFD) as a way to decouple fast from slow degrees of freedom in\nsystems with recurring patterns: A conventional simulation is carried out to\ncapture such coherent structures.
