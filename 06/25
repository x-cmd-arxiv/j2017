A\nchallenge in the attempts to understand the role of these strategies in the\nevolution of animal behavior is the lack of iterations in the fights for mating\nopportunities or territory control. We show that an arbitrary two-parameter\nstrategy may possess a corresponding equalizer strategy which produces the same\nresult: statistics of the fight outcomes in the contests with mutants are the\nsame for each of these two strategies. Therefore, analyzing only the equalizer\nstrategy space may be sufficient to predict animal behavior if nature, indeed,\nreduces (marginalizes) complex strategies to equalizer strategy space. The\nwork's main finding is that there is a unique equalizer strategy that predicts\nfight outcomes without mutual cooperation.

However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle\ncomplex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from\nthe sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate\nof accidents in these settings prove that they constitute difficult driving\nsituations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of\nimportant traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this article, we\npropose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles\nin such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining\ncompatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised\ncoordination scheme that overrides control inputs from human drivers when they\nwould result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary\nintervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs\nwhen collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe overriding\ncontrols are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally\nrequested by the drivers.

We use PVDF nanotubes that\nwere solidified in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. Dielectric\nspectroscopy measurements evidence a bimodal relaxation process for PVDF\nnanotubes: besides the bulk-like -relaxation, we detect a notably slower\nrelaxation that is associated with the PVDF regions of restricted dynamics at\nthe interface with the AAO pore. Strickingly, both the bulk-like and the\ninterfacial relaxation tend to become temperature independent as the\ntemperature increases - a behavior that has been observed before in inorganic\nrelaxor ferroelectrics. In line with this, we observe that the real part of the\ndielectric permittivity of the PVDF nanotubes exhibits a broad maximum when\nplotted against the temperature, which is, again, a typical feature of relaxor\nferroelectrics. As such, we propose that in nanotubular PVDF,\nferroelectric-like nanodomains are formed in the amorphous phase regions\nadjacent to the AAO interface.

The system employs a\nco-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on instantaneous, pairwise\nphase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total\nnumber of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated.\nWe find that a simple regulatory rule - which preserves connections between\nmore out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase\noscillators - can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more\nstructured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We\nexamine how this process unfolds over time, finding both a dependence on the\nintrinsic frequencies of the oscillators and the global coupling. For large\nenough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit\ndegree - frequency and frequency - neighbor frequency correlations. These\nproperties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or\nexplosive transitions. By considering a time-dependent interplay between\nstructure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent\nphenomena can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2017 10:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 15:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Our\nsystem is based on distributed wireless sensors allowing us to notably reduce\nthe computational time needed for 3D depth reconstruction, thus permitting the\nsuccess of real time solutions.

This\nresearch work meets these expectations. The work is empirical and it is\nsituated in the field of computer vision systems. The main part of the work\nsituates itself in the area of action and behavior recognition. Efficient\nalgorithms for fall detection were developed, tested and implemented using\nimage sequences and wireless inertial sensor worn by a monitored person. A set\nof descriptors for depth maps has been elaborated to permit classification of\npose as well as the action of a person. Experimental research was carried out\nbased on the prepared data repository consisting of synchronized depth and\naccelerometric data. The study was carried out in the scenario with a static\ncamera facing the scene and an active camera observing the scene from above.\nThe experimental results showed that the developed algorithms for fall\ndetection have high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm were designed\nwith regard to low computational demands and possibility to run on ARM\nplatforms.

Investigating these\nstructural rearrangements helps to understand how genomes have been modified\nover time. Some elements that play an important role in genome rearrangements\nare called insertion sequences (ISs), they are the simplest types of\ntransposable elements (TEs) that widely spread within prokaryotic genomes. ISs\ncan be defined as DNA segments that have the ability to move (cut and paste)\nthemselves to another location within the same chromosome or not. Due to their\nability to move around, they are often presented as responsible of some of\nthese genomic recombination. Authors of this research work have regarded this\nclaim, by checking if a relation between insertion sequences (ISs) and genome\nrearrangements can be found. To achieve this goal, a new pipeline that combines\nvarious tools have firstly been designed, for detecting the distribution of\nORFs that belongs to each IS category. Secondly, links between these predicted\nISs and observed rearrangements of two close genomes have been investigated, by\nseeing them with the naked eye, and by using computational approaches. The\nproposal has been tested on 18 complete bacterial genomes of Pseudomonas\naeruginosa, leading to the conclusion that IS3 family of insertion sequences\nare related to genomic inversions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2017 15:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

The optical\nspectrum is very similar to that of 1H 0707-495 in having extremely weak [O\n{\\sc iii}] and strong Fe {\\sc ii} emission lines, although the black hole mass\nis probably slightly higher at $5-10 \\times10^{6}~\\rm M_{\\odot}$. The broadband\nSED is uniquely well-defined due to the extremely low Galactic and intrinsic\nabsorption, so the bolometric luminosity is tightly constrained. The optical/UV\naccretion disc continuum is seen down to 900 \\AA, showing that there is a\nstandard thin disc structure down to $R \\ge$ 190-380 $R_{\\rm g}$ and\ndetermining the mass accretion rate through the outer disc. This predicts a\nmuch higher bolometric luminosity than observed, indicating that there must be\nstrong wind and/or advective energy losses from the inner disc, as expected for\na highly super-Eddington accretion flow. Significant outflows are detected in\nboth the NLR and BLR emission lines, confirming the presence of a wind.

Different\nstrategies have evolved through time, bringing maintenance to its current\nstate: condition-based and predictive maintenances. This evolution was due to\nthe increasing demand of reliability in industry. The key process of\ncondition-based and predictive maintenances is prognostics and health\nmanagement, and it is a tool to predict the remaining useful life of\nengineering assets. Nowadays, plants are required to avoid shutdowns while\noffering safety and reliability. Nevertheless, planning a maintenance activity\nrequires accurate information about the system/component health state. Such\ninformation is usually gathered by means of independent sensor nodes. In this\nstudy, we consider the case where the nodes are interconnected and form a\nwireless sensor network. As far as we know, no research work has considered\nsuch a case of study for prognostics.
