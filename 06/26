Then it builds a new theory, incorporating the ideas of\nSuppressed SUSY. Suppressed SUSY is an alternative to the spontaneous breaking\nof SUSY. It does not need an invisible sector or explicit soft breaking of\nSUSY. It varies the content of the supermultiplets while keeping the\nrestrictive nature of SUSY. For the simple model and sector constructed here,\nSuppressed SUSY has only three dimensionless parameters, plus the Planck mass.\nAt tree level, this predicts a set of 8 different new masses, along with a\ncosmological constant that is naturally zero. The X and Y vector bosons get\nPlanck scale masses $2 \\sqrt{10} g_5 M_{\\rm P}$. The five scalar multiplets\nthat accompany the Higgs, and the Gravitino, all get colossally huge\n`SuperPlanck' scale masses of order $M_{\\rm SP} \\approx 10^{17} M_{\\rm P}$ from\na see-saw mechanism that arises from the theory. This new mass spectrum, the\nwell-known $SU(5)$ weak angle problem, and the cosmological constant value,\nshould serve as guides for further modifications for the new Action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 13:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

In this work we emphasize two security issues:\n(1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling\nalgorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary\nto preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to\nreduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes\nscheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to\nguarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation\nrequirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will\nbe defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling.

However, discovering entity synonyms from\ndomain-specific text corpora (e.g., news articles, scientific papers) is rather\nchallenging. Current systems take an entity name string as input to find out\nother names that are synonymous, ignoring the fact that often times a name\nstring can refer to multiple entities (e.g., \"apple\" could refer to both Apple\nInc and the fruit apple). Moreover, most existing methods require training data\nmanually created by domain experts to construct supervised-learning systems. In\nthis paper, we study the problem of automatic synonym discovery with knowledge\nbases, that is, identifying synonyms for knowledge base entities in a given\ndomain-specific corpus.

The generation of geometric frustration from the\nintrinsic geometry of the constituents of a material is not only natural and\nubiquitous but also leads to a striking variety of morphologies of ground\nstates and exotic response properties.\n  In this work we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for two\nscalar functions, $s$ and $b$ to describe the splay and bend of a director\nfield in the plane. We generalize these compatibility conditions for geometries\nwith non-vanishing constant Gaussian curvature, and provide a reconstruction\nformula for the director field depending only on the splay and bend fields and\ntheir derivatives.

Here, we present a new type of the\nphononic topological insulator in the square lattice with position-variational\nDirac cones along the high symmetric lines. The emergence of such Dirac cones,\ncharacterized by the vortex structure in a momentum space, is attributed to the\nunavoidable band crossing protected by the mirror symmetry.

Along the topological domain\nwall between the phononic crystals (PhCs) with the distinct topological phases\nstemming from the mirror symmetry inversion, we obtain a topological edge state\nfor the neutral scalar sound which is absence of the intrinsic polarization and\nis uncoupled from an external field. Within a wide rotational range of the\nsquare column, the topological edge state in our PhCs evolves from a gapless\none into a gapped one with a robust edge transport against cavities and\ndisorders. Our excellent results are promising for the exploration of the new\ntopological phenomena in the PhCs beyond the hexagonal lattices.

VR's two variants, stochastic variance-reduced-gradient\n(SVRG-SGD) and importance sampling (IS-SGD) have achieved remarkable\nprogresses. Meanwhile, asynchronous SGD (ASGD) is becoming more critical due to\nthe ever-increasing scale of the optimization problems. The application of VR\nin ASGD to accelerate its convergence rate has therefore attracted much\ninterest and SVRG-ASGDs are therefore proposed. However, we found that SVRG\nsuffers dissatisfying performance in accelerating ASGD when the datasets are\nsparse and large-scale. In such case, SVRG-ASGD's iterative computation cost is\nmagnitudes higher than ASGD which makes it very slow. On the other hand, IS\nachieves improved convergence rate with few extra computation cost and is\ninvariant to the sparsity of dataset. This advantage makes it very suitable for\nthe acceleration of ASGD for large-scale sparse datasets.

Moreover, some representative examples are presented to show this\nproperty and indicate its application for shape deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

Fundamentally, the method models this projection matrix as a\nfunction of frequency that can be approximated by a polynomial. It provides two\nimprovements: a reduction in the number of parameters required to represent the\nsignal subspace along a given frequency band and a quality improvement in\nwideband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimators such as Incoherent Multiple\nSignal Classification (IC-MUSIC) and Modified Test of Orthogonality of\nProjected Subspaces (MTOPS). In rough terms, the method fits a polynomial to a\nset of projection matrix estimates, obtained at a set of frequencies, and then\nuses the polynomial as a representation of the signal subspace. The paper\nincludes the derivation of asymptotic bounds for the bias and root-mean-square\n(RMS) error of the projection matrix estimate and a numerical assessment of the\nmethod and its combination with the previous two DOA estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 08:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 12:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Using the holographic\ninfluence functional method, we find that the large coupling constant of the\nfields reduces the position uncertainty of the mirror, but enhances the\nmomentum uncertainty. As such, the product of the position and momentum\nuncertainties is independent of the coupling constant. The proper choices of\nthe phase of the squeezing parameter might reduce the uncertainties,\nnevertheless large values of its amplitude always lead to the larger\nuncertainties due to the fact that more quanta are excited as compared with the\ncorresponding normal vacuum and thermal states.

To assess whether this mechanism offers a solution to the\ncusp-core controversy, simulated haloes must be compared to real dark matter\nhaloes inferred from galaxy rotation curves. For this purpose, two new dark\nmatter density profiles were recently derived from simulations of galaxies in\ncomplementary mass ranges: the DC14 halo ($10^{10} < M_{\\text{halo}}/M_{\\odot}\n< 8 \\times 10^{11}$) and the coreNFW halo ($10^{7} < M_{\\text{halo}}/M_{\\odot}\n< 10^{9}$). Both models have individually been found to give good fits to\nobserved rotation curves. For the DC14 model, however, the agreement of the\npredicted halo properties with cosmological scaling relations was confirmed by\none study, but strongly refuted by another. A next question is whether the two\nmodels converge to the same solution in the mass range where both should be\nappropriate. To investigate this, we tested the DC14 and cNFW halo models on\nthe rotation curves of a selection of galaxies with halo masses in the range $4\n\\times 10^{9}$ - $7 \\times 10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$. We further applied the DC14\nmodel to a set of rotation curves at higher halo masses, up to $9 \\times\n10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$, to verify the agreement with the cosmological scaling\nrelations. We find that both models are generally able to reproduce the\nobserved rotation curves, in line with earlier results, and the predicted dark\nmatter haloes are consistent with the cosmological $c-M_{\\text{halo}}$ and\n$M_{*}-M_{\\text{halo}}$ relations. The DC14 and cNFW models are also in fairly\ngood agreement with each other, even though DC14 tends to predict slightly less\nextended cores and somewhat more concentrated haloes than cNFW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 09:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This letter presents a simple method for\ntranslating impedance sub-models within a complex network, from their own\nreference frames to any given point in the network.

By way of this method, standard circuit analysis\nrules for series and parallel connection are applicable, as proven in the\nletter.

This opens new possibilities in analysing and estimating\nunemployment and its spatial distribution across any region. The labor force\nsurvey choose, according to an preestablished sampling criteria, a certain\nnumber of dwellings across the nation and survey the number of unemployed in\nthese dwellings. Based on this survey, the National Statistical Institute of\nPortugal presently uses direct estimation methods to estimate the national\nunemployment figures. Recently, there has been increased interest in estimating\nthese figures in smaller areas. Direct estimation methods, due to reduced\nsampling sizes in small areas, tend to produce fairly large sampling variations\ntherefore model based methods, which tend to \"borrow strength\" from area to\narea by making use of the areal dependence, should be favored. These model\nbased methods tend use areal counting processes as models and typically\nintroduce spatial dependence through the model parameters by a latent random\neffect. In this paper, we suggest modeling the spatial distribution of\nresidential buildings across Portugal by a Log Gaussian Cox process and the\nnumber of unemployed per residential unit as a mark attached to these random\npoints. Thus the main focus of the study is to model the spatial intensity\nfunction of this marked point process. Number of unemployed in any region can\nthen be estimated using a proper functional of this marked point process. The\nprincipal objective of this point referenced method for unemployment estimation\nis to get reliable estimates at higher spatial resolutions and at the same time\nincorporate in the model the auxiliary information available at residential\nunits such as average income or education level of individuals surveyed in\nthese units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 11:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

Traditional multi-label learning algorithms treat each\nclass label as a logical indicator of whether the corresponding label is\nrelevant or irrelevant to the instance, i.e., +1 represents relevant to the\ninstance and -1 represents irrelevant to the instance. Such label represented\nby -1 or +1 is called logical label. Logical label cannot reflect different\nlabel importance. However, for real-world multi-label learning problems, the\nimportance of each possible label is generally different. For the real\napplications, it is difficult to obtain the label importance information\ndirectly. Thus we need a method to reconstruct the essential label importance\nfrom the logical multilabel data. To solve this problem, we assume that each\nmulti-label instance is described by a vector of latent real-valued labels,\nwhich can reflect the importance of the corresponding labels. Such label is\ncalled numerical label. The process of reconstructing the numerical labels from\nthe logical multi-label data via utilizing the logical label information and\nthe topological structure in the feature space is called Label Enhancement. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning framework called LEMLL,\ni.e., Label Enhanced Multi-Label Learning, which incorporates regression of the\nnumerical labels and label enhancement into a unified framework. Extensive\ncomparative studies validate that the performance of multi-label learning can\nbe improved significantly with label enhancement and LEMLL can effectively\nreconstruct latent label importance information from logical multi-label data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 11:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 08:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 13:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 09:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

In dynamical\natmosphere and wind models the effects of the stellar pulsation are often\nsimulated by a simplistic prescription at the inner boundary. We test a sample\nof dynamical models for M-type AGB stars, for which we kept the stellar\nparameters fixed to values characteristic of a typical Mira variable but varied\nthe inner boundary condition.

Our method alternates between updating the shape and the\nsemantic labels. In the geometry refinement step, the mesh is deformed with\nvariational energy minimization, such that it simultaneously maximizes\nphoto-consistency and the compatibility of the semantic segmentations across a\nset of calibrated images. Label-specific shape priors account for interactions\nbetween the geometry and the semantic labels in 3D. In the semantic\nsegmentation step, the labels on the mesh are updated with MRF inference, such\nthat they are compatible with the semantic segmentations in the input images.\nAlso, this step includes prior assumptions about the surface shape of different\nsemantic classes. The priors induce a tight coupling, where semantic\ninformation influences the shape update and vice versa. Specifically, we\nintroduce priors that favor (i) adaptive smoothing, depending on the class\nlabel; (ii) straightness of class boundaries; and (iii) semantic labels that\nare consistent with the surface orientation. The novel mesh-based\nreconstruction is evaluated in a series of experiments with real and synthetic\ndata.

Knowledge of the bias\nand scatter values is fundamental for both cluster cosmology and astrophysics.\nIn this paper we show that the intrinsic scatter of a mass proxy can be\nconstrained by measurements of the gas fraction because masses with higher\nvalues of intrinsic scatter with true mass produce more scattered gas\nfractions. Moreover, the relative bias of two mass estimates can be constrained\nby comparing the mean gas fraction at the same (nominal) cluster mass.

For these purposes, we used the X-ray Unbiased Cluster Sample, a\ncluster sample selected independently from the intracluster medium content with\nreliable masses: 34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe,\nmostly with $14<\\log M_{500}/M_\\odot \\lesssim 14.5$, and with caustic masses.\nWe found a 35\\% scatter between caustic and true masses. Furthermore, we found\nthat the relative bias between caustic and hydrostatic masses is small,\n$0.06\\pm0.05$ dex, improving upon past measurements. The small scatter found\nconfirms our previous measurements of a highly variable amount of feedback from\ncluster to cluster, which is the cause of the observed large variety of\ncore-excised X-ray luminosities and gas masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 13:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 09:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

In this paper, we propose a method for\npointwise semantic classification of 3D LiDAR data into three classes:\nnon-movable, movable and dynamic. We concentrate on understanding these\nspecific semantics because they characterize important information required for\nan autonomous system. Non-movable points in the scene belong to unchanging\nsegments of the environment, whereas the remaining classes corresponds to the\nchanging parts of the scene. The difference between the movable and dynamic\nclass is their motion state. The dynamic points can be perceived as moving,\nwhereas movable objects can move, but are perceived as static. To learn the\ndistinction between movable and non-movable points in the environment, we\nintroduce an approach based on deep neural network and for detecting the\ndynamic points, we estimate pointwise motion. We propose a Bayes filter\nframework for combining the learned semantic cues with the motion cues to infer\nthe required semantic classification. In extensive experiments, we compare our\napproach with other methods on a standard benchmark dataset and report\ncompetitive results in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, we show an improvement in the classification of points by\ncombining the semantic cues retrieved from the neural network with the motion\ncues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 13:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

The\nperformance measure for the Do-All problem is work: the total number of\navailable processor steps during the whole execution. We address the question\nof how the ordered adversaries controlling crashes of stations influence work\nperformance of Do-All algorithms. The first presented algorithm solves Do-All\nwith work O(t+p\\sqrt{t}\\log p) against the Linearly-Ordered adversary,\nrestricted by some pre-defined linear order of crashing stations.

All players occupy vertices of $G$. The game operates in\nrounds; in each round the cops move to neighboring vertices, after which the\nrobber does the same. The minimum number of cops needed to guarantee capture of\na robber on $G$ is the cop number of $G$, denoted $c(G)$, and the minimum\nnumber of rounds needed for them to do so is the capture time. It has long been\nknown that the capture time of an $n$-vertex graph with cop number $k$ is\n$O(n^{k+1})$. More recently, Bonato, Golovach, Hahn, and Kratochv\\'{i}l (2009)\nand Gaven\\v{c}iak (2010) showed that for $k = 1$, this upper bound is not\nasymptotically tight: for graphs with cop number 1, the cop can always win\nwithin $n-4$ rounds. In this paper, we show that the upper bound is tight when\n$k \\ge 2$: for fixed $k \\ge 2$, we construct arbitrarily large graphs $G$\nhaving capture time at least $\\left (\\frac{\\vert V(G) \\vert}{40k^4}\\right\n)^{k+1}$.\n  In the process of proving our main result, we establish results that may be\nof independent interest. In particular, we show that the problem of deciding\nwhether $k$ cops can capture a robber on a directed graph is polynomial-time\nequivalent to deciding whether $k$ cops can capture a robber on an undirected\ngraph. As a corollary of this fact, we obtain a relatively short proof of a\nmajor conjecture of Goldstein and Reingold (1995), which was recently proved\nthrough other means by the author (2015). We also show that $n$-vertex\nstrongly-connected directed graphs with cop number 1 can have capture time\n$\\Omega(n^2)$, thereby showing that the result of Bonato et al. does not extend\nto the directed setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

Mass estimates are crucial to determine gravitational\ncollapse conditions for the birth of new stellar objects in molecular clouds.\nHowever, most of these estimates rely on dust models that need further\nobservational constraints from clouds to prestellar and protostellar cores. We\npresent results of a study of dust emissivity changes based on mm-continuum\ndata obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM-30m telescope. Observing dust\nemission at 1.15 mm and 2 mm allows us to constrain the dust emissivity index\n($\\beta$) in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust spectral energy distribution\n(SED) far from its peak emission, where the contribution of other parameters\n(i.e. dust temperature) is important. Focusing on the Taurus molecular cloud, a\nlow-mass star-forming regions in the Gould Belt, we analyze the emission\nproperties of several distinct objects in the B213 filament: three prestellar\ncores, two Class-0/I protostellar cores and one Class-II object. By means of\nthe ratio of the two NIKA channel-maps, we show that in the Rayleigh-Jeans\napproximation the dust emissivity index varies among the objects. For one\nprestellar and two protostellar cores, we produce a robust study using Herschel\ndata to constrain the dust temperature of the sources. By using the Abel\ntransform inversion technique we get accurate radial $\\beta$ profiles. We find\nsystematic spatial variations of $\\beta$ in the protostellar cores that is not\nobserved in the prestellar core. While in the former case $\\beta$ decreases\ntoward the center, in the latter it remains constant. Moreover, $\\beta$ appears\nanticorrelated with the dust temperature. We discuss the implication of these\nresults in terms of dust grain evolution between pre- and protostellar cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

EPI-TrACR was applied to in vivo\ndata acquired at 7 Tesla across acceleration and multishot factors, and in a\ndynamic time series. The method was efficiently implemented using a segmented\nFFT and compared to a conventional calibrated reconstruction. RESULTS: Compared\nto conventional calibrated reconstructions, EPI-TrACR reduced ghosting up to\nmoderate acceleration factors and across multishot factors. It also maintained\nlow ghosting in a dynamic time series. Averaged over all cases, EPI-TrACR\nreduced root-mean-square ghosted signal outside the brain by 27% compared to\ncalibrated reconstruction.

Once we impose\nthe embeding conditions we obtain that gravity on the 4D spacetime is governed\nby the Einstein field equations modified by an extra term that can play the\nrole of a dynamical cosmological constant. Two examples were studied. In the\nfirst we derive a cosmological model of a universe filled only with a\ncosmological constant. In the second we obtain a cosmological solution\ndescribing a universe filled with matter, radiation and a dynamical\ncosmological constant, in agree with observational data. Due to the 5D\ngeometrical origin for the dynamical cosmological constant we interpret that\nthe acceleration in the expansion is explained without the introduction of a\ndark energy component. Moreover, all 4D matter sources are geometrically\ninduced in the same manner as it is usually done in the Wesson's induced matter\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

In the symmetry analysis of such systems, instead of the\nirreducible representations of the space groups, it is necessary to consider\nthe single- and double-valued irreducible representations of the double space\ngroups. The new section includes databases of symmetry operations (DGENPOS) and\nof irreducible representations of the double (point and space) groups\n(REPRESENTATIONS DPG and REPRESENTATIONS DSG).

Consequently, data collected on\nlimited types of outcrop surfaces (mainly bedding surfaces) may not be a\nsufficient representation of fracture network characteristic in outcrops.\nRecent development of techniques that obtain DOMs from outcrops and extract the\nfull extent of individual fractures offers the opportunity to address the\nproblem of performing the conventional sampling methods on uneven outcrop\nsurfaces. In this study, we propose a new method that performs outcrop fracture\ncharacterization on suppositional planes cutting through DOMs. The\nsuppositional plane is the best fit plane of the outcrop surface, and the\nfracture trace map is extracted on the suppositional plane so that the fracture\nnetwork can be further characterized.
