In this paper, we present a novel approach stemmed from slow\nfeature analysis (SFA) for dynamic texture recognition. SFA extracts slowly\nvarying features from fast varying signals. Fortunately, SFA is capable to\nleach invariant representations from dynamic textures. However, complex\ntemporal variations require high-level semantic representations to fully\nachieve temporal slowness, and thus it is impractical to learn a high-level\nrepresentation from dynamic textures directly by SFA. In order to learn a\nrobust low-level feature to resolve the complexity of dynamic textures, we\npropose manifold regularized SFA (MR-SFA) by exploring the neighbor\nrelationship of the initial state of each temporal transition and retaining the\nlocality of their variations. Therefore, the learned features are not only\nslowly varying, but also partly predictable. MR-SFA for dynamic texture\nrecognition is proposed in the following steps: 1) learning feature extraction\nfunctions as convolution filters by MR-SFA, 2) extracting local features by\nconvolution and pooling, and 3) employing Fisher vectors to form a video-level\nrepresentation for classification. Experimental results on dynamic texture and\ndynamic scene recognition datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 16:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

The ensuing electrical field couples self-consistently\nto the itinerant electrons, so that the properties of the ML crucially depend\non an interplay between the on-site Coulomb forces and the long range\nelectrostatic forces. The ML is described by the Falicov-Kimball model and the\nself-consistent solution is obtained by iterating simultaneously the DMFT and\nthe Poisson equations. This yields the reconstructed charge profile, the\nelectrical potential, the planar density of states, the transport function, and\nthe transport coefficients of the device.\n  We find that a heterostructure built of two Mott-Hubbard insulators exhibits,\nin a large temperature interval, a linear conductivity and a large\ntemperature-independent thermopower. The charge and energy currents are\nconfined to the central part of the ML. Our results indicate that correlated\nmultilayers have the potential for applications; by tuning the band shift and\nthe Coulomb correlation on the central planes, we can bring the chemical\npotential in the immediate proximity of the Mott-Hubbard gap edge and optimize\nthe transport properties of the device. In such a heterostructure, a small gate\nvoltage can easily induce a MI transition. This switching does not involve the\ndiffusion of electrons over macroscopic distances and it is much faster than in\nordinary semiconductors.

While subsystems can be readily defined for finite\nquantum systems and in local quantum field theory, a corresponding definition\nfor gravitational systems is significantly complicated by the apparent\nnonlocality arising due to gauge invariance, enforced by the constraints. A\nrelated question is whether \"soft hair\" encodes otherwise localized\ninformation, and the question of such localization also remains an important\npuzzle for proposals that gravity emerges from another structure such as a\nboundary field theory as in AdS/CFT. This paper describes different approaches\nto defining local subsystem structure, and shows that at least classically,\nperturbative gravity has localized subsystems based on a split structure,\ngeneralizing the split property of quantum field theory. This, and related\narguments for QED, give simple explanations that in these theories there is\nlocalized information that is independent of fields outside a region, in\nparticular so that there is no role for \"soft hair\" in encoding such\ninformation. Additional subtleties appear in quantum gravity. We argue that\nlocalized information exists in perturbative quantum gravity in the presence of\nglobal symmetries, but that nonperturbative dynamics is likely tied to a\nmodification of such structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

These curves are\ndefined by the eigenvalues and the Hamiltonian function of the associated\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operator, and they play a crucial role in the\nquantum interference mechanism in phase space. We assume that the potential of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger operator is a single potential well, such that the spectrum\nis discrete.\n  The construction starts from an eigenfunction series expansion of the\nsolution, which is derived here for first time in a systematic way, by\ncombining the elementary technique of separation of variables with involved\nspectral results for the Moyal star exponential operator. The eigenfunctions of\nthe Wigner equation are the Wigner transforms of the Schr\\\"odinger\neigenfunctions, and they are approximated in terms of Airy functions by a\nuniform stationary phase approximation of the Wigner transforms of the WKB\nexpansions of the Schr\\\"odinger eigenfunctions.\n  The approximation of the eigenfunction series is an approximated solution of\nthe Wigner equation, which by projection onto the configuration space provides\nan approximate wave amplitude, free of turning point singularities. It is\ngenerally expected that, the derived wave amplitude is bounded, and correctly\nscaled, even on caustics, since only finite terms of the approximate terms are\nsignificant for WKB initial wave functions with finite energy.\n  The details of the calculations are presented for the simple potential of the\nharmonic oscillator, in order to be able to check our approximations\nanalytically. But, the same construction can be applied to any potential well,\nwhich behaves like the harmonic oscillator near the bottom of the well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 20:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Existing approaches have concentrated on either designing the best\nfeature representation or learning optimal matching metrics in a static setting\nwhere the number of cameras are fixed in a network. Most approaches have\nneglected the dynamic and open world nature of the re-identification problem,\nwhere a new camera may be temporarily inserted into an existing system to get\nadditional information. To address such a novel and very practical problem, we\npropose an unsupervised adaptation scheme for re-identification models in a\ndynamic camera network. First, we formulate a domain perceptive\nre-identification method based on geodesic flow kernel that can effectively\nfind the best source camera (already installed) to adapt with a newly\nintroduced target camera, without requiring a very expensive training phase.\nSecond, we introduce a transitive inference algorithm for re-identification\nthat can exploit the information from best source camera to improve the\naccuracy across other camera pairs in a network of multiple cameras. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning based\nalternatives whilst being extremely efficient to compute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 20:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Building up from the seminal\nwork of Chaudhuri et al.

We present a computationally efficient, rate optimal\ncluster tree estimator based on a straightforward extension of the popular\ndensity-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN by Ester et al. [1996]. The procedure\nrelies on a kernel density estimator with an appropriate choice of the kernel\nand bandwidth to produce a sequence of nested random geometric graphs whose\nconnected components form a hierarchy of clusters. The resulting optimal rates\nfor cluster tree estimation depend on the degree of smoothness of the\nunderlying density and, interestingly, match minimax rates for density\nestimation under the supremum norm. Our results complement and extend the\nanalysis of the DBSCAN algorithm in Sriperumbudur and Steinwart [2012].\nFinally, we consider level set estimation and cluster consistency for densities\nwith jump discontinuities, where the sizes of the jumps and the distance among\nclusters are allowed to vanish as the sample size increases. We demonstrate\nthat our DBSCAN-based algorithm remains minimax rate optimal in this setting as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 20:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 18:36:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 16:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

We\nestablish constraints on the relic mass m_x and its relative abundance\n$F=\\Omega_{wdm}/\\Omega_{dm}$ using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in 28\nC+WDM configurations. We find that the 3 sigma bounds approximately follow F ~\n$0.35 (keV/m_x)^{-1.37}$ from BOSS alone. We also establish constraints on\nsterile neutrino mass and mixing angle by producing the non-linear flux power\nspectrum of 8 RPSN models, where the input linear power spectrum is computed\ndirectly from the particles distribution functions. We find values of lepton\nasymmetries for which sterile neutrinos as light as 6.5 keV (resp. 3.5 keV) are\nconsistent with BOSS at the 2 sigma (resp. 3sigma) level. These limits tighten\nby close to a factor of 2 for lepton asymmetries departing from those yielding\nthe coolest distribution functions.\n  Our Ly-a forest bounds can be strengthened if we include higher-resolution\ndata from XQ-100, HIRES and MIKE. At these smaller scales, the flux power\nspectrum exhibits a suppression that can be due to Doppler broadening, IGM\npressure smoothing or free-streaming of WDM particles.

Second-order Newton-type methods that make use of\nregularization and trust regions have been analyzed from such a perspective.\nMore recent proposals, based chiefly on first-order methodology, have also been\nshown to enjoy optimal iteration complexity rates, while providing additional\nguarantees on computational cost.\n  In this paper, we present an algorithm with favorable complexity properties\nthat differs in two significant ways from other recently proposed methods.\nFirst, it is based on line searches only: Each step involves computation of a\nsearch direction, followed by a backtracking line search along that direction.\nSecond, its analysis is rather straightforward, relying for the most part on\nthe standard technique for demonstrating sufficient decrease in the objective\nfrom backtracking. In the latter part of the paper, we consider inexact\ncomputation of the search directions, using iterative methods in linear\nalgebra: the conjugate gradient and Lanczos methods.

With increasing $We$, the average radius of curvature of\nthe surface decreases, the number of small droplets increases, and the cascade\nand the surface area growth occur at faster rates. The spray angle is mainly\naffected by $Re$ and density ratio, and is larger at higher $We$, at higher\ndensity ratios, and also at lower $Re$. The change in the spray spread rate\nversus $Re$ is attributed to the angle of ligaments stretching from the jet\ncore, which increases as $Re$ decreases. Gas viscosity has negligible effect on\nboth the droplet-size distribution and the spray angle. Increasing the\nwavelength-to-sheet-thickness ratio, however, increases the spray angle and the\nstructure cascade rate, while decreasing the droplet size. The smallest length\nscale is determined more by surface tension and liquid inertia than by the\nliquid viscosity, while gas inertia and liquid surface tension are the key\nparameters in determining the spray angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 23:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

To understand the role of host genetics in HIV-1C disease\nprogression, we perform a study to assess the association between\nlongitudinally collected measures of disease and more than 100,000 genetic\nmarkers located on chromosome 6.

It attracts increasing attention in computer vision due\nto its importance to surveillance system. To combat the major challenge of\ncross-view visual variations, deep embedding approaches are proposed by\nlearning a compact feature space from images such that the Euclidean distances\ncorrespond to their cross-view similarity metric. However, the global Euclidean\ndistance cannot faithfully characterize the ideal similarity in a complex\nvisual feature space because features of pedestrian images exhibit unknown\ndistributions due to large variations in poses, illumination and occlusion.\nMoreover, intra-personal training samples within a local range are robust to\nguide deep embedding against uncontrolled variations, which however, cannot be\ncaptured by a global Euclidean distance. In this paper, we study the problem of\nperson re-id by proposing a novel sampling to mine suitable \\textit{positives}\n(i.e. intra-class) within a local range to improve the deep embedding in the\ncontext of large intra-class variations. Our method is capable of learning a\ndeep similarity metric adaptive to local sample structure by minimizing each\nsample's local distances while propagating through the relationship between\nsamples to attain the whole intra-class minimization. To this end, a novel\nobjective function is proposed to jointly optimize similarity metric learning,\nlocal positive mining and robust deep embedding. This yields local\ndiscriminations by selecting local-ranged positive samples, and the learned\nfeatures are robust to dramatic intra-class variations.

Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clusters\nis difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional.

We give efficient algorithms\nfor computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of\nrelation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward\nsimulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination\nprinciple is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called\nantichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed\noriginally for finite word automata for tree automata.

Robust CS aims to reconstruct the sparse\nsignals under non-Gaussian(i.e. heavy tailed) noises where traditional CS\nreconstruction algorithms may perform very poorly due to utilizing $l_2$ norm\nof the residual vector in optimization. Most of existing robust CS\nreconstruction algorithms are based on greedy pursuit method or convex\nrelaxation approach. Recently, the adaptive filtering framework has been\nintroduced to deal with the CS reconstruction, which shows desirable\nperformance in both efficiency and reconstruction performance under Gaussian\nnoise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive filtering based robust CS\nreconstruction algorithm, called $l_0$ regularized maximum correntropy\ncriterion($l_0$-MCC) algorithm, which combines the adaptive filtering framework\nand maximum correntropy criterion(MCC). MCC has recently been successfully used\nin adaptive filtering due to its robustness to impulsive non-Gaussian noises\nand low computational complexity. We analyze theoretically the stability of the\nproposed $l_0$-MCC algorithm. A mini-batch based $l_0$-MCC(MB-$l_0$-MCC)\nalgorithm is further developed to speed up the convergence.

Each motif emits thermal radiation in a\ncertain manner, as it changes its geometry; however, the spatial distribution\nof these motifs causes them to interact with each other. Therefore, their\ncombination and interaction determine the global behaviour of the surfaces,\nthus enabling their a priori design. The emissivity behaviour is not random; it\nis determined by two fundamental parameters, namely the combination of\norientations in which the motifs open (n-fold rotational symmetry (rn)) and the\ncombination of materials (colours) on the motifs; these generate functions\nwhich fully determine the dependency of the emissivity on the temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 12:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 13:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 11:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

Unlike\nCrSiTe3 whose magnetism can be understood using the 2D-Ising model, CrGeTe3\nexhibits a smaller van der Waals gap and larger cleavage energy, which could\nlead to a transition of magnetic mechanism from 2D to 3D. To confirm this\nspeculation, we investigate the critical behavior CrGeTe3 around the\nsecond-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. We obtain the\ncritical exponents estimated by several common experimental techniques\nincluding the modified Arrott plot, Kouvel-Fisher method and critical isotherm\nanalysis, which show that the magnetism of CrGeTe3 follows the tricritical\nmean-field model with the critical exponents \\b{eta}, {\\gamma}, and {\\delta} of\n0.240, 1.000, and 5.070, respectively, at the Curie temperature of 67.9 K. We\ntherefore suggest that the magnetic phase transition from 2D to 3D for CrGeTe3\nshould locate near a tricritical point. Our experiment provides a direct\ndemonstration of the applicability of the tricritical mean-field model to a 2D\nferromagnetic semiconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 14:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The theoretical underpinnings of this generalization of the\nconventional Fourier transform is quite well established in the\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) formalism; however, efficient numerical\nalgorithms that could be employed in practical applications are still\nunavailable. In this paper, we present two fast inverse NFT algorithms with\n$O(KN+N\\log^2N)$ complexity and a convergence rate of $O(N^{-2})$ where $N$ is\nthe number of samples of the signal and $K$ is the number of eigenvalues. These\nalgorithms are realized using a new fast layer-peeling (LP) scheme\n($O(N\\log^2N)$) together with a new fast Darboux transformation (FDT) algorithm\n($O(KN+N\\log^2N)$) previously developed by the author. The proposed fast\ninverse NFT algorithm proceeds in two steps: The first step involves computing\nthe radiative part of the potential using the fast LP scheme for which the\ninput is synthesized under the assumption that the radiative potential is\nnonlinearly bandlimited, i.e., the continuous spectrum has a compact support\nand the discrete spectrum is empty. The second step involves addition of bound\nstates using the FDT algorithm. Finally, the performance of these algorithms is\ndemonstrated through exhaustive numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 19:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 18:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 16:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

The second objective was to provide a comparative analysis of EP\nfailure rates with those of chemical propulsion. After a thorough data\ncollection, 162 EP-equipped satellites launched between January 1997 and\nDecember 2015 were included in our dataset for analysis. Several statistical\nanalyses were conducted, at the aggregate level and then with the data\nstratified by severity of the anomaly, by orbit type, and by EP technology.\nMean Time To Anomaly (MTTA) and the distribution of the time to anomaly were\ninvestigated, as well as anomaly rates. The important findings in this work\ninclude the following: (1) Post-2005, EP reliability has outperformed that of\nchemical propulsion; (2) Hall thrusters have robustly outperformed chemical\npropulsion, and they maintain a small but shrinking reliability advantage over\ngridded ion engines. Other results were also provided, for example the\ndifferentials in MTTA of minor and major anomalies for gridded ion engines and\nHall thrusters. It was shown that: (3) Hall thrusters exhibit minor anomalies\nvery early on orbit, which might be indicative of infant anomalies, and thus\nwould benefit from better ground testing and acceptance procedures; (4) Strong\nevidence exists that EP anomalies (onset and likelihood) and orbit type are\ndependent, a dependence likely mediated by either the space environment or\ndifferences in thrusters duty cycles; (5) Gridded ion thrusters exhibit both\ninfant and wear-out failures, and thus would benefit from a reliability growth\nprogram that addresses both these types of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 21:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

These sensors\nare omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide\ncomfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers\nthemselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data\ncollected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of\nindividuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where\nour dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by\nmultiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each\nindividual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short\nroad segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI\nAG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped\nwith automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show\nthat turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across\ndrivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12\nmost frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway\non-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning\nuseful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 17:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}
