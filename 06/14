Variants of this strategy are prevalent\nin state-of-the-art concurrent priority queue implementations. Nonetheless, it\nis not known whether such implementations provide any rank guarantees, even in\na sequential model.\n  We answer this question, showing that this strategy provides surprisingly\nstrong guarantees: Although the single-choice process, where we always insert\nand remove from a single randomly chosen queue, has degrading cost, going to\ninfinity as we increase the number of steps, in the two choice process, the\nexpected rank of a removed element is $O( n )$ while the expected worst-case\ncost is $O( n \\log n )$. These bounds are tight, and hold irrespective of the\nnumber of steps for which we run the process.\n  The argument is based on a new technical connection between \"heavily loaded\"\nballs-into-bins processes and priority scheduling.\n  Our analytic results inspire a new concurrent priority queue implementation,\nwhich improves upon the state of the art in terms of practical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 17:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

In\nthis paper we describe the prospects for predicting lensing events generated by\nthe local population of compact objects, consisting of 250 neutron stars, 5\nblack holes, and approximately 35,000 white dwarfs. By focusing on a population\nof nearby compact objects with measured proper motions and known distances from\nus, we can measure their masses by studying the characteristics of any lensing\nevent they generate. Here we concentrate on shifts in the position of a\nbackground source due to lensing by a foreground compact object. With HST,\nJWST, and Gaia, measurable centroid shifts caused by lensing are relatively\nfrequent occurrences. We find that 30-50 detectable events per decade are\nexpected for white dwarfs. Because relatively few neutron stars and black holes\nhave measured distances and proper motions, it is more difficult to compute\nrealistic rates for them. However, we show that at least one isolated neutron\nstar has likely produced detectable events during the past several decades.\nThis work is particularly relevant to the upcoming data releases by the Gaia\nmission and also to data that will be collected by JWST.

Motivated by the intriguing possibility of an EM counterpart to BBH\nmergers, we construct a model that can reproduce the observed EM and GW signals\nfor GW150914- and GW170104-like events, from a single-star progenitor.\nFollowing Loeb (2016), we envision a massive, rapidly rotating star within\nwhich a rotating bar instability fractures the core into two overdensities that\nfragment into clumps which merge to form BHs in a tight binary with arbitrary\nspin-orbit alignment. Once formed, the BBH inspirals due to gas and\ngravitational-wave drag until tidal forces trigger strong feeding of the BHs\nwith the surrounding stellar-density gas about 10 seconds before merger. The\nresulting giga-Eddington accretion peak launches a jet that breaks out of the\nprogenitor star and drives a powerful outflow that clears the gas from the\norbit of the binary within one second, preserving the vacuum GW waveform in the\nLIGO band. The single-progenitor scenario predicts the existence of variability\nof the gamma-ray burst, modulated at the ~0.2 second chirping period of the BBH\ndue to relativistic Doppler boost. The jet breakout should be accompanied by a\nlow-luminosity supernova. Finally, because the BBHs of the single progenitor\nmodel do not exist at large separations, they will not be detectable in the low\nfrequency gravitational wave band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna\n(LISA).

These disturbances are typically interpreted as slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves. Recent spectroscopic observations with Hinode/EIS of\nactive region loops, however, revealed that the propagating intensity\ndisturbances are associated with intermittent plasma upflows (or jets) at the\nfootpoints which are presumably generated by magnetic reconnection. For this\nreason, whether these disturbances are waves or periodic flows is still being\nstudied. This study is aimed at understanding the physical properties of\nobserved disturbances by investigating the excitation of waves by hot plasma\ninjections from below and the evolution of flows and wave propagation along the\nloop. We expand our previous studies based on isothermal 3D MHD models of\nactive region to a more realistic model that includes full energy equation\naccounting for effects of radiative losses. Computations are initialized with\nan equilibrium state of a model active region using potential (dipole) magnetic\nfield, gravitationally stratified density and temperature obtained from\npolytropic equation of state. We model an impulsive injection of hot plasma\ninto the steady plasma outflow along the loops of different temperature, warm\n($\\sim$1 MK) and hot ($\\sim$6 MK). The simulations show that hot jets launched\nat the coronal base excite slow magnetoacoustic waves that propagate along the\nloops to the high corona, while the injected hot flows decelerates rapidly with\nheights.

We develop a novel model\nfor the success of a startup company based on the first passage time of a\nBrownian motion. The drift and diffusion of the Brownian motion associated with\na startup company are a function of features based its sector, founders, and\ninitial investors. All features are calculated using our massive dataset. Using\na Bayesian approach, we are able to obtain quantitative insights about the\nfeatures of successful startup companies from our model.\n  To test the performance of our model, we use it to build a portfolio of\ncompanies where the goal is to maximize the probability of having at least one\ncompany achieve an exit (IPO or acquisition), which we refer to as winning.\nThis $\\textit{picking winners}$ framework is very general and can be used to\nmodel many problems with low probability, high reward outcomes, such as\npharmaceutical companies choosing drugs to develop or studios selecting movies\nto produce. We frame the construction of a picking winners portfolio as a\ncombinatorial optimization problem and show that a greedy solution has strong\nperformance guarantees. We apply the picking winners framework to the problem\nof choosing a portfolio of startup companies. Using our model for the exit\nprobabilities, we are able to construct out of sample portfolios which achieve\nexit rates as high as 60%, which is nearly double that of top venture capital\nfirms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 19:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 19:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Evidence for a new low brightness HI component with anomalous velocity is\nreported. It harbours a large velocity scatter, as its kinematics both exceeds\nand lags the rotation of the disk, and leaks in the forbidden velocity zone of\napparent counter-rotation. The observations also reveal wide and multiple peak\nHI profiles which can be partly explained by crowded orbits in the framework of\nthe warp model. Asymmetric motions are identified in the velocity field, as\npossible signatures of a lopsided potential and the warp. The mass distribution\nmodeling of the hybrid Halpha-HI rotation curve favours a cuspy dark matter\nhalo with a concentration in disagreement with the LambdaCDM dark halo\nmass-concentration relationship. The total mass enclosed in 23 kpc is 8 10^10\nMsol, of which 11% are stars and gas. At the virial radius of the cuspy halo,\nthe resulting total mass is 5 10^11 Msol, but with a baryonic mass fraction of\n2% only.

Most models\nof social influence tend to assume that individuals react to changes in the\nstates of their neighbors without any time delay, but this is often not true in\nsocial contexts, where (for various reasons) different agents can have\ndifferent response times. To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of\na timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on\nnodes delays the adoption --- i.e., change of state --- of each agent, which in\nturn delays the adoptions of its neighbors. With a homogeneous-distributed\ntimer, in which all nodes exhibit the same amount of delay, adoption delays are\nalso homogeneous, so the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However,\nheterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and\nhence the \"adoption paths\" through which state changes spread in a network.\nUsing a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous\ntimers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to\nan analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the\nrelationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to timer\ndistribution and network structure. We derive an analytical approximation for\nthe temporal evolution of the fraction of adopters by modifying a pair\napproximation of the Watts threshold model, and we find good agreement with\nnumerical computations.

Threshold-driven similarity join, which has been\nextensively studied in the past, assumes that a user is able to specify a\nsimilarity threshold, and then focuses on how to efficiently return the object\npairs whose similarities pass the threshold. We argue that the assumption about\na well set similarity threshold may not be valid for two reasons. The optimal\nthresholds for different similarity join tasks may vary a lot. Moreover, the\nend-to-end time spent on similarity join is likely to be dominated by a\nback-and-forth threshold-tuning process.\n  In response, we propose preference-driven similarity join. The key idea is to\nprovide several result-set preferences, rather than a range of thresholds, for\na user to choose from. Intuitively, a result-set preference can be considered\nas an objective function to capture a user's preference on a similarity join\nresult. Once a preference is chosen, we automatically compute the similarity\njoin result optimizing the preference objective. As the proof of concept, we\ndevise two useful preferences and propose a novel preference-driven similarity\njoin framework coupled with effective optimization techniques.

However, the nonlinearity of the resulting closed-loop system\ncomplicates verification that the system does in fact satisfy those\nrequirements at all possible operating conditions. While analytical proof-based\ntechniques and finite abstractions can be used to provably verify the\nclosed-loop system's response at different operating conditions, they often\nproduce conservative approximations due to restrictive assumptions and are\ndifficult to construct in many applications. In contrast, popular statistical\nverification techniques relax the restrictions and instead rely upon\nsimulations to construct statistical or probabilistic guarantees. This work\npresents a data-driven statistical verification procedure that instead\nconstructs statistical learning models from simulated training data to separate\nthe set of possible perturbations into \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" subsets. Binary\nevaluations of closed-loop system requirement satisfaction at various\nrealizations of the uncertainties are obtained through temporal logic\nrobustness metrics, which are then used to construct predictive models of\nrequirement satisfaction over the full set of possible uncertainties.

For appropriately defined notions of risk in the misspecified\nsetting, we prove a generalization of a low noise characterization of the risk\ndue to Oymak and Hassibi in the case of a polyhedral constraint set. An\ninteresting consequence of our results is that the risk can be much smaller in\nthe misspecified setting than in the well-specified setting. We also discuss\nconsequences of our result for isotonic regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 23:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

It presents numerous examples of the use of\nsimulation, from detector design and optimization, through software and\ncomputing development and testing, to cases where the use of simulation samples\nmade a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication\nturnaround, from data-taking to submission. It also presents estimates of the\ncost and economic impact of simulation in the CMS experiment.\n  Future experiments will collect orders of magnitude more data with\nincreasingly complex detectors, taxing heavily the performance of simulation\nand reconstruction software. Consequently, exploring solutions to speed up\nsimulation and reconstruction software to satisfy the growing demand of\ncomputing resources in a time of flat budgets is a matter that deserves\nimmediate attention. The article ends with a short discussion on the potential\nsolutions that are being considered, based on leveraging core count growth in\nmulticore machines, using new generation coprocessors, and re-engineering HEP\ncode for concurrency and parallel computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

However, experimental\ndetermination of the central charge of a conformal field theory has not been\ndone before. Here we propose to extract the central charge of the conformal\nfield theory corresponding to a critical point of a two-dimensional lattice\nmodels from the quantum decoherence measurement of a probe spin which is\ncoupled to the two-dimensional lattice models. Conformal invariance predicts\nthat the leading finite-size correction to the free energy for a\ntwo-dimensional system at a conformal invariant critical point is linearly\nrelated to the conformal anomaly for various boundary conditions. A recent\ndiscovery of thermodynamic holography allows us to obtain the free energy of\nmany-body system from central spin decoherence measurement. Thus the central\ncharge of the conformal field theory could be extracted from central spin\ndecoherence measurement. We have applied the method to the two-dimensional\nIsing model and extracted the central charge of two-dimensional Ising model\nwith good precision. This work provides a useful approach to extracting the\ncentral charge of conformal field theory in various two-dimensional lattice\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 02:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

Since the maximum achievable key rate\ncaptures the total amount of information mutual to the compressed sources, an\noptimal compression scheme essentially maximizes the multivariate mutual\ninformation per bit of randomness of the private sources, and can therefore be\nviewed more generally as a dimension reduction technique.

The\nelectrons in the quantum dot interact with the nuclear spins via hyperfine\nspin-flip processes as typically seen in solid state systems such as GaAs\nquantum dots. The hyperfine interaction in such systems, which is often treated\nas a deterrent for quantum information processing, can favorably be regarded as\na driving agent for classical information flow into a heat engine setup.

The size of parallel computing systems and the number of their\ncomponents steadily increase. The volume of generated logs by the system is in\nproportion to this increase. Hence, long-term collection and storage of system\nlogs is challenging. The analysis of system logs requires advanced text\nprocessing techniques. For very large volumes of logs, the analysis is highly\ntime-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. For many parallel\ncomputing centers, outsourcing the analysis of system logs to third parties is\nthe only affordable option. The existence of sensitive data within system log\nentries obstructs, however, the transmission of system logs to third parties.\nMoreover, the analytical tools for processing system logs and the solutions\nprovided by such tools are highly system specific. Achieving a more general\nsolution is only possible through the access and analysis system of logs of\nmultiple computing systems.

The results\npresented in this work indicate that apart from eliminating the sensitive data\nwithin system logs and converting them into shareable data, the proposed\nanonymization method provides 25% performance improvement in post-processing of\nthe anonymized system logs, and more than 50% reduction in their required\nstorage space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

By measuring the displacement of the\nprominence at different heights to calculate the apparent velocity, we show\nthat the propagation slows down over time, in accordance with the theoretical\nwork of Kaneko et al.

In most cases,\nwhen these approaches are employed to increase the resilience of certain parts\nof a system, energy consumption rapidly increases, or performance significantly\ndegrades.

In order to achieve a\ncomputationally efficient estimate for the unknown position, we minimize a\nweighted sum-square-distance-error cost function in an iterative fashion\nutilizing the gradient-descent method. We calculate the weights in the cost\nfunction by taking into account perturbations in both RSSI measurements and\nanchor node position information while assuming normal distribution for the\nperturbations in the anchor node position information and log-normal\ndistribution for the RSSI-induced distance estimates. The latter assumption is\ndue to considering the log-distance path-loss model with normally-distributed\nperturbations for the RSSI measurements in the logarithmic scale.

We performed a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations for locally isothermal discs with embedded planets in the mass\nrange from 5 to 100 Earth masses.

A nearby descriptive model for visual processes is thus a statistical\ndistribution that varies over time. Specifically, modeling visual processes as\nstreams of histograms generated by a kernelized linear dynamic system turns out\nto be efficient. We refer to such a model as a System of Bags. In this work, we\ninvestigate Systems of Bags with special emphasis on dynamic scenes and dynamic\ntextures. Parameters of linear dynamic systems suffer from ambiguities. In\norder to cope with these ambiguities in the kernelized setting, we develop a\nkernelized version of the alignment distance.

The puzzling feature is\nthat the probability of an electron arriving at the detector when both slits\nare open is not the sum of the probabilities when the slits are open\nseparately. The superposition principle of quantum mechanics tells us to add\namplitudes rather than probabilities and this results in interference. This\nexperiment defies our classical intuition that the probabilities of exclusive\nevents add. In understanding the emergence of the classical world from the\nquantum one, there have been suggestions by Feynman, Diosi and Penrose that\ngravity is responsible for suppressing interference. This idea has been pursued\nin many different forms ever since, predominantly within Newtonian approaches\nto gravity. In this paper, we propose and theoretically analyse two `gedanken'\nor thought experiments which lend strong support to the idea that gravity is\nresponsible for decoherence. The first makes the point that thermal radiation\ncan suppress interference. The second shows that in an accelerating frame,\nUnruh radiation plays the same role. Invoking the Einstein equivalence\nprinciple to relate acceleration to gravity, we support the view that gravity\nis responsible for decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 10:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 08:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

Normally, HBLs are not\nvery active but 1ES 1959+650 has shown exceptional outburst activity across the\nwhole electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).

In\noptical, the source showed a hint of optical intra-night variability during the\noutburst. A significant short-term variability in optical during MJD 57344 to\nMJD 57365 and in gamma-rays during MJD 57360 and MJD 57365 was also noticed.\nMultiwavelength study suggests the flaring activity at all frequencies to be\ncorrelated in general, albeit with diverse flare durations.

When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay\nthe control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the\nmaximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with\nprevious findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total\ninfectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the\nmaximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our\nresults is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be\nimpossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the\nepidemic duration, and vice versa.

In addition, the\nCH rotation rates are compared with the solar photospheric and inner layer\nrotational profiles. We study coronal holes observed within $\\pm 60$ latitude\nand longitude degrees from the solar disc centre during the time span from the\n1 January 2013 to 20 April 2015, which includes the extended peak of solar\ncycle 24.We used data created by the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm\n(SPoCA), which provides the exact location and characterisation of solar\ncoronal holes using SDO=AIA 193 {\\AA} channel images. The CH rotation rates are\nmeasured with four-hour cadence data to track variable positions of the CH\ngeometric centre. North-south asymmetry was found in the distribution of\ncoronal holes: about 60 percent were observed in the northern hemisphere and 40\npercent were observed in the southern hemisphere.

The latitudinal\ncharacteristics of CH rotation do not match any known photospheric rotation\nprofile. The CH angular velocities exceed the photospheric angular velocities\nat latitudes higher than 35-40 degrees. According to our results, the CH\nrotation profile perfectly coincides with tachocline and the lower layers of\nconvection zone at around 0.71 $R_{\\odot}$; this indicates that CHs may be\nlinked to the solar global magnetic field, which originates in the tachocline\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 13:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Is this recognition exactly true?\nThis study presents a solid theoretical derivation to prove whether the\nisotopologue distributions of organochlorines are binomial or not, and\ninvestigates the implications of the distributions to relevant experimental\nstudies. During synthetic reactions, the C-Cl bonds with stronger strengths are\nmore readily to be formed with heavy isotopes. The chlorine KIEs are higher\nduring the breakages of the stronger C-Cl bonds than during the breaking of the\nweaker ones. For a synthetic organochlorine, if the rate-limiting step during a\nchlorination reaction is the formation of C-Cl bonds, then chlorine KIE takes\neffect in the reaction, resulting in always higher chlorine isotope ratio on\nthe reaction position than that of the initial chlorine atoms from the chlorine\nsource. Chlorine KIEs vary during different chlorination reactions, leading to\ninconsistent chlorine isotope ratios on different reaction positions of\nasymmetric reaction intermediates and final products. If the rate-determining\nstep is the generation of reactive chlorine atoms and the initial isotope ratio\nof the chlorine source is constant, then the chlorine isotope ratios on the\nreaction positions of all intermediates and final products are equivalent,\ndemonstrating that the isotopologues follow binomial distribution. After\nphysical changes and dechlorination reactions, organochlorines in the\nenvironment are unlikely binomially distributed.

We consider magnetically open boundary conditions that allow a\nflux of helicity in or out of the computational domain. We circumvent the\nproblem of the lack of gauge invariance in open domains by choosing a\nparticular gauge -- the winding gauge -- that provides a natural interpretation\nin terms of average winding number of pairwise field lines. We use this gauge\nprecisely to define and measure the helicity and helicity flux for several\nrealizations of dynamo action.

Furthermore, to exploit the long-range temporal dynamics in videos,\nwe apply two Long Short Term Memory networks with extracted appearance and\nmotion features as inputs. Finally, we also propose to refine the prediction\nscores by leveraging contextual relationships among video semantics. The hybrid\ndeep learning framework is able to exploit a comprehensive set of multimodal\nfeatures for video classification. Through an extensive set of experiments, we\ndemonstrate that (1) LSTM networks which model sequences in an explicitly\nrecurrent manner are highly complementary with CNN models; (2) the feature\nfusion network which produces a fused representation through modeling feature\nrelationships outperforms alternative fusion strategies; (3) the semantic\ncontext of video classes can help further refine the predictions for improved\nperformance. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101\nand the Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV), provide strong quantitative evidence\nthat our framework achieves promising results: $93.1\\%$ on the UCF-101 and\n$84.5\\%$ on the CCV, outperforming competing methods with clear margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 14:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

It was recently\nsuggested that an evaporating black hole (BH) can be a catalyst of bubble\nnucleations and dramatically shortens the lifetime of the false vacuum. In\nparticular, in the context of the Standard Model valid up to a certain energy\nscale, even a single evaporating BH may spoil the successful cosmology by\ninducing the decay of our electroweak vacuum. In this paper, we reinterpret\ncatalyzed vacuum decay by BHs, using an effective action for a thin-wall bubble\naround a BH to clarify the meaning of bounce solutions. We calculate bounce\nsolutions in the limit of a flat spacetime and in the limit of negligible\nbackreaction to the metric, where it is much easier to understand the physical\nmeaning, and compare these results with the full calculations done in the\nliterature. As a result, we give a physical interpretation of the enhancement\nfactor: it is nothing but the probability of producing states with a finite\nenergy. This makes it clear that all the other states such as plasma should\nalso be generated through the same mechanism, and calls for finite-density\ncorrections to the tunneling rate which tend to stabilize the false vacuum. We\nalso clarify that the dominant process is always consistent with the\nperiodicity indicated by the BH Hawking temperature after summing over all\npossible remnant BH masses or bubble energies, although the periodicity of each\nbounce solution as a function of a remnant BH can be completely different from\nthe inverse temperature of the system as mentioned in the previous literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 14:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

State of the art CSE water-fat separation approaches rely\non a multi-peak fat spectrum with peak frequencies and relative amplitudes kept\nconstant over the entire MRI dataset. However, the latter approximation\nintroduces a systematic error in fat percentage quantification in patients\nwhere the differences in lipid chemical composition are significant, such as\nfor neuromuscular disorders, because of the spatial dependence of the peak\namplitudes. The present work aims to overcome this limitation by taking\nadvantage of an unsupervised clusterization-based approach offering a reliable\ncriterion to carry out a data-driven segmentation of the input MRI dataset into\nmultiple regions. The idea is to apply the clusterization for partitioning the\nmulti-echo MRI dataset into a finite number of clusters whose internal voxels\nexhibit similar distance metrics. For each cluster, the estimation of the fat\nspectral properties are evaluated with a self-calibration technique and finally\nthe fat-water percentages are computed via a non-linear fitting.

Recent sensitive H.E.S.S. analysis revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR)\ndensity profile drops with the distance to the centre, making data compatible\nwith a steady cosmic PeVatron at the GC. In this paper, we extend this analysis\nto obtain for the first time a detailed characterisation of the correlation\nwith matter and to search for additional features and individual gamma-ray\nsources in the inner 200 pc. Taking advantage of 250 hours of H.E.S.S. data and\nimproved analysis techniques we perform a detailed morphology study of the\ndiffuse VHE emission observed from the GC ridge and reconstruct its total\nspectrum. We show that the emission correlated with dense matter covers the\nfull CMZ and that its flux is about half the total diffuse emission flux. We\nalso detect some emission at higher latitude likely produced by hadronic\ncollisions of CRs in less dense regions of the GC interstellar medium. We\ndetect an additional emission component centred on the GC and extending over\nabout 15 pc that is consistent with the existence of a strong CR density\ngradient and confirms the presence of a CR accelerator at the very centre of\nour Galaxy. We show that the spectrum of the full ridge diffuse emission is\ncompatible with the one previously derived from the central regions, suggesting\nthat a single population of particles fills the entire CMZ. Finally, we report\nthe discovery of a VHE gamma-ray source near the GC radio arc and argue that it\nis produced by the pulsar wind nebula candidate G0.13-0.11.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 15:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

However, the pressure behavior of such tiltings can dramatically\ndiffer from one material to another, with the origins of such differences\nremaining controversial.

Besides the known A-O interactions, we\nreveal that the interactions between specific B-ions and oxygen ions contribute\nto the tilting instability.

Linear\ndevices provide an axial magnetic field that serves to confine a plasma in\ncylindrical geometry as it travels along the magnetic field from the source to\nthe strike point. Due to perpendicular transport, the plasma density and\ntemperature have a roughly Gaussian radial profile with gradients that drive\ninstabilities, such as resistive drift-waves and Kelvin-Helmholtz. If unstable,\nthese instabilities cause perturbations to grow resulting in saturated\nturbulence, increasing the cross-field transport of heat and particles. When\nthe plasma emerges from the source, there is a time, $\\tau_{\\parallel}$, that\ndescribes the lifetime of the plasma based on parallel velocity and length of\nthe device. As the plasma moves down the device, it also moves azimuthally\naccording to $E\\times B$ and diamagnetic velocities. There is a balance point\nin these parallel and perpendicular times that sets the stabilisation\nthreshold. We simulate plasmas with a variety of parallel lengths and magnetic\nfields to vary the parallel and perpendicular lifetimes, respectively, and find\nthat there is a clear correlation between the saturated RMS density\nperturbation level and the balance between these lifetimes. The threshold of\nmarginal stability is seen to exist where\n$\\tau_{\\parallel}\\approx11\\tau_{\\perp}$. This is also associated with the\nproduct $\\tau_{\\parallel}\\gamma_*$, where $\\gamma_*$ is the drift-wave linear\ngrowth rate, indicating that the instability must exist for roughly 100 times\nthe growth time for the instability to enter the non-linear growth phase.

In this work, we develop a forward\nmodel for flat-panel-based systems that includes blur and noise correlation\nassociated with finite focal spot size and an indirect detector (e.g.,\nscintillator). This forward model is used to develop a staged reconstruction\nframework where projection data are deconvolved and log-transformed, followed\nby a generalized least-squares reconstruction that utilizes a non-diagonal\nstatistical weighting to account for the correlation that arises from the\nacquisition and data processing chain. We investigate the performance of this\nnovel reconstruction approach in both simulated data and in CBCT test-bench\ndata.

Familial aggregation is often quantified in terms of a\nfamilial relative risk (FRR), and although at first glance this measure may\nseem simple and intuitive as an average risk prediction, its implications are\nnot straightforward.\n  Methods: We use two statistical models for the distribution of disease risk\nin a population: a dichotomous risk model that gives an intuitive understanding\nof the implication of a given FRR, and a continuous risk model that facilitates\na more detailed computation of the inequalities in disease risk. Published\nestimates of FRRs are used to produce Lorenz curves and Gini indices that\nquantifies the inequalities in risk for a range of diseases.\n  Results: We demonstrate that even a moderate familial association in disease\nrisk implies a very large difference in risk between individuals in the\npopulation. We give examples of diseases for which this is likely to be true,\nand we further demonstrate the relationship between the point estimates of FRRs\nand the distribution of risk in the population.\n  Conclusions: The variation in risk for several severe diseases may be larger\nthan the variation in income in many countries.

Simulation results show the root mean square (RMS)\npositioning accuracy of 25 cm and 5 cm for one and 4 PDs scenarios,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 09:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

So, naturally lots of research work is going on\nto mount a significant attack on AES. Many different forms of Linear and\ndifferential cryptanalysis have been performed on AES. Of late, an active area\nof research has been Algebraic Cryptanalysis of AES, where although fast\nprogress is being made, there are still numerous scopes for research and\nimprovement. One of the major reasons behind this being that algebraic\ncryptanalysis mainly depends on I/O relations of the AES S- Box (a major\ncomponent of the AES). As, already known, that the key recovery algorithm of\nAES can be broken down as an MQ problem which is itself considered hard.\nSolving these equations depends on our ability reduce them into linear forms\nwhich are easily solvable under our current computational prowess. The lower\nthe degree of these equations, the easier it is for us to linearlize hence the\nattack complexity reduces. The aim of this paper is to analyze the various\nrelations involving small number of monomials of the AES S- Box and to answer\nthe question whether it is actually possible to have such monomial equations\nfor the S- Box if we restrict the degree of the monomials. In other words this\npaper aims to study such equations and see if they can be applicable for AES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 10:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

A good tour must consider several objectives regarding the\ndesirability of certain days of the week, as well as travel cost. We developed\nand implemented a heuristic algorithm in Java, which was based on simulated\nannealing, to automatically generate good tours that both satisfied the above\nconstraints and improved objectives significantly when compared to the best\nmanual tour created by the client. Our program also enabled the client to see\nand explore trade-offs among objectives while choosing the best tour that meets\nthe requirements of the business.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 01:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

To accommodate the high data rates, a direct communication between\nnearby mobile terminals (MTs), known as Device-to-device (D2D) communication,\ncan be exploited. Furthermore, a communication in high frequency bands, such\nas, visible light communication (VLC), is also foreseen as an enabler for the\nhigh data rates. In conventional D2D communication, pairs of the MTs should\nreuse the same frequencies to keep a high spectral efficiency of the system.\nHowever, this implies either interference among the D2D pairs or utilization of\ncomplex and advanced resource allocation algorithms. In this paper, we propose\na new concept for D2D communication combining VLC and RF technologies in order\nto maximize capacity of the system. This paper provides an analysis of the\noperational limits for the proposed concept and investigates capacity gains\nintroduced by the combined usage of RF and VLC bands for D2D. Moreover, we\ndiscuss several practical issues related to the proposed RF-VLC D2D concept.\nPerformed analyses show that the RF--VLC D2D is able to improve the capacity in\nan indoor scenario by a factor of 4.1 and 1.5 when compared to stand-alone RF\nD2D and VLC D2D, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 12:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}
