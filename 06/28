Using SDSS spectra of NGC 3191, we find a metallicity\n~2 Z$_\\odot$ at the nucleus and ~1.3 Z$_\\odot$ for a star forming region at a\nradial offset similar to SN 2017egm. Archival radio-to-UV photometry reveals a\nstar-formation rate ~15 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (with ~70% dust-obscured), which\ncan account for a Swift X-ray detection, and stellar mass ~$10^{10.7}$\nM$_\\odot$. We model the early UV-optical light curves with a magnetar\ncentral-engine model, using the Bayesian light curve fitting tool MOSFiT. The\nfits indicate ejecta mass 2-4 M$_\\odot$, spin period 4-6 ms, magnetic field\n(0.7-1.7)$\\times 10^{14}$G, and kinetic energy 1-2 $\\times10^{51}$ erg. These\nparameters are consistent with the overall distributions for SLSNe, modeled by\nNicholl et al (2017), although the derived mass and spin are towards the low\nend, possibly indicating enhanced loss of mass and angular momentum before\nexplosion. This has two implications: (i) SLSNe can occur at solar metallicity,\nalthough with a low fraction ~10%; and (ii) metallicity has at most a modest\neffect on their properties. Both conclusions are in line with results for long\ngamma-ray bursts. Assuming a monotonic rise gives an explosion date MJD\n$57889\\pm1$. However, a short-lived excess in the data relative to the\nbest-fitting models may indicate an early-time `bump'. If confirmed, SN 2017egm\nwould be the first SLSN with a spectrum during the bump-phase; this shows the\nsame O II lines seen at maximum light, which may be an important clue for\nexplaining these bumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:11:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 20:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

In model-based clustering, a method\ncalled high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC) uses a family of Gaussian\nmixture models for clustering. HDDC is based on the idea that high-dimensional\ndata usually exists in lower-dimensional subspaces; as such, an intrinsic\ndimension for each sub-population of the observed data can be estimated and\ncluster analysis can be performed in this lower-dimensional subspace. As a\nresult, only a fraction of the total number of parameters need to be estimated\nand a computationally efficient parameter estimation scheme based on the EM\nalgorithm was developed.

A standard optimization strategy is based on formulating the problem\nas one of low rank matrix factorization which, however, leads to a non-convex\nproblem. In practice this approach works well, and it is often computationally\nfaster than standard convex solvers such as proximal gradient methods.\nNevertheless, it is not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, and the\noptimization can be trapped at poor stationary points.

It is an\nindispensable tool for various scientific disciplines such as molecular\nengineering, solid-state physics, and cell biology. Prior to a given\nexperiment, the AFM must be calibrated by fitting a spectral density model to\nbaseline recordings. However, since AFM experiments typically collect large\namounts of data, parameter estimation by maximum likelihood can be\nprohibitively expensive. Thus, practitioners routinely employ a much faster\nleast-squares estimation method, at the cost of substantially reduced\nstatistical efficiency. Additionally, AFM data is often contaminated by\nperiodic electronic noise, to which parameter estimates are highly sensitive.\nThis article proposes a two-stage estimator to address these issues.\nPreliminary parameter estimates are first obtained by a variance-stabilizing\nprocedure, by which the simplicity of least-squares combines with the\nefficiency of maximum likelihood. A test for spectral periodicities then\neliminates high-impact outliers, considerably and robustly protecting the\nsecond-stage estimator from the effects of electronic noise. Simulation and\nexperimental results indicate that a two- to ten-fold reduction in mean squared\nerror can be expected by applying our methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Some applications, such as mammography and\nextremities imaging, require spatial resolution beyond current capabilities.\nThorough understanding of system properties may help tailor system design,\nacquisition protocols, and reconstruction algorithms to improve image quality.\nUsing a high-fidelity measurement model, we analyze the effects of\nshift-variant focal spot blur due to depth-dependence and anode angulation on\nimage quality throughout the three-dimensional field of view of a simulated\nextremities scanner. A model of the shift-variant blur associated with this\ndevice is then incorporated into a Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR)\nalgorithm, which is then compared to FDK and MBIR with simpler blur models at\nselect locations throughout the field of view. We show that shift-variant focal\nspot blur leads to location-dependent imaging performance. Furthermore,\nchanging the orientation of the X-ray tube alters this spatial dependence. The\nanalysis suggests methods to improve imaging performance based on specific\nimage quality needs. The results also demonstrate that image quality can be\nimproved by combining accurate blur modeling with MBIR. Specifically, across\nthe entire field of view, MBIR with shift-variant blur modeling yielded the\nbest image quality, followed by MBIR with a shift-invariant blur model, MBIR\nwith an identity blur model, and FDK, respectively. These results suggest a\nnumber of opportunities for the optimization of imaging system performance in\nthe hardware setup, the imaging protocol, and the reconstruction approach.\nWhile the high-fidelity models used here are applied using the specifications\nof a dedicated extremities imaging system, the methods are general and may be\napplied to optimize imaging performance in any CT system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 17:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward.

First, libration changes the\nspectral distribution of tidal damping across the tidal modes, as compared to\nthe case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating rate and the tidal\ntorque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating\ndeformation only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a\nlibrating body is also subject to a toroidal force proportional to the angular\nacceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force in a steadily spinning body\nrenders only a permanent deformation, in a librating body this force contains\ntwo alternating components $-$ one radial, another a degree-2 potential force.\nBoth contribute to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential.\n  We build a formalism to describe dissipation in a homogeneous terrestrial\nbody performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism\nincorporates a linear rheological law defining the response of the material to\nforcing. While the formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we\nconsider a simple example of a Maxwell material.\n  We show that, independent of rheology, the forced libration in longitude can\nprovide a considerable and even leading input in the tidal heating. Based on\nthe observed parameters, this input amounts to 52% in Phobos, 33% in Mimas, 23%\nin Enceladus, and 96% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis by Makarov &\nEfroimsky (2014) that the additional damping due to forced libration may have\nparticipated in the early heating up of some moons. As one possibility, a moon\ncould have been chipped by collisions $-$ whereby it acquired a higher\ntriaxiality and a higher forced-libration magnitude and, consequently, a higher\nheating rate.

The\nconstruction of the corresponding many-body trial wave functions proceeds first\nvia symmetry breaking at the mean-field level followed by symmetry restoration\nusing projection techniques. The ensuing correlated many-body wave functions\nare stationary states and preserve the rotational symmetries, and at the same\ntime they reflect the point-group symmetries of the mean-field crystals. This\nbehavior results in the emergence of sequences of select magic angular momenta\n$L_m$. For angular-momenta away from the magic values, the trial functions\nvanish. Symmetry breaking beyond mean field can be induced by superpositions of\nsuch good-$L_m$ many-body stationary states.

They are coalition forming games of selfish agents\nbased on their mutual preferences. Most of the work in the literature\ncharacterizes the existence and structure of stable outcomes (i.e., partitions\nin coalitions), assuming that preferences are given. However, there is little\ndiscussion on this assumption. In fact, agents receive different utilities if\nthey belong to different partitions, and thus it is natural for them to declare\ntheir preferences strategically in order to maximize their benefit. In this\npaper we consider strategyproof mechanisms for additively separable hedonic\ngames and fractional hedonic games, that is, partitioning methods without\npayments such that utility maximizing agents have no incentive to lie about\ntheir true preferences. We focus on social welfare maximization and provide\nseveral lower and upper bounds on the performance achievable by strategyproof\nmechanisms for general and specific additive functions. In most of the cases we\nprovide tight or asymptotically tight results. All our mechanisms are simple\nand can be computed in polynomial time.

We show that in a growing spherical disk\ncovering a sphere the accumulation of curvature effect can prevent typical +1\nand +1/2 defects from forming boojum textures where the defects are repelled to\nthe boundary of the disk.

We estimate the size of the texture-induced magnetoresistance effect\nbeing in the range of that of domain walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 19:47:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 17:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

Motivated to resolve this potential controversy, in the present\nwork, we study backscattering effects employing fermionic perturbation theory\nand considering quite general forms of the backscattering field and electron\ninteractions. We discover that backscattering effects are crucially sensitive\nto the locality properties of the backscattering field and electron\ninteractions, to the symmetry of the latter, as well as to the presence or\nabsence of the cutoff of the electron spectrum. We find that backscattering is\nindeed absent under the following assumptions: (i) local backscattering field;\n(ii.a) local or (ii.b) SU(2)-symmetric interactions; (iii) absent cutoff of the\nedge-state spectrum. However, violation of any of these conditions leads to\nbackscattering. This also reconciles with the results based on the bosonization\ntechnique. We calculate the associated backscattering current, establish its\nlow-bias scaling behavior, and predict a crossover between two different\nscaling regimes. The main implication of our findings is that backscattering of\nsome magnitude is inevitable in a real system, although could be quite\nsuppressed for nearly local backscattering field and interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 23:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Herein we focus on\nthe domain of international relations. Our major substantive question is: How\ncan we determine what characteristics make an actor influential? To address the\ntopic of influence, we build on a multilinear tensor regression framework\n(MLTR) that captures influence relationships using a tensor generalization of a\nvector autoregression model. Influence relationships in that approach are\ncaptured in a pair of n x n matrices and provide measurements of how the\nnetwork actions of one actor may influence the future actions of another. A\nlimitation of the MLTR and earlier latent space approaches is that there are no\ndirect mechanisms through which to explain why a certain actor is more or less\ninfluential than others. Our new framework, social influence regression,\nprovides a way to statistically model the influence of one actor on another as\na function of characteristics of the actors. Thus we can move beyond just\nestimating that an actor influences another to understanding why. To highlight\nthe utility of this approach, we apply it to studying monthly-level conflictual\nevents between countries as measured through the Integrated Crisis Early\nWarning System (ICEWS) event data project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 23:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

We infer that the convergence of the\nopposite-polarity patches results in reconnection in the low corona that builds\na magnetic arcade enveloping the minifilament in its core, and that the\ncontinuing flux cancelation at the neutral line finally destabilizes the\nminifilament field so that it erupts and drives the production of a coronal\njet.

There is currently no cure. Brain computer\ninterfaces (BCIs) can establish a communication channel directly between the\nbrain and an external device by recognizing brain activities that reflect user\nintent. Therefore, this technology could help ALS patients in promoting\nfunctional independence through BCI-based speller systems and motor assistive\ndevices. Methods: In this paper, two kinds of ERP-based speller systems were\ntested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) assess performance when they spelled 42\ncharacters online continuously, without a break; and (2) to compare performance\nbetween a matrix-based speller paradigm (MS-P, mean visual angle 6 degree) and\na new speller paradigm that used a larger visual angle called the large visual\nangle speller paradigm (LS-P, mean visual angle 8 degree). Results: Although\nresults showed that there were no significant differences between the two\nparadigms in accuracy trend over continuous use (p>0.05), the fatigue during\nthe LS-P condition was significantly lower than that of MS-P (p<0.05). Results\nalso showed that continuous use slightly reduced the performance of this\nERP-based BCI. Conclusion: 15 subjects obtained higher than 80% feedback\naccuracy (online output accuracy) and 9 subjects obtained higher than 90%\nfeedback accuracy in one of the two paradigms, thus validating the BCI\napproaches in this study. Significance: Most ALS subjects in this study could\nspell effectively after continuous use of an ERP-based BCI. The new LS-P\ndisplay may be easier for subjects to use, resulting in lower fatigue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 00:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

Here, we establish a general\npicture of the interactions and resulting ground-states (GSs) arising from\nnearest neighbour exchange anisotropy on the kagome lattice.

In the\nhigh-symmetry case where reflection in the kagome plane is a symmetry of the\nsystem, the generic nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian can be locally defined as a\nXYZ model with out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We proceed to\nstudy its phase diagram in the classical limit, making use of an exact\nreformulation of the Hamiltonian in terms of irreducible representations\n(irreps) of the lattice symmetry group.

Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime\nbehavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results.

We consider propagation of pulses in ultrathin gold strip\nwaveguides, modeled by the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. The nonlinear\nresponse of gold is accounted for by the two-temperature model, revealing it as\na delayed nonlinearity intrinsic in gold. The consequence is that the measured\nnonlinearities are strongly dependent on pulse duration. This issue has so far\nonly been addressed phenomenologically, but we provide an accurate estimate of\nthe quantitative connection as well as a phenomenological theory to understand\nthe enhanced nonlinear response as the gold thickness is reduced.

There are two\ncomponents to this eruptive event. First, a flux rope forms above a\nstrong-field polarity-inversion line and erupts and grows as the parallel\nribbons turn on, grow, and spread part from that polarity-inversion line; this\nevolution is consistent with the tether-cutting-reconnection mechanism for\neruptions.

Missing\ndata on exposures are common and multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach\nto handling this, to avoid the potential bias and loss of efficiency resulting\nfrom a 'complete-case' analysis. Two MI methods have been proposed for when the\nsubstantive model is a Cox proportional hazards regression: an approximate\nmethod (White and Royston, Statist.

The methods also give approximately correct type I errors in the test\nfor proportional hazards when there is no TVE, and gain power to detect TVEs\nrelative to complete-case analysis. Ignoring TVEs at the imputation stage\nresults in biased TVE estimates, incorrect type I errors and substantial loss\nof power in detecting TVEs.

In this paper, we\nconsider storage capacity as a natural information-theoretic analogue of the\nminimum vertex cover of a graph. Indeed, while it was known that storage\ncapacity is upper bounded by minimum vertex cover, we show that by treating it\nas such we can get a 3/2 approximation for planar graphs, and a 4/3\napproximation for triangle-free planar graphs. Since the storage capacity is\nintimately related to the index coding rate, we get a 2 approximation of index\ncoding rate for planar graphs and 3/2 approximation for triangle-free planar\ngraphs. We also show a polynomial time approximation scheme for the index\ncoding rate when the alphabet size is constant. We then develop a general\nmethod of \"gadget covering\" to upper bound the storage capacity in terms of the\naverage of a set of vertex covers. This method is intuitive and leads to the\nexact characterization of storage capacity for various families of graphs. As\nan illustrative example, we use this approach to derive the exact storage\ncapacity of cycles-with-chords, a family of graphs related to outerplanar\ngraphs. Finally, we generalize the storage capacity notion to include recovery\nfrom partial node failures in distributed storage. We show tight upper and\nlower bounds on this partial recovery capacity that scales nicely with the\nfraction of failures in a vertex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 10:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 23:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 03:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

In\nthis analysis, we leverage the spectral differences of green vegetation, soil,\nand clouds to perform an EOF analysis which simultaneously characterizes\nmonsoon cloud cover and vegetation phenology in a temperate cloud forest in\nDhofar, southern Oman. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of daily\nMODIS reflectance clearly distinguishes clouds and bare soil from both\ngrassland and cloud forest vegetation. Using the temporal feature space of the\nlow order principal components of the NDVI time series, we identify distinct\nannual cycles of cloud cover and vegetation phenology corresponding to\ngeographically contiguous areas of coupled monsoon-phenological activity\n(phenoregions). The EOF analysis characterizes the temporal dynamics of these\nphenoregions. The wadi cloud forests of the Jabal Al Qara and Jabal Al Qamar\ncan each be described with 2 distinct spatiotemporal patterns of monsoon\nphenology, corresponding to the eastern and western portions of each range.

While each phenoregion has a clearly repeating annual\ncycle, each also demonstrates substantial interannual variability in both cloud\ncover and phenology. This interannual variability is of a sufficient magnitude\nto mask any trends in cloud cover or phenology in any of the regions in the\nDhofar Mountains.

A key issue in understanding these QSL\ncandidates is often the interplay of weak disorder of the crystal structure\nwith the spin liquid state. It has recently been pointed out that in at least\none important class of candidate QSLs - pyrochlore magnets based on non-Kramers\nions such as Pr$^{3+}$ or Tb$^{3+}$- structural disorder can actually promote a\n$U(1)$ QSL ground state. Here we set this proposal on a quantitative footing by\nanalyzing the stability of the QSL state in the minimal model for these\nsystems: a random transverse field Ising model. We consider two kinds of\ninstability, which are relevant in different limits of the phase diagram:\ncondensation of spinons and confinement of the $U(1)$ gauge fields.

For DG methods applied to the dual splitting\nprojection method, instabilities have recently been reported that occur for\ncoarse spatial resolutions and small time step sizes. By means of numerical\ninvestigation we give evidence that these instabilities are related to the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin formulation of the velocity divergence term and the\npressure gradient term that couple velocity and pressure. Integration by parts\nof these terms with a suitable definition of boundary conditions is required in\norder to obtain a stable and robust method. Since the intermediate velocity\nfield does not fulfill the boundary conditions prescribed for the velocity, a\nconsistent boundary condition is derived from the convective step of the dual\nsplitting scheme to ensure high-order accuracy with respect to the temporal\ndiscretization. This new formulation is stable in the limit of small time steps\nfor both equal-order and mixed-order polynomial approximations. Although the\ndual splitting scheme itself includes inf-sup stabilizing contributions, we\ndemonstrate that spurious pressure oscillations appear for equal-order\npolynomials and small time steps highlighting the necessity to consider inf-sup\nstability explicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 12:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Moreover, it\nhas been shown that VADs by means of blood pump have advantages for working\nunder different conditions. While a lot of work has been done on modeling the\nfunctionality of the blood pump, but quantifying uncertainties in a numerical\nmodel is a challenging task.

Molecular qubits, which benefit from the power of\nchemistry for the tailored and inexpensive synthesis of new systems, face the\nchallenge from decoherence effect. The decoherence effect is due to the\nmolecular qubits' inevitable interactions to their environment. Strategies to\novercome decoherence effect have been developed, such as designing a nuclear\nspin free environment and working at atomic clock transitions. These chemical\napproaches, however, have some fundamental limitations. For example, chemical\napproach restricts the ligand selection and design to ligands with zero nuclear\nmagnetic dipole moment, such as carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Herein, a physical\napproach, named Dynamical decoupling (DD), is utilized to combat decoherence,\nwhile the limitations of the chemical approaches can be avoided. The phase\nmemory time $T_2$ for a transition metal complex has been prolonged to exceed\none millisecond ($1.4~$ms) by employing DD. The single qubit figure of merit\n$Q_M $ reaches $ 1.4\\times 10^5$, which is $40$ times better than that\npreviously reported value for such system.

In this\nstudy, we theoretically demonstrate that pnictogen-dichalcogenide layered\ncompounds, which originally attracted attention as a family of superconductors\nand have recently been investigated as thermoelectric materials, can exhibit\nvery high thermoelectric performance with elemental substitution. In\nparticular, we clarify a promising guiding principle for materials design and\nfind that LaOAsSe$_2$, a material that has yet to be synthesized, has a\npowerfactor that is six times as large as that of the known compound LaOBiS$_2$\nand can exhibit a very large $ZT$ under some plausible assumptions.

Our\nfirst-principles calculation of free energy predicts that the configurational\nentropy stabilizes a single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase from T = 1,700K up\nto melting, while precipitation of a complex intermetallic is favored at lower\ntemperatures. We form the compound experimentally and confirm that it forms as\na single BCC phase from the melt, but that it transforms reversibly at lower\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 13:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

The\nphotoluminescence response of monolayer WS$_2$ is found to be largely dominated\nby disorder/impurity- and/or phonon-assisted recombination processes. The\nindirect band-gap luminescence in multilayer WS$_2$ turns out to be a\nphonon-mediated process whose energy evolution with the number of layers\nsurprisingly follows a simple model of a two-dimensional confinement.

The large variety and quantity of data\navailable should be explored but this brings important challenges. For\ninstance, although there are powerful computer vision methods that may be\nexplored, they may require large annotated datasets. In this work we propose a\nnovel approach to automatically creating an object recognition system with\nminimal manual annotation. The basic idea behind the method is to use large\ninput datasets using available online cameras on large cities. A off-the-shelf\nweak classifier is used to detect an initial set of urban elements of interest\n(e.g. cars, pedestrians, bikes, etc.). Such initial dataset undergoes a quality\ncontrol procedure and it is subsequently used to fine tune a strong classifier.\nQuality control and comparative performance assessment are used as part of the\npipeline. We evaluate the method for detecting cars based on monitoring\ncameras. Experimental results using real data show that despite losing\ngenerality, the final detector provides better detection rates tailored to the\nselected cameras. The programmed robot gathered 770 video hours from 24 online\ncity cameras (\\~300GB), which has been fed to the proposed system.

Normal mode\nanalysis was used to get vibrations, and these are analysed using mode\ncharacter indicators which can quantify: how active an element is in a mode;\nthe overall direction of the mode; and which chemical coordinates are relevant.\nWe examined the 4 possible packing structures. We find that the more\nthermodynamically stable structures were less perturbed by the surface and more\nsupported by the surrounding monolayer. The surface-perturbed modes were below\n100cm$^{-1}$, had a higher global, carbon, sulfur, longitudinal and torsional\ncharacters, indicating unit cell backbone motions, often with increased S\nmotion parallel to the surface, and an increased terminal methyl group motion.\nModes identified by this technique showed a difference between experimental\nvibrations (with and without the surface) that was twice as large as those not\nidentified. The surrounding monolayer had a larger effect on a single molecule\ndynamics than the surface, including stabilising the molecules enough for 12\nhigh energy modes to move $\\approx$425cm$^{-1}$ down in energy to below $k_B\nT$, allowing them to be populated at room temperature. These modes had higher\nlocal and higher H characters, and were highly modulated by the SAM structure.\nThis work shows novels ways to analyse vibrations, and demonstrates the crucial\nneed to include geometric confinement effects in SAM studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

Our aim is to perceive and model an unprepared kitchen\nscenario with many objects. We start with the perception of a single target\nobject. The modeling relies especially on fusing and merging of weak\ninformation from the sensors of the robot in order to localize objects. This\nrequires the representation of various probability distributions of pose in\n$S_3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ as orientation and position have to be localized. In\nthis thesis I present a framework for probabilistic modeling of poses in $S_3\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ that represents a large class of probability distributions\nand provides among others the operations of the fusion and the merge of\nestimates. Further it offers the propagation of uncertain information data. I\nwork out why we choose to represent the orientation part of a pose by a unit\nquaternion. The translation part is described either by a 3-dimensional vector\nor by a purely imaginary quaternion. This depends on whether we define the\nprobability density function or whether we want to represent a transformation\nwhich consists of a rotation and a translation by a dual quaternion. A basic\nprobability den- sity function over the poses is defined by a tangent point on\nthe hypersphere and a 6-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The hypersphere is\nembedded to the R4 which is representing a unit quaternions whereas the\nGaussian is defined over the product of the tangent space of the sphere and of\nthe space of translations. The projection of this Gaussian to the hypersphere\ninduces a distribution over poses in $S_3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. The set of\nmixtures of projected Gaussians can approximate the probability density\nfunctions that arise in our application. Moreover it is closed under the\noperations introduced in this framework and allows for an efficient\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 11:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}
