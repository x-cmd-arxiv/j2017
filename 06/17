In this framework, a frozen electric field modeling\napproach is applied to take advantage of the quasiperiodic behaviors of the\nelectrical characteristics to avoid the recalculation of electric field for\neach pulse. The correlated dynamic adaptive chemistry (CoDAC) method is\nemployed to accelerate the calculation of large and stiff chemical mechanisms.\nThe timestep is updated dynamically during the simulation through a three-stage\nmultitimescale modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the large separation\nof timescales in nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges. A general theory of\nplasma assisted ignition and combustion is then proposed. Nanosecond pulsed\nplasma discharges for ignition and combustion can be divided into four stages.\nStage I is the discharge pulse, with timescales of O(1 to 10 ns). In this\nstage, most input energy is coupled into electron impact excitation and\ndissociation reactions to generate charged or excited species and radicals.\nStage II is the afterglow during the gap between two adjacent pulses, with\ntimescales of O(100 ns). In this stage, quenching of excited species not only\nfurther dissociates O2 and fuel molecules, but also provides fast gas heating.\nStage III is the remaining gap between pulses, with timescales of O(1 to 100\nmicrosec). The radicals generated during Stages I and II significantly enhance\nthe exothermic reactions in this stage. Stage IV is the accumulative effects of\nmultiple pulses, with timescales of O(1 ms to 1 sec), which include preheated\ngas temperatures and a large pool of radicals and fuel fragments to trigger\nignition. For plasma assisted flames, plasma significantly enhances the radical\ngeneration and gas heating in the preheat zone, which could trigger upstream\nautoignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 16:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

This clustering must either be representative of the intrinsic\ndistribution of these TNOs, or else arise as a result of observation biases\nand/or statistically expected variations for such a small set of detected\nobjects. The clustered TNOs were detected across different and independent\nsurveys, which has led to claims that the detections are therefore free of\nobservational bias. This apparent clustering has led to the so-called \"Planet\n9\" hypothesis that a super-Earth currently resides in the distant solar system\nand causes this clustering. The Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) is a\nlarge program that ran on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2013--2017,\ndiscovering more than 800 new TNOs. One of the primary design goals of OSSOS\nwas the careful determination of observational biases that would manifest\nwithin the detected sample. We demonstrate the striking and non-intuitive\nbiases that exist for the detection of TNOs with large semi-major axes. The\neight large semi-major axis OSSOS detections are an independent dataset, of\ncomparable size to the conglomerate samples used in previous studies. We\nconclude that the orbital distribution of the OSSOS sample is consistent with\nbeing detected from a uniform underlying angular distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 17:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Opinion and trend mining on micro blogs dealing\nwith politics has recently attracted researchers in several fields including\nInformation Retrieval and Machine Learning (ML). Since the performance of ML\nand Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are limited by the amount and\nquality of data available, one promising alternative for some tasks is the\nautomatic propagation of expert annotations. This paper intends to develop a\nso-called active learning process for automatically annotating French language\ntweets that deal with the image (i.e., representation, web reputation) of\npoliticians. Our main focus is on the methodology followed to build an original\nannotated dataset expressing opinion from two French politicians over time. We\ntherefore review state of the art NLP-based ML algorithms to automatically\nannotate tweets using a manual initiation step as bootstrap. This paper focuses\non key issues about active learning while building a large annotated data set\nfrom noise. This will be introduced by human annotators, abundance of data and\nthe label distribution across data and entities. In turn, we show that Twitter\ncharacteristics such as the author's name or hashtags can be considered as the\nbearing point to not only improve automatic systems for Opinion Mining (OM) and\nTopic Classification but also to reduce noise in human annotations.

This study is\nperformed by exploiting the multi-wavelength, from UV to sub-mm bands,\nDustPedia database, in addition to molecular (12CO) and atomic (HI) gas maps\nand metallicity abundance information available in the literature. We fitted\nthe surface brightness profiles of the tracers of dust and stars, the mass\nsurface density profiles of dust, stars, molecular gas, and total gas, and the\nSFR surface density profiles with an exponential curve and derived their\nscale-lengths. We also developed a method to solve for the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor (alpha_CO) per galaxy by using dust and gas mass profiles. Although each\ngalaxy has its own peculiar behaviour, we identified a common trend of the\nexponential scale-lengths vs. wavelength. On average, the scale-lengths\nnormalized to the B-band 25 mag/arcsec^2 radius decrease from UV to 70 micron,\nfrom 0.4 to 0.2, and then increase back up to 0.3 at 500 microns. The main\nresult is that, on average, the dust mass surface density scale-length is about\n1.8 times the stellar one derived from IRAC data and the 3.6 micron surface\nbrightness, and close to that in the UV. We found a mild dependence of the\nscale-lengths on the Hubble stage T: the scale-lengths of the Herschel bands\nand the 3.6 micron scale-length tend to increase from earlier to later types,\nthe scale-length at 70 micron tends to be smaller than that at longer sub-mm\nwavelength with ratios between longer sub-mm wavelengths and 70 micron that\ndecrease with increasing T.

Communications to a relay orbiter is a major constraint, due to power\nrequirements and decreasing antenna gain at small sizes. Also, analysis time\nscales adversely for power hungry Raman or surface abrasion, and also for low\nphoton count gamma ray spectroscopy. 1 cm scale rovers with a MER like\ncapability should be possible, and could operate on solar power to 40 AU. At 2\ncm, rovers powered by current RTGs are feasible, and are useful in the outer\nsolar system. Such rovers will return images, autonomously navigate from\ninterest point to interest point, and autonomously deploy instruments. Analyses\ninclude elemental APX and gamma ray spectroscopy for elemental and Raman and IR\nspectroscopy for molecular and or mineralogical compositions.

We demonstrate this for the specific case of the uncolored $O(n)^3$\ntensor model with arbitrary even $n$, and reduce the question of determining\nthe spectrum and eigenstates to an algebraic equation relating Young tableaux.\nSolving this reduced problem is conceptually trivial and amounts to matching\nthe representations on either side, as we demonstrate explicitly at low levels.\nAt high levels, representations become bigger, but should still be tractable.\nNone of our arguments require any supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

A major challenge to further scalability is\nto find approaches for connecting these systems over long distances and at high\nrates. One approach is to convert the quantum state of a microwave circuit to\noptical photons that can be transmitted over kilometers at room temperature\nwith little loss. Many proposals for electro-optic conversion between microwave\nand optics use optical driving of a weak three-wave mixing nonlinearity to\nconvert the frequency of an excitation. Residual absorption of this optical\npump leads to heating, which is problematic at cryogenic temperatures. Here we\npropose an alternative approach where a nonlinear superconducting circuit is\ndriven to interconvert between microwave-frequency and\nmillimeter-wave-frequency (300 GHz) photons. To understand the potential for\nquantum conversion between microwave and mm-wave photons, we consider the\ndriven four-wave mixing quantum dynamics of nonlinear circuits. In contrast to\nthe linear dynamics of the driven three-wave mixing converters, the proposed\nfour-wave mixing converter has nonlinear decoherence channels that lead to a\nmore complex parameter space of couplings and pump powers that we map out. We\nconsider physical realizations of such converter circuits by deriving\ntheoretically the upper bound on the maximum obtainable nonlinear coupling\nbetween any two modes in a lossless circuit, and synthesizing an optimal\ncircuit based on realistic materials that saturates this bound. Our proposed\ncircuit dissipates less than $10^{-9}$ times the energy of current\nelectro-optic converters per qubit. Finally, we outline the quantum link budget\nfor optical, microwave, and mm-wave connections, showing that our approach is\nviable for realizing interconnected quantum processors for intracity or quantum\ndatacenter environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Using the Weak Gravity Conjecture, it has\nbeen recently argued by Ooguri and Vafa that such vacua are incompatible with\nthe SM embedding into a consistent theory of quantum gravity. We study the\nlimits obtained for both the cosmological constant $\\Lambda_4$ and neutrino\nmasses from the absence of such dangerous 3D and 2D SM AdS vacua. One\ninteresting implication is that $\\Lambda_4$ is bounded to be larger than a\nscale of order $m_\\nu^4$, as observed experimentally. Interestingly, this is\nthe first argument implying a non-vanishing $\\Lambda_4$ only on the basis of\nparticle physics, with no cosmological input. Conversely, the observed\n$\\Lambda_4$ implies strong constraints on neutrino masses in the SM and also\nfor some BSM extensions including extra Weyl or Dirac spinors, gravitinos and\naxions.

Chapter 3 discusses in details all the observations carried out for the\nthesis. In Chapter 4, details regarding the nulling behaviour of various\npulsars are listed. Chapter 4 highlights the fact that nulling is\nunpredictable. Chapter 5 presents a comparison between two pulsars with high\nNFs. It is shown that both the pulsars exhibit similar bursting behaviour, but\nstrikingly different quasi-periodicities and emission properties. Chapter 6\ndiscusses the details regarding the simultaneous observations of two nulling\npulsars at four different frequencies. These observations suggest that nulling\nis a frequency independent phenomena simultaneous occuring over a decade of\nfrequency.

Methods:\nThe study included 11,951 participants six years and older from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006, who wore\naccelerometers to measure physical activity for seven consecutive days.\nParticipants were instructed to remove the device just before the nighttime\nsleep period and put it back on immediately after. This nighttime period of\nnon-wear was defined in this paper as the objective bedtime (OBT), an\nobjectively estimated record of the in-bed-interval. For each night of the\nweek, we estimated two measures: the duration of the OBT (OBT-D) and, as a\nmeasure of the chronotype, the midpoint of the OBT (OBT-M). We estimated\nday-of-the-week-specific OBT-D and OBT-M using gender-specific population\npercentile curves. Differences in OBT-M (chronotype) and OBT-D (the amount of\ntime spent in bed) by age and sex were estimated using regression models.\nResults: The estimates of OBT-M and their differences among age groups were\nconsistent with the estimates of chronotype obtained via self-report in\nEuropean populations. The average OBT-M varied significantly by age, while\nOBT-D was less variable with age. The most pronounced differences were observed\nbetween OBT-M of weekday and weekend nights. Conclusions: The proposed\nmeasures, OBT-D and OBT-M, provide useful information of time in bed and\nchronotype in NHANES 2003-2006. They identify within-week patterns of bedtime\nand can be used to study associations between the bedtime and the large number\nof health outcomes collected in NHANES 2003-2006.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 19:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

They are often seen as inter-arm features in external\nspiral galaxies, but have been tentatively associated with spiral arms when\nviewed in the Milky Way. In this paper, we study the time evolution of GMFs in\na high-resolution section of a spiral galaxy simulation, and their link with\nspiral arm GMCs and star formation, over a period of 11Myrs. The GMFs generally\nsurvive the inter-arm passage, although they are subject to a number of\nprocesses (e.g. star formation, stellar feedback and differential rotation)\nwhich can break the giant filamentary structure into smaller sections. The GMFs\nare not gravitationally bound clouds as a whole, but are, to some extent,\nconfined by external pressure. Once they reach the spiral arms, the GMFs tend\nto evolve into more substructured spiral arm GMCs, suggesting that GMFs may be\nprecursors to arm GMCs. Here, they become incorporated into the more complex\nand almost continuum molecular medium that makes up the gaseous spiral arm.\nInstead of retaining a clear filamentary shape, their shapes are distorted both\nby their climb up the spiral potential and their interaction with the gas\nwithin the spiral arm. The GMFs do tend to become aligned with the spiral arms\njust before they enter them (when they reach the minimum of the spiral\npotential), which could account for the observations of GMFs in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 20:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In this work, we focus on the problem of\nrepairing multiple failures in a centralized way, which can be desirable in\nmany data storage configurations, and we show that a significant repair traffic\nreduction is possible. First, the fundamental tradeoff between the repair\nbandwidth and the storage size for functional repair is established. Using a\ngraph-theoretic formulation, the optimal tradeoff is identified as the solution\nto an integer optimization problem, for which a closed-form expression is\nderived. Expressions of the extreme points, namely the minimum storage\nmulti-node repair (MSMR) and minimum bandwidth multi-node repair (MBMR) points,\nare obtained. Second, we describe a general framework for converting single\nerasure minimum storage regenerating codes to MSMR codes. The repair strategy\nfor $e$ failures is similar to that for single failure, however certain extra\nrequirements need to be satisfied by the repairing functions for single\nfailure. For illustration, the framework is applied to product-matrix codes and\ninterference alignment codes. Furthermore, we prove that the functional MBMR\npoint is not achievable for linear exact repair codes.

The variation of the HeI 1.08um line blue-shifted absorption\nsuggests that the inner wind has undergone a dramatic change in its velocity\nstructure, connected with a recent accretion event. DR Tau has a more stable\nwind as its HeI 1.08um absorption is stable in time in spite of strong\nvariability of the emission component.

Physical models of stellar surfaces\nhave many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate\nor high-dimensional parameter spaces.

One of the most popular graph similarity measures is the Graph Edit\nDistance (GED) mainly because of its broad applicability and high\ninterpretability. Despite its prevalence, exact GED computation is proved to be\nNP-hard, which could result in unsatisfactory computational efficiency on large\ngraphs. However, exactly accurate search results are usually unnecessary for\nreal-world applications especially when the responsiveness is far more\nimportant than the accuracy. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic approach to efficiently estimate GED, which is further leveraged\nfor the graph similarity search. Specifically, we first take branches as\nelementary structures in graphs, and introduce a novel graph similarity measure\nby comparing branches between graphs, i.e., Graph Branch Distance (GBD), which\ncan be efficiently calculated in polynomial time. Then, we formulate the\nrelationship between GED and GBD by considering branch variations as the result\nascribed to graph edit operations, and model this process by probabilistic\napproaches. By applying our model, the GED between any two graphs can be\nefficiently estimated by their GBD, and these estimations are finally utilized\nin the graph similarity search. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nhas better accuracy, efficiency and scalability than other comparable methods\nin the graph similarity search over real and synthetic data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 05:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 19:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

We study the properties\nof merger shocks in merging galaxy clusters, using a set of cosmological\nsimulations for the large-scale structure formation of the universe. As a\nrepresentative case, we here focus on the simulated clusters that undergo\nalmost head-on collisions with mass ratio $\\sim2$. Due to the turbulent nature\nof the intracluster medium, shock surfaces are not smooth, but composed of\nshocks with different Mach numbers. As the merger shocks expand outward from\nthe core to the outskirts, the average Mach number, $\\left<M_s\\right>$,\nincreases in time. We suggest that the shocks propagating along the merger axis\ncould be manifested as X-ray shocks and/or radio relics. The kinetic energy\nthrough the shocks, $F_\\phi$, peaks at $\\sim1$ Gyr after their initial\nlaunching, or at $\\sim1-2$ Mpc from the core.

In\npresence of VRE uncertainties, this paper discusses a distributionally robust\nchance constrained approximate AC-OPF. The power flow model employed in the\nproposed OPF formulation combines an exact AC power flow model at the nominal\noperation point and an approximate linear power flow model to reflect the\nsystem response under uncertainties. The ambiguity set employed in the\ndistributionally robust formulation is the Wasserstein ball centered at the\nempirical distribution. The proposed OPF model minimizes the expectation of the\nquadratic cost function w.r.t. the worst-case probability distribution and\nguarantees the chance constraints satisfied for any distribution in the\nambiguity set.

However, a distinctive difference exists that Gd is less\ndisplacive compared to Y, which results in an orthorhombic P na21 structure in\nGdCrO3 in contrast to monoclinic structure in YCrO3 and consequently, decreases\nits polar property. This is due to the subtle forces involving Gd-4f electrons\neither directly or indirectly. A strong magneto-electric coupling is revealed\nusing Raman measurements based analysis in the system below Cr-ordering\ntemperature, indicating their relevance to ferroelectric modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 14:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Combinatorially,\ntwo DAGs are Markov equivalent if and only if they have the same underlying\nundirected graph (i.e. skeleton) and the same set of the induced subDAGs $i\\to\nj \\leftarrow k$, known as immoralities. Hence it is of interest to study the\nnumber and size of Markov equivalence classes (MECs).

The success of these models however relies on the use of\nsophisticated recipes and complicated machinery that is not easily accessible\nto non-practitioners. Recent innovations in Deep Learning have given rise to an\nalternative - discriminative models called Sequence-to-Sequence models, that\ncan almost match the accuracy of state of the art generative models. While\nthese models are easy to train as they can be trained end-to-end in a single\nstep, they have a practical limitation that they can only be used for offline\nrecognition. This is because the models require that the entirety of the input\nsequence be available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not\nvalid for instantaneous speech recognition. To address this problem, online\nsequence-to-sequence models were recently introduced. These models are able to\nstart producing outputs as data arrives, and the model feels confident enough\nto output partial transcripts. These models, like sequence-to-sequence are\ncausal - the output produced by the model until any time, $t$, affects the\nfeatures that are computed subsequently. This makes the model inherently more\npowerful than generative models that are unable to change features that are\ncomputed from the data.

Firstly, the two-bright-one-dark\n(2-b-1-d) and one-bright-two-dark (1-b-2-d) mixed $N$-soliton solutions in\nshort-wave components of the three-component Mel'nikov system are derived in\ndetail. Then we extend our analysis to the $M$-component Mel'nikov system to\nobtain its general mixed $N$-soliton solution. The formula obtained unifies the\nall-bright, all-dark and bright-dark mixed $N$-soliton solutions. For the\ncollision of two solitons, the asymptotic analysis shows that for a\n$M$-component Mel'nikov system with $M \\geq 3$, inelastic collision takes\nplace, resulting in energy exchange among the short-wave components supporting\nbright solitons only if the bright solitons appear at least in two short-wave\ncomponents. Whereas, the dark solitons in the short-wave components and the\nbright solitons in the long-wave component always undergo elastic collision\nwhich just accompanied by a position shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 09:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel deep learning method named projection-recovery\nnetwork (PRNet) to blindly calibrate sensor measurements online. The PRNet\nfirst projects the drifted data to a feature space, and uses a powerful deep\nconvolutional neural network to recover the estimated drift-free measurements.\nWe deploy a 24-sensor testbed and provide comprehensive empirical evidence\nshowing that the proposed method significantly improves the sensing accuracy\nand drifted sensor detection.

Since WSN protocols are application specific, the focus has been\ngiven to the routing protocols that might differ depending on the application\nand network architecture. In this work, novel routing protocols have been\nproposed which is a cluster-based security protocol is named as Efficient and\nSecure Routing Protocol (ESRP) for WSN. The goal of ESRP is to provide an\nenergy efficient routing solution with dynamic security features for clustered\nWSN. During the network formation, a node which is connected to a Personal\nComputer (PC) has been selected as a sink node. Once the sensor nodes were\ndeployed, the sink node logically segregates the other nodes in a cluster\nstructure and subsequently creates a WSN. This centralized cluster formation\nmethod is used to reduce the node level processing burden and avoid multiple\ncommunications. In order to ensure reliable data delivery, various security\nfeatures have been incorporated in the proposed protocol such as Modified\nZero-Knowledge Protocol (MZKP), Promiscuous hearing method, Trapping of\nadversaries and Mine detection. One of the unique features of this ESRP is that\nit can dynamically decide about the selection of these security methods, based\non the residual energy of nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 04:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}
