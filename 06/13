Using a twisting jet of 2010 August 21 by \\emph{SDO}/AIA and other\nobservations of coronal jets we set the parameters of our theoretical model and\nhave obtained that in a twisted magnetic flux tube of radius of $9.8$~Mm, at a\ndensity contrast of $0.474$ and fixed Alfv\\'en Mach number of ${\\cong}0.76$,\nfor three MHD modes there exist instability windows whose width crucially\ndepends upon the internal magnetic field twist. It is found that for the\nconsidered modes an azimuthal magnetic field of $1.3$--$1.4$~G (computed at the\ntube boundary) makes the width of the instability windows equal to zero, that\nis, it suppress the KH instability onset. On the other hand, the times for\ndeveloping KH instability of the $m = 12$ MHD mode at instability wavelengths\nbetween $15$ and $12$~Mm turn out to be in the range of $1.9$ to $4.7$~minutes\nthat is in agreement with the growth rates estimated from the temporal\nevolution of the observed unstable jet's blobs in their initial stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Several noticeable parsec-scale\nfilaments are detected in the Herschel 250 microns image and seem to be\nradially directed to the massive clump. It resembles more of a \"hub-filament\"\nsystem. Deeply embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified using\nthe 1-5 microns photometric data, and a significant fraction of YSOs and their\nclustering are spatially found toward the massive clump, revealing the intense\nSF activities. An infrared counterpart (IRc) of the maser is investigated in\nthe Spitzer 3.6-4.5 microns images. The IRc does not appear point-like source\nand is most likely associated with the molecular outflow. Based on the 1.4 GHz\nand Halpha continuum images, the ionized emission is absent toward the IRc,\nindicating that the massive clump harbors an early phase of massive protostar\nbefore the onset of an ultracompact H II region.

In particular, a question that is crucial in\nthe context of biological cellular networks, is whether the system can keep the\nchanging components \\emph{confined} so that only nodes in their vicinity may be\naffected by the changes, but nodes sufficiently far away from any changing\ncomponent remain unaffected.\n  Based on this notion of confinement, we propose a new metric for measuring\nthe dynamic changes recovery performance in distributed network algorithms\noperating under the \\emph{Stone Age} model (Emek \\& Wattenhofer, PODC 2013),\nwhere the class of dynamic topology changes we consider includes\ninserting/deleting an edge, deleting a node together with its incident edges,\nand inserting a new isolated node. Our main technical contribution is a\ndistributed algorithm for maximal independent set (MIS) in synchronous networks\nsubject to these topology changes that performs well in terms of the\naforementioned new metric. Specifically, our algorithm guarantees that nodes\nwhich do not experience a topology change in their immediate vicinity are not\naffected and that all surviving nodes (including the affected ones) perform\n$\\mathcal{O}((C + 1) \\log^{2} n)$ computationally-meaningful steps, where $C$\nis the number of topology changes; in other words, each surviving node performs\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2} n)$ steps when amortized over the number of topology\nchanges. This is accompanied by a simple example demonstrating that the linear\ndependency on $C$ cannot be avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Galaxies with small stellar masses\nhave discs with larger $r_{\\rm reff}$ and flatter metallicity gradients than\nexpected. We detect migration albeit weaker than in previous works. Our stellar\ndiscs show a mild evolution of the stellar metallicity slopes up to $z\\sim 1,$\nwhich is well-matched by the evolution calculated archeologically from the\nabundance distributions of mono-age stellar populations at $z\\sim 0$. Overall,\nSupernova feedback could explain the trends but an impact of migration can not\nbe totally discarded. Galaxy-galaxy interactions or small satellite accretions\ncan also contribute to modify the metallicity profiles in the outer parts.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Hydrodynamical simulations that\nincorporate energetic feedback processes suggest that gas should be depleted\nfrom such low-mass halos, thus decreasing their tSZ signal relative to\nself-similar predictions.

Data from large-scale astrometric\nand spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a well-defined view of the\ncurrent chemo-kinematical structure of the Milky Way, but will only enable a\nblurred view on the temporal sequence that led to the present-day Galaxy.

It is often used to\nmake predictions either for new values of interest or missing information in\nthe original data, as well as to perform data exploratory analysis. However,\nalthough there is an extensive literature on latent feature models for\nhomogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of\nthe same (continuous or discrete) nature, there is a lack of work on latent\nfeature modeling for heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we introduce a\ngeneral Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model suitable for heterogeneous\ndatasets, where the attributes describing each object can be either discrete,\ncontinuous or mixed variables. The proposed model presents several important\nproperties. First, it accounts for heterogeneous data while keeping the\nproperties of conjugate models, which allow us to infer the model in linear\ntime with respect to the number of objects and attributes. Second, its Bayesian\nnonparametric nature allows us to automatically infer the model complexity from\nthe data, i.e., the number of features necessary to capture the latent\nstructure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are\nbinary-valued variables, easing the interpretability of the obtained latent\nfeatures in data exploratory analysis. We show the flexibility of the proposed\nmodel by solving both prediction and data analysis tasks on several real-world\ndatasets. Moreover, a software package of the GLFM is publicly available for\nother researcher to use and improve it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 06:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

The losses due to tank mixing\ndominate over the polarization-induced capacity losses that arise due to\nresistive processes in the reactor. A porous electrode model is used to\nseparate these effects by predicting the time variation of active species\nconcentration in electrodes and tanks. A simple transient model based on\nspecies conservation laws developed in this study reveals that charge\nutilization and polarization are affected by two dimensionless numbers\nquantifying (1) flow rate relative to stoichiometric flow and (2) size of flow\nbattery tanks relative to the reactor. The RFB's utilization is shown to\nincrease monotonically with flow rate, reaching 90% of the theoretical value\nonly when flow rate exceeds twenty-fold of the stoichiometric value. We also\nidentify polarization due to irreversibilities inherent to RFB architecture as\na result of tank mixing and current distribution internal to the reactor, and\nthis polarization dominates over that resulting from ohmic resistances\nparticularly when cycling RFBs at low flow rates and currents.

We studied a set of major and minor merger\nexperiments from the GalMer database that generate massive S0 remnants. We\nanalysed the location of these remnants in the photometric and stellar TFRs\nassuming that they correspond to $z\\sim0.8$ galaxies. We then estimated their\nevolution in these planes over the last 7 Gyr. The results were compared with\ndata of real S0s and spirals at different redshifts.

In the planes\ninvolving Vrot,max, a clear segregation of the S0 remnants in terms of the\nspin-orbit coupling of the model is observed, in which the remnants of\nretrograde encounters overlap with local S0s hosting counter-rotating discs.\nThe location of the S0 remnants at $z\\sim 0$ agrees well with the observed\ndistribution of local S0 galaxies in the $\\sigma_0$-$M_K$, Vcirc-$\\sigma_0$ and\nVrot,max-$\\sigma_0$ planes.

According to the standard ORAM\ndefinition presented by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, two ORAM access sequences must\nbe computationally indistinguishable if the lengths of these sequences are\nidentically distributed. An artifact of this definition is that it does not\napply to modern ORAM implementations adapted in current secure processors\ntechnology because of their arbitrary lengths of memory access sequences\ndepending on programs' behaviors (their termination times). As a result, the\nORAM definition does not directly apply; the theoretical foundations of ORAM do\nnot clearly argue about the timing and termination channels.\n  This paper conducts a first rigorous study of the standard\nGoldreich-Ostrovsky ORAM definition in view of modern practical ORAMs (e.g.,\nPath ORAM) and demonstrates the gap between theoretical foundations and real\nimplementations. A new ORAM formulation which clearly separates out termination\nchannel leakage is proposed. It is shown how this definition implies the\nstandard ORAM definition (for finite length input access sequences) and better\nfits the modern practical ORAM implementations. The proposed definition relaxes\nthe constraints around the stash size and overflow probability for Path ORAM,\nand essentially transforms its security argument into a performance\nconsideration problem.\n  Finally, a `strong' ORAM formulation which clearly includes obfuscation of\ntermination leakage is shown to imply our new ORAM formulation and applies to\nORAM for outsourced disk storage. In this strong formulation constraints are\nnot relaxed and the security argument for Path ORAM remains complex as one\nneeds to prove that the stash overflows with negligible probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 09:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 20:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

This process is essential for the\ncorrect sorting of the phononic bands and, subsequently, for the accurate\ndetermination of mode continuation, group velocities, and emergent properties\nwhich depend on them such as thermal conductivity. Through explicit phononic\ncalculations using generalized Rayleigh quotient, we identify exact locations\nof exceptional points in the complex wavenumber domain which results in level\nrepulsion in the real domain. We show that in the vicinity of the exceptional\npoint the relevant phononic eigenvalue surfaces resemble the surfaces of a 2 by\n2 parameter-dependent matrix. Along a closed loop encircling the exceptional\npoint we show that the phononic eigenvalues are exchanged, just as they are for\nthe 2 by 2 matrix case. However, the behavior of the associated eigenvectors is\nshown to be more complex in the phononic case. Along a closed loop around an\nexceptional point, we show that the eigenvectors can flip signs multiple times\nunlike a 2 by 2 matrix where the flip of sign occurs only once. Finally, we\nexploit these eigenvector sign flips around exceptional points to propose a\nsimple and efficient method of distinguishing them from normal crosses and of\ncorrectly sorting the band-structure. Our proposed method is roughly an\norder-of magnitude faster than the zoom-in method and correctly identifies >\n97% of the cases considered. Both its speed and accuracy can be further\nimproved and we suggest some ways of achieving this.

For applications to mechanical design and\nself-folding structures, it is essential to understand the interplay between\nthe set of folds in the unfolded origami and the possible 3D folded\nconfigurations. When deforming a structure that has been folded, one can often\nlinearize the geometric constraints, but the degeneracy of the unfolded state\nmakes a linear approach impossible there. We derive a theory for the\nsecond-order infinitesimal rigidity of an initially unfolded triangulated\norigami structure and use it to study the set of nearly-unfolded configurations\nof origami with four boundary vertices. We find that locally, this set consists\nof a number of distinct \"branches\" which intersect at the unfolded state, and\nthat the number of these branches is exponential in the number of vertices. We\nfind numerical and analytical evidence that suggests that the branches are\ncharacterized by choosing each internal vertex to either \"pop up\" or \"pop\ndown\". The large number of pathways along which one can fold an\ninitially-unfolded origami structure strongly indicate that a generic structure\nis likely to become trapped in a \"misfolded\" state. Thus, new techniques for\ncreating self-folding origami are likely necessary; controlling the popping\nstate of the vertices may be one possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 23:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 19:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Yet, the\ninteraction of spontaneous curvature and geometric frustration in curved shells\nremains still poorly understood. Via a combination of precision experiments on\nelastomeric spherical bilayer shells, simulations, and theory, we show a\nspontaneous curvature-induced rotational symmetry-breaking as well as a\nsnapping instability reminiscent of the Venus fly trap closure mechanism. The\ninstabilities and their dependence on geometry are rationalized by reducing the\nspontaneous curvature to an effective mechanical load. This formulation reveals\na combined pressurelike bulk term and a torquelike boundary term, allowing\nscaling predictions for the instabilities in excellent agreement with\nexperiments and simulations. Moreover, the effective pressure analogy suggests\na curvature-induced buckling in closed shells. We determine the critical\nbuckling curvature via a linear stability analysis that accounts for the\ncombination of residual membrane and bending stresses. The prominent role of\ngeometry in our findings suggests the applicability of the results over a wide\nrange of scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 02:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 16:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

It remains an active and important topic how to design a small\nnetwork while retaining the performance of large and deep CNNs (e.g., Inception\nNets, ResNets). Albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the\nsize of CNNs, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in\nmany designs. This paper addresses this concern with several new contributions.\nFirst, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep\nCNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most\nprevious work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different\ntreatments of $1\\times 1$ convolutions and $k\\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$),\nwhere we only binarize $k\\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. The\nresulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show\nthat previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be\ncompressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of\nthe different functionalities of $1\\times 1$ (data projection/transformation)\nand $k\\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block\nstructure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature\nmaps generated by $1\\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps\ngenerated by $k\\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network\nwith $\\sim 1$ million parameters. Combining with our parameter binarization, we\nachieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks\nincluding recently released Google MobileNets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 06:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Earlier studies have suggested that\nthis pattern arises from natural selection favouring asexual recruitment in\nyoung populations. Alternatively, as we show here, this pattern may result from\nstochastic processes during species-range expansions. We model a dioecious\nspecies expanding into a new area in which all individuals are capable of both\nsexual and asexual reproduction, and all individuals have equal survival rates\nand dispersal distances. Even under conditions that eventually favour sexual\nrecruitment, colonisation starts with an asexual wave. Long after colonisation\nis completed, a sexual wave erodes clonal dominance. If individuals reproduce\nmore than one season, and with only local dispersal, a few large clones\ntypically dominate for thousands of reproductive seasons. Adding occasional\nlong-distance dispersal, more dominant clones emerge, but they persist for a\nshorter period of time. The general mechanism involved is simple: edge effects\nat the expansion front favour asexual (uniparental) recruitment where potential\nmates are rare. Specifically, our stochastic model makes detailed predictions\ndifferent from a selection model, and comparing these with empirical data from\na postglacially established seaweed species (Fucus radicans) shows that in this\ncase a stochastic mechanism is strongly supported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 06:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

In this paper the restrictions on variable occurrences in SF\nsentences are relaxed such that universally and existentially quantified\nvariables may occur together in the same atom under certain conditions. Still,\nsatisfiability can be decided. This result is established in two ways: firstly,\nby an effective equivalence-preserving translation into the BSR fragment, and,\nsecondly, by a model-theoretic argument.\n  Slight modifications to the described concepts facilitate the definition of\nother decidable classes of first-order sentences. The paper presents a second\nfragment which is novel, has a decidable satisfiability problem, and properly\ncontains the Ackermann fragment and---once more---the relational monadic\nfragment.

More precisely, after certain\ntransformations, Skolemization yields only unary functions and constants, and\nevery atom contains at most one universally quantified variable.

Applying our model and algorithm to both\nsimulated and experimental data, we demonstrate an improvement in\nreconstruction quality over previous models as well as an increase in\nconvergence speed compared to existing first-order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 09:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 04:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Results showed no overall\nmultimedia effect, but instead an effect to confirm statements that were\naccompanied by graphs, irrespective of whether these statements were true or\nfalse. Eye movement and verbal data shed light on this surprising finding.\nStudents looked proportionally less at the text and the problem statement when\na graph was present.

However, the\nrelation among these is still a matter of debate for luminous infrared\ngalaxies, which carry a bulk of SFR budget of the universe at $z\\sim1$. We have\ninvestigated the relation among stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and\nSFR of AKARI-detected mid-IR galaxies at $z\\sim0.88$ in the AKARI NEP deep\nfield. We observed about 350 AKARI sources with Subaru/FMOS NIR spectrograph,\nand detected secure and expected H$\\alpha$ emission lines from 25 and 44\ngalaxies, respectively. The SFR of our sample is almost constant ($\\sim\n25M_{\\odot}/yr$) over the stellar mass range of our sample. Compared with\nmain-sequence (MS) galaxies at a similar redshift range, the average SFR of our\ndetected sample is comparable for massive galaxies\n($\\sim10^{10.58}~M_{\\odot}$), while higher by $\\sim$0.6dex for less massive\ngalaxies ($\\sim 10^{10.05}~M_{\\odot}$). We measure metallicities from the\n[NII]/H$\\alpha$ emission line ratio.\n  We find that the mass-metallicity relation of our individually measured\nsources agrees with that for optical-selected star-forming galaxies at\n$z\\sim0.1$, while metallicities of stacked spectra agree with that of MS\ngalaxies at $z\\sim0.78$. Considering high SFR of individually measured sources,\nFMR of the IR galaxies is different from that at $z\\sim0.1$. However, on the\nmass-metallicity plane, they are consistent with the MS galaxies, highlighting\nhigher SFR of the IR galaxies. This suggests the evolutionary path of our IR\ngalaxies is different from that of MS galaxies. A possible physical\ninterpretation includes that the star-formation activities of IR galaxies at\n$z\\sim0.88$ in our sample are enhanced by interaction and/or merger of\ngalaxies, but the inflow of metal-poor gas is not yet induced, keeping the\nmetallicity intact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 11:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In this\npaper, we propose a computer Go system that follows experts way of thinking and\nplaying. Our system consists of two parts. The first part is a novel deep\nalternative neural network (DANN) used to generate candidates of next move.\nCompared with existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), DANN inserts\nrecurrent layer after each convolutional layer and stacks them in an\nalternative manner. We show such setting can preserve more contexts of local\nfeatures and its evolutions which are beneficial for move prediction. The\nsecond part is a long-term evaluation (LTE) module used to provide a reliable\nevaluation of candidates rather than a single probability from move predictor.\nThis is consistent with human experts nature of playing since they can foresee\ntens of steps to give an accurate estimation of candidates. In our system, for\neach candidate, LTE calculates a cumulative reward after several future\ninteractions when local variations are settled. Combining criteria from the two\nparts, our system determines the optimal choice of next move.

We complement our theoretical results with empirical\nstudies on semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating its advantage over several\npopular methods in recovering the ground-truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 14:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Kashiwara, 1970). Among the new results obtained,\nwe may quote: 1) In dimension 4 only, the 9 Bianchi identities that must be\nsatisfied by the 10 components of the Weyl tensor are described by a second\norder operator and have thus nothing to do with the 20 first order Bianchi\nidentities for the 20 components of the Riemann tensor. This result, not known\nafter one century, has been recently confirmed by A. Quadrat (INRIA) using new\ncomputer algebra packages. 2) The Ricci tensor R is a section of the Ricci\nbundle of symmetric covariant 2-tensors which is the kernel of the canonical\nprojection of the Riemann bundle onto the Weyl bundle, induced by the canonical\ninclusion of the classical Killing system (Poincare group) into the conformal\nKilling system (Conformal group). It has only to do with the second order jets\n(elations) of the conformal Killing system because any 1-form with value in the\nbundle of elations can be decomposed in the direct sum (R,F) where the\nelectromagnetic field F is a section of the vector bundle of skewsymmetric\ncovariant 2-tensors. It follows therefore that electromagnetism and gravitation\nhave only to do with second order jets. 3) The 10 linearized second order\nEinstein equations are parametrizing the 4 first order Cauchy stress equations\nbut cannot be parametrized themselves. As a byproduct of this negative result,\nthese 4 Cauchy stress equations have nothing to do with the 4 divergence-type\nequations usually obtained from the 20 Bianchi identities by contraction of\nindices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 14:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Since existing AUVs have limited battery capacity and\nrestricted endurance, they should autonomously manage mission time and the\nresources to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. Task\nassignment requires making decisions subject to resource constraints, while\ntasks are assigned with costs and/or values that are budgeted in advance. Tasks\nare distributed in a particular operation zone and mapped by a waypoint covered\nnetwork. Thus, design an efficient routing-task priority assign framework\nconsidering vehicle's availabilities and properties is essential for increasing\nmission productivity and on-time mission completion. This depends strongly on\nthe order and priority of the tasks that are located between node-like\nwaypoints in an operation network. On the other hand, autonomous operation of\nAUVs in an unfamiliar dynamic underwater and performing quick response to\nsudden environmental changes is a complicated process. Water current\ninstabilities can deflect the vehicle to an undesired direction and perturb\nAUVs safety. The vehicle's robustness to strong environmental variations is\nextremely crucial for its safe and optimum operations in an uncertain and\ndynamic environment. To this end, the AUV needs to have a general overview of\nthe environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task\nselection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in\ndealing with continuously changing situations. This research deals with\ndeveloping a novel reactive control architecture to provide a higher level of\ndecision autonomy for the AUV operation that enables a single vehicle to\naccomplish multiple tasks in a single mission in the face of periodic\ndisturbances in a turbulent and highly uncertain environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 00:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

Unfortunately, this is not always\npossible, mainly because of two reasons: (i) the model is still under\ndevelopment and (ii) the correctness of implementation of some modules is not\nestablished. In such circumstances, is it still possible to get correct answers\nfor some model checking queries?\n  This paper is a step towards answering this question. We formulate this\nproblem for the Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) modeling formalism and the\nProbabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) query language. We then propose a\nsimple solution by modifying DTMC and PCTL to accommodate three valued logic.\nThe technique builds on existing model checking algorithms and tools, obviating\nthe need for new ones to account for three valued logic.\n  One of the most useful and popular techniques for modeling complex systems is\nthrough discrete event simulation. Discrete event simulators are essentially\ncode in some programming language. We show an application of our approach on a\npiece of code that contains a module of unknown correctness.\n  A preliminary version of this paper appears in the proceedings of Leveraging\nApplications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation: Foundational\nTechniques (ISoLA 2016), LNCS 9952, Springer.\n  Keywords: Probabilistic models, Probabilistic Model checking Three-valued\nLogic, Discrete Time Markov Chain, Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

When fitness\nevaluations are corrupted by noise, as happens in many real-world problems as a\nconsequence of various types of uncertainty, a strategy is needed in order to\ncope with this. Resampling is one of the most common strategies, whereby each\nsolution is evaluated many times in order to reduce the variance of the fitness\nestimates. When evaluating the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm, a\nkey consideration is the stopping condition for the algorithm. A frequently\nused stopping condition in runtime analysis, known as \"First Hitting Time\", is\nto stop the algorithm as soon as it encounters the optimal solution. However,\nthis is unrealistic for real-world problems, as if the optimal solution were\nalready known, there would be no need to search for it. This paper argues that\nthe use of First Hitting Time, despite being a commonly used approach, is\nsignificantly flawed and overestimates the quality of many algorithms in\nreal-world cases, where the optimum is not known in advance and has to be\ngenuinely searched for. A better alternative is to measure the quality of the\nsolution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus\non final solution quality. This paper argues that focussing on final solution\nquality is more realistic and demonstrates cases where the results produced by\neach algorithm evaluation method lead to very different conclusions regarding\nthe quality of each noisy optimisation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 09:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 11:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

However, lossy compressor developers and\nusers are missing a tool to explore the features of scientific datasets and\nunderstand the data alteration after compression in a systematic and reliable\nway. To address this gap, we have designed and implemented a generic framework\ncalled Z-checker. On the one hand, Z-checker combines a battery of data\nanalysis components for data compression.
