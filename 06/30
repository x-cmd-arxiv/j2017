Acceptor wave functions\nare taken to be approximately hydrogenic and the standard hydrogen molecule\nHeitler-London model is used to describe acceptor-acceptor interactions. But\ndue to valence band degeneracy and spin-orbit coupling, acceptor states can be\nfar more complex than those of hydrogen atoms, which brings into question the\nvalidity of this approximation. To address this issue, we develop an\nacceptor-acceptor Heitler-London model using single-acceptor wave functions of\nthe form proposed by Baldereschi and Lipari, which more accurately capture the\nphysics of the acceptor states.

The\nmain purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a\nset of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of\n\"rational trust modeling\" is introduced by bridging trust management and game\ntheory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory\n(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been\nutilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty\nof our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust\nmodel assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are\nrational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy\nbased on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are\nincentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of\ntrust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and\nsolution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be\nbuilt-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of\nrational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will\nresult in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model\ncan incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper\nparameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish\nplayers in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).\nFurthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known\nattacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict\nbehavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 17:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The iterative method hinges on the complex\nfactorization of the sum of two matrices and the solution path resides in the\ncomplex domain (instead of the real domain). Compared to the Gauss-Seidel\nmethod, the complex factorization converges almost instantaneously and its\nerror is several magnitude smaller than that of the Gauss-Seidel method.

Scientists wanting to use EAGLE may\nfind it useful to first investigate whether their analysis can be performed\nusing the database, before accessing the particle data. The particles in the\nsnapshot files are indexed by a peano-hilbert key. This allows for an eased\nextraction of simply connected spatial volumes, without needing to read the\nentire snapshot. This makes it possible to analyse many aspects of galaxies\nusing modest computing resources, even when using EAGLE simulations with large\nnumbers of particles. A reading routine is provided to simplify this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

Two\ncomponents are often necessary to accurately fit the Spectral Line Energy\nDistributions (SLEDs); a one-component fit often underestimates the flux of CO\nJ = 1-0 and the mass. If low-J lines are not included, mass is underestimated\nby an order of magnitude. Even when modeling the low-J lines alone or using an\n$\\alpha_{CO}$ conversion factor, the mass should be considered to be uncertain\nto a factor of at least 0.4 dex, and the vast majority of the CO luminosity\nwill be missed (median, 65%).

MMC is a converter system with a typical\nmulti-frequency response due to its significant harmonics in the arm currents,\ncapacitor voltages, and control signals. These internal harmonic dynamics can\nhave a great influence on the operation characteristics of MMC. However, the\nconventional modeling methods commonly used in two-level voltage-source\nconverters (VSCs), where only the fundamental-frequency dynamic is considered,\nwill lead to an inaccurate model that cannot accurately reflect the real\ndynamic characteristics of MMC. Therefore, the HSS modeling method, in which\nharmonics of state variables, inputs, and outputs are posed separately in a\nstate-space form, is introduced in this paper to model the MMC in order to\ncapture all the harmonics and the frequency couplings.

To do this, we calculate the normal\nand tangential tractions along the membrane using the known material properties\nof the membrane along with its shape.

The\nmost notable spectral feature in the FUV continuum of some CTTSs is a broad\nemission approximately centered at 1600~\\AA, which has been referred to as the\n\"1600 A Bump\". The origin of this feature remains unclear. We have assembled\narchival FUV spectra of 37 disk-hosting systems observed by the {\\it Hubble\nSpace Telescope}. Clear 1600 A Bump emission is observed above the smooth,\nunderlying 1100-1800 A continuum spectrum in 19/37 Classical T Tauri disks in\nthe HST sample, with the detection rate in transition disks (8/8) being much\nhigher than in primordial or non-transition sources (11/29).

We demonstrate\nthat non-thermally populated H2O fragments can qualitatively account for the\nobserved emission (discrete and continuum), and find that the average\nLy-a-driven H2O dissociation rate is 1.7x 10^{42} water molecules s^{-1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 20:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Memory access patterns, memory\nbandwidth requirements and on-chip network communications in these applications\ndo not fit in the conventional program execution flow. In this work, we propose\nand design a new architecture for fast processing of large graph applications.\nTo leverage the lack of the spatial and temporal localities in these\napplications and to support scalable computational models, we design the\narchitecture around two key concepts. (1) The architecture is a multicore\nprocessor of independently clocked processing elements. These elements\ncommunicate in a self-timed manner and use handshaking to perform\nsynchronization, communication, and sequencing of operations. By being\nasynchronous, the operating speed at each processing element is determined by\nactual local latencies rather than global worst-case latencies. We create a\nspecialized ISA to support these operations. (2) The application compilation\nand mapping process uses a graph clustering algorithm to optimize parallel\ncomputing of graph operations and load balancing. Through the clustering\nprocess, we make scalability an inherent property of the architecture where\ntask-to-element mapping can be done at the graph node level or at node cluster\nlevel. A prototyped version of the architecture outperforms a comparable CPU by\n10~20x across all benchmarks and provides 2~5x better power efficiency when\ncompared to a GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 21:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

D\\\"urr et al. recently presented a $2$-pass algorithm called\nCategory-Advice that achieves approximation ratio $3/5$. We extend their\nalgorithm to multiple passes.

This algorithm is an online version of a well-known and\nextensively studied offline algorithm MinGreedy. We show that MinDegree cannot\nachieve an approximation ratio better than $1-1/e$, which is guaranteed by any\nconsistent greedy algorithm in the known IID model.\n  Finally, following the work in Besser and Poloczek, we depart from an\nadversarial or stochastic ordering and investigate a natural randomized\nalgorithm (MinRanking) in the priority model. Although the priority model\nallows the algorithm to choose the input ordering in a general but well defined\nway, this natural algorithm cannot obtain the approximation of the Ranking\nalgorithm in the ROM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

The resonance is the heaviest state in the dark matter flavor\nmultiplet and the required mass relation is protected by the vacuum structure\nand supersymmetry from radiative corrections.

The presence of liquid, such as\nwater on Earth or methane on Titan, may affect the threshold values to a great\nextent. Sediment density is also crucial for determining threshold values. Here\nwe provide quantitative data on density and water content of common wind tunnel\nmaterials that have been used to study conditions on Earth, Titan, Mars, and\nVenus. The measured density values for low density materials are higher\ncompared to literature values, whereas for the high density materials, there is\nno such discrepancy. We also find that low density materials have much higher\nwater content and longer atmospheric equilibration timescales compared to high\ndensity sediments. In the Titan Wind Tunnel, we performed threshold experiments\nwith the standard walnut shells (125-150 \\mu m, 7.2% water by mass) and dried\nwalnut shells (1.7% water by mass). The threshold results for the two scenarios\nare almost the same, which indicates that humidity had a negligible effect on\nthreshold for walnut shells in this experimental regime. When the water content\nis lower than 11.0%, the interparticle forces are dominated by adsorption\nforces, whereas at higher values the interparticle forces are dominated by much\nlarger capillary forces. For materials with low equilibrium water content, like\nquartz sand, capillary forces dominate. When the interparticle forces are\ndominated by adsorption forces, the threshold does not increase with increasing\nrelative humidity (RH). Only when the interparticle forces are dominated by\ncapillary forces does the threshold start to increase with increasing RH/water\ncontent. Since tholins have a low methane content (0.3% at saturation, Curtis\net al., 2008), we believe tholins would behave similarly to quartz sand when\nsubjected to methane moisture.

By independently assessing the results\nfrom each algorithm, and computing ensemble averages of multiple algorithms,\nthe results allow a quantification of key flow properties as well as the\nuncertainty due to differing numerical approaches. A new analytical model\npredicting the initial layer growth for a multimode narrowband perturbation is\npresented, along with two models for the linear and non-linear regime combined.\nOverall, the growth rate exponent is determined as $\\theta=0.292 \\pm 0.009$, in\ngood agreement with prior studies; however, the exponent is decaying slowly in\ntime. $\\theta$ is shown to be relatively insensitive to the choice of mixing\nlayer width measurement.

To cope with\nthe uncertainties and variability of DRE, a stochastic day-ahead dynamic\noptimal power flow (DOPF) and its algorithm are proposed. The overall economy\nis achieved by fully considering the DRE, BES, electricity purchasing and\nactive power losses. The rainflow algorithm-based cycle counting method of BES\nis incorporated in the DOPF model to capture the cell degradation, greatly\nextending the expected BES lifetime and achieving a better economy.

However, model selection for PS estimation\nin high-dimensional data has received little attention. In these settings, PS\nmodels have traditionally been selected based on the goodness-of-fit for the\ntreatment mechanism itself, without consideration of the causal parameter of\ninterest. Collaborative minimum loss-based estimation (C-TMLE) is a novel\nmethodology for causal inference that takes into account information on the\ncausal parameter of interest when selecting a PS model. This \"collaborative\nlearning\" considers variable associations with both treatment and outcome when\nselecting a PS model in order to minimize a bias-variance trade off in the\nestimated treatment effect. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for\ncollaborative model selection when using the LASSO estimator for PS estimation\nin high-dimensional covariate settings. To demonstrate the importance of\nselecting the PS model collaboratively, we designed quasi-experiments based on\na real electronic healthcare database, where only the potential outcomes were\nmanually generated, and the treatment and baseline covariates remained\nunchanged. Results showed that the C-TMLE algorithm outperformed other\ncompeting estimators for both point estimation and confidence interval\ncoverage. In addition, the PS model selected by C-TMLE could be applied to\nother PS-based estimators, which also resulted in substantive improvement for\nboth point estimation and confidence interval coverage.

While\nseveral studies have applied social network data to activity and mobility\nanalysis, a comparison with travel diaries and general statistics has been\nlacking.

By combining\nthis data, population statistics and travel diaries and applying clustering\ntechniques, we addressed detection of activity locations, as well as spatial\nseparation and transitions between these locations. Kernel density estimation\nperforms best to detect activity locations due to the scattered nature of the\ntwitter data; more activity locations are detected per user than reported in\nthe travel survey. The descriptive analysis shows that determining home\nlocations is more difficult than detecting work locations for most planning\nzones. Spatial separations between detected activity locations from Twitter\ndata - as reported in a travel survey and captured by public transport smart\ncard data - are mostly similarly distributed, but also show relevant\ndifferences for very short and very long distances.

The final decay of the bands at Rg points to the relevance of\ndirected percolation and criticality in the sense of statistical-physics phase\ntransitions. The nature of the transition at Rt where bands form is still\nsomewhat mysterious and does not easily fit the scheme holding for\npattern-forming instabilities at increasing control parameter on a laminar\nbackground. In contrast, the bands arise at Rt out of a uniform turbulent\nbackground at a decreasing control parameter. Ingredients of a possible theory\nof laminar-turbulent patterning are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 09:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

This process can develop\nwith different intensities both in space and time, making the interpretation of\ncompositional patterns in igneous rocks a petrological challenge. As a\ntime-dependent process, magma mixing has been suggested to preserve information\nabout the time elapsed between the injection of a new magma into sub-volcanic\nmagma chambers and eruptions. This allowed the use of magma mixing as an\nadditional volcanological tool to infer the mixing-to-eruption timescales. In\nspite of the potential of magma mixing processes to provide information about\nthe timing of volcanic eruptions its statistical robustness is not yet\nestablished. This represents a prerequisite to apply reliably this conceptual\nmodel. Here, new chaotic magma mixing experiments were performed at different\ntimes using natural melts. The degree of reproducibility of experimental\nresults was tested repeating one experiment at the same starting conditions and\ncomparing the compositional variability.

The consistency bias is defined as the distance (possibly\nzero) between the orbit of the template and the orbit of one element which\nminimizes the variance.

Our study reveals that (a)\npostpaid customers are more active in terms of service usage and (b) there are\nstrong structural correlations in the mobile phone call network as connections\nbetween customers of the same subscription type are much more frequent than\nthose between customers of different subscription types. Based on these\nobservations we provide methods to detect the subscription type of customers by\nusing information about their personal call statistics, and also their\negocentric networks simultaneously. The key of our first approach is to cast\nthis classification problem as a problem of graph labelling, which can be\nsolved by max-flow min-cut algorithms. Our experiments show that, by using both\nuser attributes and relationships, the proposed graph labelling approach is\nable to achieve a classification accuracy of $\\sim 87\\%$, which outperforms by\n$\\sim 7\\%$ supervised learning methods using only user attributes. In our\nsecond problem we aim to infer the subscription type of customers of external\noperators. We propose via approximate methods to solve this problem by using\nnode attributes, and a two-ways indirect inference method based on observed\nhomophilic structural correlations. Our results have straightforward\napplications in behavioural prediction and personal marketing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 12:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

Here\nwe argue that they also offer a natural framework to understand stationary\ndistributions of generic driven non-equilibrium systems that are composed of a\ndriving and a relaxing process. We show that the statistics of driven\nnon-equilibrium systems can be derived from the understanding of the nature of\nthe underlying driving process. For constant driving rates exact power-laws\nemerge with exponents that are related to the driving rate. If driving rates\nbecome state-dependent, or if they vary across the life-span of the process,\nthe functional form of the state-dependence determines the statistics. Constant\ndriving rates lead to exact power-laws, a linear state-dependence function\nyields exponential or Gamma distributions, a quadratic function gives the\nnormal distribution. Logarithmic and power-law state dependence leads to\nlog-normal and stretched exponential distribution functions, respectively.

We formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming problem in which the weighted difference of\nnetwork throughput and total power consumption is maximized, subject to the\npredefined DDR requirements and the maximum transmit power at each eRRH. To\naddress this challenging problem, we first apply the l0-norm approximation and\nl1-norm minimization techniques to deal with the UA. After this key step, we\narrive at an approximated problem that only involves the joint optimization of\nDDR and precoding. By using the alternating descent method, we further\ndecompose this problem into a convex subproblem for DDR allocation and a\nnonconvex subproblem for precoding design. While the former is globally solved\nby the interior-point method, the latter is solved by a specifically tailored\nsuccessive convex quadratic programming method. Finally, we propose an\niterative algorithm for the original joint optimization that is guaranteed to\nconverge. Importantly, each iteration of the developed algorithm only involves\nsolving simple convex problems. Numerical examples demonstrate that the\nproposed design significantly improves both throughput and power performances,\nespecially in practical F-RANs with limited fronthaul capacity.

However,\ntuning magnetic proper-ties in these materials is yet to be addressed. Here, we\nfound a striped antiferromag-netic (sAFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition\nundergoing from monolayer to bilayer and thicker CrS2. This transition is\nattributed to charge sharing of interlayer S atoms and its resulting charge\ntransfer from Cr d eg to t2g orbitals. The transferred charge reduces a portion\nof Cr4+ to Cr3+, which enhances the double-exchange mechanism favoring FM\nrather than sAFM ordering. Doping of electrons shares the same effect with\nstacking induced charge sharing.

In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a\ncontext-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart\ndevices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and\ncreating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of\nsensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection\nmechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT) to detect malicious\nbehavior associated with sensors.

The algorithm provides an\napproximation of the set of solutions associated with a possibly large number\nof instances of the parameters, with a computational complexity which can be\norders of magnitude lower than when using the same Newton-like solver for all\ninstances of the parameters. The reduction of complexity requires efficient\nstrategies for obtaining low-rank approximations of the residual, of the\npreconditioner, and of the increment at each iteration of the algorithm. For\nthe approximation of the residual and the preconditioner, weakly intrusive\nvariants of the empirical interpolation method are introduced, which require\nevaluations of entries of the residual and the preconditioner.

We propose an extension to existing RNN approaches that\ncaptures user dwell time in addition to the visited items and show that\nrecommendation performance can be improved. Additionally, we investigate the\nusefulness of a single validation split for model selection in the case of\nminor improvements and find that in our case the best model is not selected and\na fold-like study with different validation sets is necessary to ensure the\nselection of the best model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 14:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

This article briefly reviews development of Nb3Sn\nsuperconductor and proposes prospects for further improvement. It is shown that\nsignificant improvement of critical current density (Jc) is needed for future\naccelerator magnets. After a brief review of the development of Nb3Sn\nsuperconductors, the factors controlling Jc are summarized and correlated with\ntheir microstructure and chemistry. The non-matrix Jc of Nb3Sn conductors is\nmainly determined by three factors: the fraction of current-carrying Nb3Sn\nphase in the non-matrix area, the upper critical field Bc2, and the flux-line\npinning capacity. Then prospects to improve the three factors are discussed\nrespectively. An analytic model was developed to show how the ratios of\nprecursors determine the phase fractions after heat treatment, based on which\nit is predicted that the limit of current-carrying Nb3Sn fraction in\nsubelements is ~65%. Then, since Bc2 is largely determined by the Nb3Sn\nstoichiometry, a thermodynamic/kinetic theory was presented to show what\nessentially determines the Sn content of Nb3Sn conductors. This theory explains\nthe influences of Sn sources and Ti addition on stoichiometry and growth rate\nof Nb3Sn layers. Next, to improve flux pinning, previous efforts in this\ncommunity to introduce additional pinning centers (APC) to Nb3Sn wires are\nreviewed, and an internal oxidation technique is described. Finally, prospects\nfor further improvement of non-matrix Jc of Nb3Sn conductors are discussed, and\nit is seen that the only opportunity for further significantly improving Jc\nlies in improving the flux pinning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest\nthat DNA-bound ParB proteins can interact with each other to condense into a\ncoherent 3D complex on the DNA. However, the structural organization of this\nprotein-DNA complex remains unclear, and a predictive quantitative theory for\nthe distribution of ParB proteins on DNA is lacking. Here, we propose the\nLooping and Clustering (LC) model, which employs a statistical physics approach\nto describe protein-DNA complexes. The LC model accounts for the extrusion of\nDNA loops from a cluster of interacting DNA-bound proteins. Conceptually, the\nstructure of the protein-DNA complex is determined by a competition between\nattractive protein interactions and the configurational and loop entropy of\nthis protein-DNA cluster. Indeed, we show that the protein interaction strength\ndetermines the \"tightness\" of the loopy protein-DNA complex. With this approach\nwe consider the genomic organization of such a protein-DNA cluster around a\nsingle high-affinity binding site. Thus, our model provides a theoretical\nframework to quantitatively compute the binding profiles of ParB-like proteins\naround a cognate (parS) binding site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 12:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Since\nthese applications are often limited by memory bandwidth rather than\ncomputational resources they can benefit greatly from any optimizations which\ndecrease the run time of their loops by improving data reuse and thus reducing\nthe total memory traffic. Some of the most effective of these optimizations are\nnot suitable for development by hand or require advanced software engineering\nknowledge which is beyond the level of many researchers who are not specialists\nin code optimization. Several tools exist to automate the generation of\nhigh-performance code for numerical methods, such as Devito which produces code\nfor finite-difference approximations typically used in the seismic imaging\ndomain. We present a loop-tiling optimization which can be applied to\nDevito-generated loops and improves run time by up to 27.5%, and options for\nautomating this optimization in the Devito framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 14:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

In this study, we explored the mechanisms of Xenopus\nlaevis embryonic cell cycle by quantifying the underlying landscape and flux.\nWe uncovered the irregular Mexican hat landscape of the Xenopus laevis\nembryonic cell cycle with several local basins and barriers on the oscillation\npath. The local basins characterize the different phases of Xenopus laevis\nembryonic cell cycle and the local barriers represent the checkpoints. The\ncheckpoint mechanism of cell cycle is revealed by the landscape basins and\nbarriers. While landscape shape determines the stabilities of the states on the\noscillation path, the curl flux force determines the stability of the cell\ncycle flow. Replication is fundamental for biology of living. From our\nquantitative study here, we see that replication can not proceed without energy\ninput. In fact, the curl flux originated from energy or nutrition supply\ndetermines the speed of the cell cycle and guarantees the progression. Speed of\ncell cycle is a hallmark of cancer. Through landscape and flux analysis, one\ncan identify the key elements for controlling the speed. This can help to\ndesign effective strategy for drug discovery against cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 09:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Cumulative studies demonstrate that the mature miRNAs as well as\ntheir precursors can be targeted by small molecular drugs. At the same time,\nhuman diseases result from the disordered interplay of tissue- and cell\nlineage-specific processes. However, few computational researches predict\ndrug-disease potential relationships based on miRNA data and tissue\nspecificity. Therefore, based on miRNA data and the tissue specificity of\ndiseases, we propose a new method named as miTS to predict the potential\ntreatments for diseases. Firstly, based on miRNAs data, target genes and\ninformation of FDA approved drugs, we evaluate the relationships between miRNAs\nand drugs in the tissue-specific PPI network. Then, we construct a tripartite\nnetwork: drug-miRNA-disease Finally, we obtain the potential drug-disease\nassociations based on the tripartite network. In this paper, we take breast\ncancer as case study and focus on the top-30 predicted drugs. 25 of them\n(83.3%) are found having known connections with breast cancer in CTD benchmark\nand the other 5 drugs are potential drugs for breast cancer. We further\nevaluate the 5 newly predicted drugs from clinical records, literature mining,\nKEGG pathways enrichment analysis and overlapping genes between enriched\npathways. For each of the 5 new drugs, strongly supported evidences can be\nfound in three or more aspects. In particular, Regorafenib has 15 overlapping\nKEGG pathways with breast cancer and their p-values are all very small. In\naddition, whether in the literature curation or clinical validation,\nRegorafenib has a strong correlation with breast cancer. All the facts show\nthat Regorafenib is likely to be a truly effective drug, worthy of our further\nstudy. It further follows that our method miTS is effective and practical for\npredicting new drug indications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 09:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-07"}
