For both space and ground observations, wavefront control\nperformance is ultimately limited by the finite amount of starlight available\nfor sensing, so wavefront measurements must be as efficient as possible. To\nmeet this challenge, we propose to sense residual errors using bright\nfocal-plane speckles at wavelengths outside the high contrast spectral\nbandwidth. We show that a linear relationship exists between the intensity of\nthe bright out-of-band speckles and residual wavefront aberrations. An\nefficient linear control loop can exploit this relationship. The proposed\nscheme, referred to as Spectral Linear Dark Field Control (spectral LDFC), is\nmore sensitive than conventional approaches for ultra-high contrast imaging.\nSpectral LDFC is closely related to, and can be combined with, the recently\nproposed spatial LDFC which uses light at the observation wavelength but\nlocated outside of the high contrast area in the focal plane image. Both LDFC\ntechniques do not require starlight to be mixed with the high contrast speckle\nfield, so full-sensitivity uninterrupted high contrast observations can be\nconducted simultaneously with wavefront correction iterations. We also show\nthat LDFC is robust against deformable mirror calibration errors and drifts, as\nit relies on detector response stability instead of deformable mirror\nstability. LDFC is particularly advantageous when science acquisition is\nperformed at a non-optimal wavefront sensing wavelength, such as nearIR\nobservations of planets around solar-type stars, for which visible-light\nspeckle sensing is ideal. We describe the approach at a fundamental level and\nprovide an algorithm for its implementation. We demonstrate, through numerical\nsimulation, that spectral LDFC is well-suited for picometer-level cophasing of\na large segmented space telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 16:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

Such variation renders a critical assumption behind\nthe traditional procedure of flat fielding--that a sensor's pixels comprise a\nuniform grid--invalid. In this work, we present a method to infer a curl-free\nmodel of a sensor's underlying pixel grid from flat field images, incorporating\nthe superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects--both known and\nunknown--present in flat field data.

Here we describe how measurements of\nthe Sun's oscillation eigenfunctions might be used to measure the Sun's\ninterior B-field. The B-field induces mode-mode couplings, causing the angular\npatterns of the eigenfunctions to differ from simple Y_{lm}'s We concentrate on\nthe magnetic coupling between modes with the same (n,l) values and different\nbut nearby $m$-values, since these non-axisymmetric couplings clearly cannot be\ndue to the Sun's axisymmetric rotation and since for these cases, mode mixing\nis enhanced by the near-degeneracy of the mode frequencies. We analyze\nmagnetically-induced mode mixing in two stages of increasing complexity: first\nneglecting mode damping, and then incorporating realistic damping rates. We\nintroduce a novel detection statistic that tests for the presence of\nnon-axisymmetric mode-mixing in Solar Doppler data. We show that our detection\nstatistic is naturally robust against spatial aliasing. We estimate our\nstatistic's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the mode-mixing\namplitude. While B-induced mode-mixing is probably not detectable in a single\nmode pair, we argue that the phase of the B-induced mixing should be\napproximately the same across a wide range of modes. The total SNR then grows\nroughly as Np^{1/2}, where Np is the number of mode pairs.

In the context of searches\nfor heavy long-lived particles (LLP) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we\nquantitatively demonstrate, using a few benchmark models, that objects which\nemerge from a secondary vertex due to the decay of an LLP at the TeV scale can\nbe at large angular separations with respect to the direction of the parent\nLLP. A fraction of the decay products, the backward moving objects\n(\\textit{BMO}s), can even go in the backward direction. These will give rise to\nstriking signatures in the detectors at the LHC as these particles will\ntraverse different layers of the detector {\\it outside-in} towards the\ndirection of the beam-pipe. Based on a simple geometrical modelling of the\ndetector, we give examples of how this effect translates into the fraction of\nenergy deposited in the tracker, from particles coming as far as from the\nhadron calorimeter, as well as those that could be entering from outside the\ndetector into the muon chamber. The largest effect is from LLP candidates that\ncome to rest inside the detector, such as the stopped $R$-hadrons. But the\nresults are promising even in the case of not so heavy LLPs and/or when some of\nthe available energy is carried by a massive invisible daughter. This urges us\nto look more in details at these unusual signatures, taking into account the\nparticularities of each layer that constitutes the detector.

We use\nLOFAR imaging spectroscopy between 30-80 MHz of low-frequency U-bursts and\nJ-bursts, for the first time, to understand why electron beams travelling along\ncoronal loops produce radio emission less often. The different radio source\npositions were used to model the spatial structure of the guiding magnetic flux\ntube and then deduce the energy range of the exciting electron beams without\nthe assumption of a standard density model. The radio sources infer a magnetic\nloop 1 solar radius in altitude, with the highest frequency sources starting\naround 0.6 solar radii.

The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar\nmass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the\ndense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII\nregions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases\ndramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized\nregion breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the\nradio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial\nmodel, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to\n100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a\nfactor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase\nfrom the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of\n0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free\nflux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in\nthe accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker\nfree-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude\nduring such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since\ninternal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH\ncontraction starts.

In our model, the HTCs appear to be an\nextension of the population of returning Oort-cloud comets (OCCs) to shorter\norbital periods. The inclination distribution of model HTCs becomes broader\nwith increasing Np, but the existing observational data are not good enough to\nconstrain Np from orbital fits. Np(2.5)>1000 is required to obtain a\nsteady-state population of large active HTCs that is consistent with\nobservations. To fit the ratio of the returning-to-new OCCs, by contrast, our\nmodel implies that Np(2.5)<10, possibly because the detected long-period comets\nare smaller and much easier to disrupt than observed HTCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 18:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

However, distributing entanglement with high-quality via fiber optic\nroutes could be challenging due to the various decoherence mechanisms in\nfibers. In particular, one of the primary polarization decoherence mechanisms\nin optical fibers is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which is the\ndistortion of optical pulses by randomly varying birefringences in the system.\nTo mitigate the effect of decoherence in entangled particles, quantum\nentanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been proposed. One particular\nclass, the recurrence QED algorithms, stands out because it has relatively\nrelaxed requirements on both the size of the quantum circuits involved and on\nthe initial quality of entanglement in particles. However, because the number\nof particles required grows exponentially with the number of rounds of\ndistillation, an efficient recurrence algorithm needs to converge quickly. We\npresent a recurrence QED algorithm designed for photonic qubit pairs affected\nby PMD-degraded channels. Our proposed algorithm achieves the optimal fidelity\nas well as the optimal success probability (conditional on the optimal fidelity\nbeing achieved) in every round of distillation. The attainment of optimal\nfidelity improves the convergence speed of fidelity with respect to the rounds\nof distillation from linear to quadratic, and hence significantly reduces the\nnumber of distillation rounds. Combined with the fact that the optimal success\nprobability is achieved, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient method to\ndistribute entangled states with high fidelity via optic fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 19:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 02:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 16:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 18:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Beyond the tricritical Ising point, in\nthe strong-coupling regime, the quantum phase transition becomes first order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 20:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

By feeding\nthis information to the original RNN, it is able to improve its\nrecommendations. Our experiments on two different datasets show that the\nproposed approach can significantly improve recommendations throughout the\nsessions, compared to a single RNN working only on the current session.

This observation provides direct experimental evidence on\nthe existence of upward propagating self-similar pressure fields during the\ninitial impact of liquid drops at high Re. When viscous forces gradually set in\nwith decreasing Re, we analyse the early-time scaling of the impact force of\nviscous drops using a perturbation method.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to $U(1)$\nfields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the\n$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide\nnontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to\nthe energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

HourGlass is a time-based cache coherence protocol for\ndual-critical multi-core systems that ensures worst-case latency (WCL) bounds\nfor memory requests originating from critical cores. Although HourGlass does\nnot provide either WCL or bandwidth guarantees for memory requests from\nnon-critical cores, it promotes the use of timers to improve its bandwidth\nutilization while still maintaining WCL bounds for critical cores. This\nencourages a trade-off between the WCL bounds for critical cores, and the\nimproved memory bandwidth for non-critical cores via timer configurations. We\nevaluate HourGlass using gem5, and with multithreaded benchmark suites\nincluding SPLASH-2, and synthetic workloads. Our results show that the WCL for\ncritical cores with HourGlass is always within the analytical WCL bounds, and\nprovides a tighter WCL bound on critical cores compared to the state-of-the-art\nreal-time cache coherence protocol. Further, we show that HourGlass enables a\ntrade-off between provable WCL bounds for critical cores, and improved\nbandwidth utilization for non-critical cores.

This observation motivates the trend that DG methods with\nRiemann solvers are used without an explicit LES model added. Due to\nunder-resolution of vortical dominated structures typical for LES type setups,\nelement based high order methods suffer from stability issues caused by\naliasing errors of the non-linear flux terms. A very common strategy to fight\nthese aliasing issues (and instabilities) is so-called polynomial de-aliasing,\nwhere interpolation is exchanged with projection based on an increased number\nof quadrature points. In this paper, we start with this common no-model or\nimplicit LES (iLES) DG approach with polynomial de-aliasing and Riemann solver\ndissipation and review its capabilities and limitations. We find that the\nstrategy gives excellent results, but only when the resolution is such, that\nabout 40\\% of the dissipation is resolved. For more realistic, coarser\nresolutions used in classical LES e.g. of industrial applications, the iLES DG\nstrategy becomes quite in-accurate. The core of this work is a novel LES\nstrategy based on split form DG methods that are kinetic energy preserving.\nSuch discretisations offer excellent stability with full control over the\namount and shape of the added artificial dissipation. This premise is the main\nidea of the work and we will assess the LES capabilities of the novel split\nform DG approach. We will demonstrate that the novel DG LES strategy offers\nsimilar accuracy as the iLES methodology for well resolved cases, but strongly\nincreases fidelity in case of more realistic coarse resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 08:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In standard irradiated evolution models of hot Jupiters,\npredicted transit radii are too small. Previous studies have shown that deeper\nheating -- at a small fraction of the heating rate from irradiation -- can\nexplain observed radii. Here we present a suite of evolution models for HD\n209458b where we systematically vary both the depth and intensity of internal\nheating, without specifying the uncertain heating mechanism(s). Our models\nstart with a hot, high entropy planet whose radius decreases as the convective\ninterior cools. The applied heating suppresses this cooling. We find that very\nshallow heating -- at pressures of $1 - 10 \\ \\mathrm{bars}$ -- does not\nsignificantly suppress cooling, unless the total heating rate is $\\gtrsim 10\\%$\nof the incident stellar power. Deeper heating, at $100 \\ \\mathrm{bars}$,\nrequires heating at only $1\\%$ of the stellar irradiation to explain the\nobserved transit radius of $1.4 R_{\\rm Jup}$ after 5 Gyr of cooling. In\ngeneral, more intense and deeper heating results in larger hot Jupiter radii.\nSurprisingly, we find that heat deposited at $10^4 \\ \\mathrm{bars}$ -- which is\nexterior to $\\approx 99\\%$ of the planet's mass -- suppresses planetary cooling\nas effectively as heating at the center. In summary, we find that relatively\nshallow heating is required to explain the radii of most hot Jupiters, provided\nthat this heat is applied early and persists throughout their evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 09:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Then, we apply this method to the dual\nproblem and show, how to reconstruct an approximate solution to the primal\nproblem with provable convergence rate. We prove the rate $O(1/k^2)$, $k$ being\nthe iteration counter, both for the absolute value of the primal objective\nresidual and constraints infeasibility. Our method has similar to Sinkhorn's\nmethod complexity of each iteration, but is faster and more stable numerically,\nwhen the regularization parameter is small. We illustrate the advantage of our\nmethod by numerical experiments for the two mentioned applications. We show\nthat there exists a threshold, such that, when the regularization parameter is\nsmaller than this threshold, our method outperforms the Sinkhorn's method in\nterms of computation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 10:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 15:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The F-RAN we consider in this paper is composed of a centralized\ncloud server which is connected through fronthaul links to two edge nodes\nserving two mobile users through a Z-shaped partially connected wireless\nnetwork. We define an information-theoretic metric, the delivery time per bit\n(DTB), that captures the worst-case per-bit delivery latency for conveying any\nrequested content to the users. For the cases when cloud and wireless\ntransmission occur either sequentially or in parallel, we establish coinciding\nlower and upper bounds on the DTB as a function of cache size, backhaul\ncapacity and wireless channel parameters. Through optimized rate allocation,\nour achievability scheme determines the best combination of private, common\nsignalling and interference neutralization that matches the converse.

The core element in virtually any active learning strategy\nis the criterion that measures the usefulness of the unlabeled data based on\nwhich new points to be labeled are picked. We propose a novel approach which we\nrefer to as maximizing variance for active learning or MVAL for short. MVAL\nmeasures the value of unlabeled instances by evaluating the rate of change of\noutput variables caused by changes in the next sample to be queried and its\npotential labelling. In a sense, this criterion measures how unstable the\nclassifier's output is for the unlabeled data points under perturbations of the\ntraining data. MVAL maintains, what we refer to as, retraining information\nmatrices to keep track of these output scores and exploits two kinds of\nvariance to measure the informativeness and representativeness, respectively.\nBy fusing these variances, MVAL is able to select the instances which are both\ninformative and representative.

In this paper, we initiate a rigorous theoretical study of\nthis basic problem of query complexity of interactive clustering, and provide\nstrong information theoretic lower bounds, as well as nearly matching upper\nbounds. Most clustering problems come with a similarity matrix, which is used\nby an automated process to cluster similar points together. Our main\ncontribution in this paper is to show the dramatic power of side information\naka similarity matrix on reducing the query complexity of clustering. A\nsimilarity matrix represents noisy pair-wise relationships such as one computed\nby some function on attributes of the elements. A natural noisy model is where\nsimilarity values are drawn independently from some arbitrary probability\ndistribution $f_+$ when the underlying pair of elements belong to the same\ncluster, and from some $f_-$ otherwise. We show that given such a similarity\nmatrix, the query complexity reduces drastically from $\\Theta(nk)$ (no\nsimilarity matrix) to $O(\\frac{k^2\\log{n}}{\\cH^2(f_+\\|f_-)})$ where $\\cH^2$\ndenotes the squared Hellinger divergence. Moreover, this is also\ninformation-theoretic optimal within an $O(\\log{n})$ factor. Our algorithms are\nall efficient, and parameter free, i.e., they work without any knowledge of $k,\nf_+$ and $f_-$, and only depend logarithmically with $n$. Along the way, our\nwork also reveals intriguing connection to popular community detection models\nsuch as the {\\em stochastic block model}, significantly generalizes them, and\nopens up many venues for interesting future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

The basic concept of\nthe displacement version of the reduced Trefftz method operates on the natural\nboundary conditions enforced in an integral form whereas the stress version of\nthe reduced Trefftz type approach operates on the essential boundary conditions\nenforced in an integral sense. The application of the method proposed in the\nframework of the finite element method is briefly outlined. The methods used by\nthe reduced Trefftz type approach for enforcing conformity and interelement\ncontinuity between neighboured elements are also discussed. Comparisons with\nother known methods for the same purpose are performed. General strategy for\ndeveloping finite elements of general geometric form such as quadrilateral\nelements with invariance properties is presented. The basic idea of this\nstrategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the\nelement geometry and performing the element integration in the biunit interval.\nFor defining the approximation functions a local coordinate system defined from\nthe directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular\ncontravariant base vectors computed in the geometric centre of the element is\nused. This strategy can also be used to implement other versions of finite\nelements and other forms of finite elements.

Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted\ncases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes value 0 or\n1. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for\nstochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the case of the mass-action\nrate law, that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of\nfactorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of\nhigh-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation\nreduces solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a\nheat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate\nbetween low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated\nseparately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-0 networks, and\nconnected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable\nor metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the\nstarting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments,\nreversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies. A basis for a\nsubset of network flows defined by having the same mean-regressing property as\nthe flows in deficiency-0 networks gives the leading contribution to low-order\nmoments in CRNs at general deficiency, in a $1/n$-expansion in large particle\nnumbers.

The framework demands that boundary conditions for this path\nintegral be uniquely given, but unlike other approaches where they are\nprescribed --- such as the no-boundary and the tunneling proposals --- here I\npostulate basic principles to identify boundary conditions in a large class of\ntheories. Uniqueness arises only if a reduced configuration space can be\ndefined and if it has a profoundly asymmetric fundamental structure. These\nrequirements place strong restrictions on the field and symmetry content of\ntheories encompassed here; shape dynamics is one such theory. Also as in other\nboundary proposals, Time, including space-time, emerges as an effective\nconcept; valid for certain curves in configuration space but not assumed from\nthe start. When some such notion of time becomes available, conservation of\n(positive) probability currents ensues. I show that, in the appropriate limits,\na Schroedinger equation dictates the evolution of weakly coupled source fields\non a classical gravitational background. Due to the asymmetry of reduced\nconfiguration space, these probabilities and currents avoid a known difficulty\nof standard WKB approximations for Wheeler DeWitt in minisuperspace: the\nselection of a unique Hamilton-Jacobi solution to serve as background. I\nillustrate these constructions with a simple example of a full quantum\ngravitational theory (i.e. not in minisuperspace) for which the formalism is\napplicable, and give a formula for calculating gravitational semi-classical\nrelative probabilities in it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 04:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 11:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

The equation of motion\nobtained from the old non-relativistic Lagrangian density is not complete, it\nlost some important terms. The new deduced equation can be approximated to the\nold equations of motion, the new momentum and energy can return to the old\nexpressions of superfluid systems under some conditions, and the energy and\nmomentum from the general Lagrangian density is accurate, no ignoring some\nterms. This paper reveals that the current classical superfluid Lagrangian\ndensity is only an approximation Lagrangian density under conditions: the\nscalar field is inverse proportional to its complex conjugate field and the\nsquare of time derivative of scalar field logarithm approximates to zero. This\npaper deduces that the divergence of velocity field is zero under classic\nsuperfluid, gives two different expressions of Lagrangian, gets the same\nequation, and finds its solutions. Using two different Lagrangian densities,\nthis paper obtains different forces. Therefore, this paper discovers a general,\nfundamental and real physics symmetry Lagrangian deducing the real physics\nequation of the superfluid, and further discover the symmetry breaking\nprocesses and the special conditions from the general Lagrangian to the special\nLagrangian. This paper gives both superfluid theory of scalar field and\ncomparing investigations with its corresponding theory of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 17:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

Starting from the optimal---and\nimpractical---strategy of offering zero or nominal power, which exposes the\nparticipant to potentially large imbalance costs, we develop a number of\nstrategies that control risk by hedging against penalising balancing prices in\nfavour of rewarding ones. Trading strategies are formulated in a probabilistic\nframework in order to address asymmetry in balancing prices. The large-scale\ncommunication of system information characteristic of modern power systems is\nutilised to inputs for electricity price forecasts and probabilistic system\nlength forecasts.
