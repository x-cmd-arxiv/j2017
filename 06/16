The longitudinal\nflux also indicates that the so-called giant amplification in the $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric phase is a sub-exponential behavior and does not outperform a\nsingle gain waveguide. The transverse flux, on the other hand, reveals that the\napparent power oscillations between the gain and loss waveguides in the $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric phase can be deceiving in certain cases, where the transverse\npower transfer is in fact unidirectional.

Memory is also one of the\nfundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of\nknowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical\nsubstrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical\nprocess can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations\nlast only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot\ninfluence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to\nkeep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves\nseveral distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal\nlevels.

Intriguingly, it has been suggested that dark matter may be explained\nby another recently observed phenomenon: the detection of gravitational waves\nby LIGO. LIGO's detection of gravitational waves from merging stellar mass\nblack holes renewed attention toward the possibility that dark matter consists\nsolely of black holes created in the very early universe and that these\nprimordial black holes are what LIGO is presently observing. Subsequent work on\nthis topic has ruled out the possibility that dark matter could consist solely\nof black holes similar to those that LIGO has detected with masses above 10\nsolar masses. However, LIGO's connection to dark matter remains an open\nquestion and in this work we consider a distribution of primordial black holes\nthat accounts for all of the dark matter, is consistent with LIGO's\nobservations arising from primordial black hole binaries, and resolves tension\nin previous surveys of microlensing events in the Milky Way halo. The\nprimordial black hole mass distribution that we consider offers an important\nprediction--LIGO may detect black holes smaller than have ever been observed\nwith ~1% of the black holes it detects having a mass less than the mass of our\nSun. Approximately one year of operating advanced LIGO at design sensitivity\nshould be adequate to begin to see a hint of a primordial black hole mass\ndistribution.

On\nthis basis, it is shown that Park transformations at three different\nfrequencies ($+\\omega$, $-2\\omega$ and $+3\\omega$) can be applied for deriving\na model formulation where all state-variables will settle at constant values in\nsteady-state, corresponding to an equilibrium point of the model.

With a rest-frame rise-time of just 4 days and a\npeak absolute magnitude of $M_{\\rm g}=-20.4$ mag, the light curve of iPTF16asu\nis faster and more luminous than previous rapid transients. The spectra of\niPTF16asu show a featureless, blue continuum near peak that develops into a\nType Ic-BL spectrum on the decline.

These inquires provide us the ingredients to model such phenomena and\nhelp answer important questions about the nuclear Equation of State (EOS) and\nits evolution as a function of neutron-to-proton $(N/Z)$ ratio. Purpose: The\nmotivation is to examine the real-time dynamics of nuclear transport phenomena\nand its dependence on $(N/Z)$ asymmetry from a microscopic point of view to\navoid any pre-conceived assumptions about the involved processes. Method:\nTime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method in full 3D is employed to calculate\ndeep-inelastic reactions of $^{78}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb and $^{92}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb\nsystems at 8.5~MeV$/A$. The impact parameter and energy-loss dependence of\nrelevant observables are calculated. In addition, density constrained TDHF\nmethod is used to compute excitation energies of the primary fragments. The\nstatistical deexcitation code GEMINI is utilized to examine the final reaction\nproducts. Results: The kinetic energy loss and sticking times as a function of\nimpact parameter are calculated. Final properties of the fragments (charge,\nmass, scattering angle, kinetic energy) are computed. Conclusions: We find a\nsmooth dependence of the energy loss, $E_\\mathrm{loss}$, on the impact\nparameter for both systems. On the other hand the transfer properties for low\n$E_\\mathrm{loss}$ values are very different for the two systems but become\nsimilar in the higher $E_\\mathrm{loss}$ regime. The mean life time of the\ncharge equilibration process, obtained from the final $(N-Z)/A$ value of the\nfragments, is shown to be $\\sim 0.5$~zs.

Because of the proximity, spatially resolved, multi-wavelength\nobservations offer excellent opportunities to learn about the physical origin\nof the bubbles. One of the unique features of the observed bubbles is that\ntheir gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ~110 GeV and the\noverall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy\nspectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin as it could be a signature\nof synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons;\nhowever, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should\nbe spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the formation of the Fermi\nbubble in the leptonic jet scenario using a newly implemented CRSPEC module in\nFLASH that allows us to track the evolution of CR spectrum on-the-fly during\nthe simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast\nsynchrotron and IC cooling near the GC when the jets were first launched. After\nthe jets propagate away from the GC, the dynamical timescale of the jets become\nthe shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is\nessentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the\nbubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of\nthe bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at early stage\nof the bubble expansion. We find that the CR spatial and spectral distribution\npredicted by the leptonic jet model can simultaneously match the normalization,\nspectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and\ntheir spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely\nmechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 18:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 17:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

This model has become the standard\ncosmological model with the evidence for an accelerated expansion provided by\nthe type Ia supernovae (SNIa) Hubble diagram. However, the robustness of this\nevidence has been addressed recently with somewhat diverging conclusions. Aims:\nThe purpose of this paper is to assess the robustness of the conclusion that\nthe Universe is indeed accelerating if we rely only on low-redshift\n(z$\\lesssim$2) observations, that is to say with SNIa, baryonic acoustic\noscillations, measurements of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, and\nmeasurements of the growth of matter perturbations. Methods: We used the\nstandard statistical procedure of minimizing the $\\chi^2$ function for the\ndifferent probes to quantify the goodness of fit of a model for both\n$\\Lambda$CDM and a simple nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model. In this\nanalysis, we do not assume that supernovae intrinsic luminosity is independent\nof the redshift, which has been a fundamental assumption in most previous\nstudies that cannot be tested. Results: We have found that, when SNIa intrinsic\nluminosity is not assumed to be redshift independent, a nonaccelerated\nlow-redshift power law model is able to fit the low-redshift background data as\nwell as, or even slightly better, than $\\Lambda$CDM. When measurements of the\ngrowth of structures are added, a nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model\nstill provides an excellent fit to the data for all the luminosity evolution\nmodels considered. Conclusions: Without the standard assumption that supernovae\nintrinsic luminosity is independent of the redshift, low-redshift probes are\nconsistent with a nonaccelerated universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 18:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

Furthermore, we characterise both the coverage probability\nand user rate in terms of the time variation of the channel. It is shown that\nboth of them decrease with increasing user mobility, but after a specific value\nof the normalised Doppler shift, they increase again. Actually, the time\nvariation, following the Jakes autocorrelation function, mirrors this effect on\ncoverage probability and user rate. Finally, we consider space division\nmultiple access (SDMA), single user beamforming (SU-BF), and baseline\nsingle-input single-output (SISO) transmission. A comparison among these\nschemes reveals that the coverage by means of SU-BF outperforms SDMA in terms\nof coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

Therefore, proving the convergence of the best-response dynamics to a\nNash equilibrium in these games requires new techniques. We suggest a model for\nrandom interference games, based on the long term fading governed by the\nplayers' geometry. Our goal is to prove convergence of the approximate\nbest-response dynamics with high probability with respect to the randomized\ngame. We embrace the asynchronous model in which the acting player is chosen at\neach stage at random. In our approximate best-response dynamics, the action of\na deviating player is chosen at random among all the approximately best ones.\nWe show that with high probability, with respect to the players' geometry and\nasymptotically with the number of players, each action increases the expected\nsocial-welfare (sum of achievable rates). Hence, the induced sum-rate process\nis a submartingale. Based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem, we prove\nconvergence of the strategy profile to an approximate Nash equilibrium with\ngood performance for asymptotically almost all interference games.

Further,\nscalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on Clifford + T gates. An\nefficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the\nnumber of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.\nRecently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which\nimproves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of\nqubits, and delay. However, the recent design is not based on fault-tolerant\nClifford + T gates. Also, it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs.\nTherefore, this work presents a T-count optimized quantum circuit for integer\nmultiplication with only $4 \\cdot n + 1$ qubits and no garbage outputs. The\nproposed quantum multiplier design saves the T-count by using a novel quantum\nconditional adder circuit. Also, where one operand to the controlled adder is\nzero, the conditional adder is replaced with a Toffoli gate array to further\nsave the T gates. To have fair comparison with the recent design by Babu and\nget an actual estimate of the T-count, it is made garbageless by using\nBennett's garbage removal scheme.

Finding the number\nof triangles in a graph is an important problem in the mining and analysis of\ngraphs. In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based distributed memory\nparallel algorithms for counting triangles in big graphs. The first algorithm\nemploys overlapping partitioning and efficient load balancing schemes to\nprovide a very fast parallel algorithm. The algorithm scales well to networks\nwith billions of nodes and can compute the exact number of triangles in a\nnetwork with 10 billion edges in 16 minutes. The second algorithm divides the\nnetwork into non-overlapping partitions leading to a space-efficient algorithm.\nOur results on both artificial and real-world networks demonstrate a\nsignificant space saving with this algorithm. We also present a novel approach\nthat reduces communication cost drastically leading the algorithm to both a\nspace- and runtime-efficient algorithm. Further, we demonstrate how our\nalgorithms can be used to list all triangles in a graph and compute clustering\ncoefficients of nodes. Our algorithm can also be adapted to a parallel\napproximation algorithm using an edge sparsification method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 05:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent. We investigate how constraints on black hole ringdown parameters\nscale with the loudness of the ringdown signal---subject to the constraint that\nthe post-merger remnant must be allowed to settle into a perturbative,\nKerr-like state. In particular, we require that---for a given detector---the\ngravitational waveform predicted by numerical relativity is indistinguishable\nfrom an exponentially damped sine after time $t^\\text{cut}$.

We show that for\nBiot's model this does give rise to discretizations that are uniformly stable\nwith respect to the physical parameters. We also propose a perturbation of the\nbilinear form, which allows for local elimination of the bubble functions and\nprovides a uniformly stable scheme with the same number of degrees of freedom\nas the classical P1-RT0-P0 approach. We prove optimal stability and error\nestimates for this discretization. Finally, we show that this scheme can also\nbe successfully applied to Stokes' equations, yielding a discrete problem with\noptimal approximation properties and with minimum number of degrees of freedom\n(equivalent to a P1-P0 discretization). Numerical tests confirm the theory for\nboth poroelastic and Stokes' test problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 07:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Yet, at\nany time, he/she can execute a SNAP command, which projects the current voxel\ngrid onto a latent shape manifold with a learned projection operator and then\ngenerates a similar, but more realistic, shape using a learned generator\nnetwork. Then the user can edit the resulting shape and snap again until he/she\nis satisfied with the result. The main advantage of this approach is that the\nprojection and generation operators assist novice users to create 3D models\ncharacteristic of a background distribution of object shapes, but without\nhaving to specify all the details. The core new research idea is to use a GAN\nto support this application. 3D GANs have previously been used for shape\ngeneration, interpolation, and completion, but never for interactive modeling.\nThe new challenge for this application is to learn a projection operator that\ntakes an arbitrary 3D voxel model and produces a latent vector on the shape\nmanifold from which a similar and realistic shape can be generated. We develop\nalgorithms for this and other steps of the SNAP processing pipeline and\nintegrate them into a simple modeling tool.

In contrast to mean field\napproaches, spatial correlations are explicitly conserved. A strong repulsive\ninteraction between particles of the same kind and a very attractive channel\nimply a strong entanglement of transport of both species. This is reflected by\nthe magnitude of transition flows in state space which in the extreme case of\nperfect coupling are restricted to a cyclic sub space. Entanglement of\ntransport implies that the species mutually exert entropic forces on each\nother. For parallel directed concentration gradients this implies that the\nspecies' ability to cooperate increases with the degree of entanglement. Thus,\nthe gradient of one species reciprocally induce a higher flow of the other\nspecies when compared to that in its absence. The opposite holds for\nantiparallel gradients where species mutually hamper their transport. For a\nsufficient strong coupling, the species under the influence of the stronger\nconcentration gradient drives the other against its gradient, i.e. flow and\ngradient of the driven species become antiparallel. Hence, besides the positive\nentropy production generated by the driving species a negative component of\nentropy production of the driven species emerges. The sources of both, positive\nand negative entropy production, can be localized in state space. The stronger\nthe coupling of transport the higher is the degree of efficiency, i.e. the\namount of negative entropy production on cost of the positive one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 08:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Here we show dramatic effects of spin\ntransport through an amorphous magnetic insulator, which is both magnetically\nand structurally disordered. We generate and detect spin flow though amorphous\nyttrium-iron-garnet ($a$-YIG) thin films in a non-local geometry by use of the\nspin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in platinum strips separated by 10 or\nmore microns. By comparing non-local spin transport in $a$-YIG on suspended\nmicromachined thermal isolation platforms to the same experiment performed on a\nbulk substrate, we show strong effects of in-plane thermal gradients on spin\ntransport in the disordered magnetic insulator. The resulting non-local voltage\nsignals are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in crystalline magnetic\ninsulators, with easily measurable spin signals seen even at distances in\nexcess of $100$ microns. In analogy to heat transport, where disordered\nmaterials support a range of vibrational excitations that can allow large\nthermal conductivities, we suggest that efficient spin transport in disordered\nmagnetic systems can occur via a similar spectrum of excitations that relies on\nstrong local exchange interactions and does not require long-range order.

We find that the single-photon spectral efficiency of the\ncavity-coupled emitter can be expressed by a simple formula, taking as inputs\nthe free-space emission and absorption spectra of the emitter as well as the\nloss rates of the system. In other words, the information on the interaction\nbetween the exciton and the phonon bath, encoded in the free-space behavior of\nthe emitter, is sufficient to obtain the dynamics of the system in the cavity.\nWe compute numerically the spectral efficiency for several types of localized\nemitters and show distinct behaviors depending on the phonon bath\ndimensionality. In particular, a pronounced asymmetric energy exchange between\nthe emitter and the cavity on the side-bands can yield a considerable extension\nof the tuning range of the sources through phonon-assisted cavity feeding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 10:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

A fundamentally important, but long-standing controversial\nproblem has been whether the pseudogap state is a distinct thermodynamic phase\ncharacterized by broken symmetries below the onset temperature $T^*$.\nElectronic nematicity, a fourfold ($C_4$) rotational symmetry breaking, has\nemerged as a key feature inside the pseudogap regime, but the presence or\nabsence of a nematic phase transition and its relationship to the pseudogap\nremain unresolved. Here we report thermodynamic measurements of magnetic torque\nin the underdoped regime of orthorhombic YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ with a field\nrotating in the CuO$_2$ plane, which allow us to quantify magnetic anisotropy\nwith exceptionally high precision. Upon entering the pseudogap regime, the\nin-plane anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility increases after exhibiting a\ndistinct kink at $T^*$. Our doping dependence analysis reveals that this\nanisotropy is preserved below $T^*$ even in the limit where the effect of\northorhombicity is eliminated. In addition, the excess in-plane anisotropy data\nshow a remarkable scaling behaviour with respect to $T/T^*$ in a wide doping\nrange. These results provide thermodynamic evidence that the pseudogap onset is\nassociated with a second-order nematic phase transition, which is distinct from\nthe CDW transition that accompanies translational symmetry breaking. This\nsuggests that nematic fluctuations near the pseudogap phase boundary have a\npotential link to the strange metallic behaviour in the normal state, out of\nwhich high-$T_c$ superconductivity emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 10:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

Our lattice\nformulation involves the Wilson discretization for the gluino and quark fields;\nfor gluons we employ the Wilson gauge action; for scalar fields (squarks) we\nuse na\\\"ive discretization. The gauge group that we consider is $SU(N_c)$,\nwhile the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge\nparameter, $\\alpha$, are left unspecified.\n  We obtain analytic expressions for the renormalization factors of the\ncoupling constant ($Z_g$) and of the quark ($Z_\\psi$), gluon ($Z_u$), gluino\n($Z_\\lambda$), squark ($Z_{A_\\pm}$), and ghost ($Z_c$) fields on the lattice.\nWe also compute the critical values of the gluino, quark and squark masses.\nFinally, we address the mixing which occurs among squark degrees of freedom\nbeyond tree level: we calculate the corresponding mixing matrix which is\nnecessary in order to disentangle the components of the squark field via an\nadditional finite renormalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 11:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The\nradio spectrum in these states is flat to slightly inverted. It is widely\naccepted that the energy distribution of the electrons, in the rest frame of\nthe jet, is a power law with index p. A power-law energy distribution of the\nelectrons in the jet is sufficient to explain the flat to slightly inverted\nspectrum emitted by the jet from radio to near infrared wavelengths, but is it\nnecessary? Contrary to what our thinking was decades ago, now we know that the\njets originate in the hot inner flow around black holes and neutron stars.\nThus, we have investigated the spectrum that is emitted by a thermal jet with\nkT in the range 100-250 keV. We have computed the emitted spectrum from radio\nto near infrared using either a thermal distribution of electrons or a\npower-law one. We have found that parabolic jets with a thermal distribution of\nelectrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the range 0-0.4, while jets with\na power-law distribution of electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the\nrange 0-0.2. The rest of the parameters are kept the same in the two cases. The\nbreak frequency, which marks the transition from optically thick to optically\nthin synchrotron emission, is comparable for the two electron energy\ndistributions. Our conclusion is that, contrary to common belief, it is not\nnecessary to invoke a power-law energy distribution of the electrons in a jet\nto explain its flat to slightly inverted radio spectrum. A relativistic\nMaxwellian produces similar spectra. Thus, the widely invoked corona around\nblack holes in X-ray binaries may actually be the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 12:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Existing object detection pipelines\nusually detect small objects through learning representations of all the\nobjects at multiple scales. However, the performance gain of such ad hoc\narchitectures is usually limited to pay off the computational cost. In this\nwork, we address the small object detection problem by developing a single\narchitecture that internally lifts representations of small objects to\n\"super-resolved\" ones, achieving similar characteristics as large objects and\nthus more discriminative for detection. For this purpose, we propose a new\nPerceptual Generative Adversarial Network (Perceptual GAN) model that improves\nsmall object detection through narrowing representation difference of small\nobjects from the large ones. Specifically, its generator learns to transfer\nperceived poor representations of the small objects to super-resolved ones that\nare similar enough to real large objects to fool a competing discriminator.\nMeanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the\ngenerated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement -\ngenerated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection\npurpose - on the generator. Extensive evaluations on the challenging\nTsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Caltech benchmark well demonstrate the\nsuperiority of Perceptual GAN in detecting small objects, including traffic\nsigns and pedestrians, over well-established state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 13:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

CEMP-no stars are long-lived low-mass stars with a very low iron\ncontent, overabundances of carbon and no or minor signs for the presence of s-\nor r-elements. Although their origin is still a matter of debate, they are\noften considered as being made of a material ejected by a previous stellar\ngeneration (source stars). Aims. We place constraints on the source stars from\nthe observed abundance data of CEMP-no stars. Methods. We computed source star\nmodels of 20, 32, and 60 M$_{\\odot}$ at Z = 10$^{-5}$ with and without fast\nrotation. For each model we also computed a case with a late mixing event\noccurring between the hydrogen and helium-burning shell $\\sim$ 200 yr before\nthe end of the evolution. This creates a partially CNO-processed zone in the\nsource star. We use the 12C/13C and C/N ratios observed on CEMP-no stars to put\nconstraints on the possible source stars (mass, late mixing or not). Then, we\ninspect more closely the abundance data of six CEMP-no stars and select their\npreferred source star(s). Results. Four out of the six CEMP-no stars studied\ncannot be explained without the late mixing process in the source star. Two of\nthem show nucleosynthetic signatures of a progressive mixing (due e.g. to\nrotation) in the source star. We also show that a 20 M$_{\\odot}$ source star is\npreferred compared to one of 60 M$_{\\odot}$ and that likely only the outer\nlayers of the source stars were expelled to reproduce the observed 12C/13C.\nConclusions. The results suggest that (1) a late mixing process could operate\nin some source stars, (2) a progressive mixing, possibly achieved by fast\nrotation, is at work in several source stars, (3) $\\sim$ 20 M$_{\\odot}$ source\nstars are preferred compared to $\\sim$ 60 M$_{\\odot}$ ones, and (4) the source\nstar might have preferentially experienced a low energetic supernova with large\nfallback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

DAS has\nadvantages in capacity especially for the cell edge users, in both single-cell\nand multi-cell environments. In this paper, non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) is suggested in single-cell DAS to maximize user fairness and sumrate.\nTwo transmission strategies are considered: NOMA with single selection\ntransmission and NOMA with blanket transmission. In a two-user scenario, the\ncenter base station (BS) uses NOMA to serve both users and the remote radio\nunits (RRUs) serve only the weak user based on the transmission scheme. The\nsignals sent from the RRUs are not considered as interference at both user\nsides. At one side, the signals from the RRUs are used to detect the required\ndata and at the other side, the signals are used to perform successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC).

Our mean-field equations describe\nthe local concentration evolution for each of an arbitrary number of species,\nand for an arbitrary overall composition of the system. We focus on the\npredictions for the dynamics of colloidal gas-liquid phase separation after a\nquench into the coexistence region. The critical point and the relevant\nspinodal curves are determined analytically, with the latter depending only on\nthree moments of the overall composition. The results for the early-time\nspinodal dynamics show qualitative changes as one crosses a 'quenched' spinodal\nthat excludes fractionation and so allows only density fluctuations at fixed\ncomposition. This effect occurs for dense systems, in agreement with a\nconjecture by Warren that, at high density, fractionation should be generically\nslow because it requires inter-diffusion of particles.

The edge states on the\ninterface between topological (non-trivial) and conventional (trivial)\ninsulators are topologically protected from scattering due to structural\ndefects and disorders. Recently, it was shown that photonic crystals can serve\nas a platform for realizing a scatter-free propagation of light waves. In\nconventional photonic crystals, imperfections, structural disorders, and\nsurface roughness lead to significant losses. The breakthrough in overcoming\nthese problems is likely to come from the synergy of the topological photonic\ncrystals and silicon-based photonics technology that enables high integration\ndensity, lossless propagation, and immunity to fabrication imperfections. For\nmany applications, reconfigurability and capability to control the propagation\nof these non-trivial photonic edge states is essential.

Here, we demonstrate dynamic\ncontrol of topological edge states by modifying the refractive index of a\nliquid crystal background medium. Background index is changed depending on the\norientation of a liquid crystal, while preserving the topological order of the\nsystem. This results in a change of the spectral position of the photonic\nbandgap and the topologically protected edge states.

It is therefore fundamentally impossible to\nsimultaneously reduce all three of these characteristics to their respective\ntheoretical minimum values. A figure of merit is introduced which holistically\ncaptures the performance of an arbitrary DC-DC converter, this is called the\nconverter's non-ideality and it has a target value of zero. It is derived using\nthe first law of thermodynamics and is shown to be dependent on the efficiency\nand the root-mean-squared total harmonic distortion of the output voltage.\nInterestingly, it is also shown that: boost conversion is impossible without\nenergy storage; ideal rectifiers convert all of the input power spectral\ndensity into DC (and introduces more noise in the process); the input current\nof any DC-DC converter scales with the gain of the device squared. Using an\narbitrary DC-DC converter, the culprit of this inherent trade-off is shown to\nbe the act of switching itself. Switching creates harmonics which need to be\nfiltered or transformed into heat in order to get a pure DC voltage at the\noutput of the converter. Even with ideal sub-systems, whether or not resonant\nconversion is employed, the result stands. The conclusion is that spreading of\nthe switching noise is a primary goal in attempting to reach the impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 17:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 06:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Significant effort has been devoted to developing custom\nsilicon devices to accelerate inference in ANNs. Accelerating the training\nphase, however, has attracted relatively little attention. In this paper, we\ndescribe a hardware-efficient on-line learning technique for feedforward\nmulti-layer ANNs that is based on pipelined backpropagation. Learning is\nperformed in parallel with inference in the forward pass, removing the need for\nan explicit backward pass and requiring no extra weight lookup. By using binary\nstate variables in the feedforward network and ternary errors in\ntruncated-error backpropagation, the need for any multiplications in the\nforward and backward passes is removed, and memory requirements for the\npipelining are drastically reduced. Further reduction in addition operations\nowing to the sparsity in the forward neural and backpropagating error signal\npaths contributes to highly efficient hardware implementation. For\nproof-of-concept validation, we demonstrate on-line learning of MNIST\nhandwritten digit classification on a Spartan 6 FPGA interfacing with an\nexternal 1Gb DDR2 DRAM, that shows small degradation in test error performance\ncompared to an equivalently sized binary ANN trained off-line using standard\nback-propagation and exact errors.
