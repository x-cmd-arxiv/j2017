It is often ignored that multiple self-consistent solutions can exist,\nseveral of which may correspond to minima of the energy functional. In addition\nto the difficulty sometimes encountered to converge the calculation to a\nself-consistent solution, one must ensure that the correct self-consistent\nsolution was found, typically the one with the lowest electronic energy.\nConvergence to an unwanted solution is in general not trivial to detect and\nwill deliver incorrect energy and molecular properties, and accordingly a\nmisleading description of chemical reactivity. Wrong conclusions based on\nincorrect self-consistent field convergence are particularly cumbersome in\nautomated calculations met in high-throughput virtual screening, structure\noptimizations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and in real-time explorations of\nchemical reactivity, where the vast amount of data can hardly be manually\ninspected. Here, we introduce a fast and automated approach to detect and cure\nincorrect orbital convergence, which is especially suited for electronic\nstructure calculations on sequences of molecular structures. Our approach\nconsists of a randomized perturbation of the converged electron density\n(matrix) intended to push orbital convergence to solutions that correspond to\nanother stationary point (of potentially lower electronic energy) in the\nvariational parameter space of an electronic wave function approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 16:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

The\nreconnection has two phases: first of all, 3D \"zipper reconnection\" propagates\nalong the initial coronal arcade, parallel to the polarity inversion line\n(PIL), then subsequent quasi-2D \"main phase reconnection\" in the low corona\naround a flux rope during its eruption produces coronal loops and chromospheric\nribbons that propagate away from the PIL in a direction normal to it.\n  One scenario starts with a sheared arcade: the zipper reconnection creates a\ntwisted flux rope of roughly one turn ($2\\pi$ radians of twist), and then main\nphase reconnection builds up the bulk of the erupting flux rope with a\nrelatively uniform twist of a few turns. A second scenario starts with a\npre-existing flux rope under the arcade. Here the zipper phase can create a\ncore with many turns that depend on the ratio of the magnetic fluxes in the\nnewly formed flare ribbons and the new flux rope. Main phase reconnection then\nadds a layer of roughly uniform twist to the twisted central core. Both phases\nand scenarios are modeled in a simple way that assumes the initial magnetic\nflux is fragmented along the PIL. The model uses conservation of magnetic\nhelicity and flux, together with equipartition of magnetic helicity, to deduce\nthe twist of the erupting flux rope in terms the geometry of the initial\nconfiguration.\n  Interplanetary observations show some flux ropes have a fairly uniform twist,\nwhich could be produced when the zipper phase and any pre-existing flux rope\npossess small or moderate twist (up to one or two turns). Other interplanetary\nflux ropes have highly twisted cores (up to five turns), which could be\nproduced when there is a pre-existing flux rope and an active zipper phase that\ncreates substantial extra twist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 17:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Its primary\ngoal is to collect known facts and establish a basic operational calculus that\nwill be used in the subsequent parts. This is done in greater generality than\nis necessary for the stated goal. Several results of independent interest are\nalso established. They include, among other things, connections with\nsatellites, an explicit construction of the stabilization of a finitely\npresented functor, various exactness properties of the injectively stable\nfunctors, a construction, from a functor and a short exact sequence, of a\ndoubly-infinite exact sequence by splicing the injective stabilization of the\nfunctor and its derived functors. When specialized to the tensor product with a\nfinitely presented module, the injective stabilization with coefficients in the\nring is isomorphic to the 1-torsion functor. The Auslander-Reiten formula is\nextended to a more general formula, which holds for arbitrary (i.e., not\nnecessarily finite) modules over arbitrary associative rings with identity.\nWeakening of the assumptions in the theorems of Eilenberg and Watts leads to\ncharacterizations of the requisite zeroth derived functors.\n  The subsequent papers, provide applications of the developed techniques.\nPart~II deals with new notions of torsion module and cotorsion module of a\nmodule.

It applies to\narbitrary modules over arbitrary rings. For arbitrary modules over commutative\ndomains it coincides with the classical torsion, and for finitely presented\nmodules over arbitrary rings it coincides with the Bass torsion. A formally\ndual approach -- based on projective stabilization -- gives rise to a new\nconcept: the cotorsion quotient module of a module. This is done in complete\ngenerality -- the new concept is defined for any module over any ring. Unlike\ntorsion, cotorsion does not have classical prototypes.\n  General properties of these constructs are established. It is shown that the\nAuslander-Gruson-Jensen functor applied to the cotorsion functor returns the\ntorsion functor. As a consequence, a ring is one-sided absolutely pure if and\nonly if each pure injective on the other side is cotorsion-free. If the\ninjective envelope of the ring is finitely presented, then the right adjoint of\nthe Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor applied to the torsion functor returns the\ncotorsion functor. This correspondence establishes a duality between torsion\nand cotorsion over such rings. In particular, this duality applies to artin\nalgebras. It is also shown that, over any ring, the character module of the\ntorsion of a module is isomorphic to the cotorsion of the character module of\nthe module. Under various finiteness conditions on the injective envelope of\nthe ring, the derived functors of torsion and cotorsion are computed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 18:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 03:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 01:31:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 13:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 05:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

The key variables are the frequency of\nprecipitation and temperature during an approximately two month window of the\nwinter season preceding the outbreak. Thus simple climate signatures may be\ninfluencing Dengue outbreaks even months before their occurrence. Some of the\nmore challenging datasets required usage of compressive-sensing procedures to\nestimate missing entries for temperature and precipitation records. Our results\nindicate that each Brazilian capital considered has a unique frequency of\nprecipitation and temperature signature in the winter preceding a Dengue\noutbreak. Such climate contributions on vector populations are key factors in\ndengue dynamics which could lead to more accurate prediction models and early\nwarning systems. Finally, we show that critical temperature and precipitation\nsignatures may vary significantly from city to city, suggesting that the\ninterplay between climate variables and dengue outbreaks is more complex than\ngenerally appreciated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 20:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

This paper\npresents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies\nthe point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within\neach layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The\nnovelty of the approach is the stratification procedure that separates the\npoint cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by\nanalyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales.\nThe procedure does not make a priori assumptions about the shape and size of\nthe tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be\nutilized to vertically stratify tree crowns of forest canopies. We applied the\nproposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural\ndeciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation\nstructure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification\nprocedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46% to 68%) at the\ncost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased\nfrom 1% to 16%), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of\noverstory trees. Results of vertical stratification of the canopy showed that\nthe point density of understory canopy layers were suboptimal for performing a\nreasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point\nclouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown\nby inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the\nsegmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 21:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 19:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 15:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 19:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

We use\nthe superposition principles to generate a variety of interesting solutions,\nincluding superpositions of a merging soliton with $1$ or $2$ regular solitons,\nand solutions that develop a singularity in finite time which then disappears\nat some later finite time. We prove a Wronskian formula for the solutions\nobtained by applying a general sequence of BTs on the trivial solution.\nFinally, we show how to obtain the standard conserved quantities of the\nBoussinesq equation from the BT, and how the hierarchy of local symmetries\nfollows in a simple manner from the superposition principle for 3 BTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 13:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}
