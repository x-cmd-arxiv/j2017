Manganese-doped\naluminum (Al-Mn) has a tunable critical temperature and could therefore be an\nattractive material for LEKIDs sensitive to frequencies below 100 GHz if the\ninternal quality factor remains sufficiently high when manganese is added to\nthe film. To investigate, we measured some of the key properties of Al-Mn\nLEKIDs.

We provide analytical estimates\nof the spectrum and of the polarization fraction of the synchrotron precursor\nfor both relativistic and non-relativistic collisionless shock fronts,\naccounting for the self-generation or amplification of magnetic turbulence. In\nrelativistic sources, the spectrum of the precursor is harder than that of the\nshocked plasma, because the upstream residence time increases with particle\nenergy, leading to an effectively hard spectrum of accelerated particles in the\nprecursor volume. At high frequencies, typically in the optical to X-ray range,\nthe contribution of the precursor becomes sizeable, but we find that in most\ncases studied, it remains dominated by the synchrotron or inverse Compton\ncontribution of the shocked plasma; its contribution might be detectable only\nin trans-relativistic shock waves. Non-relativistic sources offer the\npossibility of spectral imaging of the precursor by viewing the shock front\nedge-on. We calculate this spectro-morphological contribution for various\nparameters.

Differently from most prior works, in this\npaper we consider a generic scenario, in which the ER and AP do not coincide,\ni.e., are two separate entities. We study two NOMA decoding schemes, namely Low\nComplexity Decoding (LCD) and Successive Interference Cancellation Decoding\n(SICD). For each scheme, we formulate a sum-throughput optimization problem\nover a finite horizon. Despite the complexity of the LCD optimization problem,\ndue to its non-convexity, we recast it into a series of geometric programs. On\nthe other hand, we establish the convexity of the SICD optimization problem and\npropose an algorithm to find its optimal solution. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate the importance of using successive interference cancellation in\nWPCNs with NOMA, and show how the energy should be distributed as a function of\nthe system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 09:49:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 14:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Solution of a such\nproblem is constructed by starting with a semi-discretization approach followed\nby a full discretization using exponential time differencing and matrix\nquadrature rules. To the best of our knowledge the stability of the numerical\nsolution is treated in this paper for the first time. Analysis of the time\nvariation of the numerical solution with respect to previous time level\ntogether with the use of logarithmic norm of matrices are the basis of the\nstability result. Sufficient stability conditions on step sizes, that also\nguarantee positivity and boundedness of the solution, are found.

For example, CUDA programmers must set thread\nand block parameters for a kernel, but might not have the intuition to make a\ngood choice. Similarly, compilers can generate working code, but may miss\ntuning opportunities by not targeting GPU models or performing code\ntransformations. Although empirical autotuning addresses some of these\nchallenges, it requires extensive experimentation and search for optimal code\nvariants. This research presents an approach for tuning CUDA kernels based on\nstatic analysis that considers fine-grained code structure and the specific GPU\narchitecture features. Notably, our approach does not require any program runs\nin order to discover near-optimal parameter settings.

Corrected FC\nimages acquired on approach to Ceres were assembled into global maps of albedo\nand color. Generally, albedo and color variations on Ceres are muted. The\nalbedo map is dominated by a large, circular feature in Vendimia Planitia,\nknown from HST images (Li et al., 2006), and dotted by smaller bright features\nmostly associated with fresh-looking craters. The dominant color variation over\nthe surface is represented by the presence of \"blue\" material in and around\nsuch craters, which has a negative spectral slope over the visible wavelength\nrange when compared to average terrain. We also mapped variations of the phase\ncurve by employing an exponential photometric model, a technique previously\napplied to asteroid Vesta (Schr\\\"oder et al., 2013b). The surface of Ceres\nscatters light differently from Vesta in the sense that the ejecta of several\nfresh-looking craters may be physically smooth rather than rough. High albedo,\nblue color, and physical smoothness all appear to be indicators of youth. The\nblue color may result from the desiccation of ejected material that is similar\nto the phyllosilicates/water ice mixtures in the experiments of Poch et al.\n(2016).

All these peaks would contribute significantly to some of the CMB\nlarge-scale anomalies, as the parity and hemispherical asymmetries, the dipole\nmodulation, the alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, or in the\ncase of the Cold Spot, to the non-Gaussianity of the field.

We discuss to build a unified theory of\nrisky choice, which would explain both of compensatory and non-compensatory\ntheories. For risky choice, according to cognition ability, we argue that\npeople could not build a continuous and accurate subjective probability world,\nbut several order concepts, such as small, middle and large probability. People\nmake decisions based on information, experience, imagination and other things.\nAll of these things are so huge that people have to prepare some strategies.\nThat is, people have different strategies when facing to different situations.\nThe distributions of these things have different decision structures. More\nprecisely, decision making is a process of simplifying the decision structure.\nHowever, the process of decision structure simplifying is not stuck in a rut,\nbut through different path when facing problems repeatedly. It is why\npreference reversal always happens when making decisions. The most efficient\nway to simplify the decision structure is calculating expected value or making\ndecisions based on one or two dimensions. We also argue that the deliberation\ntime at least has four parts, which are consist of substitution time, first\norder time, second order time and calculation time.

The tension with the Jubilee-based $\\Lambda$CDM\npredictions is $\\sim 2\\sigma$, in consistency with independent analyses of\nsupervoids in Dark Energy Survey data. We show that such a very large\nenhancement of the $A_{\\rm ISW}$ parameter hints at a possible causal relation\nbetween the CMB Cold Spot and the Eridanus supervoid. The origin of these\nfindings remains unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 13:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 12:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The recent\nobservation of Kerr frequency combs operating in the dissipative Kerr soliton\n(DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the means for\nfully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered\nspectral envelope.

In order to achieve this,\nthe magnetic structure of the CME as it leaves the Sun must be known. In this\narticle we address this issue by developing a method to determine the intrinsic\nflux rope type of a CME solely from solar disk observations. We use several\nwell known proxies for the magnetic helicity sign, the axis orientation, and\nthe axial magnetic field direction to predict the magnetic structure of the\ninterplanetary flux rope. We present two case studies: the 2 June 2011 and the\n14 June 2012 CMEs. Both of these events erupted from an active region and,\ndespite having clear in situ counterparts, their eruption characteristics were\nrelatively complex. The first event was associated with an active region\nfilament that erupted in two stages, while for the other event the eruption\noriginated from a relatively high coronal altitude and the source region did\nnot feature the presence of a filament. Our magnetic helicity sign proxies\ninclude the analysis of magnetic tongues, soft X-ray and/or EUV sigmoids,\ncoronal arcade skew, filament emission and absorption threads, and filament\nrotation. Since the inclination of the post-eruption arcades was not clear, we\nuse the tilt of the polarity inversion line to determine the flux rope axis\norientation, and coronal dimmings to determine the flux rope footpoints and,\ntherefore, the direction of the axial magnetic field.

Observational studies of metal-poor stars suggest that there is a\nuniversal pattern in the main r-process, similar to the abundance pattern of\nthe r-process component of solar-system material.

The model with two fixed\nends has been integrated by Thiery and Le Doussal, using coordinate Bethe\nAnsatz techniques and an analytic-continuation prescription. The probability\ndistribution of the free energy has been obtained through the replica method,\neven though the moments of the partition sum do not exist at all orders due to\nthe fat tail in the distribution of Boltzmann weights. To extend this approach\nto the polymer with one free end, we argue that the contribution to the\npartition sums in the thermodynamic limit is localised on parity-invariant\nstring states. This situation is analogous to the case of the continuum polymer\nwith one free end, related to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation with flat\nboundary conditions and solved by Le Doussal and Calabrese.

Next, we\nanalyze the effect of implementing the ARQ protocol on the throughput. We show\nthat by using the proposed power allocation scheme we can minimize the loss of\nthroughput that is caused from the retransmissions. Furthermore, we analyze the\neffect of the feedback delay length in our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 14:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

On the one hand, the outer layers of\nmassive stars are so hot that they produce most of the ionizing ultraviolet\nradiation of galaxies; in fact, the first massive stars helped to re-ionize the\nUniverse after its Dark Ages. Another important property of massive stars are\nthe strong stellar winds and outflows they produce. This mass loss, and finally\nthe explosion of a massive star as a supernova or a gamma-ray burst, provide a\nsignificant input of mechanical and radiative energy into the interstellar\nspace. These two properties together make massive stars one of the most\nimportant cosmic engines: they trigger the star formation and enrich the\ninterstellar medium with heavy elements, that ultimately leads to formation of\nEarth-like rocky planets and the development of complex life. The study of\nmassive star winds is thus a truly multidisciplinary field and has a wide\nimpact on different areas of astronomy. [...]\n  This detailed review summarises the current knowledge on the theory and\nobservations of winds from massive stars, as well as on observations and\naccretion processes in wind-fed high mass X-ray binaries.

There are several reasons: the long-standing impact of\ninvestment decisions, the proper integration of renewable sources into the\nsystem, the present and future uncertainties, and the convenience to consider\nan integrated year-by-year representation of both uncertainties and investment\ndecisions. However, recent breakthroughs in Dynamic Transmission Network\nExpansion Planning (DTNEP) have demonstrated that the use of robust\noptimization might render this problem computationally tractable for real\nsystems. This paper intends to consider not only the capacity expansion of\nlines, but the construction and/or dismantling of renewable and conventional\ngeneration facilities as well. The Dynamic Transmission Network and Renewable\nGeneration Expansion Planning (DTNRGEP) problem is formulated as an adaptive\nrobust optimization problem with three levels. First level minimizes the\ninvestment costs of transmission network and generation expansion planning, the\nsecond level maximizes system operational costs with respect to uncertain\nparameters, while the third level minimizes those operational costs with\nrespect to operational decisions. The method is tested for two cases: i) an\nillustrative example based on Garver IEEE system and ii) a case study using the\nIEEE 118-bus system. Numerical results from these examples demonstrate that the\nproposed model allows making optimal decisions towards reaching a sustainable\npower system, while overcoming problem size limitations and computational\nintractability for realistic cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 15:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Their relevance for information\nrepresentation has been supported by in-vivo studies in ferret and mouse\nprimary visual cortex. In ferret blocking glutamate transport pharmacologically\nbroadened tuning curves and enhanced the response at preferred orientation. In\nknock-out mice with reduced expression of glutamate transporters sharpened\ntuning was observed. It is however unclear how focal and ambient changes in\nglutamate concentration affect stimulus representation. Here we develop a\ncomputational framework, which allows the investigation of synaptic and\nextrasynaptic effects of glutamate uptake on orientation tuning in recurrently\nconnected network models with pinwheel-domain (ferret) or salt-and-pepper\n(mouse) organization. This model proposed that glutamate uptake shapes\ninformation representation when it affects the contribution of excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons to the network activity. Namely, strengthening the\ncontribution of excitatory neurons generally broadens tuning and elevates the\nresponse. In contrast, strengthening the contribution of inhibitory neurons can\nhave a sharpening effect on tuning. In addition local representational topology\nalso plays a role: In the pinwheel-domain model effects were strongest within\ndomains - regions where neighboring neurons share preferred orientations.\nAround pinwheels but also within salt-and-pepper networks the effects were less\nstrong.

In Two Measure\nTheories one uses metric independent volume elements and this allows to\nconstruct unified Dark Matter Dark Energy, where the cosmological constant\nappears as an integration constant associated to the equation of motion of the\nmeasure fields. The Dynamical space time Theories generalize the Two Measure\nTheories by introducing a vector field whose equation of motion guarantees the\nconservation of a certain Energy Momentum tensor, which may be related, but in\ngeneral is not the same as the gravitational Energy Momentum tensor. We propose\ntwo formulations of this idea: I - by demanding that this vector field be the\ngradient of a scalar, II - by considering the dynamical space field appearing\nin another part of the action. Then the Dynamical space time Theory becomes a\ntheory of Diffusive Unified Dark Energy and Dark Matter. These generalizations\nproduce non conserved energy momentum tensors instead of conserved energy\nmomentum tensors which leads at the end to a formulation of interacting DE-DM\ndust models in the form of a diffusive type interacting Unified Dark Energy and\nDark Matter scenario. We solved analytically the theories for perturbative\nsolution and asymptotic solution, and we show that the $\\Lambda$CDM is a fixed\npoint of these theories at large times.

The resulting pressure-saturation\ncharacteristics and transport correlations are important input parameters for\nmodeling approaches on the continuum scale and allow for an efficient\ndevelopment of improved gas diffusion electrodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 13:26:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

In this letter, we report for the first time another\ntype of IR-RS that is related to the built-in homojunction. The IR-RS study was\nusually limited to macroscopic samples with micron-order pad-type electrodes,\nwhile this work is on NiO nanodots fabricated with ultrathin\nanodic-aluminum-oxide templates and acting as nanoscaled analogs of real\ndevices. The NiO nanodots show high storage density and high uniformity, and\nthe IR-RS behaviors are of good device performances in terms of retention,\nendurance, switching ratio and rectification ratio. The feasibility of the\nIR-RS for selection device-free memory application has been demonstrated, by\ncalculating the maximum crossbar array size under the worst-case scenario to be\n3 Mbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 21:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We employ time-resolved optical\ntwo-color pump-probe measurements to study the coherent non-thermal spin\ndynamics. Optical pumping and probing with linearly and circularly polarized\nlight along the optic axis of the NiO crystal scrutinizes the mechanism behind\nthe ultrafast optical magnon excitation. A phenomenological symmetry-based\ntheory links these experimental results to expressions for the optically\ninduced magnetization via the inverse Faraday effect and the inverse\nCotton-Mouton effect. We obtain striking agreement between experiment and\ntheory that, furthermore, allows us to extract information about the spin\ndomain distribution. We also find that in NiO the energy transfer into the\nmagnon mode via the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect is about three orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than via the inverse Faraday effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 10:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}
