In this\nmethodology, effective equations are derived for the observable velocity and\nmagnetic fields spatially-averaged at an arbitrary scale of resolution. The\nmicroscopic equations for the bare velocity and magnetic fields are\nrenormalized by coarse-graining to yield macroscopic effective equations that\ncontain both a subscale stress and a subscale electromotive force (EMF)\ngenerated by nonlinear interaction of eliminated fields and plasma motions. At\nlarge coarse-graining length-scales, the direct dissipation of invariants by\nmicroscopic mechanisms (such as molecular viscosity and Spitzer resistivity) is\nshown to be negligible. The balance at large scales is dominated instead by the\nsubscale nonlinear terms, which can transfer invariants across scales, and are\ninterpreted in terms of work concepts for energy and in terms of topological\nflux-linkage for the two helicities. An important application of this approach\nis to MHD turbulence, where the coarse-graining length $\\ell$ lies in the\ninertial cascade range. We show that in the case of sufficiently rough velocity\nand/or magnetic fields, the nonlinear inter-scale transfer need not vanish and\ncan persist to arbitrarily small scales. Although closed expressions are not\navailable for subscale stress and subscale EMF, we derive rigorous upper bounds\non the effective dissipation they produce in terms of scaling exponents of the\nvelocity and magnetic fields. These bounds provide exact constraints on\nphenomenological theories of MHD turbulence in order to allow the nonlinear\ncascade of energy and cross-helicity. On the other hand, we show that the\nforward cascade of magnetic helicity to asymptotically small scales is\nimpossible unless 3rd-order moments of either velocity or magnetic field become\ninfinite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 16:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

When\nthe asymptotically exact approximation is required, it is shown that the\nresolvability under the two kinds of approximation measures coincides.

The obtained characterization of the channel\nresolvability is fully general in the sense that when the channel is just the\nidentity mapping, the characterization reduces to the general formula for the\nsource resolvability.

So far, digital superconducting circuits could not demonstrate their\nimmense potential. One important reason for this is that a dense\nsuperconducting memory technology is not yet available. Miniaturization of\ntraditional superconducting quantum interference devices is difficult below a\nfew micrometers because their operation relies on the geometric inductance of\nthe superconducting loop. Magnetic memories do allow nanometer-scale\nminiaturization, but they are not purely superconducting (Baek et al 2014 Nat.\nCommun. 5 3888). Our approach is to make nanometer scale memory cells based on\nthe kinetic inductance (and not geometric inductance) of superconducting\nnanowire loops, which have already shown many fascinating properties (Aprili\n2006 Nat. Nanotechnol. 1 15; Hopkins et al 2005 Science 308 1762). This allows\nmuch smaller devices and naturally eliminates magnetic-field cross-talk. We\ndemonstrate that the vorticity, i.e., the winding number of the order\nparameter, of a closed superconducting loop can be used for realizing a\nnanoscale nonvolatile memory device. We demonstrate how to alter the vorticity\nin a controlled fashion by applying calibrated current pulses. A reliable\nread-out of the memory is also demonstrated.

Clear deceleration started after first three seconds of flight, and\nthe terminal velocity of the meteor was only 5.0 +\\- 0.3 km/s at height of 26.0\n+\\- 0.2 km. Such a low value of terminal velocity indicates that fragments with\ntotal mass of around 10-15 kg could survive the atmospheric passage and cause\nfall of the meteorites. The predicted area of possible meteorite impact is\ncomputed and it is located south of Reszel city at Warmian-Masurian region. The\nimpact area was extensively searched by experienced groups of meteorite hunters\nbut without any success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 17:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

We suggest that memory augmented neural networks can\nreduce the effects of vanishing gradients by creating shortcut (or wormhole)\nconnections. Based on this observation, we propose a novel memory augmented\nneural network model called TARDIS (Temporal Automatic Relation Discovery in\nSequences). The controller of TARDIS can store a selective set of embeddings of\nits own previous hidden states into an external memory and revisit them as and\nwhen needed. For TARDIS, memory acts as a storage for wormhole connections to\nthe past to propagate the gradients more effectively and it helps to learn the\ntemporal dependencies. The memory structure of TARDIS has similarities to both\nNeural Turing Machines (NTM) and Dynamic Neural Turing Machines (D-NTM), but\nboth read and write operations of TARDIS are simpler and more efficient. We use\ndiscrete addressing for read/write operations which helps to substantially to\nreduce the vanishing gradient problem with very long sequences. Read and write\noperations in TARDIS are tied with a heuristic once the memory becomes full,\nand this makes the learning problem simpler when compared to NTM or D-NTM type\nof architectures.

To make the\ncalculation robust against discretization errors, we propose a novel numerical\nscheme based on game theoretical methods, in particular the discriminating\nkernel. We show that the resulting algorithm provides an inner approximation of\nthe viability kernel and guarantees that, for all states in the cell\nsurrounding a viable grid point, there exists a control that keeps the system\nwithin the kernel. The performance of the proposed control method is studied in\nsimulation where we determine the effects of various design choices and\nparameters and in experiments on an autonomous racing set-up maintained at the\nAutomatic Control Laboratory of ETH Zurich. Both simulation and experimental\nresults suggest that the more conservative approximation using the\ndiscriminating kernel results in safer driving style at the cost of a small\nincrease in lap time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 18:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 15:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

In particular, given the importance of magnetic fields, various aspects\nof this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics\n(GRMHD). So far, most GRMHD simulations focused the attention on BNS mergers\nleading to the formation of a hypermassive NS, which, in turn, collapses within\nfew tens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. However,\nrecent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could\nform a long-lived NS remnant, which will either collapse on much longer\ntimescales or remain indefinitely stable. Despite the profound implications for\nthe evolution and the emission properties of the system, a detailed\ninvestigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing. Here, we\nfollow this direction and present a first detailed GRMHD study of BNS mergers\nforming a long-lived NS. We consider magnetized binaries with different mass\nratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the NS remnants, the\nrotation profiles, the accretion disks, the evolution and amplification of\nmagnetic fields, and the ejection of matter.

For example, we found that the shock and PMS plane\nnormals generally coincided for the events where the PMSs occurred near the\nshock (68% of the PMS plane normals near the shock were separated by less than\n20{\\deg} from the shock normal), while deviations were clearly larger when PMSs\noccurred close to the ejecta leading edge.

For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically\nacceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate\nthis bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 19:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

A new flexible method to sample the stellar initial mass function\nallows us to follow the contribution to the ISRF, the metal output and the SN\ndelay times of individual massive stars. We find that SNe play the dominant\nrole in regulating the global star formation rate, shaping the multi-phase\ninterstellar medium (ISM) and driving galactic outflows. Outflow rates (with\nmass-loading factors of a few) and hot gas fractions of the ISM increase with\nthe number of SNe exploding in low-density environments where radiative energy\nlosses are low. While PE heating alone can suppress star formation slightly\nmore (a factor of a few) than SNe alone can do, it is unable to drive outflows\nand reproduce the multi-phase ISM that emerges naturally when SNe are included.\nThese results are in conflict with recent results of Forbes et al. who\nconcluded that PE heating is the dominant process suppressing star formation in\ndwarfs, about an order of magnitude more efficient than SNe. Potential origins\nfor this discrepancy are discussed. In the absence of SNe and photoionization\n(mechanisms to disperse dense clouds), the impact of PE heating is highly\noverestimated owing to the (unrealistic) proximity of dense gas to the\nradiation sources. This leads to a substantial boost of the infrared continuum\nemission from the UV-irradiated dust and a far infrared line-to-continuum ratio\ntoo low compared to observations. Though sub-dominant in regulating star\nformation, the ISRF controls the abundance of molecular hydrogen via\nphotodissociation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 19:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Specifically, we identify vertices whose failures will\ncritically damage the network by degrading its clustering, evaluated through\nthe average clustering coefficient. This problem is important because any\nsignificant change made to the clustering, resulting from element-wise\nfailures, could degrade network performance such as the ability for information\nto propagate in a social network.

The Sun's\natmosphere is divided into magnetically open regions, coronal holes, where\nsolar-wind plasma streams out freely and fills the solar system, and closed\nregions, where the plasma is confined to coronal loops. The boundary between\nthese regions extends outward as the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).\nMeasurements of plasma composition imply that the solar wind near the HCS, the\nso-called slow solar wind, originates in closed regions, presumably by the\nprocesses of field-line opening or interchange reconnection. Mysteriously,\nhowever, slow wind is also often seen far from the HCS. We use high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the dynamics of\na coronal hole whose geometry includes a narrow corridor flanked by closed\nfield and which is driven by supergranule-like flows at the coronal-hole\nboundary. We find that these dynamics result in the formation of giant arcs of\nclosed-field plasma that extend far from the HCS and span tens of degrees in\nlatitude and longitude at Earth, accounting for the slow solar wind\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 19:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 18:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

A problem arises on heterogeneous parallel machines where\ncomputation and communication costs can vary between different types of\nprocessor. Existing solutions for heterogeneous machines attempt to estimate\nthe critical path using average values of computation and communication costs.\nHowever, this ignores opportunities to match specific tasks to specific classes\nof processor and communication links, and can result in quite misleading paths\nbeing identified as critical. We argue that an accurate critical path must\nconsider the mapping of tasks to classes of processor and communication links.\nWe formulate a polynomial time algorithm to find such a critical path. Our\nCritical Earliest Finish Time (CEFT) algorithm finds both the length of the\ncritical path and an allocation of tasks to processors on that path. We\ncompared CEFT experimentally to existing approaches such as averaging execution\ntimes across processors.

The van der Waals shift\nbecomes commensurate with the 2S-2P_{3/2} fine-structure splitting only for\nclose approach (R < 100 a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius) and one may thus\nrestrict the discussion to the levels with n=2 and J=1/2 to good approximation.\nBecause each S or P state splits into an F=1 triplet and an F=0 hyperfine\nsinglet (eight states for each atom), the Hamiltonian matrix {\\em a priori} is\nof dimension 64. A careful analysis of symmetries the problem allows one to\nreduce the dimensionality of the most involved irreducible submatrix to 12.

There are scenarios\nwhen high resolution images are not available and our experiments show that the\nOCR accuracy reduces significantly with decrease in the spatial resolution of\ndocument images.

While IPCC has traditionally used a simple model\noutput average, recent work has illustrated potential advantages of using a\nmultitask learning (MTL) framework for projections of individual climate\nvariables. In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask\nlearning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task\nat the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For\nclimate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate\nvariables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a\ngroup lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the\nsuper-tasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the\nbehavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show\nthat some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can\nbe viewed as special cases of HMTL.

In the case of\ntree-width, the restriction to minor-closed classes is justified by the fact\nthat the tree-width of a graph is never smaller than the tree-width of any of\nits minors. This, however, is not the case with respect to clique-width, as the\nclique-width of a graph can be (much) smaller than the clique-width of its\nminor. On the other hand, the clique-width of a graph is never smaller than the\nclique-width of any of its induced subgraphs, which allows us to be restricted\nto hereditary classes (that is, classes closed under taking induced subgraphs),\nwhen we study clique-width. Up to date, only finitely many minimal hereditary\nclasses of graphs of unbounded clique-width have been discovered in the\nliterature. In the present paper, we prove that the family of such classes is\ninfinite.

While\nin the case of coherent conduction the temperature dependence arises from the\nbroadening of the Fermi distribution in the metal electrodes, in the latter\ncase it corresponds to electron-vibration interaction effects on the junction.\nWith the objective to distill the thermally-activated hopping component, thus\nexpose intrinsic electron-vibration interaction phenomena on the junction, we\nsuggest the design of molecular junctions with \"spacers\", extended anchoring\ngroups that act to filter out phase-coherent resonant electrons. Specifically,\nwe study the electrical conductance of fixed-gap and variable-gap junctions\nthat include a tunneling block, with spacers at the boundaries. Using numerical\nsimulations and analytical considerations, we demonstrate that in our design,\nresonant conduction is suppressed. As a result, the electrical conductance is\ndominated by two (rather than three) mechanisms: superexchange (deep\ntunneling), and multi-step thermally-induced hopping. We further exemplify our\nanalysis on DNA junctions with an A:T block serving as a tunneling barrier.\nHere, we show that the electrical conductance is insensitive to the number of\nG:C base-pairs at the boundaries. This indicates that the tunneling-to-hopping\ncrossover revealed in such sequences truly corresponds to the properties of the\nA:T barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 04:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

We then define a new class of submodular functions we call\n{\\em deep submodular functions} or DSFs. We show that DSFs are a flexible\nparametric family of submodular functions that share many of the properties and\nadvantages of deep neural networks (DNNs). DSFs can be motivated by considering\na hierarchy of descriptive concepts over ground elements and where one wishes\nto allow submodular interaction throughout this hierarchy. Results in this\npaper show that DSFs constitute a strictly larger class of submodular functions\nthan SCMMs. We show that, for any integer $k>0$, there are $k$-layer DSFs that\ncannot be represented by a $k'$-layer DSF for any $k'<k$. This implies that,\nlike DNNs, there is a utility to depth, but unlike DNNs, the family of DSFs\nstrictly increase with depth. Despite this, we show (using a \"backpropagation\"\nlike method) that DSFs, even with arbitrarily large $k$, do not comprise all\nsubmodular functions.

We present a novel method for automatic seizure detection\nbased on iEEG data that outperforms current state-of-the-art seizure detection\nmethods in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy.\nThe proposed algorithm incorporates an automatic channel selection (ACS) engine\nas a pre-processing stage to the seizure detection procedure. The ACS engine\nconsists of supervised classifiers which aim to find iEEGchannelswhich\ncontribute the most to a seizure. Seizure detection stage involves feature\nextraction and classification. Feature extraction is performed in both\nfrequency and time domains where spectral power and correlation between channel\npairs are calculated. Random Forest is used in classification of interictal,\nictal and early ictal periods of iEEG signals. Seizure detection in this paper\nis retrospective and patient-specific. iEEG data is accessed via Kaggle,\nprovided by International Epilepsy Electro-physiology Portal. The dataset\nincludes a training set of 6.5 hours of interictal data and 41 minin ictal data\nand a test set of 9.14 hours. Compared to the state-of-the-art on the same\ndataset, we achieve 49.4% increase in computational efficiency and 400 mins\nbetter in average for detection delay. The proposed model is able to detect a\nseizure onset at 91.95% sensitivity and 94.05% specificity with a mean\ndetection delay of 2.77 s. The area under the curve (AUC) is 96.44%, that is\ncomparable to the current state-of-the-art with AUC of 96.29%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 10:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

A common approach used in\nphylogenetics to build a phylogenetic network on $X$ involves constructing it\nfrom networks on subsets of $X$.

This problem is closely related to the\n(in)famous reconstruction conjecture in graph theory but, as we shall show,\npresents distinct challenges. We show that some large classes of phylogenetic\nnetworks are reconstructible from their $X$-deck. This includes phylogenetic\ntrees, binary networks containing at least one non-trivial cut-edge, and binary\nlevel-4 networks (the level of a network measures how far it is from being a\ntree).

Essentially, a phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic\ngraph having a unique root in which the leaves are labelled by a given set of\nspecies. Recently, some approaches have been developed to construct\nphylogenetic networks from collections of networks on 2- and 3-leaved networks,\nwhich are known as binets and trinets, respectively. Here we study in more\ndepth properties of collections of binets, one of the simplest possible types\nof networks into which a phylogenetic network can be decomposed. More\nspecifically, we show that if a collection of level-1 binets is compatible with\nsome binary network, then it is also compatible with a binary level-1 network.\nOur proofs are based on useful structural results concerning lowest stable\nancestors in networks. In addition, we show that, although the binets do not\ndetermine the topology of the network, they do determine the number of\nreticulations in the network, which is one of its most important parameters. We\nalso consider algorithmic questions concerning binets. We show that deciding\nwhether an arbitrary set of binets is compatible with some network is at least\nas hard as the well-known Graph Isomorphism problem. However, if we restrict to\nlevel-1 binets, it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether there\nexists a binary network that displays all the binets. We also show that to find\na network that displays a maximum number of the binets is NP-hard, but that\nthere exists a simple polynomial-time 1/3-approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. It is hoped that these results will eventually assist in the\ndevelopment of new methods for constructing phylogenetic networks from\ncollections of smaller networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 11:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

For this reason, fast and\naccurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost\nimportance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking\nAnalysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their\ndiffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA\nfollows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement\n(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\\propto t$). However, we show\nthat NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,\ni.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour\n(MSD $\\propto t^\\alpha$, $0<\\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present\na range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is\nalso related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge\ndiscrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with\nthe direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the\nFinite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is\nlimited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the\nmodels of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of\na particle and the generalized diffusion constant.

The algorithm stems from the finding that the\nshortest delivery time or delay is obtained when the load is semi-equalized\nthroughout the network. In addition, we prove that, with Local Voting, the\nnetwork system converges asymptotically towards the optimal scheduling.\nMoreover, through extensive simulations, the performance of Local Voting is\nfurther investigated in comparison with several representative scheduling\nalgorithms from the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves better performance than the other distributed algorithms in\nterms of average delay, maximum delay, and fairness.

In this contribution we first summarize the\nphysical mechanisms by which the momentum and energy output from a population\nof massive stars and associated supernovae can drive galactic winds.

The number of repeating $n$-chords,\nor points which are turned into themselves during a circular permutation,\n$T_n$, of their coordinates, is inferred from algebraic considerations.\nFinally, the total number of $n$-chords and the number of $T_n$ set classes are\ndetermined. Palindrome and pseudo palindrome $n$-chords are defined and\nincluded among repeating $n$-chords, with regard to an equivalence relation,\n$T_n/T_nI$, where reflection is added to circular permutation. To this respect,\nthe number of $T_n$ set classes is inferred concerning palindrome and pseudo\npalindrome $n$-chords and the remaining $n$-chords. The above results are\nreproduced within the framework of a geometrical interpretation, where positive\ninteger points related to $n$-chords of cardinality, $n$, belong to a regular\ninclined $n$-hedron, $\\Psi_{12}^n$, the vertexes lying on the coordinate axes\nof a Cartesian orthogonal reference frame at a distance, $x_i=12$, $1\\le i\\le\nn$, from the origin. Considering $\\Psi_{12}^n$ as special cases of lattice\npolytopes, the number of related nonnegative integer points is also determined\nfor completeness. A comparison is performed with the results inferred from\ngroup theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 09:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

The method only requires that either the power\nseries solution or some truncation of the power series solution be available\nand that some asymptotic behavior of the solution is known away from the\nseries' expansion point. Here, we formalize the method of asymptotic\napproximants that has found recent success in its application to thermodynamic\nvirial series where only a few to (at most) a dozen series coefficients are\ntypically known. We demonstrate how asymptotic approximants may be constructed\nusing simple recurrence relations, obtained through the use of a few known\nrules of series manipulation. The result is an approximant that bridges two\nasymptotic regions of the unknown exact solution, while maintaining accuracy\nin-between. A general algorithm is provided to construct such approximants. To\ndemonstrate the versatility of the method, approximants are constructed for\nthree nonlinear problems relevant to mathematical physics: the Sakiadis\nboundary layer, the Blasius boundary layer, and the Flierl-Petviashvili\nmonopole. The power series solution to each of these problems is underspecified\nsince, in the absence of numerical simulation, one lower-order coefficient is\nnot known; consequently, higher-order coefficients that depend recursively on\nthis coefficient are also unknown. The constructed approximants are capable of\npredicting this unknown coefficient as well as other important properties\ninherent to each problem. The approximants lead to new benchmark values for the\nSakiadis boundary layer and agree with recent numerical values for properties\nof the Blasius boundary layer and Flierl-Petviashvili monopole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 20:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

Nuclear\nquantum effects were included through a Langevin dynamics in a bath of quantum\nharmonic oscillators.\n  We confirm that under increasing pressure delta-AlOOH undergoes a phase\ntransition from a $P2_1nm$ structure with asymmetric and disordered O-H bonds\nto a stiffer $Pnnm$ phase with symmetric hydrogen bonds, which should be stable\nwithin the pressure and temperature ranges typical for the Earth's mantle.\n  The transition is initially triggered by proton tunneling, which makes the\nmean proton position to coincide with the midpoint of the O-O distance, at\npressures as low as 10 GPa. However, only at much larger pressures, around 30\nGPa as previously found by other calculations, the Pnnm phase with symmetric\nhydrogen bonds is stable from the classical point of view.\n  The transition is also characterized through the analysis of the H-O\nstretching modes, which soften considerably and fade out around 10 GPa in the\nP2_1nm structure, when thermal and nuclear quantum effects are taken into\naccount in the simulations. At variance, the harmonic picture is not adequate\nto describe the highly anharmonic effective potential that is seen by the\nprotons at the transition.\n  Finally, we propose that the picture of a dynamical transition to the\nhigh-symmetry and proton-centered Pnnm phase, which is brought about by the\nonset of proton tunneling, could be confirmed by quasi-elastic neutron\nscattering and vibrational spectroscopy under pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 17:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}
