It employs two independent optical readouts of the interferometer test\nmasses, featuring strongly different values of the bandwidths $\\gamma_{1,2}$\nand of the optical circulating power $I_{1,2}$, with the special relationship\nof $I_1/I_2=\\gamma_1/\\gamma_2$. The outputs of these two position meters have\nto be combined by an additional beamsplitter. In this scheme, signals at the\ncommon and the differential outputs of the interferometer setup are\nproportional to the position and the velocity of the test masses, respectively.\nThe influence of the position meter-like back action force associated with the\nposition signal can be cancelled using the EPR approach by measuring the\namplitude quadrature of the beamsplitter common output correlated with this\nforce. In the standard signal-recycled Michelson interferometer topology of the\nmodern gravitational-wave detectors, two independent optical position meters\ncan be implemented by two orthogonal polarisations of the probe light. Our\nanalysis shows that the EPR speedmeter provides significantly improved\nsensitivity for all frequencies below $\\sim 30\\,{\\rm Hz}$ compared to an\nequivalent signal recycled Michelson interferometer. We believe the EPR\nspeedmeter scheme to be very attractive for future upgrades of gravitational\nwave detectors, because it requires only minor changes to be implemented in the\ninterferometer hardware and allows to switch between the position meter and the\nspeed meter modes within short time-scales and without any changes to the\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 17:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

From the comparison of shock\nmodels with the observed line ratios, and the kinematics observed from the FPI\ndata, we constrain the physical properties of the observed outflow.

Our analysis exploits the fact\nthat halo bias factors satisfy consistency relations which encode this physics,\nand that these relations are the same even for sub-populations in which\nassembly bias has played a role. We illustrate our methods using a model in\nwhich three parameters matter: a density threshold, the local slope and the\ncurvature of the smoothed density field.

In contrast, here we need only consider a single\nsystem and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable\nunder a weaker form of reversibility. More precisely, we show that given a\nsingle copy of any athermal quantum state we may extract a maximal amount of\nenergy from the state when we can use a machine that operates in a reversible\ncycle and whose state is left unchanged. This means that for individual systems\nthe only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is\ncomplete passivity, and thus provides a single-shot and more physically\nmotivated identification of thermal states and the emergence of temperature.\nThe machine which extracts work from passive states exploits the fact that one\ncan find a subspace which acts as a virtual hot reservoir, and a subspace which\nacts as a virtual cold reservoir.

In this paper we determine the distribution of the heavy elements in\nproto-Jupiter and determine the mass and composition of the core. We find that\nwhile the outer envelope of proto-Jupiter is typically convective and has an\nhomogeneous composition, the innermost regions have compositional gradients. In\naddition, the existence of heavy elements in the envelope leads to much higher\ninternal temperatures (several times 10$^4$ K) than in the case of a\nhydrogen-helium envelope. The derived core mass depends on the actual\ndefinition of the core: if the core is defined as the region in which the\nheavy-element mass fraction is above some limit (say 0.5), then it can be much\nmore massive ($\\sim$ 15 M$_{\\oplus}$) and more extended (10\\% of the planet's\nradius) than in the case where the core is just the region with 100\\% heavy\nelements.

The distribution of elements in galaxies forms an important\ndiagnostic tool to characterize the system's formation and evolution.

This renders\nobservations of the full optical extent of galaxies down to sub-kpc scales\nessential. Aims. Using the WiFeS integral field spectrograph, we previously\ndetected abrupt and localized variations in the gas-phase oxygen abundance of\nthe spiral galaxy HCG91c. Here, we follow-up on these observations to map\nHCG91c's disk out to ~2Re at a resolution of 600pc, and characterize the\nnon-radial variations of the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the system. Methods.\nWe obtained deep MUSE observations of the target under ~0.6 arcsec seeing\nconditions. We perform both a spaxel-based and aperture-based analysis of the\ndata to map the spatial variations of 12+log(O/H) across the disk of the\ngalaxy. Results. We confirm the presence of rapid variations of the oxygen\nabundance across the entire extent of the galaxy previously detected with\nWiFeS, for all azimuths and radii.

They are commonly believed not to have formed in situ,\nrequiring inwards migration towards the host star. One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this\npossibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in\ntwo hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ\nformation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at\nmost a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the\nsimulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly\nto studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters. HJs\nare only formed in our simulations for triples with specific orbital\nconfigurations, and our constraints are approximately consistent with current\nobservations. In future, this allows to rule out high-$e$ migration in stellar\ntriples if a HJ is detected in a triple grossly violating these constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

EMT can also be co-opted by cancer cells to\nacquire metastatic potential and drug-resistance. Recent research has argued\nthat epithelial (E) cells can undergo either a partial EMT to attain a hybrid\nepithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that typically displays collective\nmigration, or a complete EMT to adopt a mesenchymal (M) phenotype that shows\nindividual migration. The core EMT regulatory network -\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 - has been identified by various studies, but how\nthis network regulates the transitions among the E, E/M, and M phenotypes\nremains controversial. Two major mathematical models - ternary chimera switch\n(TCS) and cascading bistable switches (CBS) - that both focus on the\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 network, have been proposed to elucidate the EMT\ndynamics, but a detailed analysis of how well either or both of these two\nmodels can capture recent experimental observations about EMT dynamics remains\nto be done. Results: Here, via an integrated experimental and theoretical\napproach, we first show that both these two models can be used to understand\nthe two-step transition of EMT - E-E/M-M, the different responses of SNAIL and\nZEB1 to exogenous TGF-b and the irreversibility of complete EMT. Next, we\npresent new experimental results that tend to discriminate between these two\nmodels. We show that ZEB1 is present at intermediate levels in the hybrid E/M\nH1975 cells, and that in HMLE cells, overexpression of SNAIL is not sufficient\nto initiate EMT in the absence of ZEB1 and FOXC2.

The method\nrelies on a new non-Euclidean proximity operator for the data fidelity term,\nthat generalises the projection onto the $\\ell_2$ ball where the noise lives\nfor naturally weighted data, to the projection onto a generalised ellipsoid\nincorporating sampling density information through uniform weighting.\nImportantly, this non-Euclidean modification is only an acceleration strategy\nto solve the convex imaging problem with data fidelity dictated only by noise\nstatistics. We showcase through simulations with realistic sampling patterns\nthe acceleration obtained using the preconditioning. We also investigate the\nalgorithm performance for the reconstruction of the 3C129 radio galaxy from\nreal visibilities and compare with multi-scale CLEAN, showing better\nsensitivity and resolution.

This approach extends the concept of magnetic flux tube evolution to\ninclude the effects of finite particle momentum and enables visualization of\nthe topology of plasma jets in regimes beyond MHD. A flared, current-carrying\nmagnetic flux tube in an ion-electron plasma with finite ion momentum is thus\nequivalent to either a pair of electron and ion flow flux tubes, a pair of\nelectron and ion canonical momentum flux tubes, or a pair of electron and ion\ncanonical vorticity flux tubes.

Quantum tomography\n(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout\ndevices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is\nexpensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy\nclassical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new\nmethods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and\nerrors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information\nexperiments.\n  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods\npossible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information\nis prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which\nrequire pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,\nmost experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that\nwhen this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer\nresources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.\nMoreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the\nprocess is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such\ncompelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on\nquantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature\nof quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.\n  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new\nmethods in an experimental setting. The physical system is an ensemble of\nlaser-cooled cesium atoms in the laboratory of Prof. Poul Jessen. Experiments\nwere conducted by Hector Sosa-Martinez et al. to demonstrate different QT\nprotocols.

Finding the best physical implementation for such technologies is an\nimportant research topic and using optical effects is a promising route towards\nthis goal. It was theoretically shown that optical quantum computing is\npossible using only single-photon sources and detectors, and linear optical\ncircuits. An experimental implementation of such quantum optical circuits\nrequires a stable, robust and scalable architecture. This can be achieved via\nminiaturization of the optical devices in the form of photonic integrated\ncircuits (PICs). The development of a suitable material platform for such PICs\ncould therefore have a large impact on future technologies. Diamond is a\nparticularly attractive material here, as it naturally offers a range of\noptically active defects, which can act as single-photon sources, quantum\nmemories, or sensor elements. Besides its excellent optical properties, diamond\nalso has a very high Young's modulus, which is important for optomechanics, and\ncan be employed for potentially fast and low-loss tuning of PICs after\nfabrication. In this work, components for future quantum optical circuits are\ndeveloped. This includes the first diamond optomechanical elements, as well as\nthe first integrated single-photon detectors on a diamond material platform.\nDiamond micromechanical resonators with high quality factors are realized and\ntheir actuation via optical gradient forces and electrostatic forces is\ndemonstrated.

In addition, our general\nformula is applied to asymptotic analysis for a stationary memoryless source.\nAs a result, we derive a single-letter characterization of the optimal rate by\nusing the rate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 08:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 09:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

Therefore, a tradeoff\nbetween the interest of railway operator and the service quality of passengers\nneeds to be addressed.

However, resolving MHz energy splittings with ultrashort laser pulses\nhas still remained a challenge. Here, we analyze two-dimensional Fourier\nspectra for resonant optical excitation of resident electrons to localized\ntrions or donor-bound excitons in semiconductor nanostructures subject to a\ntransverse magnetic field. Particular attention is devoted to Raman coherence\nspectra which allow one to accurately evaluate tiny splittings of the electron\nground state and to determine the relaxation times in the electron spin\nensemble. A stimulated step-like Raman process induced by a sequence of two\nlaser pulses creates a coherent superposition of the ground state doublet which\ncan be retrieved only optically due to selective excitation of the same\nsub-ensemble with a third pulse.

The interest is mainly\nfocused on the assessment of suspension behaviour and, thus, on the\nidentification of the so-called vehicle rigid body modes. But issues arise when\nthe operational identification of a vehicle system is performed, basically\nrelated to the nature of the loads induced by the roughness of rolling\nprofiles. The forces exerted on the wheels, in fact, depending on their\nlocation, are affected by time and/or spatial correlation, and, more over, do\nnot fit the form of white noise sequences. Thus, the nature of the excitation\nstrongly violate the hypotheses on which the formulation of classical OMA modal\nmodel relies, leading to pronounced modelling errors and, in turn, to poorly\nestimated modal parameters. In this paper, we develop a specialised modal\nmodel, that we refer to as the Track-Vehicle Interaction Modal Model, able to\nincorporate the character of road/rail inputs acting on vehicles during\noperation. Since in this novel modal model the relationship between vehicle\nsystem outputs and modal parameters is given explicitly, the development of new\nspecific curve fitting techniques, in the time-lag or frequency domain, is now\npossible, making available simple and cost-effective tools for vehicle\noperational identification. More over, a second, but not less important outcome\nof the proposed modal model is the usage of the resulting techniques for the\nindirect characterisation of rolling surface roughness, that can be used to\nimprove comfort and safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 15:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}
