Multilayer networks,\nin their multiplex form, have been introduced within the last three years to\nanalysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have\nmodelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial\ninstitutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a\nnon-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising\nthe same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No\nmechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically\nevaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive\ncontagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an\ninterconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial\ninstitutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity\nwithin different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial\nmarket. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and\nresilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion\nmechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost\nstabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their\ninterconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion\nprogressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly\naffect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural\nresilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each\ninstitution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate\nthe new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel\nstabilisation are confirmed empirically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 15:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 22:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 03:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2017 09:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

In this paper, we present a strongly explicit construction of\n$\\mathcal{M}$ for when the number of defective items is at most 2, with the\nnumber of tests $t \\simeq 16 \\log{N} = O(\\log{N})$. In particular, we need only\n$K \\simeq N \\times 16\\log{N} = O(N\\log{N})$ bits to construct such matrices,\nwhich is optimal. Furthermore, given these $K$ bits, any entry in the matrix\ncan be constructed in time $O \\left(\\ln{N}/ \\ln{\\ln{N}} \\right)$. Moreover,\n$\\mathcal{M}$ can be decoded with high probability in time $O\\left(\n\\frac{\\ln^2{N}}{\\ln^2{\\ln{N}}} \\right)$. When the number of defective items is\ngreater than 2, we present a scheme that can identify at least $(1-\\epsilon)d$\ndefective items with $t \\simeq 32 C(\\epsilon) d \\log{N} = O(d \\log{N})$ in time\n$O \\left( d \\frac{\\ln^2{N}}{\\ln^2{\\ln{N}}} \\right)$ for any close-to-zero\n$\\epsilon$, where $C(\\epsilon)$ is a constant that depends only on $\\epsilon$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 17:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 06:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 08:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 06:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

The model is\nminimally based on first principles, as conservation of energy and mass\nrecycling. The inflow occurs via chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of cold\nclouds condensing out of the quenched cooling flow and recurrently funneled via\ninelastic collisions. Within 100s gravitational radii, the accretion energy is\ntransformed into ultrafast 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$ outflows (UFOs) ejecting most of\nthe inflowing mass. At larger radii the energy-driven outflow entrains\nprogressively more mass: at roughly kpc scale, the velocities of the\nhot/warm/cold outflows are a few 10$^3$, 1000, 500 km s$^{-1}$, with median\nmass rates ~10, 100, several 100 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The unified\nCCA model is consistent with the observations of nuclear UFOs, and ionized,\nneutral, and molecular macro outflows. We provide step-by-step implementation\nfor subgrid simulations, (semi)analytic works, or observational interpretations\nwhich require self-regulated AGN feedback at coarse scales, avoiding the\na-posteriori fine-tuning of efficiencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 12:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

We show that the size distributions are\nconsistent with log-normal, which severely limits the number of model\nparameters in any SNR population synthesis model. Simple Monte Carlo\nsimulations demonstrate that the size distribution is indistinguishable from\nlog-normal when the SNR sample size is less than 600.

Energy bands in NGS correspond to special\nrelativity, the latter is analogous to two-band k.p description for NGS.\nMaximum electron velocity in NGS is u=(okolo)1x 10^8 cm/s corresponding to the\nlight velocity. An effective mass of electrons in semiconductors is introduced\nrelating their velocity to quasimomentum. This mass depends on energy similarly\nto the mass of relativistic electrons. In Hg_(1-x)Cd_(x)Te alloys one can reach\nvanishing energy gap at which electrons and light holes are 3D massless Dirac\nfermions. Wavelength lam_z is defined for NGS, in analogy to the Compton\nwavelength, lam_z is around tens of Angstroms in semiconducting materials, in\nagreement with tunneling experiments. Interband electron tunneling in NGS is in\nclose analogy to tunneling between negative and positive energies of the Dirac\nequation. Relativistic analogy holds for orbital and spin properties of\nelectrons in an external magnetic field. The spin magnetic moment of both NGS\nelectrons and relativistic electrons approaches zero with increasing energy.\nElectrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields are described. It is the\nsemirelativistic two-band description that gives a correct account of\nexperiments in this situation. A transverse Doppler shift is observed in\ncrossed fields indicating that there exists a time dilatation between an\nelectron and an observer. Phenomenon of Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion)\nfor semiconductor electrons follows an analogy to free relativistic electrons.\nGraphene, carbon nanotubes, topological insulators illustrate extreme\nsemirelativistic regime. Approximations and restrictions of the relativistic\nanalogy are emphasized. It is often easier to observe semirelativistic effects\nin semiconductors than relativistic effects in vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 20:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The degree of neutronization in\nSN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the\nmetallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior\nto the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization\nusing Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs).\nApplying this method to \\textit{Suzaku} data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397 and\nG337.2$-$0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find\nthat the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho\nand Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source\nof neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to\ninfer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied\nmetallicities of 3C 397, G337.2$-$0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to\nthe local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that\nprogenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for\nthese SNRs.

As a result, multiple users in the vicinity of an RRH can simultaneously\ntransmit pilots on the same pilot dimension (and thus interfering with one\nanother). Each RRH performs rudimentary processing of the pilot observations in\n\"sectors\". In a sector, the RRH is able to resolve a scheduled user's channel\nwhen that user is determined to be the only one among the scheduled users (on\nthe same pilot dimension) with significant received power in the sector.\nSubsequently, only the subset of scheduled users whose channels are resolved in\nat least one sector can be served by the system.\n  We consider a spatially consistent evaluation of the area multiplexing gains\nby means of a Poisson Point Process (PPP) problem formulation where RRHs,\nblockers, scatterers and scheduled user terminals are all PPPs with individual\nintensities. Also, we study directional training at the user terminals.

However, the predictive\ncapabilities of RANS models are limited by potential inaccuracy driven by\nhypotheses in the Reynolds stress closure. Recently, a Physics-Informed Machine\nLearning (PIML) approach has been proposed to learn the functional form of\nReynolds stress discrepancy in RANS simulations based on available data. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the learned discrepancy function can be used to improve\nReynolds stresses in different flows where data are not available. However,\nowing to a number of challenges, the improvements have been demonstrated only\nin the Reynolds stress prediction but not in the corresponding propagated\nquantities of interest. In this work, we introduce the procedures toward a\ncomplete PIML framework for predictive turbulence modeling, including learning\nReynolds stress discrepancy function, predicting Reynolds stresses in different\nflows, and propagating to mean flow fields. The process of Reynolds stress\npropagation and predictive accuracy of the propagated velocity field are\ninvestigated. To improve the learning-prediction performance, the input\nfeatures are enriched based on an integrity basis of invariants. The fully\ndeveloped turbulent flow in a square duct is used as the test case. The\ndiscrepancy model is trained on flow fields obtained from several Reynolds\nnumbers and evaluated on a duct flow at a Reynolds number higher than any of\nthe training cases.

Similarly, dependencies exist\nwithin the networks itself. It is essential to have a model which captures\nthese dependencies precisely.

The limitations of the aforementioned\nmodels have been overcome by the Implicative Interdependency Model, which uses\nBoolean Logic to denote the dependencies. This paper formulates the Entity\nHardening problem and the Targeted Entity Hardening problem using the\nImplicative Interdependency Model. The Entity Hardening problem describes a\nsituation where an operator, with a limited budget, must decide which entities\nto harden, which in turn would minimize the damage, provided a set of entities\nfail initially. The Targeted Entity Hardening problem is a restricted version\nof the Entity Hardening problem. This problem presents a scenario where, the\nprotection of certain entities is of higher priority.

The aim of\nthe present paper is to develop a numerical algorithm for slowly diffusing\nsolutions of a perturbed integrable Hamiltonian system that will apply to the\nrepresentation of the chaotic planetary motions with varying frequencies. By\nsimple analytical considerations, we first argue that it is possible to recover\nexactly a single varying frequency.

In this paper, we show that this representation\nbias can be greatly reduced by discretization. Discretization is a common\nprocedure in machine learning that is used to convert a quantitative attribute\ninto a qualitative one. It is often motivated by the limitation of some\nlearners to qualitative data. Discretization loses information, as fewer\ndistinctions between instances are possible using discretized data relative to\nundiscretized data. In consequence, where discretization is not essential, it\nmight appear desirable to avoid it.

This is partly due to the\nambiguity of the energy spectrum of individual composition. Recently, direct\nmeasurements from several balloon/satellite-borne detectors found significant\nspectral hardenings of cosmic ray nuclei at a few hundred GV rigidities. A\njoint modeling of the direct and indirect measurements of the cosmic ray\nspectra may help to understand the experimental systematics and probably the\nphysics of the knee. In this work, we update the phenomenological \"poly-gonato\"\nmodel of the knee to include the spectral hardenings, with a changing spectral\nindex of $\\gamma + \\beta \\cdot \\log E$ with respect to energy. We find that\nthere is some tension between the direct and indirect measurements.\nSpecifically, the hard spectra of CREAM suggest a relatively low energy cutoff\nof the individual cosmic ray spectrum around the knee, which is inconsistent\nwith the light component spectra of the air shower measurements.

These representations are derived through\ncascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode\nthe output of preceding stages. Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve\nunderstanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures.\nAlthough models exist in the visual domain to explain how mid-level features\nsuch as junctions and curves might be derived from oriented filters in early\nvisual cortex, little is known about analogous grouping principles for\nmid-level auditory representations. We propose a hierarchical generative model\nof natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from\nnatural stimulus statistics. In the first layer the model forms a sparse\nconvolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned\nspectrotemporal kernels. To generalize from specific kernel activation\npatterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of\nmultiple first layer coefficients. Because second-layer features are sensitive\nto combinations of spectrotemporal features, the representation they support\nencodes more complex acoustic patterns than the first layer. When trained on\ncorpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to\ngroup spectrotemporal features that occur together in natural sounds. Others\ninstantiate opponency between dissimilar sets of spectrotemporal features. Such\ngroupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a\nhypothesis for mid-level neuronal computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 02:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 19:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 21:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 02:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The efficiency of CN addition to unsaturated\nhydrocarbons boosts the abundances of nitriles in the model, and enhances the\nratio of straight-to-branched molecule production.

The IB\nformulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian\nrepresentation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled\nby integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB\nequations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta\nfunction kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to\nspread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional\nIB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated\nLagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can\ncause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is\nespecially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences\nacross thin structural boundaries. The aim of this paper is to greatly reduce\nthe volume error of the IB method by introducing velocity-interpolation and\nforce-spreading schemes with the properties that the interpolated velocity\nfield in which the structure moves is at least C1 and satisfies a continuous\ndivergence-free condition, and that the force-spreading operator is the adjoint\nof the velocity-interpolation operator. We confirm through numerical\nexperiments in two and three spatial dimensions that this new IB method is able\nto achieve substantial improvement in volume conservation compared to other\nexisting IB methods, at the expense of a modest increase in the computational\ncost. Further, the new method provides smoother Lagrangian forces (tractions)\nthan traditional IB methods. The method presented here is restricted to\nperiodic computational domains. Its generalization to non-periodic domains is\nimportant future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 05:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 19:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Although these methods differ essentially in many aspects, a\ncommon practice of them is to specifically align the facial area based on the\nprior knowledge of human face structure before feature extraction. In most\nsystems, the face alignment module is implemented independently. This has\nactually caused difficulties in the designing and training of end-to-end face\nrecognition models. In this paper we study the possibility of alignment\nlearning in end-to-end face recognition, in which neither prior knowledge on\nfacial landmarks nor artificially defined geometric transformations are\nrequired. Specifically, spatial transformer layers are inserted in front of the\nfeature extraction layers in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face\nrecognition. Only human identity clues are used for driving the neural network\nto automatically learn the most suitable geometric transformation and the most\nappropriate facial area for the recognition task. To ensure reproducibility,\nour model is trained purely on the publicly available CASIA-WebFace dataset,\nand is tested on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g.~by transfer of a\npre-trained classifier or unsupervised adaptive classification methods which\nlearn from scratch and adapt over time. While such heuristics work well in\npractice, none of them can provide theoretical guarantees. Our objective is to\nmodify an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to work in unison with the\nmachine learning decoder to achieve a reliable calibration-less decoding with a\nguarantee to recover the true class means.\n  Method: We introduce learning from label proportions (LLP) to the BCI\ncommunity as a new unsupervised, and easy-to-implement classification approach\nfor ERP-based BCIs. The LLP estimates the mean target and non-target responses\nbased on known proportions of these two classes in different groups of the\ndata. We modified a visual ERP speller to meet the requirements of the LLP. For\nevaluation, we ran simulations on artificially created data sets and conducted\nan online BCI study with N=13 subjects performing a copy-spelling task.\n  Results: Theoretical considerations show that LLP is guaranteed to minimize\nthe loss function similarly to a corresponding supervised classifier. It\nperformed well in simulations and in the online application, where 84.5% of\ncharacters were spelled correctly on average without prior calibration.\n  Significance: The continuously adapting LLP classifier is the first\nunsupervised decoder for ERP BCIs guaranteed to find the true class means. This\nmakes it an ideal solution to avoid a tedious calibration and to tackle\nnon-stationarities in the data. Additionally, LLP works on complementary\nprinciples compared to existing unsupervised methods, allowing for their\nfurther enhancement when combined with LLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 09:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

We also consider the interaction of the BTZ black\nhole with test fields. We show that overspinning of nearly extremal black holes\nis possible whether or not there is superradiance for the field. If there is\nsuperradiance, overspinning occurs in a narrow range of frequencies bounded\nbelow by the super-radiant limit.

This problem is\ncalled \"surface effect\" and a key ingredient to solve it is turbulent pressure\nfor the computation of both the equilibrium models and the oscillations. While\n3D hydrodynamic simulations help to include properly the turbulent pressure in\nthe equilibrium models, the way this surface effect is included in the\ncomputation of stellar oscillations is still subject to uncertainties. We aim\nat determining how to properly include the effect of turbulent pressure and its\nLagrangian perturbation in the adiabatic computation of the oscillations. We\nalso discuss the validity of the gas-gamma model (GGM) and reduced gamma model\n(RGM) approximations, which have been used to compute adiabatic oscillations of\nequilibrium models including turbulent pressure. We use a patched model of the\nSun with an inner part constructed by a 1D stellar evolution code (CESTAM) and\nan outer part by the 3D hydrodynamical code (CO$^5$BOLD). Then, the adiabatic\noscillations are computed using the ADIPLS code for the GGM and RGM and with\nthe MAD code imposing the adiabatic condition on an existing time-dependent\nconvection (TDC) formalism. We show that the computation of the oscillations\nusing the TDC formalism in the adiabatic limit improves significantly the\nagreement with the observed frequencies compared to the GGM and RGM. Of the\ncomponents of the turbulent pressure perturbation, the perturbation of the\ndensity and advection term is found to contribute most to the frequency shift.\nWe propose a formalism to evaluate the frequency shift due to the inclusion of\nthe term with the turbulent pressure perturbation in the variational principle\nin order to extrapolate our result to other stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 10:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Be/BH binaries\nare important in the context of binary system evolution and sources of\ndetectable gravitational waves because they are possible precursors of\ncoalescing neutron star/BH binaries. X-ray observations conducted in 2013\nrevealed that MWC 656 is a quiescent high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), opening the\npossibility to explore X-ray/radio correlations and the accretion/ejection\ncoupling down to low luminosities for BH HMXBs. Here we report on a deep joint\nChandra/VLA observation of MWC 656 (and contemporaneous optical data) conducted\nin 2015 July that has allowed us to unambiguously identify the X-ray\ncounterpart of the source. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law\nwith $\\Gamma\\sim2$, providing a flux of $\\simeq4\\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-8 keV energy range and a luminosity of $L_{\\rm\nX}\\simeq3\\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a 2.6 kpc distance.

The obtained X-ray/radio luminosities for\nthis quiescent BH HMXB are fully compatible with those of the X-ray/radio\ncorrelations derived from quiescent BH low-mass X-ray binaries.

A so-called polaron transformation is then used to make\nthe problem in the strong system-environment coupling regime tractable. We find\nthat the strong coupling case exhibits quantitative and qualitative differences\nas compared with the weak coupling case. In particular, the effective decay\nrate does not depend linearly on the spectral density of the environment. This\nthen means that, in the strong coupling regime that we investigate, increasing\nthe system-environment coupling strength can actually decrease the effective\ndecay rate. We also consider a collection of two-level atoms coupled strongly\nwith a common environment.

Aims: Since the source is known for being a\nradio emitter, we investigated about the presence and the properties of a\nnon-thermal component. Methods: We observed IRAS 17020+4544 with the Very Long\nBaseline Array at 5, 8, 15, and 24 GHz within a month of the 2014 XMM-Newton\nobservations. We further analysed archival data taken in 2000 and 2012.\nResults: We detect the source at 5 GHz and on short baselines at 8 GHz. At 15\nand 24 GHz, the source is below our baseline sensitivity for fringe fitting,\nindicating the lack of prominent compact features. The morphology is that of an\nasymmetric double, with significant diffuse emission. The spectrum between 5\nand 8 GHz is rather steep ($S(\\nu)\\sim\\nu^{-(1.0\\pm0.2)}$). Our re-analysis of\nthe archival data at 5 and 8 GHz provides results consistent with the new\nobservations, suggesting that flux density and structural variability are not\nimportant in this source. We put a limit on the separation speed between the\nmain components of $<0.06c$. Conclusions: IRAS 17020+4544 shows interesting\nfeatures of several classes of objects: its properties are typical of compact\nsteep spectrum sources, low power compact sources, radio-emitting narrow line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. However, it can not be classified in any of these\ncategories, remaining so far a one-of-a-kind object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 13:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

This randomness can be translated into\nthe cryptographic keys thus avoiding the need to store and manage the device\ncryptographic keys.

Raw images are in the\nform of triangulated surfaces and the first step is to create a standardised\nrepresentation of surface shape which provides a meaningful correspondence\nacross different images, to provide a basis for statistical analysis. Point\nlocations with anatomical definitions, referred to as landmarks, have been the\ntraditional approach, with analysis and interpretation which is widely used and\nwell understood. Landmarks can also be taken as the starting point for more\ngeneral surface representations, often using templates which are warped on to\nan observed surface by matching landmark positions and subsequent local\nadjustment of the surface. The aim of the present paper is to use the\nintermediate structures of ridge and valley curves to capture the principal\nfeatures of the manifold (surface) of interest. Landmarks are used as anchoring\npoints, as usual, but curvature information across the surface is used to guide\nthe curve locations. Once the ridges and valleys have been located, the\nintervening surface patches are relatively flat and can be represented in a\nstandardised manner by appropriate surface transects, to give a complete\nsurface model. However, the intermediate curve representation is of\nconsiderable interest in its own right, as it captures the principal features\nof the surface and therefore embodies much of the shape information on the\nobject of interest.\n  Methods of identifying these curves are described and evaluated. While the\nmethods are generic, the human face is used as an important application. In\nparticular, the models are used to investigate sexual dimorphism (the\ndifferences in shape between male and female faces). The curve representation\nis shown to capture a major component of the relevant information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 14:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

While typical erasure codes can provide\na significant storage advantage over replication, they suffer from poor repair\nefficiency. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) tackle this issue by reducing the\nnumber of nodes participating in the repair process (locality), at the cost of\nreduced minimum distance. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between locality\nand minimum distance of LRCs with local codes that have arbitrary distance\nrequirements. Unlike existing methods where both the locality and the local\ndistance requirements imposed on every node are identical, we allow the\nrequirements to vary arbitrarily from node to node. Such a property can be an\nadvantage for distributed storage systems with non-homogeneous characteristics.\nWe present Singleton-type distance upper bounds and also provide an optimal\ncode construction with respect to these bounds. In addition, the feasible rate\nregion is characterized by dimension upper bounds that do not depend on the\ndistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 14:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 09:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 04:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

However, sometimes this equation might give incorrect predictions for\nsome realistic geometries, in particular when the radius of the cable changes\nsignificantly. Cables with a non constant radius are important for some\nphenomena, for example discrete swellings along the axons appear in\nneurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, HIV-associated\ndementia and Multiple Sclerosis. In this paper, using the Frenet-Serret frame,\nwe propose a generalized cable equation for a general cable geometry. This\ngeneralized equation depends on geometric quantities such as the curvature and\ntorsion of the cable. We show that when the cable has a constant circular\ncross-section, the first fundamental form of the cable can be simplified and\nthe generalized cable equation depends on neither the curvature nor the torsion\nof the cable. Additionally, we find an exact solution for an ideal cable which\nhas a particular variable circular cross-section and zero curvature. For this\ncase we show that when the cross-section of the cable increases the voltage\ndecreases. Inspired in this ideal case, we rewrite the generalized cable\nequation as a diffusion equation with a source term generated by the cable\ngeometry. This source term depends on the cable cross-section area and its\nderivates. In addition, we study different cables with swelling and provide\ntheir numerical solutions. The numerical solutions show that when the\ncross-section of the cable has abrupt changes, its voltage is smaller than the\nvoltage in the cylindrical cable. Furthermore, these numerical solutions show\nthat the voltage can be affected by geometrical inhomogeneities on the cable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 20:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Many significant\nresearch have been pursued to model the interdependency and failure analysis of\nthese interdependent networks. However, most of these models fail to capture\nthe complex interdependencies that might actually exist between the\ninfrastructures. The \\emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} that utilizes\nBoolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which\novercome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were\nstudies based on this model. In this paper we study the \\textit{Robustness}\nproblem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network. The robustness is\ndefined with respect to two parameters $K \\in I^{+} \\cup \\{0\\}$ and $\\rho \\in\n(0,1]$. We utilized the \\emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} model to\ncapture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model\nclassifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational\ncomplexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial\ntime algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal\nsolution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An\nin-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case\nwe formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a\npolynomial time heuristic. The applicability of the heuristic is evaluated\nusing power and communication network data of Maricopa County, Arizona. The\nexperimental results showed that the heuristic almost always produced near\noptimal value of parameter $K$ for $\\rho < 0.42$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 23:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}

GR can compare losses of internal energy under\nspeed increases and can explain the attraction law by the body tendency toward\nequipartition of kinetic energies over internal and external degrees of\nfreedom. Thermodynamic approach numerically describes the cyclic dynamics of\nthe vertical fall to center with the final path deceleration followed by the\naccelerated rise as an oscillation around the kinetic energy equilibrium of\ngeodetically moving body and pushes other testable predictions for inertial\ncharges with heat in strong field gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 22:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Such dependencies causes failure in these infrastructures to cascade on\nan initial failure event. Owing to this vulnerability it is imperative to\nincorporate efficient strategies for their protection. Modifying dependencies\nby adding additional dependency implications using entities (termed as\n\\emph{auxiliary entities}) is shown to mitigate this issue to a certain extent.\nWith this finding, in this article we introduce the Auxiliary Entity Allocation\nproblem. The objective is to maximize protection in Power and Communication\ninfrastructures using a budget in number of dependency modifications using the\nauxiliary entities. The problem is proved to be NP-complete in general case. We\nprovide an optimal solution using Integer Linear program and a heuristic for a\nrestricted case. The efficacy of heuristic with respect to the optimal is\njudged through experimentation using real world data sets with heuristic\ndeviating $6.75 \\%$ from optimal on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 23:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}
