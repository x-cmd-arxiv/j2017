Deep imaging from LSST and Euclid will provide accurate photometry for\nspectroscopic targets beyond the reach of 4m class instruments. Such a facility\nwould revolutionise our understanding of the assembly and enrichment history of\nthe Milky Way and the role of dark matter through chemo-dynamical studies of\ntens of millions of stars in the Local Group. Emission and absorption line\nspectroscopy of redshift z=2-5 galaxies can be used to directly chart the\nevolution of the cosmic web and examine its connection with activity in\ngalaxies. The facility will also have synergistic impact, e.g. in following up\nlive and transpired transients found with LSST, as well as providing targets\nand the local environmental conditions for follow-up studies with E-ELT and\nfuture space missions. Although our study is exploratory, we highlight a\nspecific telescope design with a 5 square degree field of view and an\nadditional focus that could host a next-generation panoramic IFU.

Its popularity\narose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility, derived by\nheat kernel methods. As markets moved to historically low rates, this expansion\nappeared to yield inconsistent prices. Since the model is deeply embedded in\nmarket practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in\nnumerous approaches in recent years. All standard option pricing methods make\ncertain regularity assumptions on the underlying model, but for SABR these are\nrarely satisfied. We examine here regularity properties of the model from this\nperspective with view to a number of (asymptotic and numerical) option pricing\nmethods. In particular, we highlight delicate degeneracies of the SABR model\n(and related processes) at the origin, which deem the currently used popular\nheat kernel methods and all related methods from (sub-) Riemannian geometry\nill-suited for SABR-type processes, when interest rates are near zero. We\ndescribe a more general semigroup framework, which permits to derive a suitable\ngeometry for SABR-type processes (in certain parameter regimes) via symmetric\nDirichlet forms. Furthermore, we derive regularity properties (Feller-\nproperties and strong continuity properties) necessary for the applicability of\npopular numerical schemes to SABR-semigroups, and identify suitable Banach- and\nHilbert spaces for these. Finally, we comment on the short time and large time\nasymptotic behaviour of SABR-type processes beyond the heat-kernel framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 20:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

Starting from the results of a detailed, three-dimensional\nsimulation of the aftermath of a binary neutron star merger, we compute the\ndeposition rates over a time scale comparable to the life time of the disk ($t\n\\approx 0.4$ s), assuming a long-lived massive neutron star (MNS). We model\nneutrino emission using a spectral leakage scheme and compute the neutrino\nannihilation rates using a ray-tracing algorithm. We find that the presence of\nthe MNS increases the energy deposition rate by a factor $\\sim 2$, mainly due\nto the annihilation of radiation coming from the MNS with radiation coming from\nthe disk. We compute the impact of relativistic effects and discover that,\ndespite they can significantly change the local rate intensity, the\nvolume-integrated results are only marginally decreased. The cumulative\ndeposited energy, extrapolated to 1 sec, is $\\approx 2.2 \\times 10^{49} \\, {\\rm\nerg}$. A comparison with the inferred short GRB energetics reveals that in most\ncases this energy is not large enough, even assuming small jet opening angles\nand a long-lived MNS. Significantly more intense neutrino luminosities (a\nfactor ~5-10 larger) are required to explain most of the observed short GRB. We\nconclude that it is unlikely that neutrino pair annihilation can explain the\ncentral engine of short GRBs alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 21:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Specifically, we predict that an\nultrafast electric field pulse can cause a negative ECE up to 35 K in PbTiO$_3$\noccurring on few picosecond time scales. We acquire and analyze these results\nby clarifying the mechanism of ECE during an adiabatic irreversible process; In\naddition to the conventional explanation of the ECE with entropy reallocation,\nwe simply portray the ECE with the concept of internal energy redistribution.\nElectric field does work on a ferroelectric crystal and redistributes its\ninternal energy. How the kinetic energy is redistributed determines the\ntemperature change and strongly depends on the electric field temporal profile.\nThis concept is supported by our all--atom molecular dynamics simulations of\nPbTiO$_3$ and BaTiO$_3$.

Traditional damping\ncontrollers include Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and Flexible AC Transmission\nSystem (FACTS) controller, which adds additional damping to the inter-area\noscillation modes by affecting the real power in an indirect manner. However,\nthe effectiveness of these controllers is restricted to the neighborhood of a\nprescribed set of operating conditions. In this paper, decentralized robust\ncontrollers are developed to improve the damping ratios of the inter-area\noscillation modes by directly affecting the real power through the turbine\ngoverning system.

On a large number of\nclassification tasks, the tuning-free GMM kernel performs (surprisingly) well\ncompared to the best-tuned RBF kernel. Nevertheless, one would naturally expect\nthat the GMM kernel ought to be further improved if we introduce tuning\nparameters.\n  In this paper, we study three simple constructions of tunable GMM kernels:\n(i) the exponentiated-GMM (or eGMM) kernel, (ii) the powered-GMM (or pGMM)\nkernel, and (iii) the exponentiated-powered-GMM (epGMM) kernel.

It is recognized as a powerful tool in\ndifferent applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech\nlanguage, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection\nis a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample\nof a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection\nare suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family\nof individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach\nleads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical\nprocedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic\nof these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing\nliterature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect\nedge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also\nimportant to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type\nII error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection\nproblem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of\nstatistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses.\nAdditive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We\nconstruct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine\nthem to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the strong metric\nsubregularity shares the main features of these two most popular regularity\nproperties and is not less instrumental in applications. We show that the\nstrong metric subregularity of a mapping F acting between metric spaces is\nstable under perturbations of the form f + F, where f is a function with a\nsmall calmness constant. This result is parallel to the Lyusternik-Graves\ntheorem for metric regularity and to the Robinson theorem for strong\nregularity, where the perturbations are represented by a function f with a\nsmall Lipschitz constant. Then we study perturbation stability of the same kind\nfor mappings acting between Banach spaces, where f is not necessarily\ndifferentiable but admits a set-valued derivative-like approximation. Strong\nmetric q-subregularity is also considered, where q is a positive real constant\nappearing as exponent in the definition. Rockafellar's criterion for strong\nmetric subregularity involving injectivity of the graphical derivative is\nextended to mappings acting in infinite-dimensional spaces. A sufficient\ncondition for strong metric subregularity is established in terms of\nsurjectivity of the Frechet coderivative. Various versions of Newton's method\nfor solving generalized equations are considered including inexact and\nsemismooth methods, for which superlinear convergence is shown under strong\nmetric subregularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 06:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

The EH\nprocess is characterized by a sequence of blocks of harvested energy, which is\nknown causally at the source. The harvested energy remains constant within a\nblock while the harvested energy across different blocks is characterized by a\nsequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.\nThe blocks have length $L$, which can be interpreted as the coherence time of\nthe energy arrival process. If $L$ is a constant or grows sublinearly in the\nblocklength $n$, we fully characterize the first-order term in the asymptotic\nexpansion of the maximum transmission rate subject to a fixed tolerable error\nprobability $\\varepsilon$.

We also compare our\nsolutions to the recent differentially private matrix factorization (MF)\nrecommender systems, and show that our solutions achieve better accuracy when\nthe privacy budget is reasonably small.

In this text we consider dynamic network models that are inspired by\nthe (static) configuration network. The networks are described by\npopulation-level averages such as the fraction of the population with $k$\npartners, $k=0,1,2,\\ldots$ This means that the bookkeeping contains information\nabout individuals and their partners, but no information about partners of\npartners. Can we average over the population to obtain information about\npartners of partners? The answer is `it depends', and this is where the mean\nfield at distance one assumption comes into play. In this text we explain that,\nyes, we may average over the population (in the right way) in the static\nnetwork. Moreover, we provide evidence in support of a positive answer for the\nnetwork model that is dynamic due to partnership changes. If, however, we\nadditionally allow for demographic changes, dependencies between partners\narise.

Assuming various spectral\nindices for the energy spectrum of neutrino emitters, the Southern sky and in\nparticular central regions of our Galaxy have been studied searching for\npoint-like objects, for extended regions of emission, and for signal from\ntransient objects selected through multi-messenger observations. For the first\ntime, cascade events are used for these searches.\n  ANTARES has also provided results on searches for hypothetical particles\n(such as magnetic monopoles and nuclearites in the cosmic radiation), and\nmulti-messenger studies of the sky in combination with various detectors.

The\nStandard Model Higgs field emerges as a result of the mixing of a scalar meson\nin the new strong dynamics and a massless elementary scalar field. The mass and\nscalar decay constant of that scalar meson, which are generated dynamically in\nthe new gauge theory, give rise to the Higgs field mass term, automatically\npossessing the correct negative sign by the bosonic seesaw mechanism. Using\nanalogy with QCD, we evaluate the dynamical scale of the new gauge theory and\nfurther make quantitative predictions for light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons\nassociated with axial symmetry breaking along chiral symmetry breaking in the\nnew gauge theory. A prominent consequence of the scenario is that there should\nbe a Standard Model gauge singlet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with mass below\n220GeV, which couples to two electroweak gauge bosons through the\nWess-Zumino-Witten term, whose strength is thus determined by the dynamical\nscale of the new gauge theory.

This\nleads to an increment of the number of wireless interfaces integrated into a\nsingle mobile device, hence, it allows the device to be able to connect to\nmultiple access networks. However, in some specific cases such as natural\ndisasters, having an uncorrupted and timely information exchanging means is\ncritical for affected victims to survive or to connect to the outside world.\nThis is because the essential network infrastructures in these cases could be\ndestroyed causing a large number of systems to stop working. In that cases, the\nvictims need a heterogeneous communications network in which they can\ncommunicate, without a doubt, by using different wireless access technologies,\ni.e., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The network must also be able to smoothly change the\naccess technologies, or called a vertical handover, to ensure QoS for ongoing\napplications. In addition, the network must have a mechanism to save energy.\nFor hese reasons, an SDN approach, which has been proposed in a previous work,\nis considered. The performance of the system has been validated by a set of\nexperiments in a real testbed. The obtained results show that the proposed\nvertical handover can save at least 24.42 per cent of the energy consumed by\nthe wireless communication.

Waves induce\nturbulence in the upper ocean by breaking and through Langmuir circulations.\nHowever, waves can directly inject energy into subsurface layers. This relates\nto waves not being truly irrotational and therefore the induced orbital motion\nbeing turbulent. The existence, extent and properties of this turbulent\noscillatory flow still remain uncertain. Here we present measurements of the\nvelocity field of oscillatory flows, which are induced by mechanically\ngenerated random wave fields in a large scale experimental facility.

The evolving\nvolatility over the Republican Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US\npresidential election is a perfect example when politicians, through announced\npolicies, send signals to financial markets. The present paper seeks to address\nwhether BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) stock markets\nequally vulnerable to Trump's plans. For this purpose, two methods were\nadopted. The first presents an event-study methodology based on regression\nestimation of abnormal returns. The second is based on vote intentions by\nintegrating data from social media (Twitter), search queries (Google Trends)\nand public opinion polls. Our results robustly reveal that although some\nmarkets emerged losers, others took the opposite route. China took the biggest\nhit with Brazil, while the damage was much more limited for India and South\nAfrica. These adverse responses can be explained by the Trump's\nneo-mercantilist attitude revolving around tearing up trade deals, instituting\ntariffs, and labeling China a \"currency manipulator\". However, Russia looks to\nbe benefiting due to Trump's sympathetic attitude towards Vladimir Putin and\nexpectations about the scaling down of sanctions imposed on Russia over its\nrole in the conflict in Ukraine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 14:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

However, XML-native\ndatabase systems currently suffer from limited performance, both in terms of\nvolumes of manageable data and query response time.

The development of a set of equations describing the\nplasma evolution on a given time scale is the main requirement to reach this\ngoal. A limited amount of works have studied in a self-consistent way\ncollisional transport and fluctuation induced transport. The motivation of this\nwork stems from the fundamental importance of the self-consistency of the\nadopted description in order to understand transport processes on the energy\nconfinement (transport) time scale because of the mutual interaction between\ncollisions and turbulence. In turn, this is crucial in order to predict fluxes\nof particle and energy and, ultimately, the overall plasma evolution. Using\nflux coordinates and the drift ordering we derive a set of evolutions equations\nfor the number of particles and the energy density on the transport time scale.\nThese equations show the interplay between collisions and fluctuations and, in\nparticular, show that fluctuations may enhance collisional transport while the\ncollisions can damp long lived structures formed by saturated instabilities,\ni.e zonal structures. Fluctuation induced fluxes are described using\ngyrokinetic field theory, which makes a comparison with the theory of phase\nspace zonal structures possible, revealing that the fluctuations induced part\nof the transport equations can be obtained by taking the proper moment of the\nlong length scale limit of the equation governing the evolution of phase space\nzonal structures.

In this work, it has been\nshown that the vector boson scattering involving scalar boson exchanges provide\na complimentary way to direct search methods to probe into the scalar sector.\nAs different extended scalar sectors have similar types of scalar fields, e.g.,\nan extra $CP$-even Higgs, charged Higgs etc., these new physics models can give\nrise to the similar types of experimental signatures. It is possible to\ndistinguish between such models at various vector boson scattering processes by\nlooking at the resonances. Also, the shapes of the resonances can provide\nfurther insight to the relevant parameter space of these models.\n  As in the SM, the electroweak vacuum is metastable, it is important to\nexplore if an extended scalar has an answer in its reserve. As the scalar\nweakly interacting massive scalar particles protected by $Z_2$ symmetry can\nserve as viable dark matter candidates, it is interesting to explore if they\nhelp prolong the lifetime of the Universe.

However, such degeneracy can be used to develop a consistency test\non the possibility that the WIMP is a thermal relic in the first place. When we\napply it to the pSIDM scenario we find that only a WIMP with a standard\nspin-dependent interaction ${\\cal O}_{spin}$ with quarks can be a thermal\nrelic, for a galactic velocity distribution that departs from a Maxwellian.\nHowever all the $\\chi_2$ states must have already decayed today, and this\nrequires some additional mechanism besides that provided by the ${\\cal\nO}_{spin}$ operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 15:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 07:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}
