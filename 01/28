Most\nof the usual approaches do not use the true continuum to solve the three-body\nproblem but use a discrete basis, like for example, wave functions in a finite\nbox. In this paper the proper continuum is used to solve the pairing\nHamiltonian in the continuum spectrum of energy by using the single particle\nlevel density devoid of the free gas.

Variability-intensive programs (program families) appear in many\napplication areas and for many reasons today.

Verification of program families is challenging since the number of\nvariants is exponential in the number of features. Existing single-program\nanalysis and verification tools cannot be applied directly to program families,\nand designing and implementing the corresponding variability-aware versions is\ntedious and laborious.\n  Approach. In this work, we propose a range of variability-related\ntransformations for translating program families into single programs by\nreplacing compile-time variability with run-time variability (non-determinism).\nThe obtained transformed programs can be subsequently analyzed using the\nconventional off- the-shelf single-program analysis tools such as type\ncheckers, symbolic executors, model checkers, and static analyzers.\n  Knowledge.

However, one aspect of the\napplication, namely its business-logic is constantly left imperative. In this\nwork we present Application Embedding, a novel approach to application\ndevelopment which allows all aspects of an application, including its\nbusiness-logic, to be programmed declaratively.\n  We develop this approach in a two-step process. First, we draw a mapping\nbetween web applications and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Second, we note\nthat out of the two methods for implementing DSLs, namely as either internal or\nexternal, most traditional web applications correspond to external DSLs, while\nthe the technique that corresponds to DSL embedding (implementing internal\nDSLs) is left mostly unexplored.\n  By projecting the well-known technique of DSL embedding onto web\napplications, we derive a novel technique--Application Embedding. Application\nembedding offers a separation of code assets that encourages reuse of\nimperative code, while keeping all application-specific assets, including those\nspecifying its business- logic, declarative.\n  As validation, we implemented a simple, though nontrivial web application\nusing the proposed separation of assets. This implementation includes an\napplication-agnostic imperative host application named FishTank, intended to be\napplicable for a wide variety of web applications, and a declarative definition\nof the different aspects of the specific application, intended to be loaded on\nthat host.\n  Our method of separation of code assets facilitates a better separation of\nwork, in comparison to traditional methods. By this separation, host\napplication developers can focus mostly on the extra-functional aspects of a\nweb application, namely on improving performance, scalability, and\navailability, while developers of an embedded application can focus on the\nfunctional aspects of their application, without worrying about extra-\nfunctional concerns. The reusability of the host application makes the effort\nput into a better implementation cost-effective, since it can benefit all\napplications built on top of it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 17:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

To improve its error-correction\nperformance, a list-based version called successive-cancellation list (SCL) has\nbeen proposed in the past, that however substantially increases the number of\ntime-steps in the decoding process. The simplified SCL (SSCL) decoding\nalgorithm exploits constituent codes within the polar code structure to greatly\nreduce the required number of time-steps without introducing any\nerror-correction performance loss.

To achieve this\nwe introduce a real-valued function whose global maximizers describe when the\nHRT is true. To motivate this new approach we re-derive the HRT for sets of $3$\npoints. Subsequently, we establish new results for points in $(1,n)$\nconfigurations, and for a family of symmetric $(2,3)$ configurations.\nFurthermore, we use these results and the refinements of other known ones to\nprove that the HRT holds for certain families of $4$ points. In particular, we\nshow that the HRT holds for any set of $4$ points and any real-valued Schwartz\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 17:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 18:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 16:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

We can go a long way toward solving both problems if the disk\ngas surrounding planets has no intrinsic diffusivity (\"viscosity\"). In\ninviscid, laminar disks, a planet readily repels gas away from its orbit. On\nshort timescales, zero viscosity gas accumulates inside a planet's orbit to\nslow Type I migration by orders of magnitude. On longer timescales, multiple\nsuper-Earths (distributed between, say, $\\sim$0.1--10 AU) can torque inviscid\ngas out of interplanetary space, either inward to feed their stars, or outward\nto be blown away in a wind.

Here we\nreformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is\nto maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed\nto reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of\nfairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above\nrace-specific risk thresholds.

The\nunconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one\nimportant understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same\nstandard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and\nunconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving\npublic safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness.

The PMC uses the renormalization group equation to fix the\n$\\beta$-pattern of each order in an arbitrary pQCD approximant, and it then\ndetermines the optimal renormalization scale by absorbing all $\\{\\beta_{i}\\}$\nterms into the running coupling at each order. The resulting coefficients of\nthe pQCD series match the scheme-independent conformal series with $\\beta=0$.\nAs in QED, different renormalization scales appear at each order; we call this\nthe multi-scale approach. In this paper, we present a novel single-scale\napproach for the PMC, in which a single effective scale is constructed to\neliminate all non-conformal $\\beta$-terms up to a given order simultaneously.\nThe PMC single-scale approach inherits the main features of the multi-scale\napproach; for example, its predictions are scheme-independent, and the pQCD\nconvergence is greatly improved due to the elimination of divergent renormalon\nterms.

It is a\nrather unique feature that the Cu2+ ions of CuAl2O4 sit at a tetrahedral\nposition, not like the usual octahedral position for many oxides. At low\ntemperatures, it exhibits all the thermodynamic evidence of a quantum spin\nglass. For example, the polycrystalline CuAl2O4 shows a cusp centered at ~2 K\nin the low-field dc magnetization data and a clear frequency dependence in the\nac magnetic susceptibility while it displays logarithmic relaxation behavior in\na time dependence of the magnetization. At the same time, there is a peak at\n~2.3 K in the heat capacity, which shifts towards higher temperature with\nmagnetic fields. On the other hand, there is no evidence of new superlattice\npeaks in the high-resolution neutron powder diffraction data when cooled from\n40 to 0.4 K. This implies that there is no long-ranged magnetic order down to\n0.4 K, thus confirming a spin glass-like ground state for CuAl2O4.\nInterestingly, there is no sign of structural distortion either although Cu2+\nis a Jahn-Teller active ion. Thus, we claim that an orbital liquid state is the\nmost likely ground state in CuAl2O4. Of further interest, it also exhibits a\nlarge frustration parameter, f = Theta_CW/Tm ~67, one of the largest values\nreported for spinel oxides.

Humans can provide more insightful information for these\ndifficult problems compared to machine-based automatic techniques.\nNevertheless, human workers can make mistakes due to lack of domain expertise\nor seriousness, ambiguity, or even due to malicious intents. The\nstate-of-the-art literature usually deals with human errors via majority voting\nor by assigning a universal error rate over crowd workers. However, such\napproaches are incomplete, and often inconsistent, because the expertise of\ncrowd workers are diverse with possible biases, thereby making it largely\ninappropriate to assume a universal error rate for all workers over all\ncrowdsourcing tasks.\n  To this end, we mitigate the above challenges by considering an uncertain\ngraph model, where the edge probability between two records A and B denotes the\nratio of crowd workers who voted Yes on the question if A and B are same\nentity. In order to reflect independence across different crowdsourcing tasks,\nwe apply the well-established notion of possible worlds, and develop\nparameter-free algorithms both for next crowdsourcing, as well as for entity\nresolution problems.

Here we present HypeTools, a Python toolbox for visualizing and\nmanipulating large, high-dimensional datasets.

Just as the position of an object moving through space can be\nvisualized as a 3D trajectory, HyperTools uses dimensionality reduction\nalgorithms to create similar 2D and 3D trajectories for time series of\nhigh-dimensional observations. The trajectories may be plotted as interactive\nstatic plots or visualized as animations. These same dimensionality reduction\nand alignment algorithms can also reveal structure in static datasets (e.g.\ncollections of observations or attributes).

This allows one to imprint an arbitrary\ndensity and internal energy profile with very low noise which substantially\nreduces computation because these models require no relaxation prior to use. As\na consequence one can significantly increase the resolution and more flexibly\nchange the initial bodies to explore larger parts of the impact parameter space\nin simulations. The second issue addressed is the proper treatment of the\nmatter/vacuum boundary at a planet's surface with a modified SPH density\nestimator that properly calculates the density stabilizing the models and\navoiding an artificially low density atmosphere prior to impact. Further we\npresent a novel SPH scheme that simultaneously conserves both energy and\nentropy for an arbitrary equation of state. This prevents loss of entropy\nduring the simulation and further assures that the material does not evolve\ninto unphysical states. Application of these modifications to impact\nsimulations for different resolutions up to $6.4 \\cdot 10^6$ particles show a\ngeneral agreement with prior result. However, we observe resolution dependent\ndifferences in the evolution and composition of post collision ejecta.

A consumer chooses a scenario of home appliance use to balance her\ncomfort level and the energy bill. We propose a Bayesian learning algorithm to\nestimate the comfort level function from the history of appliance use. In\nnumeric experiments with datasets generated from a simulation model of a\nconsumer interacting with small home appliances the algorithm outperforms\npopular regression analysis tools. Our approach can be extended to control an\nair heating and conditioning system, which is responsible for up to half of a\nhousehold's energy bill.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 20:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2017 06:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}
