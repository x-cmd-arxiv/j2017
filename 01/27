In the present work, we report on the\nexperiences and practices of two instructors who used the GRF in an\nintroductory physics lab course.

Time-series data, collected\nsequentially over time and across a network, yield features which are viewed as\npoints in or close to a union of multiple submanifolds of a Riemannian\nmanifold, and distinguishing disparate time series amounts to clustering\nmultiple Riemannian submanifolds. To support the claim that exploiting the\nlatent Riemannian geometry behind many statistical features of time series is\nbeneficial to learning from network data, this paper focuses on brain networks\nand puts forth two feature-generation schemes for network-wide dynamic time\nseries. The first is motivated by Granger-causality arguments and uses an\nauto-regressive moving average model to map low-rank linear vector subspaces,\nspanned by column vectors of appropriately defined observability matrices, to\npoints into the Grassmann manifold.

In\nthis work we consider the behavior of the Loschmidt echo in the many body\nlocalized phase, which is characterized by emergent local integrals of motion,\nand provides a generic example of non-ergodic dynamics. We demonstrate that the\nfluctuations of the Loschmidt echo decay as a power law in time in the\nmany-body localized phase, in contrast to the exponential decay in few-body\nergodic systems. We consider the spin-echo generalization of the Loschmidt\necho, and argue that the corresponding correlation function saturates to a\nfinite value in localized systems. Slow, power-law decay of fluctuations of\nsuch spin-echo-type overlap is related to the operator spreading and is present\nonly in the many-body localized phase, but not in a non-interacting Anderson\ninsulator. While most of the previously considered probes of dephasing dynamics\ncould be understood by approximating physical spin operators with local\nintegrals of motion, the Loschmidt echo and its generalizations crucially\ndepend on the full expansion of the physical operators via local integrals of\nmotion operators, as well as operators which flip local integrals of motion.\nHence, these probes allow to get insights into the relation between physical\noperators and local integrals of motion, and access the operator spreading in\nthe many-body localized phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

To a great extent, our highly-skilled motor responses are a\nresult of a reactive feedback system, originating in the brain-stem and spinal\ncord, combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system, that is adaptively\nfine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on\nthat interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC)\narchitecture, an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme in which a\nfeed-forward module, based on the cerebellum, steers an error feedback\ncontroller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger\nreactions as actual errors would, but that do not code for any current or\nforthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy, we\nderive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an\neligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular, our\neligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it\nconvolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context\nof cerebellar physiology, this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses\nshould generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being\ncontrolled. From an engineering perspective, CFPC provides a general-purpose\nanticipatory control architecture equipped with a learning rule that exploits\nthe full dynamics of the closed-loop system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

While prior work on intelligent topic selection\nhas never been evaluated against shallow judging baselines, prior work on deep\nvs. shallow judging has largely argued for shallowed judging, but assuming\nrandom topic selection.

INLA is based on\nproducing an accurate approximation to the posterior marginal distributions of\nthe parameters in the model and some other quantities of interest by using\nrepeated approximations to intermediate distributions and integrals that appear\nin the computation of the posterior marginals.\n  INLA focuses on models whose latent effects are a Gaussian Markov random\nfield (GMRF). For this reason, we have explored alternative ways of expanding\nthe number of possible models that can be fitted using the INLA methodology. In\nthis paper, we present a novel approach that combines INLA and Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC). The aim is to consider a wider range of models that cannot\nbe fitted with INLA unless some of the parameters of the model have been fixed.\nHence, conditioning on these parameters the model could be fitted with the\nR-INLA package. We show how new values of these parameters can be drawn from\ntheir posterior by using conditional models fitted with INLA and standard MCMC\nalgorithms, such as Metropolis-Hastings. Hence, this will extend the use of\nINLA to fit models that can be expressed as a conditional LGM. Also, this new\napproach can be used to build simpler MCMC samplers for complex models as it\nallows sampling only on a limited number parameters in the model.\n  We will demonstrate how our approach can extend the class of models that\ncould benefit from INLA, and how the R-INLA package will ease its\nimplementation.

One natural mechanism that can lead\nto the dissolution of commensurabilities is stochastic orbital forcing, induced\nby turbulent density fluctuations within the nebula. While this process is\nqualitatively promising, the conditions under which mean motion resonances can\nbe broken are not well understood. In this work, we derive a simple analytic\ncriterion that elucidates the relationship among the physical parameters of the\nsystem, and find the conditions necessary to drive planets out of resonance.\nSubsequently, we confirm our findings with numerical integrations carried out\nin the perturbative regime, as well as direct N-body simulations.

It has also been shown that evolutionary diversification can occur\nalong non-equilibrium trajectories in phenotype space.

We use a statistical approach to\ninvestigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find: 1)\nfor a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tends to\nbe fast and non-stationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages,\nbut tends to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of\ndiversity; and 2) the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases\nrapidly (exponentially) with the dimension of phenotype space. These results\nhave implications for theoretical perspectives on major macroevolutionary\npatterns such as adaptive radiation, long-term temporal patterns of phenotypic\nchanges, and the evolution of diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 03:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

Concretely, the technique constructs active molecular orbitals\ncapable of describing all relevant electronic configurations emerging from a\ntargeted set of atomic valence orbitals (e.g., the metal d orbitals in a\ncoordination complex). This is achieved via a linear transformation of the\noccupied and unoccupied orbital spaces from an easily obtainable\nsingle-reference wavefunction (such as from a Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham\ncalculations) based on projectors to targeted atomic valence orbitals. We\ndiscuss the premises, theory, and implementation of the idea, and several of\nits variations are tested. To investigate the performance and accuracy, we\ncalculate the excitation energies for various transition metal complexes in\ntypical application scenarios. Additionally, we follow the homolytic bond\nbreaking process of a Fenton reaction along its reaction coordinate. While the\ndescribed AVAS technique is not an universal solution to the active space\nproblem, its premises are fulfilled in many application scenarios of transition\nmetal chemistry and bond dissociation processes. In these cases the technique\nmakes MR calculations easier to execute, easier to reproduce by any user, and\nsimplifies the determination of the appropriate size of the active space\nrequired for accurate results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 00:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

Within the same collisions it has\nbeen claimed that hydrodynamic flows (radial, elliptic and \"higher harmonic\"\nflows) carried by a dense QCD medium or quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dominate the\nobserved hadronic final state. The flow-QGP narrative is imposed {\\em a priori}\non primary particle data, and of all possible analysis methods a subset A that\nseems to support that narrative is preferred. The present study explores an\nalternative minimum-bias (MB) jet narrative -- quantitative correspondence of\nMB dijet manifestations in the hadronic final state with measured {\\em isolated\njet} properties. The latter incorporates a different set of methods B that\nemerge from inductive study of primary particle data without {\\em a priori}\nassumptions. The resulting system of methods and data manifestations is\nrepresented by a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production.\nA survey of methods reveals that type A tends to discard substantial\ninformation carried by primary particle data whereas type B retains almost all\ninformation in both primary particle data from nuclear collisions and from\nisolated jets. The main goal of the present study is a review of MB dijet\ncontributions to high-energy collisions in small and large systems relative to\nmeasured isolated-jet properties. Representative analysis methods from types A\nand B are compared in the context of MB jet manifestations. This study suggests\nthat at least some data features commonly attributed to flows actually result\nfrom MB dijets and thereby challenges the flow-QGP narrative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

However, existing methods fall short of fully\naddressing the thermal challenges posed by high-performance interconnects. In\nthis paper, we introduce new efficient coding schemes that make it possible to\ndirectly control the peak temperature of a bus by effectively cooling its\nhottest wires. This is achieved by avoiding state transitions on the hottest\nwires for as long as necessary until their temperature drops off. We also\nreduce the average power consumption by making sure that the total number of\nstate transitions on all the wires is below a prescribed threshold. We show how\neach of these two features can be coded for separately or, alternatively, how\nboth can be achieved at the same time. In addition, error-correction for the\ntransmitted information can be provided while controlling the peak temperature\nand/or the average power consumption.\n  In general, our cooling codes use $n > k$ wires to encode a given $k$-bit\nbus. One of our goals herein is to determine the minimum possible number of\nwires $n$ needed to encode $k$ bits while satisfying any combination of the\nthree desired properties. We provide full theoretical analysis in each case. In\nparticular, we show that $n = k+t+1$ suffices to cool the $t$ hottest wires,\nand this is the best possible. Moreover, although the proposed coding schemes\nmake use of sophisticated tools from combinatorics, discrete geometry, linear\nalgebra, and coding theory, the resulting encoders and decoders are fully\npractical. They do not require significant computational overhead and can be\nimplemented without sacrificing a large circuit area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 09:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

However, it is\nstill not known whether our planet's fragile chaotic state is an expected\noutcome of terrestrial planet accretion. We use a suite of numerical\nsimulations to present a detailed analysis and characterization of the\ndynamical chaos in 145 different systems produced via terrestrial planet\nformation in Kaib and Cowan (2015). These systems were created in the presence\nof a fully formed Jupiter and Saturn, using a variety of different initial\nconditions. They are not meant to provide a detailed replication of the actual\npresent solar system, but rather serve as a sample of similar systems for\ncomparison and analysis. We find that dynamical chaos is prevalent in roughly\nhalf of the systems we form. We show that this chaos disappears in the majority\nof such systems when Jupiter is removed, implying that the largest source of\nchaos is perturbations from Jupiter. Chaos is most prevalent in systems that\nform 4 or 5 terrestrial planets. Additionally, an eccentric Jupiter and Saturn\nis shown to enhance the prevalence of chaos in systems. Furthermore, systems in\nour sample with a center of mass highly concentrated between 0.8 -1.2 AU\ngenerally prove to be less chaotic than systems with more exotic mass\ndistributions. Through the process of evolving systems to the current epoch, we\nshow that late instabilities are quite common in our systems.

In particular, it has been\nspeculated that such events could have induced significant rainfall and caused\nthe formation of late-stage valley networks.\n  We present the results of 3-D Global Climate Model simulations reproducing\nthe short and long term climatic impact of a wide range of outflow channel\nformation events under cold ancient Mars conditions. We find that the most\nintense of these events (volumes of water up to 10$^7 $km$^3$ and released at\ntemperatures up to 320 Kelvins) cannot trigger long-term greenhouse global\nwarming, regardless of how favorable are the external conditions (e.g.\nobliquity and seasons). In any case, outflow channel formation events at any\natmospheric pressure are unable to produce rainfall or significant snowmelt at\nlatitudes below 40$^{\\circ}$N.\n  On the long term, for an obliquity of $\\sim $45$^{\\circ}$ and atmospheric\npressures $>$ 80 mbar, we find that the lake ice (formed quickly after the\noutflow event) is transported progressively southward through the mechanisms of\nsublimation and adiabatic cooling. At the same time, and as long as the initial\nwater reservoir is not entirely sublimated, ice deposits remain in the West\nEchus Chasma Plateau region where hints of hydrological activity\ncontemporaneous with outflow channel formation events have been observed.\nHowever, because the high albedo of ice drives Mars to even colder\ntemperatures, snowmelt produced by seasonal solar forcing is difficult to\nattain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 21:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

In recent years, high-quality X-ray observations\nhave allowed for detailed measurements of the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line, where\nrelativistic line broadening allows constraints on the spin parameter (the\nX-ray reflection method). Another technique uses accretion disk models to fit\nthe AGN continuum emission (the continuum-fitting, or CF, method). Although\neach technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical\ntools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques\ncan be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique\ntargets mostly local (z $\\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be\napplied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and\ngrowth. Here, we apply the CF method to two AGN with X-ray reflection\nmeasurements. For both the high-mass AGN, H1821+643, and the Seyfert 1, NGC\n3783, we find a range in spin parameter consistent with the X-ray reflection\nmeasurements. However, the near-maximal spin favored by the reflection method\nfor NGC 3783 is more probable if we add a disk wind to the model. Refinement of\nthese techniques, together with improved X-ray measurements and tighter BH mass\nconstraints, will permit this comparison in a larger sample of AGN and increase\nour confidence in these spin estimation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 21:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

In this region, the time\nevolution of the emission measure and the temperature have a decreasing trend.\nThis could be interpreted as the adiabatic cooling with the expansion of $m =\n0.66$.

The blurring\neffects of lifetime and vibrational anharmonicity broadening obscure the\nnarrower, intrinsic spectral profiles of the UIR band carriers. We use a\nspectral deconvolution algorithm to remove the blurring, in order to retrieve\nthe intrinsic profile of the UIR band. The shape of the intrinsic profile, a\nsharp blue peak and an extended red tail, suggests that the UIR band originates\nfrom a molecular vibration-rotation band with a blue band head.

Yet,\nstandard homodyne, which is used to measure the quadrature information, suffers\nfrom a severe bandwidth limitation: While the bandwidth of optical states can\neasily span many THz, standard homodyne detection is inherently limited to the\nelectrically accessible, MHz to GHz range, leaving a dramatic gap between the\nrelevant optical phenomena and the measurement capability. We demonstrate a\nfully parallel optical homodyne measurement across an arbitrary optical\nbandwidth, effectively lifting this bandwidth limitation completely. Using\noptical parametric amplification, which amplifies one quadrature while\nattenuating the other, we measure two-mode quadrature squeezing of 1.7dB below\nthe vacuum level simultaneously across a bandwidth of 55THz, using just one\nlocal-oscillator - the pump.

Second, there are\n4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e.,\nchanging the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their\nincorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path\nfading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii)\na BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density.\nFinally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna\npattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a\nproportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a\ndynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network.

To begin with, using\ngeostrophic currents derived from sea-surface height anomaly data provided by\nAVISO, we confirm the presence of a strong inverse flux of surface KE at scales\nlarger than approximately 250 km. We then compute enstrophy fluxes to help\ndevelop a clearer picture of the underlying dynamics at smaller scales, i.e.,\n250 km to 100 km. Here, we observe a robust enstrophy cascading regime, wherein\nthe enstrophy shows a large forward flux and the KE spectra follow an\napproximate $k^{-3.5}$ power-law. Given the rotational character of the flow,\nnot only is this large scale inverse KE and smaller scale forward enstrophy\ntransfer scenario consistent with expectations from idealized studies of\nthree-dimensional rapidly-rotating and strongly-stratified turbulence, it also\nagrees with detailed analyses of spectra and fluxes in the upper level\nmidlatitude troposphere. Decomposing the currents into components with greater\nand less than 100 day variability (referred to as seasonal and eddy,\nrespectively), we find that, in addition to the eddy-eddy contribution, the\nseasonal-eddy and seasonal-seasonal fluxes play a significant role in the\ninverse (forward) flux of KE (enstrophy) at scales larger (smaller) than about\n250 km. Taken together, we suspect, it is quite possible that, from about 250\nkm to 100 km, the altimeter is capturing the relatively steep portion of a\nsurface oceanic counterpart of the upper tropospheric Nastrom-Gage spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 08:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

From the inversion of\nthe displacement field measured at the surface of the rubber, spatially\nresolved values of the steady state frictional shear stress are determined\nwithin the non homogeneous pressure and velocity fields of the contact. For\ncontacts with a smooth lens, a velocity dependent but pressure independent\nlocal shear stress is retrieved from the inversion. On the other hand, the\nlocal shear stress is found to depend both on velocity and applied contact\npressure when a randomly rough (sand blasted) glass lens is rubbed against the\nrubber surface.

The graph theoretic concepts\nof rooted in-trees with weighted vertices and edges perfectly admit an abstract\nformulation of the group theoretic notions of successive extensions, nuclear\nrank, multifurcation, and step size. Since all graphs in this chapter are\ninfinite and dense, we use methods of pattern recognition and independent\ncomponent analysis to reduce the complex structure to periodically repeating\nfinite patterns. The method of group cohomology yields subgraph isomorphisms\nrequired for proving the periodicity of branches along mainlines. Finally the\nmainlines are glued together with the aid of infinite limit groups whose finite\nquotients form the vertices of mainlines. The skeleton of the infinite graph is\na countable union of infinite mainlines, connected by periodic bifurcations.\nEach mainline is the backbone of a minimal subtree consisting of a periodically\nrepeating finite pattern of branches with bounded depth. A second periodicity\nis caused by isomorphisms between all minimal subtrees which make up the\ncomplete infinite graph. Only the members of the first minimal tree are\nmetabelian and the bifurcations, which were unknown up to now, open the long\ndesired door to non-metabelian extensions whose second derived quotients are\nisomorphic to the metabelian groups.

Direct\nobservations of escaping ionizing radiation have however been few and with low\nescape fractions. In the local Universe, only ~10 emitters have been observed,\nwith typical escape fractions of a few percent. The mechanisms regulating this\nescape need to be strongly evolving with redshift in order to account for the\nEpoch of Reionization. Gas content and star formation feedback are among the\nmain suspects, known to both regulate neutral gas coverage and evolve with\ncosmic time. In this paper, we reanalyze HST-COS spectrocopy of the first\ndetected local LyC leaker, Haro 11.

For widely different completion times, timing\nis set by the single specific region that is typically the last to replicate in\nall cells. Conversely, when the completion time of all regions are\ncomparable,an extreme-value estimate shows that the cell-to-cell variability of\ngenome replication timing has universal properties. Comparison with available\ndata shows that the replication program of three yeast species falls in this\nextreme-value regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 12:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 03:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The non-LTE excitation effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) are studied in a\nfull disk model to evaluate: (i) what the emitting regions of the different CO2\nro-vibrational bands are; (ii) how the CO2 abundance can be best traced using\nCO2 ro-vibrational lines using future JWST data and; (iii) what the excitation\nand abundances tell us about the inner disk physics and chemistry. CO2 is a\nmajor ice component and its abundance can potentially test models with\nmigrating icy pebbles across the iceline. A full non-LTE CO2 excitation model\nhas been built. The characteristics of the model are tested using non-LTE slab\nmodels. Subsequently the CO2 line formation has been modelled using a\ntwo-dimensional disk model representative of T-Tauri disks. The CO2 gas that\nemits in the 15 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m regions of the spectrum is not in LTE and\narises in the upper layers of disks, pumped by infrared radiation. The v$_2$ 15\n$\\mu$m feature is dominated by optically thick emission for most of the models\nthat fit the observations and increases linearly with source luminosity. Its\nnarrowness compared with that of other molecules stems from a combination of\nthe low rotational excitation temperature (~250 K) and the inherently narrower\nfeature for CO2. The inferred CO2 abundances derived for observed disks are\nmore than two orders of magnitude lower than those in interstellar ices\n(~10$^5$), similar to earlier LTE disk estimates. Line-to-continuum ratios are\nlow, of order a few %, thus high signal-to-noise (S/N > 300) observations are\nneeded for individual line detections.

The interference is most likely to\naffect the communication links and degrade the performance when sensors of\ndifferent WBANs simultaneously transmit using the same channel. In this paper,\nwe propose a distributed approach that adapts to the size of the network, i.e.,\nthe number of coexisting WBANs, and to the density of sensors forming each\nindividual WBAN in order to minimize the impact of co-channel interference\nthrough dynamic channel hopping based on Latin rectangles. Furthermore, the\nproposed approach opts to reduce the overhead resulting from channel hopping,\nand lowers the transmission delay, and saves the power resource at both sensor-\nand WBAN-levels. Specifically, we propose two schemes for channel allocation\nand medium access scheduling to diminish the probability of inter-WBAN\ninterference. The first scheme, namely, Distributed Interference Avoidance\nusing Latin rectangles (DAIL), assigns channel and time-slot combination that\nreduces the probability of medium access collision. DAIL suits crowded areas,\ne.g., high density of coexisting WBANs, and involves overhead due to frequent\nchannel hopping at the WBAN coordinator and sensors. The second scheme, namely,\nCHIM, takes advantage of the relatively lower density of collocated WBANs to\nsave power by hopping among channels only when interference is detected at the\nlevel of the individual nodes. We present an analytical model that derives the\ncollision probability and network throughput. The performance of DAIL and CHIM\nis further validated through simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 14:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

This phenomenon could be explained by the formation of\ndimer vacancy lines which could be responsible for the preferential and\nselective etching of one type of step leading to the double step surface\ncreation. To check this hypothesis, different experiments have been carried in\nan industrial 300 mm MOCVD where the total pressure during the anneal step of\nSi(001) surface has been varied. Under optimized conditions, an APBs-free GaAs\nlayer was grown on a nominal Si(001) surface paving the way for III-V\nintegration on silicon industrial platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 15:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

Recently, we studied the folding of a set of\nhomologous all-{\\alpha} proteins and found that nonnative-contact-based\nenergetic frustrations are closely related to protein native-contact networks.\nIn this paper, we studied the folding of nine homologous immunoglobulin-like\n(Ig-like) \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins and examined energetic frustrations caused\nby nonnative inter-residue interactions, based on analyses of residual\nphi-values and contact maps of transition state ensembles. The proteins share\nsimilar tertiary structures, thus minimize topology frustration differences in\nprotein folding and highlighting the effects of energetic frustrations as\ncaused by hydrophilic-hydrophobic mutations. Our calculations showed that\nenergetic frustrations have highly heterogeneous effects on the folding of most\nsecondary structures and on the folding correlations between different\nfolding-patches of \\b{eta}-sandwich proteins. The simulations revealed a strong\ninterplay between energetic frustrations and native-contact networks in\n\\b{eta}-sandwich domains, which ensures that \\b{eta}-sandwich domains follow a\ncommon folding mechanism. Our results suggested that the folding processes of\n\\b{eta}-sandwich proteins might be redesigned by carefully manipulating\nenergetic frustrations at residue level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 15:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

Assuming that a reasoner's mental causal model can\nbe (implicitly) represented by a causal Bayes net, we first introduce a notion\ncalled Potential Level (PL). PL, in essence, encodes the relative position of a\nnode with respect to its neighbors in a causal Bayes net. Drawing on the\npsychological literature on causal judgment, we substantiate the claim that PL\nmay bear on how time is encoded in the mind. Using PL, we propose an inference\nframework, called the PL-based Inference Framework (PLIF), which permits a\nboundedly-rational approach to the CFP to be formally articulated at Marr's\nalgorithmic level of analysis. We show that our proposed framework, PLIF, is\nconsistent with a wide range of findings in causal judgment literature, and\nthat PL and PLIF make a number of predictions, some of which are already\nsupported by existing findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

On the one hand,\nthe local probabilities are allowed to be partially specified. On the other\nhand, the assessments of independence do not have to hold exactly.\nConceptually, these two features turn credal networks under epistemic\nirrelevance into a powerful alternative to Bayesian networks, offering a more\nflexible approach to graph-based multivariate uncertainty modelling. However,\nin practice, they have long been perceived as very hard to work with, both\ntheoretically and computationally.\n  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that this perception is no longer\njustified. We provide a general introduction to credal networks under epistemic\nirrelevance, give an overview of the state of the art, and present several new\ntheoretical results. Most importantly, we explain how these results can be\ncombined to allow for the design of recursive inference methods. We provide\nnumerous concrete examples of how this can be achieved, and use these to\ndemonstrate that computing with credal networks under epistemic irrelevance is\nmost definitely feasible, and in some cases even highly efficient. We also\ndiscuss several philosophical aspects, including the lack of symmetry, how to\ndeal with probability zero, the interpretation of lower expectations, the\naxiomatic status of graphoid properties, and the difference between updating\nand conditioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 08:57:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

This assumption seems\nvery reasonable since the neutrino masses are extremely small and the neutrinos\nare ultrarelativistic fermions at the energy scales of current experiments.\nConsequently, in cross section calculations in the Quantum Field Theory, the\nStandard Model neutrinos are frequently assumed to be described by 100%\nnegative helicity states. This assumption is true in a sense that in the\nStandard Model processes the positive helicity states can be safely neglected\nfor ultrarelativistic neutrinos. On the other hand, the assumption tacitly\nassert that the neutrino fields are completely longitudinally polarized, i.e.,\nthe contribution to the cross section coming from transverse polarization can\nbe neglected. We show that this tacit assertion is not correct. Although the\nStandard Model cross section for a neutrino with positive helicity goes to zero\nas m-> 0, the cross section for a neutrino with transverse polarization remains\nfinite in that limit. Thus the contribution coming from transverse polarization\ncannot be neglected even in the ultrarelativistic/zero-mass limit.

It\nwill be proved that this approach generates minimum uncertainty coherent states\nof time-dependent oscillators, which in the dissociation (classical) limit\nreduce to the functions describing growth (regression) of the systems evolving\nover time. The results obtained reveal existence of a new class of macroscopic\nquantum (or quasi-quantum) phenomena, which may play a vital role in coherent\nformation of the specific growth patterns in complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 22:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

Such instruments operate in the\n\\textit{surface-volume} configuration, in which ligand molecules are convected\nthrough a fluid-filled volume over a surface to which receptors are confined.\nCurrently, scientists are using optical biosenors to measure the kinetic rate\nconstants associated with DNA translesion synthesis--a process critical to DNA\ndamage repair. Biosensor experiments to study this process involve multiple\ninteracting components on the sensor surface. This multiple-component biosensor\nexperiment is modeled with a set of nonlinear integrodifferential equations\n(IDEs). It is shown that in physically relevant asymptotic limits these\nequations reduce to a much simpler set of Ordinary Differential Equations\n(ODEs). To verify the validity of our ODE approximation, a numerical method for\nthe IDE system is developed and studied. Results from the ODE model agree with\nsimulations of the IDE model, rendering our ODE model useful for parameter\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}
