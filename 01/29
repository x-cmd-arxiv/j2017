Thus identification of unknown drug-drug\ninteraction (DDI) is an important concern for efficient and effective\nhealthcare.

The two\nmodels, {\\it AB-LSTM} and {\\it Joint AB-LSTM} also use attentive pooling in the\noutput of Bi-LSTM layer to assign weights to features. Our experimental results\non the SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset show that the {\\it Joint AB-LSTM}\nmodel outperforms all the existing methods, including those relying on\nhandcrafted features.

Normative\npractical reasoning supports agents making decisions about what is best for\nthem to (not) do in a given situation. What makes practical reasoning\nchallenging is the interplay between goals that agents are pursuing and the\nnorms that the agents are trying to uphold. We offer a formalisation to allow\nagents to plan for multiple goals and norms in the presence of durative actions\nthat can be executed concurrently. We compare plans based on decision-theoretic\nnotions (i.e. utility) such that the utility gain of goals and utility loss of\nnorm violations are the basis for this comparison. The set of optimal plans\nconsists of plans that maximise the overall utility, each of which can be\nchosen by the agent to execute. We provide an implementation of our proposal in\nAnswer Set Programming, thus allowing us to state the original problem in terms\nof a logic program that can be queried for solutions with specific properties.\nThe implementation is proven to be sound and complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2017 17:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

The RNN models containing\nlong-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from\nUniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important\nprotein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning\nalgorithms using sequence-derived protein features.

In this paper we study the application of cooperation for\ninterference management in the weak interference (WI) regime, focusing on the\nZ-interference channel with a causal relay (Z-ICR), when the channel\ncoefficients are subject to ergodic phase fading, all transmission powers are\nfinite, and the relay is full-duplex. In order to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the benefits of cooperation in the WI regime, we characterize,\nfor the first time, two major performance measures for the ergodic phase fading\nZ-ICR in the WI regime: The sum-rate capacity and the maximal generalized\ndegrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In the capacity analysis, we obtain conditions on\nthe channel coefficients, subject to which the sum-rate capacity of the ergodic\nphase fading Z-ICR is achieved by treating interference as noise at each\nreceiver, and explicitly state the corresponding sum-rate capacity. In the GDoF\nanalysis, we derive conditions on the exponents of the magnitudes of the\nchannel coefficients, under which treating interference as noise achieves the\nmaximal GDoF, which is explicitly characterized as well. It is shown that under\ncertain conditions on the channel coefficients, {\\em relaying strictly\nincreases} both the sum-rate capacity and the maximal GDoF of the ergodic phase\nfading Z-interference channel in the WI regime. Our results demonstrate {\\em\nfor the first time} the gains from relaying in the presence of interference,\n{\\em when interference is weak and the relay power is finite}, both in\nincreasing the sum-rate capacity and in increasing the maximal GDoF, compared\nto the channel without a relay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 11:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 05:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Owing to the complicated Fermi\nsurface and momentum dependency of $f$-wave pair potential, monolayer $MoS_2$\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling can be considered an intriguing structure to\nreveal the superconducting state. Actually, this can be possible by calculating\nthe peculiar spin-valley polarized transport of quasiparticles in a related\nnormal metal/superconductor junction. We theoretically study the formation of\neffective gap at the interface and resulting normalized conductance on top of a\n$MoS_2$ under induction of $f$-wave order parameter, using\nBloder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism. The superconducting excitations shows that\nthe gap is renormalized by a \\textit{bias limitation} coefficient including\ndynamical band parameters of monolayer $MoS_2$, especially, ones related to the\nSchrodinger-type momentum of Hamiltonian. The effective gap is more sensitive\nto the n-doping regime of superconductor region. The signature of spin-orbit\ncoupling, topological and asymmetry mass-related terms in the resulting subgap\nconductance and, in particular, maximum conductance is presented. In the\nabsence of topological term, the effective gap reaches to its maximum value.\nThe unconventional nature of superconducting order leads to the appearance of\nzero-bias conductance. In addition, the maximum value of conductance can be\ncontrolled by tuning the doping level of normal and superconductor regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 07:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Recently, a large number of encryption algorithms has been\npresented to protect image contents.The main objective of modern image\nencryption schemes is to reduce the computation complexity in order to respond\nto the real time multimedia and/or limited resources requirements without\ndegrading the high level of security. In fact, most of the recent solutions are\nbased on the chaotic theory. However, the majority of chaotic systems suffers\nfrom different limitations and their implementation is difficult at the\nhardware level because of the non integer operations that are employed\nrequiring huge resources and latency. In this paper, we analyze the new\nchaos-based image encryption system presented in~\\cite{el2016new}. It uses a\nstatic binary diffusion layer, followed by a key dependent bit-permutation\nlayer that only iterates for one round. Based on their results in this paper,\nwe claim that the uniformity and avalanche effect can be reached from the first\nround. However, we tried to verify the results but our conclusion was that\nthese results were wrong because it was shown that at least 6 iterations are\nnecessary to ensure the required cryptographic performance such as the\nplain-sensitivity property. Therefore, the required execution time must be\nmultiplied by 6 and consequently this will increase the latency. In addition to\nall aforementioned problems, we find that ensuring the avalanche effect in the\nwhole image introduces a high error propagation. In order to solve this\nproblem, we recommend to ensure the avalanche effect in the level of blocks\ninstead of the whole image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 12:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

They lead in the\ndevelopment of many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular\nfootprints under specific settings. Naturally, the performance of such\nalgorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy,\ninaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical\nscenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by\nimage-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection\nrequires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering\nscenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System\nhas been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership\nfunctions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are\ntime-consuming processes.

Moreover, initial fuzzy inference system is generated\nbased on fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed framework is implemented and\nvalidated on a benchmark image splicing data set in which three forgery\ndetection tools are fused based on adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system.

However, concentrating regenerators into a\nsmall number of nodes exposes the network to a high risk of data losses in the\neventual case of regenerator pool failure.

The final goal is to model C/C UACs with multi-oscillator Time\nDomain Impedance Boundary Conditions (TDIBC) developed by Lin et al. in JFM\n(2016) to be applied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) focused on the\noverlying boundary layer, eliminating the need to simultaneously resolve the\nmicroscopic porous structure of the C/C UACs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 15:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

In flow-through\nelectrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores\nor laser perforated channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact\ncells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We\nhere present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI,\nand a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model\nemploys simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show\ngood model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as\nthe Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we\ndemonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may\nbe described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical\nflow-between electrodes architecture where 2D models are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2017 19:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

This transformation allows for decoupling of the\ncoordinates and for performing aggregation via simple scalar median or mode\ncomputations. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of\nthis completely parallelizable approach and analytically prove that both the\nmode and median aggregation procedure recover the correct centroid aggregate\nwith small sample complexity when the permutations are drawn according to the\nwell-known Mallows models.
