This remarkable result is an application of the Jones polynomial. In the\ncase of the braid index of an alternating link, Murasugi had conjectured that\nthe number of Seifert circles in a reduced alternating diagram of the link\nequals the braid index of the link. This conjecture turned out to be false. In\nthis paper we prove the next best thing that one could hope for: we\ncharacterize exactly those alternating links for which their braid indices\nequal to the numbers of Seifert circles in their corresponding reduced\nalternating link diagrams. More specifically, we prove that if $D$ is a reduced\nalternating link diagram of an alternating link $L$, then $b(L)$, the braid\nindex of $L$, equals the number of Seifert circles in $D$ if and only if\n$G_S(D)$ contains no edges of weight one. Here $G_S(D)$, called the Seifert\ngraph of $D$, is an edge weighted simple graph obtained from $D$ by identifying\neach Seifert circle of $D$ as a vertex of $G_S(D)$ such that two vertices in\n$G_S(D)$ are connected by an edge if and only if the two corresponding Seifert\ncircles share crossings between them in $D$ and that the weight of the edge is\nthe number of crossings between the two Seifert circles. This result is partly\nbased on the well known MFW inequality, which states that the $a$-span of the\nHOMFLY polynomial of $L$ is a lower bound of $2b(L)-2$, as well as a result due\nto Yamada, which states that the minimum number of Seifert circles over all\nlink diagrams of $L$ equals $b(L)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 16:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 20:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Moreover, these graphs\ncan be significantly larger than the initial input stored in the database,\nmaking it infeasible to construct or analyze such graphs in memory. In this\npaper we address both of these challenges by building a system that enables\nusers to declaratively specify graph extraction tasks over a relational\ndatabase schema and then execute graph algorithms on the extracted graphs.

The approach is used to develop a relationship between the temperature\ndependence of the step free energy ($\\gamma^\\mathrm{st}$) and step excess\nquantities for energy and stress that can be readily calculated by atomistic\nsimulations.

We use the evolutionary code MESA and the\nradiative transfer code CMFGEN to investigate stripped stars as a function of\nmetallicity (Z).\n  We show that typical progenitors, initially 12$M_{\\odot}$, produce hot and\ncompact stars (~4$M_{\\odot}$, 60-80 kK, ~1$R_{\\odot}$) that copiously produce\nionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and 30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI\nionizing radiation, for Z=0.0001-0.02.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The\ngeneral-relativistic description of the BH interior is that of empty spacetime\nwith a (possibly) singular core. Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a\nmodel-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum\nresulting from a BH merger. We find that future GW detectors, such as Advanced\nLIGO with its design sensitivity, have the potential of detecting such r-modes\nif the amount of GWs leaking out quantum mechanically from the interior of a\nBH-like object is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 09:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 07:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

We present preliminary results and our key\nfindings in addressing these challenges. Our system's scalable event ingestion\nframework, based on OpenTSDB, ingests nearly 400,000 sensor data samples per\nseconds using a 30 machine cluster. To reduce false alarm rates, we leverage\nthe False Discovery Rate (FDR) algorithm which significantly reduces the number\nof false alarms. Our visualization tool presents the anomalies and associated\ncontent flagged by the FDR algorithm to inform users and practitioners in their\ndecision making process. We believe our integrated platform will help reduce\nmaintenance costs significantly while increasing asset lifespan. We are working\nto extend our system on multiple fronts, such as scaling to more data and more\ncompute nodes (70 in total).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 21:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

Therefore, distributed storage systems (DSS), which rely on tens of\nthousands of storage nodes, are the only viable solution. Such systems are\nbroadly used in all modern internet-scale systems. However, the design of a DSS\nposes a number of crucial challenges, markedly different from single-user\nstorage systems. Such systems must be able to reconstruct the data efficiently,\nto overcome failure of servers, to correct errors, etc. Lots of research was\ndone in the last few years to answer these challenges and the research is\nincreasing in parallel to the increasing amount of stored data.\n  The main goal of this paper is to consider codes which have two of the most\nimportant features of distributed storage systems, namely, locality and\navailability. Our codes are array codes which are based on subspaces of a\nlinear space over a finite field. We present several constructions of such\ncodes which are $q$-analog to some of the known block codes. Some of these\ncodes possess independent intellectual merit. We examine the locality and\navailability of the constructed codes.

For this study, a radiative-convective atmospheric model is used the\ncalculate the surface temperatures influenced by CO2 ice particles. The clouds\nare included using a parametrised cloud model. The atmospheric model includes a\ngeneral discrete ordinate radiative transfer that can describe the anisotropic\nscattering by the cloud particles accurately. A net scattering greenhouse\neffect caused by CO2 clouds is only obtained in a rather limited parameter\nrange which also strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature. For\ncool M-stars, CO2 clouds only provide about 6 K of additional greenhouse\nheating in the best case scenario.

The former\nis for a general fixed-particle number state and the latter for Holland Burnett\nstates, for which we show quantum-enhanced estimation of phase as well as phase\ndiffusion. We next investigate the simultaneous attainability of these quantum\nlimits using projective measurements acting on a single copy of the state in\nterms of a trade-off relation. In particular, we are interested how this\ntrade-off varies as a function of the dimension of the state. We derive an\nanalytical bound for this trade-off in the large phase diffusion regime for a\nparticular form of the measurement, and show that the maximum of 2, set by the\nquantum Cramer-Rao bound, is attainable. Further, we show numerical evidence\nthat as diffusion approaches zero, the optimal trade-off relation approaches 1\nfor Holland-Burnett states. These numerical results are valid in the small\nparticle number regime and suggest that the trade-off for estimating one\nparameter with quantum-limited precision leads to a complete lack of precision\nfor the other parameter as the diffusion strength approaches zero. Finally, we\nprovide numerical results showing behaviour of the trade-off for a general\nvalue of phase diffusion when using Holland-Burnett probe states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 16:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

For both cases, we find\nthat the Kondo resonance in the zero temperature spectral function, a preformed\nversion of which is evident at very short times $t\\to 0^{+}$, only fully\ndevelops at very long times $t\\gtrsim 1/T_{\\rm K}$, where $T_{\\rm K}$ is the\nKondo temperature of the final state. In contrast, the final state satellite\npeaks develop on a fast time scale $1/\\Gamma$ during the time interval\n$-1/\\Gamma \\lesssim t \\lesssim +1/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the hybridization\nstrength. Initial and final state spectral functions are recovered in the\nlimits $t\\rightarrow -\\infty$ and $t\\rightarrow +\\infty$, respectively. Our\nformulation of two-time nonequilibrium Green functions within TDNRG provides a\nfirst step towards using this method as an impurity solver within\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 03:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 04:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 06:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 06:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

The problem of designing an attitude\ncontrol system for CubeSat telescopes is very challenging because current\nchoice of actuators such as reaction-wheels and magnetorquers can induce jitter\non the spacecraft due to moving mechanical parts and due to external\ndisturbances. These telescopes may contain cryo-pumps and servos that introduce\nadditional vibrations. A better solution is required.

The\ntemperature gradient across the vanes causes the gas molecules to strike the\nvanes differently and thus inducing a force. By controlling these forces, it's\npossible to produce a torque to precisely point or spin a spacecraft.

The consequence is that they do not admit quotient types.\nThis is, of course, often inconvenient. Whenever a computation involves data\nwith multiple representatives, and they need to be identified according to some\nequations that are not satisfied by all data, the monadic programmer has to\nleave the universe of free algebras, and resort to explicit destructors. We\ncharacterize the situation when these destructors are preserved under all\noperations, and the resulting quotients of free algebras are also their\nsubalgebras. Such quotients are called *projective*. Although popular in\nuniversal algebra, projective algebras did not attract much attention in the\nmonadic setting, where they turn out to have a surprising avatar: for any given\nmonad, a suitable category of projective algebras is equivalent with the\ncategory of coalgebras for the comonad induced by any monad resolution. For a\nmonadic programmer, this equivalence provides a convenient way to implement\npolymorphic quotients as coalgebras. The dual correspondence of injective\ncoalgebras and all algebras leads to a different family of quotient types,\nwhich seems to have a different family of applications.

In recent years, several extensions of\nthese games were proposed to incorporate aspects that are not captured by the\nstandard model. Examples of such extensions include the incorporation of risk\nsensitive players, the modeling of altruistic player behavior and the\nimposition of taxes on the resources. These extensions were studied intensively\nwith the goal to obtain a precise understanding of the inefficiency of\nequilibria of these games. In this paper, we introduce a new model of\ncongestion games that captures these extensions (and additional ones) in a\nunifying way. The key idea here is to parameterize both the perceived cost of\neach player and the social cost function of the system designer. Intuitively,\neach player perceives the load induced by the other players by an extent of\n{\\rho}, while the system designer estimates that each player perceives the load\nof all others by an extent of {\\sigma}. The above mentioned extensions reduce\nto special cases of our model by choosing the parameters {\\rho} and {\\sigma}\naccordingly. As in most related works, we concentrate on congestion games with\naffine latency functions here. Despite the fact that we deal with a more\ngeneral class of congestion games, we manage to derive tight bounds on the\nprice of anarchy and the price of stability for a large range of pa- rameters.\nOur bounds provide a complete picture of the inefficiency of equilibria for\nthese perception-parameterized congestion games. As a result, we obtain tight\nbounds on the price of anarchy and the price of stability for the above\nmentioned extensions. Our results also reveal how one should \"design\" the cost\nfunctions of the players in order to reduce the price of anar- chy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 08:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

MRF uses hundreds of radio frequency (RF) excitation pulses for\nacquisition, and therefore a high undersampling ratio in the sampling domain\n(k-space) is required for reasonable scanning time. This undersampling causes\nspatial artifacts that hamper the ability to accurately estimate the tissue's\nquantitative values. In this work, we introduce a new approach for quantitative\nMRI using MRF, called magnetic resonance Fingerprinting with LOw Rank (FLOR).\n  Methods: We exploit the low rank property of the concatenated temporal\nimaging contrasts, on top of the fact that the MRF signal is sparsely\nrepresented in the generated dictionary domain. We present an iterative scheme\nthat consists of a gradient step followed by a low rank projection using the\nsingular value decomposition.\n  Results: Experimental results consist of retrospective sampling, that allows\ncomparison to a well defined reference, and prospective sampling that shows the\nperformance of FLOR for a real-data sampling scenario.

However the\naqueous environments believed to be present on these bodies are likely to be\nsaline rather than pure water. Laboratory work to underpin the properties of\nclathrates in such environments is lacking. We fill this gap by carrying out a\nlaboratory investigation of the physical properties of CO$_2$ clathrates\nproduced in weak aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We use synchrotron X-ray powder\ndiffraction to investigate clathrates formed at high CO$_2$ pressure in ice\nthat has formed from aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We measure the thermal\nexpansion, density and dissociation properties of the clathrates under\ntemperature conditions similar to those on icy Solar System bodies. We find\nthat the sulphate solution inhibits the formation of clathrates by lowering\ntheir dissociation temperatures. Hysteresis is found in the thermal expansion\ncoefficients as clathrates are cooled and heated; we attribute this to the\npresence of the salt in solution. The density derived from X-ray powder\ndiffraction is temperature and pressure dependent. When comparing the density\nof CO$_2$ clathrates to that of the solution in which they formed, we conclude\nthat they sink in the oceans in which they form. We also find that the\npolymorph of ice present at low temperatures is Ih rather than Ic, which we\nattribute to the presence of the MgSO$_4$. We 1) conclude that the clathrate\ndensity has implications for their behaviour in satellite oceans as their\nsinking and floating capabilities are temperature and pressure dependent, 2)\nconclude that the presence of MgSO$_4$ inhibits the formation of clathrates and\nin some cases may even affect their structure and 3) report the dominance of Ih\nthroughout the experimental procedure despite Ic being the stable phase at low\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 12:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees\nare \\emph{biologically feasible}, that is, if there is a possible true history\nthat would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down\nto finding a reconciliation map - also known as DTL-scenario - between the\nevent-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree.\n  In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid\nreconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees $T$ that contain\nspeciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown\nspecies tree $S$ in terms of \"informative\" triples that are displayed in $T$\nand provide information of the topology of $S$. These informative triples are\nused to infer the unknown species tree $S$ for $T$. We obtain a similar result\nfor non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs\nto be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide\nwhether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the\npositive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted)\nreconciliation map.\n  However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have its limitations\nwhen they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While\nreconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is\nnot true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples do neither\nprovide enough information to characterize \"relaxed\" DTL-scenarios nor\nnon-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene\ntrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 07:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 12:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

In this work we investigate a\nvariant of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations that shares exactly\nthe same ideal invariants (energy and helicity) and the same symmetries (under\nrotations, reflexions and scale transforms) as the original equations. It is\ndemonstrated that the examined system displays a change in the direction of the\nenergy cascade when varying the value of a free parameter which controls the\nrelative weights of the triadic interactions between different helical Fourier\nmodes. The transition from a forward to inverse cascade is shown to occur at a\ncritical point in a discontinuous manner with diverging fluctuations close to\ncriticality. Our work thus supports the observation that purely isotropic and\nthree dimensional flow configurations can support inverse energy transfer when\ninteractions are altered and that inside all turbulent flows there is a\ncompetition among forward and backward transfer mechanism which might lead to\nmultiple energy-containing turbulent states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 09:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

Typically the seed\nlayer material is studied to provide the desired face-centered cubic\n(\\textit{fcc}) texture to the [Co/Ni] to obtain PMA. The integration of [Co/Ni]\nin back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes also requires the PMA to survive\npost-annealing. In this paper, the impact of NiCr, Pt, Ru, and Ta seed layers\non the structural and magnetic properties of [Co(0.3 nm)/Ni(0.6 nm)]\nmultilayers is investigated before and after annealing. The multilayers were\ndeposited \\textit{in-situ} on different seeds via physical vapor deposition at\nroom temperature. The as-deposited [Co/Ni] films show the required\n\\textit{fcc}(111) texture on all seeds, but PMA is only observed on Pt and Ru.\nIn-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) is obtained on NiCr and Ta seeds, which is\nattributed to strain-induced PMA loss. PMA is maintained on all seeds after\npost-annealing up to 400$^{\\circ}$C. The largest effective perpendicular\nanisotropy energy ($K_U^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\approx 2\\times10^5$J/m$^3$) after\nannealing is achieved on NiCr seed. The evolution of PMA upon annealing cannot\nbe explained by further crystallization during annealing or strain-induced PMA,\nnor can the observed magnetization loss and the increased damping after\nannealing. Here we identify the diffusion of the non-magnetic materials from\nthe seed into [Co/Ni] as the major driver of the changes in the magnetic\nproperties. By selecting the seed and post-annealing temperature, the [Co/Ni]\ncan be tuned in a broad range for both PMA and damping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 14:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

The system takes waste products, such\nas water from these robots and transfers them to a thermochemical storage\nsystem. These thermochemical storage systems when mixed with water (a waste\nproduct from a PEM fuel cell) releases heat. Under eclipse, the heat from the\nthermochemical storage system is released to keep the probe warm enough to\nsurvive. In sunlight, solar photovoltaics are used to electrolyze the water and\nreheat the thermochemical storage system to release the water. Our research has\nshowed thermochemical storage systems are a feasible solution for use on\nsurface probes and robots for applications on the Moon, Mars and asteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 03:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

However, the low-gravity and unknown surface\nconditions of asteroids presents a daunting challenge for surface exploration,\nmanipulation and for resource processing. This has resulted in the loss of\nseveral landers or shortened missions. Fundamental studies are required to\nobtain better readings of the material surface properties and physical models\nof these small bodies. The Asteroid Origins Satellite 1 (AOSAT 1) is a CubeSat\ncentrifuge laboratory that spins at up to 4 rpm to simulate the milligravity\nconditions of sub 1 km asteroids. Such a laboratory will help to de-risk\ndevelopment and testing of landing and resource processing technology for\nasteroids. Inside the laboratory are crushed meteorites, the remains of\nasteroids. The laboratory is equipped with cameras and actuators to perform a\nseries of science experiments to better understand material properties and\nasteroid surface physics. These results will help to improve our physics models\nof asteroids. The CubeSat has been designed to be low-cost and contains 3-axis\nmagnetorquers and a single reaction-wheel to induce spin. In our work, we first\nanalyze how the attitude control system will de-tumble the spacecraft after\ndeployment. Further analysis has been conducted to analyze the impact and\nstability of the attitude control system to shifting mass (crushed meteorites)\ninside the spacecraft as its spinning in its centrifuge mode. AOSAT 1 will be\nthe first in a series of low-cost CubeSat centrifuges that will be launched\nsetting the stage for a larger, permanent, on-orbit centrifuge laboratory for\nexperiments in planetary science, life sciences and manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 02:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Direct applications of the encodings as nonlinear pro-\ngrams are model repair and parameter synthesis.

However, we show that our bubble\nuniverse is in a single quantum eigenstate that extends to regions of space\nthat are receding from each other at superluminal velocities because of general\nrelativistic expansion. Such a bubble universe cannot accommodate Hubble\nvolumes in the different orthogonal eigenstates required by the Level III\nMultiverse. Instead, quantum uncertainty arises from large numbers of\nalternative bubble universes in Hilbert space, isolated from each other.
