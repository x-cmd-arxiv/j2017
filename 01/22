It is found that electron doping controlled by SIC-FET leads\nto a suppression of the superconducting phase, and eventually gives rise to an\ninsulating state in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. During the gating process, the\n(001) peak in XRD patterns stays at the same position and no new diffraction\npeak emerges, indicating no evident Li$^+$ ions intercalation into the\nFeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. It indicates that a systematic change of electronic\nproperties in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ arises from the electrostatic doping\ninduced by the accumulation of Li$^+$ ions at the interface between\nFeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ and solid ion conductor in the devices. It is striking\nthat these findings are drastically different from the observation in FeSe thin\nflakes using the same SIC-FET, in which $T_c$ is enhanced from 8 K to larger\nthan 40 K, then the system goes into an insulating phase accompanied by\nstructural transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 16:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

A known limitation of the\ndistance-based method is that its computational complexity can be high. In\ngeneral, when the sample size is $n$, the order of computational complexity of\na distance-based method, which typically requires computing of all pairwise\ndistances, can be $O(n^2)$. Recent advances have discovered that in the {\\it\nunivariate} cases, a fast method with $O(n \\log n)$ computational complexity\nand $O(n)$ memory requirement exists. In this paper, we introduces a test of\nindependence method based on random projection and distance correlation, which\nachieves nearly the same power as the state-of-the-art distance-based approach,\nworks in the {\\it multivariate} cases, and enjoys the $O(n K \\log n)$\ncomputational complexity and $O(\\max\\{n,K\\})$ memory requirement, where $K$ is\nthe number of random projections.

Although both the memory state of these devices and much of the data\nthey store are intrinsically analog-valued, both are quantized for use with\ndigital systems and discrete error correcting codes. Using phase change memory\nas a prototypical multi-level storage technology, we herein demonstrate that\nanalog-valued devices can achieve higher capacities when paired with analog\ncodes. Further, we find that storing analog signals directly through\njoint-coding can achieve low distortion with reduced coding complexity. By\njointly optimizing for signal statistics, device statistics, and a distortion\nmetric, finite-length analog encodings can perform comparable to digital\nsystems with asymptotically infinite large encodings. These results show that\nend-to-end analog memory systems have not only the potential to reach higher\nstorage capacities than discrete systems, but also to significantly lower\ncoding complexity, leading to faster and more energy efficient storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 18:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

Common intuition is that defects with shallow levels act as\ncarrier providers and defects with deep levels are carrier killers. Here,\ntaking the Cu defects in CdTe as an example, we show that shallow defects can\nplay both roles. Using first-principles calculation methods combined with\nthermodynamic simulations, we study the dialectic effects of Cu-related defects\non hole density and lifetime in bulk CdTe over a wide range of Cu incorporation\nconditions. Because CuCd can form a relatively shallow acceptor in CdTe, we\nfind that increased Cu incorporation into CdTe indeed can help achieve high\nhole density; however, too much Cu can cause significant non-radiative\nrecombination. We discuss two strategies to balance the contradictory effects\nof Cu defects based on the calculated impact of Cd chemical potential, copper\ndefect concentrations, and incorporation temperature on lifetime and hole\ndensity. The results indicates that to optimize the Cu doping in CdTe, it is\nimportant to control the total amount of Cu incorporated into CdTe and optimize\nthe match between the Cu incorporation temperature and the Cd chemical\npotential. These findings can help understand the roles of Cu defects in CdTe\nand the potential complex defect behaviors of relatively shallow defect states\nin semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 19:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The currently\naccepted physical model of transcription predicts the existence of a physical\nlimit on the maximal rate of transcription, which does not depend on the\ntranscribed gene. This limit appears as a result of polymerase \"traffic jams\"\nforming in the bulk of the 1D DNA chain at high polymerase concentrations.\nRecent experiments have, for the first time, allowed one to access live gene\nexpression dynamics in the Drosophila fly embryo in vivo under the conditions\nof heavy polymerase load and test the predictions of the model. Our analysis of\nthe data shows that the maximal rate of transcription is indeed the same for\nthe Hunchback, Snail and Knirps gap genes, and modified gene constructs in\nnuclear cycles 13, 14, but the experimentally observed value of the maximal\ntranscription rate corresponds to only 40 % of the one predicted by this model.\nWe argue that such a decrease must be due to a slower polymerase elongation\nrate in the vicinity of the promoter region. This effectively shifts the\nbottleneck of transcription from the bulk to the promoter region of the gene.\nWe suggest a quantitative explanation of the difference by taking into account\nabortive transcription initiation. Our calculations based on the independently\nmeasured abortive initiation constant in vitro confirm this hypothesis and find\nquantitative agreement with MS2 fluorescence live imaging data in the early\nfruit fly embryo. If our explanation is correct, then the transcription rate\ncannot be increased by replacing \"slow codons\" in the bulk with synonymous\ncodons, and experimental efforts must be focused on the promoter region\ninstead. This study extends our understanding of transcriptional regulation,\nre-examines physical constraints on the kinetics of transcription and\nre-evaluates the validity of the standard TASEP model of transcription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 20:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration. A small shift of parameters of \"calibrated\"\nrelation could significantly change the final constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ in\nthe low-redshift calibration method. Finally, we simulate several GRB samples\nwith different statistical errors and find that, in order to correctly recover\nthe fiducial value of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ using the low-redshift calibration\nmethod, we need a large number of GRB samples with high precisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 23:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Taking into\naccount the up-to-date constraints on $r$, i.e. $r_{0.05}<0.07$ at $95\\%$\nconfidence, we find that the consistency relation $n_t=-r/8$ in the canonical\nsingle-field slow-roll inflation cannot be distinguished from the scale\ninvariance, due to the cosmic variance in the power spectrum of cosmic\nmicrowave background B-modes. The cosmic variance places an inevitable limit on\nthe measurements of the tensor spectral index, i.e. $\\sigma_{n_t}\\simeq0.01$\nfor $2\\leqslant\\ell\\leqslant \\ell_\\text{max}=300$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 02:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 12:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

This imaging system captures\ntwo types of multimodal images: one is near-infrared gray image (NGI) and the\nother is the visible color image (VCI). NGI is noise-free but it is grayscale,\nwhereas the VCI has colors but it contains noise. Moreover, there exist serious\nedge and brightness discrepancies between NGI and VCI. To deal with this\nproblem, a new transfer-based fusion method is proposed for noise removal.\nDifferent from conventional fusion approaches, the proposed method conducts a\nseries of transfers: contrast, detail, and color transfers. First, the proposed\ncontrast and detail transfers aim at solving the serious discrepancy problem,\nthereby creating a new noise-free and detail-preserving NGI. Second, the\nproposed color transfer models the unknown colors from the denoised VCI via a\nlinear transform, and then transfers natural-looking colors into the newly\ngenerated NGI.

We therefore\nrecommend that in studies of metal-rich red giant stars care needs to be taken\nto obtain sufficient calibration data in order to be able to also use the\ncooler stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 07:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Although detected in the\ninterstellar medium for decades, its formation route is still debated, whether\nin the gas phase or on the dust grain surfaces. Molecular deuteration has\nproven to be, in other cases, an efficient way to identify how a molecule is\nsynthesised. For formamide, new published observations towards the\nIRAS16293-2422 B hot corino show that its three deuterated forms have all the\nsame deuteration ratio, 2--5%, and that this is a factor 3--8 smaller than that\nmeasured for H2CO towards the IRAS16293-2422 protostar. Following a previous\nwork on the gas-phase formamide formation via the reaction NH2 + H2CO -> HCONH2\n+ H, we present here new calculations of the rate coefficients for the\nproduction of monodeuterated formamide through the same reaction, starting from\nmonodeuterated NH2 or H2CO. Some misconceptions regarding our previous\ntreatment of the reaction are also cleared up. The results of the new\ncomputations show that, at the 100 K temperature of the hot corino, the rate of\ndeuteration of the three forms is the same, within 20%. On the contrary, the\nreaction between non-deuterated species proceeds three times faster than that\nwith deuterated ones.

Recent studies\nshow that seam-cutting approaches can effectively relieve artifacts generated\nby local misalignment.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel perception-based energy function in the seam-cutting framework, which\nconsiders the nonlinearity and the nonuniformity of human perception in energy\nminimization. Our perception-based approach adopts a sigmoid metric to\ncharacterize the perception of color discrimination, and a saliency weight to\nsimulate that human eyes incline to pay more attention to salient objects. In\naddition, our seam-cutting composition can be easily implemented into other\nstitching pipelines.

In this paper, we gather from\nliterature a largest quiescent AGN (defined as $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} <\n10^{-6}$) sample to date, consisting of $75$ sources.

In this case, the quiescent sources will\nmix up with those normal ones in $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$. The value of\n$\\xi_{\\rm X}$ will then be between $0.6$ and $\\sim1.3$, with the exact value\nbeing determined by the sample composition, i.e., the fraction of the quiescent\nand normal sources. Based on this result, we propose that a more physical way\nto study the Fundamental Plane is to replace $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$ with\n$L_{\\rm R}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 09:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Cosmological gas funelled through cold flows reaches the galactic\nouter region close to free-fall. Then torques associated to pressure triggered\nby gas turbulent motions produced in the circum-galactic medium by shocks and\nexplosions from SNe are the main source of mass transport beyond the central ~\n100 pc.

To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 02:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 02:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

A connection between self-reference and consciousness has\nbeen previously discussed due to their similar nature of making a reference to\nitself. Vacuum observation has the property of self-reference and consciousness\nin the sense that the observer is observing one's own reference frame of\nenergy. In this paper, the cyclical loop model of self-reference is applied to\nthe vacuum observation, such that the discrepancy between the energy density\nresulting from the first part of the causal loop (i.e., the classical\nirreversible computation of the observer's reference frame) and the other part\nof the causal loop (i.e., nondeterministic quantum evolution) corresponds to\n10^(123). This effectively provides a consistent explanation of the difference\nbetween the observed and the theoretical values of the vacuum energy, namely,\nthe cosmological constant problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 03:08:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 02:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Low frequency waves, in the range $1$ to $10$ Hz for earthquakes and\nup to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a\nlarge amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological\nconditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant\nfundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic\nmetamaterial, or any other seismic shield, is to protect over this entire range\nof frequencies, the long wavelengths involved, and low frequency, have meant\nthis has been unachievable to date.\n  Elastic flexural waves, applicable in the mechanical vibrations of thin\nelastic plates, can be designed to have a broad zero-frequency stop-band using\na periodic array of very small clamped circles. Inspired by this experimental\nand theoretical observation, all be it in a situation far removed from seismic\nwaves, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve elastic surface (Rayleigh)\nand body (pressure P and shear S) wave reflectors at very large wavelengths in\nstructured soils modelled as a fully elastic layer periodically clamped to\nbedrock.\n  We identify zero frequency stop-bands that only exist in the limit of columns\nof concrete clamped at their base to the bedrock. In a realistic configuration\nof a sedimentary basin 15 meters deep we observe a zero frequency stop-band\ncovering a broad frequency range of $0$ to $30$ Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 19:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

To satisfy this demand, we propose two resource\nallocation (RA) algorithms to optimize the place of social media in the cache\nof the Base stations (BSs) and radio resources (i.e., transmit powers and\nsubcarriers), jointly in a multi-cell Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple\nAccess (OFDMA) based system. In the first scheme, the total downloading delay\nof the network is minimized, while in the second scheme, a fairness-aware\nscheme is proposed in which the maximum downloading delays is minimized. We\npropose iterative algorithms to solve each problem, where the content placement\nproblem and the joint subcarrier and transmit power allocation problem will be\niteratively optimized. We also prove that the proposed approaches converges to\na near-optimal solution, as well as the number of iterations increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 11:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 18:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 16:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}
