A time dependent scaling is used in the monitor function to\navoid possible sudden movement of the mesh points due to the creation or\ndiminishing of shock and rarefaction waves or the steepening of those waves.

The\nsensitive nature of much of the data that are daily exchanged or released to\nuntrusted parties requires that responsible organizations undertake appropriate\nprivacy protection measures. Nowadays, much of these data are texts (e.g.,\nemails, messages posted in social media, healthcare outcomes, etc.) that,\nbecause of their unstructured and semantic nature, constitute a challenge for\nautomatic data protection methods. In fact, textual documents are usually\nprotected manually, in a process known as document redaction or sanitization.\nTo do so, human experts identify sensitive terms (i.e., terms that may reveal\nidentities and/or confidential information) and protect them accordingly (e.g.,\nvia removal or, preferably, generalization). To relieve experts from this\nburdensome task, in a previous work we introduced the theoretical basis of\nC-sanitization, an inherently semantic privacy model that provides the basis to\nthe development of automatic document redaction/sanitization algorithms and\noffers clear and a priori privacy guarantees on data protection; even though\nits potential benefits C-sanitization still presents some limitations when\napplied to practice (mainly regarding flexibility, efficiency and accuracy).

Despite substantial efforts to understand this process, there\nremain many unsolved problems. Here, we propose an analytical model that\ndescribes how a heavily cratered surface reaches a state of crater count\nequilibrium. The proposed model formulates three physical processes\ncontributing to crater count equilibrium: cookie-cutting (simple, geometric\noverlap), ejecta-blanketing, and sandblasting (diffusive erosion). These three\nprocesses are modeled using a degradation parameter that describes the\nefficiency for a new crater to erase old craters. The flexibility of our newly\ndeveloped model allows us to represent the processes that underlie crater count\nequilibrium problems. The results show that when the slope of the production\nfunction is steeper than that of the equilibrium state, the power law of the\nequilibrium slope is independent of that of the production function slope. We\napply our model to the cratering conditions in the Sinus Medii region and at\nthe Apollo 15 landing site on the Moon and demonstrate that a consistent\ndegradation parameterization can successfully be determined based on the\nempirical results of these regions.

The DIM correctly predicts which\nsystems should be transient and works regardless of whether the accretor is a\nblack hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf. However, it has been known for\nsome time that the outbursts of X-ray binaries (which contain neutron-star or\nblack-hole accretors) exhibit hysteresis in the X-ray hardness-intensity\ndiagram (HID).

In this\npaper, we propose a semi-analytical method based on saddle point approximation\n(SPA) technique to calculate the SINR outage of a wireless system whose SINR\ncan be modeled in the form $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^M X_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i +1}$ where\n$X_i$ denotes the useful signal power, $Y_i$ denotes the power of the\ninterference signal, and $\\sum_{i=1}^M X_i$, $\\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i$ are independent\nrandom variables. Both $M$ and $N$ can also be random variables. The proposed\napproach is based on the saddle point approximation to cumulative distribution\nfunction (CDF) as given by \\tit{Wood-Booth-Butler formula}. The approach is\napplicable whenever the cumulant generating function (CGF) of the received\nsignal and interference exists, and it allows us to tackle distributions with\nlarge skewness and kurtosis with higher accuracy. In this regard, we exploit a\nfour parameter \\tit{normal-inverse Gaussian} (NIG) distribution as a base\ndistribution. Given that the skewness and kurtosis satisfy a specific\ncondition, NIG-based SPA works reliably. When this condition is violated, we\nrecommend SPA based on normal or symmetric NIG distribution, both special cases\nof NIG distribution, at the expense of reduced accuracy. For the purpose of\ndemonstration, we apply SPA for the SINR outage evaluation of a typical user\nexperiencing a downlink coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) from the\nbase stations (BSs) that are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. We\ncharacterize the outage of the typical user in scenarios such as (a)~when the\nnumber and locations of interferers are random, and (b)~when the fading\nchannels and number of interferers are random.

In this paper, we present\nan analysis of the nuclear source across three wavebands: mid-infrared (MIR)\ncontinuum, optical, and X-rays. We observed the source with the Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and combined this data with archival\nChandra data to perform broadband X-ray spectral fitting ($\\approx$0.5-40 keV)\nof the AGN for the first time.

While considerable study has probed the biophysical mechanisms of\nhow eukaryotic cells generate forces during migration, little such study has\nbeen devoted to bacteria, in particular with regard to the question of how\nbacteria generate and coordinate forces during collective motion. This question\nis addressed here for the first time using traction force microscopy. We study\ntwo distinct motility mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus, namely twitching and\ngliding. For twitching, powered by type-IV pilus retraction, we find that\nindividual cells exert local traction in small hotspots with forces on the\norder of 50 pN. Twitching of bacterial groups also produces traction hotspots,\nhowever with amplified forces around 100 pN. Although twitching groups migrate\nslowly as a whole, traction fluctuates rapidly on timescales <1.5 min. Gliding,\nthe second motility mechanism, is driven by lateral transport of substrate\nadhesions. When cells are isolated, gliding produces low average traction on\nthe order of 1 Pa. However, traction is amplified in groups by a factor of ~5.\nSince advancing protrusions of gliding cells push on average in the direction\nof motion, we infer a long-range compressive load sharing among sub-leading\ncells. Together, these results show that the forces generated during twitching\nand gliding have complementary characters and both forces are collectively\namplified in groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 21:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The magnitude of\nthis acceleration is however negligibly small and should not significantly\nalter the velocity of MBHs over relevant physical timescales.

Previous theoretical analyses\nhave shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup\nleaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small\nfraction of the total $\\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing\ntoward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.\n  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\\alpha$ inclusive cross\nsections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In\naddition to estimating the total $\\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our\ngoal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\\alpha$ particles\nand compare with experimental data, when available.\n  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive\nbreakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For\nthe NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,\nAustern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C32, 432 (1982)], within the DWBA\napproximation.\n  Results: Overall, the sum of the computed EBU and NEB cross sections is found\nto reproduce very well the measured singles cross sections. In all cases\nanalyzed, we find that the inclusive breakup cross section is largely dominated\nby the NEB component.\n  Conclusions: The presented method provides a global and systematic\ndescription of inclusive breakup reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. It\nprovides also a natural explanation of the previously observed underestimation\nof the measured $\\alpha$ yields by CDCC calculations. The method used here can\nbe extended to other weakly-bound projectiles, including halo nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 22:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 19:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

These nominally\nnarrow spectral bandwidth electromagnetic radiation pulses are efficiently\nproduced in the interaction between intense, well-focused electron and laser\nbeams. The spectral characteristics of such sources are affected by many\nexperimental parameters, such as the bandwidth of the laser, and the angles of\nboth the electrons and laser photons at collision. The laser field amplitude\ninduces harmonic generation and importantly, for the present work, nonlinear\nred shifting, both of which dilute the spectral brightness of the radiation. As\nthe applications enabled by this source often depend sensitively on its\nspectra, it is critical to resolve the details of the wavelength and angular\ndistribution obtained from ICS collisions. With this motivation, we present\nhere an experimental study that greatly improves on previous spectral\nmeasurement methods based on X-ray K-edge filters, by implementing a\nmulti-layer bent-crystal X-ray spectrometer.

We set up the basic theory, and prove a classification\nresult in terms of braided oplax monoidal functors to the Drinfeld center of\nsome monoidal category $\\mathcal T$.\n  Even the basic theory is interesting; it shares many characteristics with the\ntheory of monoidal categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category, but\nlacks some features. Of particular note, there is no cartesian product of\nbraided-enriched categories, and the natural transformations do not form a\n2-category, but rather satisfy a braided interchange relation.\n  Strikingly, our classification is slightly more general than what one might\nhave anticipated in terms of strong monoidal functors $\\mathcal V \\to\nZ(\\mathcal T)$. We would like to understand this further; in a future paper we\nshow that the functor is strong if and only if the enriched category is\n`complete' in a certain sense. Nevertheless it remains to understand what\nnon-complete enriched categories may look like.\n  One should think of our construction as a generalization of\nde-equivariantization, which takes a strong monoidal functor $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\n\\to Z(\\mathcal T)$ for some finite group $G$ and a monoidal category $\\mathcal\nT$, and produces a new monoidal category $\\mathcal T // G$.

The standard model (SM) is weakly\ncharged under the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry, in conjunction with newly\nintroduced three right-handed Majorana neutrinos and the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$\nHiggs. The model is built on the classical scale invariance, that is\ndynamically broken by a new strongly coupled sector, what is called the\nhypercolor (HC) sector, which is also weakly coupled to the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$\ngauge. At the HC strong scale, the simultaneous breaking of the EW and\n$U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetries is triggered by dynamically induced multiple\nseesaw mechanisms, namely bosonic seesaw mechanisms. Thus, all the origins of\nmasses are provided singly by the HC dynamics: that is what we call the\ndynamical scalegenesis.

Some insights on\nthe future capability of these surveys to answer crucial and fundamental issues\nare discussed, such as the mechanisms driving the spiral arms and the warp\nformation.

One of the reasons for this undeniable success is the great\nversatility of the finite-element approach to deal with different types of\ngeometries. This is particularly true of problems posed in curved domains of\narbitrary shape. In the case of function-value Dirichlet conditions prescribed\non curvilinear boundaries method's isoparametric version for meshes consisting\nof curved triangles or tetrahedra has been mostly employed to recover the\noptimal approximation properties known to hold for standard straight-edged\nelements in the case of polygonal or polyhedral domains. However, besides\nobvious algebraic and geometric inconveniences, the isoparametric technique is\nhelplessly limited in scope and simplicity, since its extension to degrees of\nfreedom other than function values is not straightforward if not unknown. The\npurpose of this paper is to propose, study and test a simple alternative that\nbypasses all the above drawbacks, without eroding qualitative approximation\nproperties. More specifically this technique can do without curved elements and\nis based only on polynomial algebra.

They proved an $O(n^{9/4})$ bound for the very special case of\nbipartite weavings of lines. Since then only little progress was made, until a\nrecent breakthrough by Aronov and Sharir (STOC 2016) who showed that\n$O(n^{3/2}\\mathrm{polylog}\\; n)$ fragments suffice for any set of lines. In a\nfollow-up paper Aronov, Miller and Sharir (SODA 2017) proved an\n$O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon})$ bound for triangles, but their method results in\npieces with curved boundaries. Moreover, their method uses polynomial\npartitions, for which currently no algorithm is known.

The running time of our\nalgorithm is $O(n^{3.69})$.

This\nresult extends to $xy$-monotone surface patches bounded by a constant number of\nbounded-degree algebraic arcs, constituting the first subquadratic bound for\nsurface patches.

Dissipation seems to set in at\nthe same length scale for different solar wind conditions independently of the\nenergy flux. To investigate this difference in more detail, we present an\nanalytic dissipation model for solar wind turbulence at electron scales, which\nwe compare with observed spectral densities. Our model combines the energy\ntransport from large to small scales and collisionless damping, which removes\nenergy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. We assume\nwave-particle interactions of kinetic Alfv\\'{e}n waves (KAW) to be the main\ndamping process. Wave frequencies and damping rates of KAW are obtained from\nthe hot plasma dispersion relation. Our model assumes a critically balanced\nturbulence, where larger energy cascade rates excite larger parallel\nwavenumbers for a certain perpendicular wavenumber. If the dissipation is\nadditionally wave driven such that the dissipation rate is proportional to the\nparallel wavenumber - as with KAW - then an increase of the energy cascade rate\nis counter-balanced by an increased dissipation rate for the same perpendicular\nwavenumber leading to a dissipation length independent of the energy cascade\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 13:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a\nlarge number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently\ndemonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex\nwaveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s)\ndue to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch\nconditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the\nhighly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,\nwe present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode\nwaveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the\nimplementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these\ncomponents is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for\ndifferent waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.\nUseful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for\neach waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters\ndepends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and\ndesired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained\nresults are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10-card shuffle\nrouter and enable >=40 Gb/s data transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 19:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

The novelty of the present\narticle is to show that anomalous diffusion could be investigated within the\nframework of non-Markovian linear Fokker-Planck equations. So on the ground of\nthis non-Markovian approach to Brownian motion, we find out anomalous diffusion\ncharacterized by the mean square displacement of a free particle and a harmonic\noscillator in absence of inertial force as well as the mean square momentum of\na free particle in presence of inertial force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 01:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

In this paper the action of a moving load is analysed on the simplest\nlattice model: a thin strip, where the fault propagating in its middle portion\nas the result of the moving force acting on the destroyed part of the\nstructure. We study both analytically and numerically how the load amplitude\nand its velocity influence the possible solution, and specifically the way the\nfracture process reaches its steady-state regime. We present the relation\nbetween the possible steady-state crack speed and the loading parameters, as\nwell as the energy release rate. In particular, we show that there exists a\nclass of loading regime corresponding to each point on the energy-speed diagram\n(and thus determine the same limiting steady-state regime). The phenomenon of\nthe forbidden regimes is discussed in detail, from both the points of view of\nforce and energy. For a sufficiently anisotropic structure, we find a stable\nsteady-state propagation corresponding to the slow crack. Numerical simulations\nreveal various ways by which the process approaches - or fails to approach -\nthe steady-state regime. The results extend our understanding of fracture\nprocesses in discrete structures, and reveal some new questions that should be\naddressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 15:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

The labeling process is usually\nnon-trivial and the labels themselves might skew the physical properties of the\nenzyme. Here we demonstrate an optical, label-free method capable of observing\nenzymatic interactions and the associated conformational changes on the single\nmolecule level. We monitor polymerase/DNA interactions via the strong\nnear-field enhancement provided by plasmonic nanorods resonantly coupled to\nwhispering gallery modes in microcavities. Specifically, we employ two\ndifferent recognition schemes: one in which the kinetics of polymerase/DNA\ninteractions are probed in the vicinity of DNA-functionalized nanorods, and the\nother in which these interactions are probed via the magnitude of\nconformational changes in the polymerase molecules immobilized on nanorods. In\nboth approaches we find that low and high polymerase activities can be clearly\ndiscerned via their characteristic signal amplitude and signal length\ndistributions. Furthermore, the thermodynamic study of the monitored\ninteractions suggests the occurrence of DNA polymerization. This work\nconstitutes a proof-of-concept study of enzymatic activities via plasmonically\nenhanced microcavities and establishes an alternative and label-free method\ncapable of investigating structural changes in single molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 11:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

To this end, we propose an automatic sleep stage monitoring system\nbased on an affordable, unobtrusive, discreet, and long-term wearable in-ear\nsensor for recording the Electroencephalogram (ear-EEG). The selected features\nfor sleep pattern classification from a single ear-EEG channel include the\nspectral edge frequency (SEF) and multi- scale fuzzy entropy (MSFE), a\nstructural complexity feature. In this preliminary study, the manually scored\nhypnograms from simultaneous scalp-EEG and ear-EEG recordings of four subjects\nare used as labels for two analysis scenarios: 1) classification of ear-EEG\nhypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings and 2) prediction of scalp-EEG\nhypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings. We consider both 2-class and 4-class\nsleep scoring, with the achieved accuracies ranging from 78.5 % to 95.2 % for\near-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG, and 76.8 % to 91.8 % for scalp-EEG\nlabels predicted from ear-EEG. The corresponding kappa coefficients, which\nrange from 0.64 to 0.83 for Scenario 1 and from 0.65 to 0.80 for Scenario 2,\nindicate a Substantial to Almost Perfect agreement, thus proving the\nfeasibility of in-ear sensing for sleep monitoring in the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 10:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}
