Pulsed field\ngradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion is much more complicated than PFG normal\ndiffusion. There have been many theoretical and experimental studies for PFG\nisotropic anomalous diffusion, but there are very few theoretical treatments\nreported for anisotropic anomalous diffusion. Currently, there is not a general\nPFG signal attenuation expression, which includes the finite gradient pulse\neffect and can treat all three types of anisotropic fractional diffusions:\ngeneral fractional diffusion, time fractional diffusion, and space-fractional\ndiffusion. In this paper, the recently developed instantaneous signal\nattenuation (ISA) method was applied to obtain PFG signal attenuation\nexpression for free and restricted anisotropic anomalous diffusion with two\nmodels: fractal derivative and fractional derivative models. The obtained PFG\nsignal attenuation expression for anisotropic anomalous diffusion can reduce to\nthe reported result for PFG anisotropic normal diffusion. The results can also\nreduce to reported PFG isotropic anomalous diffusion results obtained by\neffective phase shift diffusion equation method and instantaneous signal\nattenuation method. For anisotropic space-fractional diffusion, the obtained\nresult agrees with that obtained by the modified Bloch equation method.\nAdditionally, The PFG signal attenuation expressions for free and restricted\nanisotropic curvilinear diffusions were derived by the traditional method, the\nresults of which agree with the PFG anisotropic fractional diffusion results\nbased on the fractional derivative model. The powder pattern of PFG anisotropic\ndiffusion was also discussed. The results here improve our understanding of PFG\nanomalous diffusion, and provide new formalisms for PFG anisotropic anomalous\ndiffusion in NMR and MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 16:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 17:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

We then apply this new tool to the problems of (i)~identifying\nedges between regions with different texture, and (ii)~quantify the\ndissimilarity between pairs of samples in actual SAR data. We analyze the\nadvantages of using the geodesic distance when compared to stochastic\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 22:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

In fact, we prove that if ${\\rm Reg}(G)$ is the set of regular\nelements of $G$, then $P_k(G)\\cap {\\rm Reg}(G)$ is closed in ${\\rm Reg}(G)$. On\nthe other hand, the weak exponentiality of $G$ turns out to be equivalent to\nthe density of all the power maps $P_k$. In linear Lie groups, weak\nexponentiality reduces to the density of $P_2(G)$. We also prove that the\ndensity of the image of $P_k$ for $G$ implies the same for any connected full\nrank subgroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 08:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the\njudgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer.\nA large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the\nliterature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the\nmajority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for aggregating judgments - the transmission chain - which has\nnot yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence.\nIn a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective\nsolution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the\ncollective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members.\nWe address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster\ncollective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical\nsimulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the\ntransmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the\nstructure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to\nthose of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we\nrely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary\ndecisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods\nempirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has\nthe best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the\ntransmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those\nthat have cumulative properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 08:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

The affective attributes are\nimportant factors for the future of machine consciousness with the rise of\ntechnologies that can assist humans. Personality and affection hence can give\nan additional flavor for the computational model of consciousness in humanoid\nrobotics. Recent advances in areas of machine learning with a focus on deep\nlearning can further help in developing aspects of machine consciousness in\nareas that can better replicate human sensory perceptions such as speech\nrecognition and vision. With such advancements, one encounters further\nchallenges in developing models that can synchronize different aspects of\naffective computing.

Since the measurement of reduction probabilities is not\ndisturbed by state decoherence, the experiment can be performed at room\ntemperature.

In this paper, we\npresent a new analysis of the absolute magnitude and optical color distribution\nof Hilda asteroids, which lie in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter,\nwith the goal of comparing the bulk properties with previously published\nresults from an analogous study of Jupiter Trojans. We report an updated power\nlaw fit of the Hilda magnitude distribution through H=14. Using photometric\ndata listed in the Sloan Moving Object Catalog, we confirm the\npreviously-reported strong bimodality in visible spectral slope distribution,\nindicative of two sub-populations with differing surface compositions. When\nconsidering collisional families separately, we find that collisional fragments\nfollow a unimodal color distribution with spectral slope values consistent with\nthe bluer of the two sub-populations. The color distributions of Hildas and\nTrojans are comparable and consistent with a scenario in which the color\nbimodality in both populations developed prior to emplacement into their\npresent-day locations. We propose that the shallower magnitude distribution of\nthe Hildas is a result of an initially much larger Hilda population, which was\nsubsequently depleted as smaller bodies were preferentially ejected from the\nnarrow 3:2 resonance via collisions. Altogether, these observations provide a\nstrong case supporting a common origin for Hildas and Trojans as predicted by\ncurrent dynamical instability theories of Solar System evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 11:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

A cascade process occurs when multi-TeV gamma rays from AGN interact\nwith extragalactic background light (EBL) photons to produce electron-positron\npairs, which then interact with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons via\ninverse-Compton scattering to produce gamma rays. Due to the deflection of the\nelectron-positron pairs, a non-zero intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) would\npotentially produce detectable effects on the angular distribution of the\ncascade emission. In particular, an angular broadening compared to the\nunscattered emission could occur.

However, imperfect CSI, due to channel estimation error, imperfect\nCSI feedback and time selectivity of the channel, lead to a performance loss.\nIn this work, we propose a novel limited feedback algorithm for single-input\nsingle-output interference alignment in time-variant channels. The feedback\nalgorithm encodes the channel evolution in a small number of subspace\ncoefficients, which allow for reduced-rank channel prediction to compensate for\nthe channel estimation error due to time selectivity of the fading process and\nfeedback delay. An upper bound for the rate loss caused by feedback\nquantization and channel prediction is derived. Based on this bound, we develop\na dimension switching algorithm for the reduced-rank predictor to find the best\ntradeoff between quantization- and prediction-error. Besides, we characterize\nthe scaling of the required number of feedback bits in order to decouple the\nrate loss due to channel quantization from the transmit power.

Although simulated data\naugmented with a few real world samples has been shown to mitigate domain shift\nand improve transferability of trained models, guiding or bootstrapping the\nvirtual data generation with the distributions learnt from target real world\ndomain is desired, especially in the fields where annotating even few real\nimages is laborious (such as semantic labeling, and intrinsic images etc.). In\norder to address this problem in an unsupervised manner, our work combines\nrecent advances in CG (which aims to generate stochastic scene layouts coupled\nwith large collections of 3D object models) and generative adversarial training\n(which aims train generative models by measuring discrepancy between generated\nand real data in terms of their separability in the space of a deep\ndiscriminatively-trained classifier). Our method uses iterative estimation of\nthe posterior density of prior distributions for a generative graphical model.\nThis is done within a rejection sampling framework. Initially, we assume\nuniform distributions as priors on the parameters of a scene described by a\ngenerative graphical model. As iterations proceed the prior distributions get\nupdated to distributions that are closer to the (unknown) distributions of\ntarget data. We demonstrate the utility of adversarially tuned scene generation\non two real-world benchmark datasets (CityScapes and CamVid) for traffic scene\nsemantic labeling with a deep convolutional net (DeepLab).

Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have\nrevealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural\nproperties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500-1000 atom)\nQM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to\nsignificant charge transfer between the core active site and surrounding\nprotein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force\nfields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow\nconvergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most\natom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into\nthe crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and\ndevelop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the\ncharge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron\ndensity when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by\nlarge-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the\nhighly-parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how\ncore/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM\nresidue on smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA\napproaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes:\ncatechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme. We\nalso introduce validation strategies and test sensitivities of the two methods\nto geometric structure, basis set size, and electronic structure methodology.\nBoth methods represent promising approaches for the systematic, unbiased\ndetermination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and large systems that\nnecessitate multi-scale modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 15:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

We firstly solve Einstein field equations\nminimally coupled to an arbitrary (current-free) nonlinear Lagrangian of\nelectrodynamics (NLED) in the slow rotation regime $a\\ll M$ (black hole's\nmass), up to first order in $a/M$. We then make use of the robust and\nself-contained Born-Infeld Lagrangian in order to compare and contrast the\nphysical properties of such NLED spacetime with its Maxwellian counterpart (a\nslowly rotating Kerr-Newman spacetime), especially focusing on the astrophysics\nof both neutrino flavor oscillations ($\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$)\nand spin-flip ($\\nu_l \\rightarrow \\nu_r$, \"$l$\" stands for \"left\" and \"$r$\"\nstands for \"right\", change of neutrino handedness) mass level-crossings, the\nequivalent to gyroscopic precessions. Such analysis proves that in the\nspacetime of a slowly rotating nonlinear charged black hole (RNCBH),\nintrinsically associated with the assumption the electromagnetism is nonlinear,\nthe neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae could be significantly\nchanged. In such astrophysical environment a positive enhancement (reduction of\nthe electron fraction $Y_e<0.5$) of the r-process may take place. Consequently,\nit might result in hyperluminous supernova explosions due to enlargement, in\natomic number and amount, of the decaying nuclides. Finally, we envisage some\nphysical scenarios that may lead to short-lived charged black holes with high\ncharge-to-mass ratios (associated with unstable highly magnetized neutron\nstars) and ways to possibly disentangle theories of the electromagnetism from\nother black holes observables (by means of light polarization measurements).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

The pressure\nwithin the interior region is equal to the negative matter density which\nprovides a repulsive force over the shell. This thin shell is formed by ultra\nrelativistic plasma, where the pressure is directly proportional to the\nmatter-energy density which does counter balance the repulsive force from the\ninterior whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum assumed to be de\nSitter spacetime which can be described by the generalized Schwarzschild\nsolution. With this specification we find out a set of exact and non-singular\nsolutions of the gravastar which seems physically very interesting and\nreasonable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 07:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 17:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 14:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

In the case of Wave Mechanics, de\nBroglie's merging of Maupertuis's and Fermat's principles (see Section 3)\nprovides, without resorting to the probability-based guidance-laws and\nflow-lines of the Bohmian theory, the simple law addressing particles along the\nHelmholtz rays of the relevant matter waves. The purpose of the present\nresearch was to derive the exact Hamiltonian ray-trajectory systems concerning,\nrespectively, classical electromagnetic waves, non-relativistic matter waves\nand relativistic matter waves. We faced then, as a typical example, the\nnumerical solution of non-relativistic wave-mechanical equation systems in a\nnumber of numerical applications, showing that each particle turns out to\n\"dances a wave-mechanical dance\" around its classical trajectory, to which it\nreduces when the ray-coupling is neglected. Our approach reaches the double\ngoal of a clear insight into the mechanism of wave-particle duality and of a\nreasonably simple computability. We finally compared our exact dynamical\napproach, running as close as possible to Classical Mechanics, with the\nhydrodynamic Bohmian theory, based on fluid-like \"guidance laws\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 13:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 12:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 14:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 10:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 15:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 12:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 12:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 10:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 14:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

It is postulated that the spacetime region on which\nthe evolution of the state vector exists is bounded towards the future by a\nborder that is dynamically moving towards the future, and at which the state\nvector must fulfil a boundary condition. Wavefunction collapse is represented\nin such a way that the evolution of the state vector changes abruptly at\ncritical spacetime expansions to an evolution resembling a classical\ntrajectory. This can explain the correlations in EPR experiments without coming\ninto conflict with relativity, since the evolution of the state vector before\nand after the abrupt change is governed solely by local physical laws. This\nmodel leads to the same lifetimes of superpositions as the gravity-based\napproaches of Diosi and Penrose, and is characterised by the facts that energy\nis conserved at collapse and that the reduction point in time does not vary\nstatistically. Some unique features of the model are that it naturally leads to\nstochastic behaviour and that it can predict reduction probabilities. It\nexplains why all experiments performed so far behave in agreement with Born's\nrule, due to a property that they have in common. This gives rise to new\nexperiments for checking Born's rule, which can be realised in the short term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2017 09:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 17:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 18:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 10:04:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 09:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In this report, the exact solution is\npresented without any assumptions by calculating the pseudo inverse of matrix\nC. All eight magnetic parameters such as spin exchange interaction, second\norder magnetic anisotropy, fourth order magnetic anisotropy, stress induced\nmagnetic anisotropy, demagnetization factor, in plane magnetic field, out of\nplane magnetic field and magnetic dipole interaction were taken into account.\nThe easy and hard directions were found using 3-D and 2-D plots of total\nmagnetic energy versus these magnetic parameters.
