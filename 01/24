According to the urgent demands of\nnanotechnology miniaturization for ultra-high density data storage in advanced\nnonvolatile memory cells, it is very important to reduce the sizes of\nmultiferroic nanoparticles in the self-assembled arrays without serious\ndeterioration of their properties. We study size effects of the phase diagrams,\nFE and ME properties of semi-ellipsoidal BiFeO3 nanoparticles clamped to a\nrigid conductive substrate. The spatial distribution of the spontaneous\npolarization vector inside the nanoparticles, phase diagrams and\nparamagnetoelectric (PME) coefficient were calculated in the framework of\nmodified Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach. Analytical expressions were\nderived for the dependences of the FE transition temperature, average\npolarization, linear dielectric susceptibility and PME coefficient on the\nparticle sizes for a general case of a semi-ellipsoidal nanoparticles with\nthree different semi-axes a, b and height c. The analyses of the obtained\nresults leads to the conclusion that the size effect of the phase diagrams,\nspontaneous polarization and PME coefficient is rather sensitive to the\nparticle sizes aspect ratio in the polarization direction, and less sensitive\nto the absolute values of the sizes per se.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 16:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for\nthe spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution\nduring slow-roll inflation. However slow roll only requires that the Hubble\nrate varies slowly compared to the Hubble time, while the time taken for the\nstochastic distribution to evolve to the de-Sitter equilibrium solution can be\nmuch longer than a Hubble time.

The analysis of the integrated Halpha emission shows that the\nspecific star formation rates (SSFRs) of a majority of the cluster galaxies are\nbelow the field values for a given stellar mass. We interpret this result as\nevidence for a slow decrease in the star formation activity of star-forming\ngalaxies as they fall into higher-density regions, contrary to some previous\nstudies which suggested a rapid truncation of star formation. We find that most\nof the intermediate- and high-mass spiral galaxies go through a phase in which\ntheir star formation is suppressed but still retain significant star-formation\nactivity. During this phase, these galaxies tend to retain their spiral\nmorphology while their colours become redder.

Conventional\ncameras address this problem by compartmentalizing imaging from high-level task\nprocessing. As such, conventional imaging involves processing the RAW sensor\nmeasurements in a sequential pipeline of steps, such as demosaicking,\ndenoising, deblurring, tone-mapping and compression. This pipeline is optimized\nto obtain a visually pleasing image. High-level processing, on the other hand,\ninvolves steps such as feature extraction, classification, tracking, and\nfusion. While this siloed design approach allows for efficient development, it\nalso dictates compartmentalized performance metrics, without knowledge of the\nhigher-level task of the camera system. For example, today's demosaicking and\ndenoising algorithms are designed using perceptual image quality metrics but\nnot with domain-specific tasks such as object detection in mind. We propose an\nend-to-end differentiable architecture that jointly performs demosaicking,\ndenoising, deblurring, tone-mapping, and classification.

We also apply\nour method to fully evaluate the one-loop five-point amplitude in the maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory; the final result is identical to the one\nobtained by Q-Cut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 16:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

As a result,\nefficient data storage and retrieval processes that satisfy various QoS\nrequirements are needed. This paper studies storage allocation, meaning how\ndata of different classes must be spread over the set of storage nodes of a\nDSS. More specifically, assuming a probabilistic access to the storage nodes,\nwe aim at maximizing the weighted sum of the probability of successful data\nrecovery of data classes, when for each class a minimum QoS (probability of\nsuccessful recovery) is guaranteed. Solving this optimization problem for a\ngeneral setup is intractable. Thus, we find the optimal storage allocation when\nthe data of each class is spread minimally over the storage nodes, i.e. minimal\nspreading allocation (MSA).

The zebra patterns observed in solar radio emission are very\nimportant for are plasma diagnostics.

We aim to study in detail the double plasma resonance instability of hot\nelectrons, together with a much denser thermal background plasma. In\nparticular, we analyse how the growth rate of the instability depends on the\ntemperature of both the hot plasma and background plasma components. Methods.\nWe numerically integrated the analysed model equations, using Python and\nWolfram Mathematica. Results. We found that the growth-rate maxima of the\nupper-hybrid waves for non-zero temperatures of both the hot and background\nplasma are shifted towards lower frequencies comparing to the zero temperature\ncase. This shift increases with an increase of the harmonic number s of the\nelectron cyclotron frequency and temperatures of both hot and background plasma\ncomponents.

Furthermore, a large-$f$ axion may appear in the low-energy effective\ntheory based on two subplanckian axions in the UV. The resulting effective\nstring is a composite object built from several fundamental strings and domain\nwalls. It may or may not satisfy the magnetic Weak Gravity Conjecture depending\non how strictly the latter is interpreted and on the cosmological dynamics of\nthis composite object, which remain to be fully understood.

The quantum\ncorrections consist of three different parts: a generalisation of the\nflat-space correction, which is only significant at distances of the order of\nthe Planck length; a constant correction depending on the undetermined\nparameters of the renormalised effective action; and a term which grows\nlogarithmically with the distance from the particle. This last term is the most\ninteresting, and when resummed gives a modified power law, enhancing the\ngravitational force at large distances. As a check on the accuracy of our\ncalculation, we recover the linearised Kerr-de Sitter metric in the classical\nlimit and the flat-space quantum correction in the limit of vanishing Hubble\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Numerical results, obtained by exact diagonalization, are in excellent\nagreement with the analytical spectral density even for relatively small $N\n\\sim 8$.

This spectral density reproduces the known result for the free\nenergy in the large $q$ and $N$ limit. In the infrared region, where the SYK\nmodel is believed to have a gravity-dual, the spectral density is given by\n$\\rho(E) \\sim \\sinh[2\\pi \\sqrt 2 \\sqrt{(1-E/E_0)/(-\\log \\eta)}]$. It therefore\nhas a square-root edge, as in random matrix ensembles, followed by an\nexponential growth, a distinctive feature of black holes and also of low energy\nnuclear excitations. Results for level-statistics in this region confirm the\nagreement with random matrix theory. Physically this is a signature that, for\nsufficiently long times, the SYK model and its gravity dual evolve to a fully\nergodic state whose dynamics only depends on the global symmetry of the system.\nOur results strongly suggest that random matrix correlations are a universal\nfeature of quantum black holes and that the SYK model, combined with\nholography, may be relevant to model certain aspects of the nuclear dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 19:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 18:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Graph structures,\ncompared to the well-mixed case, can act as amplifiers or suppressors of\nselection by increasing or decreasing the fixation probability of a beneficial\nmutant. Properties of the associated mean fixation times can be more intricate,\nespecially when selection is strong. The intuition is that fixation of a\nbeneficial mutant happens fast (in a dominance game), that fixation takes very\nlong (in a coexistence game), and that strong selection eliminates demographic\nnoise. Here we show that these intuitions can be misleading in structured\npopulations. We analyze mean fixation times on the cycle graph under strong\nfrequency-dependent selection for two different microscopic evolutionary update\nrules (death-birth and birth-death). We establish exact analytical results for\nfixation times under strong selection, and show that there are coexistence\ngames in which fixation occurs in time polynomial in population size. Depending\non the underlying game, we observe inherence of demographic noise even under\nstrong selection, if the process is driven by random death before selection for\nbirth of an offspring (death-birth update). In contrast, if selection for an\noffspring occurs before random removal (birth-death update), strong selection\ncan remove demographic noise almost entirely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 20:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

We propose a block-diagonal coding scheme\nconsisting of partitioning the matrix into submatrices and encoding each\nsubmatrix using a shorter MDS code. We show that the assignment of coded matrix\nrows to servers to minimize the communication load can be formulated as an\ninteger program with a nonlinear cost function, and propose an algorithm to\nsolve it. We further prove that, up to a level of partitioning, the proposed\nscheme does not incur any loss in terms of computational delay (as defined by\nLi et al.) and communication load compared to the scheme by Li et al..

Spins naturally have magnetic dipoles, so\nalternating current (AC) magnetic fields are frequently used to drive spin\ntransitions and perform quantum gates. These fields can be difficult to\nspatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such\nas AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin\nqubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be\ndriven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by\ndemonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P\nand $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their\ndonor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field\ncontrol since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale. This leads\nto lower power requirements, higher qubit densities, and faster gate times. We\nalso show that this form of control allows for driving nuclear spin qubits at\neither their resonance frequency or the first subharmonic of that frequency,\nthus reducing device bandwidth requirements. Interestingly, as we relax the\nbandwidth requirements, we demonstrate that the computational Hilbert space is\nexpanded to include double quantum transitions, making it feasible to use all\nfour nuclear spin states to implement nuclear-spin-based qudits in Si:As.

The approach involves partitioning the regression input domain\ninto multiple local regions with a different local GP model fitted in each\nregion. Unlike existing local partitioned GP approaches, we introduce a\ntechnique for patching together the local GP models nearly seamlessly to ensure\nthat the local GP models for two neighboring regions produce nearly the same\nresponse prediction and prediction error variance on the boundary between the\ntwo regions. This largely mitigates the well-known discontinuity problem that\ndegrades the boundary accuracy of existing local partitioned GP methods. Our\nmain innovation is to represent the continuity conditions as additional\npseudo-observations that the differences between neighboring GP responses are\nidentically zero at an appropriately chosen set of boundary input locations. To\npredict the response at any input location, we simply augment the actual\nresponse observations with the pseudo-observations and apply standard GP\nprediction methods to the augmented data. In contrast to heuristic continuity\nadjustments, this has an advantage of working within a formal GP framework, so\nthat the GP-based predictive uncertainty quantification remains valid. Our\napproach also inherits a sparse block-like structure for the sample covariance\nmatrix, which results in computationally efficient closed-form expressions for\nthe predictive mean and variance. In addition, we provide a new spatial\npartitioning scheme based on a recursive space partitioning along local\nprincipal component directions, which makes the proposed approach applicable\nfor regression domains having more than two dimensions. Using three spatial\ndatasets and three higher dimensional datasets, we investigate the numerical\nperformance of the approach and compare it to several state-of-the-art\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 22:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 19:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 16:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

In addition, to form a succinct representation of the\nhigh-dimensional and complex motion fields, principal component analysis is\ncarried out to characterize the central tendencies and variations of motion\nfields of our speech tasks. Our proposed method provides a platform to\nquantitatively and objectively explain the differences and variability of\ntongue motion by illuminating internal motion and strain that have so far been\nintractable. The findings are used to understand how tongue function for speech\nis limited by abnormal internal motion and strain in glossectomy patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 02:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 02:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Several algorithms for tree\ndelineation have been suggested, mostly based on locating local maxima or\ninverted basins in raster canopy height models (CHMs) derived from Light\nDetection And Ranging (LiDAR) data or photographs. However, these algorithms\noften lead to inaccurate estimates of forest stand characteristics due to the\nlimited information content of raster CHMs. Here we develop a 3D tree\ndelineation method which uses graph cut to delineate trees from the full 3D\nLiDAR point cloud, and also makes use of any optical imagery available\n(hyperspectral imagery in our case). First, conventional methods are used to\nlocate local maxima in the CHM and generate an initial map of trees. Second, a\ngraph is built from the LiDAR point cloud, fused with the hyperspectral data.\nFor computational efficiency, the feature space of hyperspectral imagery is\nreduced using robust PCA. Third, a multi-class normalised cut is applied to the\ngraph, using the initial map of trees to constrain the number of clusters and\ntheir locations. Finally, recursive normalised cut is used to subdivide, if\nnecessary, each of the clusters identified by the initial analysis. We call\nthis approach Multiclass Cut followed by Recursive Cut (MCRC). The\neffectiveness of MCRC was tested using three datasets: i) NewFor, ii) a\nconiferous forest in the Italian Alps, and iii) a deciduous woodland in the UK.\nThe performance of MCRC was usually superior to that of other delineation\nmethods, and was further improved by including high-resolution optical imagery.\nSince MCRC delineates the entire LiDAR point cloud in 3D, it allows individual\ncrown characteristics to be measured. By making full use of the data available,\ngraph cut has the potential to considerably improve the accuracy of tree\ndelineation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 02:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

A common\nassumption adopted in the literature is that the realized (ground truth) reward\nby taking the selected action is observed by the learner at no cost, which,\nhowever, is not realistic in many practical scenarios. When observing the\nground truth reward is costly, a key challenge for the learner is how to\njudiciously acquire the ground truth by assessing the benefits and costs in\norder to balance learning efficiency and learning cost. From the information\ntheoretic perspective, a perhaps even more interesting question is how much\nefficiency might be lost due to this cost. In this paper, we design a novel\ncontextual bandit-based learning algorithm and endow it with the active\nlearning capability. The key feature of our algorithm is that in addition to\nsending a query to an annotator for the ground truth, prior information about\nthe ground truth learned by the learner is sent together, thereby reducing the\nquery cost. We prove that by carefully choosing the algorithm parameters, the\nlearning regret of the proposed algorithm achieves the same order as that of\nconventional contextual bandit algorithms in cost-free scenarios, implying\nthat, surprisingly, cost due to acquiring the ground truth does not increase\nthe learning regret in the long-run.

An\ninteresting consequence is that even in the absence of the sampling frequency\nconstraint, the optimal strategy is not zero-wait sampling in which a new\nsample is taken once the previous sample is delivered; rather, it is optimal to\nwait for a non-zero amount of time after the previous sample is delivered, and\nthen take the next sample.

These guarantees shed light on the effectiveness of single\ncountermeasures and their composition and allow practitioners to more precisely\ngauge the risk of an attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 06:09:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 05:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

Emerging evidence suggests\nstate-related changes in brain connectivity where dependence structure\nalternates between a finite number of latent states or regimes. Another\nchallenge is inference of full-brain networks with large number of nodes. We\nemploy a Markov-switching dynamic factor model in which the state-driven\ntime-varying connectivity regimes of high-dimensional fMRI data are\ncharacterized by lower-dimensional common latent factors, following a\nregime-switching process. It enables a reliable, data-adaptive estimation of\nchange-points of connectivity regimes and the massive dependencies associated\nwith each regime. We consider the switching VAR to quantity the dynamic\neffective connectivity. We propose a three-step estimation procedure: (1)\nextracting the factors using principal component analysis (PCA) and (2)\nidentifying dynamic connectivity states using the factor-based switching vector\nautoregressive (VAR) models in a state-space formulation using Kalman filter\nand expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and (3) constructing the\nhigh-dimensional connectivity metrics for each state based on subspace\nestimates. Simulation results show that our proposed estimator outperforms the\nK-means clustering of time-windowed coefficients, providing more accurate\nestimation of regime dynamics and connectivity metrics in high-dimensional\nsettings.

It was also shown that the\nirreducible admissible region for the octupolar tensor in a three-dimensional\nparameter space is bounded by a dome-shaped surface, beneath which is a\n\\emph{separatrix} surface connecting the two generic octupolar states. The\nlatter surface, which was obtained through numerical continuation, may be\nphysically interpreted as marking a possible \\emph{intra-octupolar} transition.\nIn this paper, by using the resultant theory of algebraic geometry and the\nE-characteristic polynomial of spectral theory of tensors, we give a\nclosed-form, algebraic expression for both the dome-shaped surface and the\nseparatrix surface. This turns the envisaged intra-octupolar transition into a\nquantitative, possibly observable prediction. Some other properties of\noctupolar tensors are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 08:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2017 04:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

On the other hand, the N/C and C/O\nratios, which include carbon, may contain systematic errors for stars with Teff\n> 18500 K because of neglected overionization of CII ions. The ratio N/O is\nstudied in the atmospheres of 46 early main-sequence B stars. These values of\nN/O are examined as functions of the effective temperature, age, rotation\nspeed, and mass of the stars. Most early B-stars in the main sequence are found\nto have [N / O] = 0 , which indicates that N/O varies little during the main\nsequence stage, and this result is independent of the basic parameters listed\nabove. There are two explanations for the large number of stars with [N / O] =\n0 : it is predicted theoretically that for an initial rotation velocity V0 <\n100 km/s, N/O varies little toward the end of the main sequence stage ([N/O] <\n0.2) and observations show that most early main-sequence B-stars do actually\nhave low initial rotation velocities V0. The few early main-sequence B-stars\nwith higher [N/O] = 0.4-0.8 correspond to models with rotation velocities V0 =\n200-300 km/s.

The free layer and a\nsynthetic antiferromagnetic (SyF) pinned layer of the spin-torque oscillator\nare in-plane magnetized. In order to understand experimental results, numerical\nsimulations have been performed considering three types of interlayer\ninteractions: exchange interaction between the two magnetic layers of the SyF,\nmutual spin torque between the top layer of the SyF and the free layer and\ndipolar interaction between all three magnetic layers. It will be shown that\nthe dynamic dipolar coupling plays a predominant role. First, it leads to a\nhybridization of the free layer and the SyF linear modes and through this gives\nrise to a strong field dependence of the critical current. In particular, there\nis a field range of enhanced damping in which much higher current is required\nto drive the modes into steady state. This results in a gap in the excitation\nspectrum. Second, the dynamic dipolar interaction is also responsible for the\nnon-linear interaction between the current driven steady state mode and the\ndamped modes of the system. Here one can distinguish: (i) a resonant\ninteraction that leads to a kink in the frequency-field and frequency-current\ndispersions accompanied by a small hysteresis and a reduction of the linewidth\nof the steady state mode and (ii) a non-resonant interaction that leads to a\nstrong frequency redshift of the damped mode.

To this regard,\nin this work we apply the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to the study\nof two of the most commonly used solar cycle indicators; i.e. the series of the\nsunspots number (SSN), and the radio flux 10.7 cm, with the aim of identifying\npossible dynamical transitions in the system.

Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling,\nand media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default\nend-to-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls,\nvideos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by\nany unauthorized entity since WhatsApp. In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp\nmessaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on\nits privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which\nforms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection\nagainst forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that\nsimply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata\ncan reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their\npatterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security\narchitecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols\nused. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further\nmeasures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability.\nWe start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be\nunderstood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture,\n(iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the\nimportant concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the\narchitecture are - end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, and\ncurve25519. The description of the security architecture covers key management,\nend-to-end encryption in WhatsApp, Authentication Mechanism, Message Exchange,\nand finally the security evaluation. We then cover importance of metadata and\nrole it plays in conserving privacy with respect to whatsapp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 11:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

We propose a basic model to elucidate the\ninterplay between a steady build-up of stresses and their fast release. The\nmodel reveals that for millimetric droplets the fragment velocities upon\nexplosion are independent of the droplet size and only depend on material\nproperties (such as the tensile stress of the ice and the bulk modulus of\nwater). For small (sub-millimetric) droplets, on the other hand, surface\ntension starts to play a role.

By allowing multiple users to share the\nsame time and frequency, NOMA can scale up the number of served users and\nincrease spectral efficiency compared with existing orthogonal multiple access\n(OMA). Conventional NOMA schemes with successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) do not work well when users with comparable received powers transmit\ntogether. To allow power-balanced NOMA (more exactly, near power-balanced\nNOMA), this paper investigates a new NOMA architecture, named Network-Coded\nMultiple Access (NCMA). A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost NOMA\nthroughputs. We first show that a simple NCMA architecture in which all users\nuse the same modulation, referred to as rate-homogeneous NCMA, can achieve\nsubstantial throughput improvement over SIC-based NOMA under near\npower-balanced scenarios. Then, we put forth a new NCMA architecture, referred\nto as rate-diverse NCMA, in which different users may adopt different\nmodulations commensurate with their relative SNRs. A challenge for rate-diverse\nNCMA is the design of a channel-coded PNC system. This paper is the first\nattempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC. Experimental results on our\nsoftware-defined radio prototype show that the throughput of rate-diverse NCMA\ncan outperform the state-of-the-art rate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall,\nrate-diverse NCMA is a practical solution for near power-balanced NOMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 11:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Not only that, but LBN (LRBN) is\nobserved to be the transition path from BN (RBN) to Mixed state. Moreover, BN\nphenomenon takes place in the area of low density ratio and found to be\nindependent of layer structure, while RBN is sensitive to the layer structure\nand occurs at the large density ratio but lower diameter ratio. Our result may\nbe helpful for the establishment of theory about the segregation and mixing of\ngranular mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 12:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In racetrack\nmemory, each magnetic domain can store a single bit of information, which can\nbe sensed by a reading port (head). The memory has a tape-like structure which\nsupports a shift operation that moves the domains to be read sequentially by\nthe head. In order to increase the memory's speed, prior work studied how to\nminimize the latency of the shift operation, while the no less important\nreliability of this operation has received only a little attention.\n  In this work we design codes which combat shift errors in racetrack memory,\ncalled position errors. Namely, shifting the domains is not an error-free\noperation and the domains may be over-shifted or are not shifted, which can be\nmodeled as deletions and sticky insertions. While it is possible to use\nconventional deletion and insertion-correcting codes, we tackle this problem\nwith the special structure of racetrack memory, where the domains can be read\nby multiple heads. Each head outputs a noisy version of the stored data and the\nmultiple outputs are combined in order to reconstruct the data. Under this\nparadigm, we will show that it is possible to correct, with at most a single\nbit of redundancy, $d$ deletions with $d+1$ heads if the heads are\nwell-separated.

Its importance comes from its crucial role to quantify\nthe efficiency of processes as varied as diffusion-limited reactions, target\nsearch processes or spreading of diseases. Most methods to determine the FPT\nproperties in confined domains have been limited to Markovian (memoryless)\nprocesses. However, as soon as the random walker interacts with its\nenvironment, memory effects can not be neglected. Examples of non Markovian\ndynamics include single-file diffusion in narrow channels or the motion of a\ntracer particle either attached to a polymeric chain or diffusing in simple or\ncomplex fluids such as nematics \\cite{turiv2013effect}, dense soft colloids or\nviscoelastic solution.

The non-Markovian features of\nthe dynamics are encompassed by determining the statistical properties of the\ntrajectory of the random walker in the future of the first-passage event, which\nare shown to govern the FPT kinetics.This analysis is applicable to a broad\nrange of stochastic processes, possibly correlated at long-times.

A TDS is characterized by the linear touching of bulk (conduction\nand valance) bands at discrete points in the momentum space (i.e. 3D Dirac\npoints), such as in Na3Bi and Cd3As2. More recently, new types of Dirac\nsemimetals with robust Dirac line-nodes (with non-trivial topology or near the\ncritical point between topological phase transitions) have been proposed that\nextends the bulk linear touching from discrete points to 1D lines. In this\nwork, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we explored the\nelectronic structure of the non-symmorphic crystals MSiS (M=Hf, Zr).\nRemarkably, by mapping out the band structure in the full 3D Brillouin Zone\n(BZ), we observed two sets of Dirac line-nodes in parallel with the kz-axis and\ntheir dispersions.

Here the chimera-like states are\ncharacterized by the synchronized oscillations in one population and\ndesynchronized oscillations in another population.

Perturbation from such spatially\nprepared initial condition leads to the existence of imperfectly synchronized\nstates. An imperfectly synchronized state represents the existence of solitary\noscillators which escape from the synchronized group in population-I and\nsynchronized oscillations in population-II. Also the existence of chimera state\nis independent of the increase of frequency mismatch between the populations.\nWe also find the coexistence of different dynamical states with respect to\ndifferent initial conditions which causes multistability in the globally\ncoupled system.

We are thus studying magnetic Ap/Bp stars in open clusters in order\nto obtain observational evidence of how the properties of Ap/Bp magnetic stars,\nsuch as field strength and structure, evolve with age during the main sequence.\nOne important aspect of this study is to search for the very rare examples of\nhot magnetic stars in short-period binary systems among magnetic cluster\nmembers. In this paper we characterize the object BD-19~5044L, which is both a\nmember of the open cluster IC 4725 = M~25, and a short-period SB2 system\ncontaining a magnetic primary star. We have obtained a series of intensity and\ncircular polarisation spectra distributed through the orbital and rotation\ncycles of BD-19 5044L with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT. We find\nthat the orbit of BD-19 5044L AB is quite eccentric (e = 0.477), with a period\nof 17.63 d. The primary is a magnetic Bp star with a variable longitudinal\nmagnetic field, a polar field strength of ~1400 G and a low obliquity, while\nthe secondary is probably a hot Am star and does not appear to be magnetic. The\nrotation period of the primary (5.04 d) is not synchronised with the orbit, but\nthe rotation angular velocity is close to being synchronised with the orbital\nangular velocity of the secondary at periastron, perhaps as a result of tidal\ninteractions. The periastron separation is small enough (about 12 times the\nradius of the primary star) that BD-19 5044L may be one of the very rare known\ncases of a tidally interacting SB2 binary system containing a magnetic Ap/Bp\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 15:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

However, receptor density in the retina is not\nuniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits\nhigh resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial\nresolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a\nvery small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception\nof a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs\nthe eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move\nbetween these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as \"saccades\".\nOnce a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a\nsecond while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An\nartificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network\nset within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions\nof interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with\nseveral experimentally observed phenomena, and suggests novel predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 09:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

Ego-networks\npresent an internal structure of increasingly large nested layers (or circles)\nof decreasing relationship intensity, whose size exhibits a precise scaling\nratio. Starting from the notion of limited social bandwidth, and assuming fixed\ncosts for the links in each layer, we propose a null model built on a\ngrand-canonical ensemble that generates the observed hierarchical social\nstructure. The observed internal structure of ego-networks becomes a natural\noutcome to expect when we assume the existence of layers demanding different\namounts of resources. In the thermodynamic limit, reached when the number of\nego-network copies is large, the specific layer degrees follow a Poisson\ndistribution. We also find that, under certain conditions, equispaced layer\ncosts are necessary to obtain a constant group size scaling. Our model presents\ninteresting analogies to a Bose-Einstein gas, that we briefly discuss. Finally,\nwe fit and compare the model with an empirical social network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 17:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 17:08:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 16:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}
