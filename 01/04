While it\nis known how one genotype can generate such non-genetic diversity, it remains\nunclear how different phenotypes contribute to the performance of biological\nfunction at the population level. We developed a microfluidic device to\nsimultaneously measure the phenotype and chemotactic performance of tens of\nthousands of individual, freely-swimming Escherichia coli as they climbed a\ngradient of attractant. We discovered that spatial structure spontaneously\nemerged from initially well-mixed wild type populations due to non-genetic\ndiversity. By manipulating the expression of key chemotaxis proteins, we\nestablished a causal relationship between protein expression, non- genetic\ndiversity, and performance that was theoretically predicted. This approach\ngenerated a complete phenotype-to-performance map, in which we found a\nnonlinear regime. We used this map to demonstrate how changing the shape of a\nphenotypic distribution can have as large of an effect on collective\nperformance as changing the mean phenotype, suggesting that selection could act\non both during the process of adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 16:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Locally enhanced spreading occurs via the formation of\nthin pointed rivulets along the side walls of the pixel through a mechanism\nsimilar to capillary rise in sharp corners. We demonstrate that a thin-film\nmodel combined with an experimentally measured spreading law, which relates the\nspeed of the contact line to the contact angle, provides excellent predictions\nof the evolving liquid morphologies.

PL models can be\nderived in the fashion of automatic or algorithmic differentiation as local\napproximations of PS functions with a second order error in the distance to a\ngiven reference point. The resulting PL functions are obtained quite naturally\nin what we call the abs-normal form, a variant of the state representation\nproposed by Bokhoven in his dissertation. Apart from the tradition of PL\nmodeling by electrical engineers, which dates back to the Master thesis of\nThomas Stern in 1956, we take into account more recent results on linear\ncomplementarity problems and semi-smooth equations originating in the\noptimization community. We analyze simultaneously the original PL problem (OPL)\nin abs-normal form and a corresponding complementary system (CPL), which is\nclosely related to the absolute value equation (AVE) studied by Mangasarian et\nal and a corresponding linear complementarity problem (LCP). We show that the\nCPL, like KKT conditions and other simply switched systems, cannot be open\nwithout being injective. Hence some of the intriguing PL structure described by\nScholtes is lost in the transformation from OPL to CPL. To both problems one\nmay apply Newton variants with appropriate generalized Jacobians directly\ncomputable from the abs-normal representation. Alternatively, the CPL can be\nsolved by Bokhoven's modulus method and related fixed point iterations.

Important contributions to methodology, theory and\napplication for the prediction of future trajectories and the estimation of\nfunctional time series parameters have been made in the recent past. This paper\ncontinues this line of research by proposing a first principled approach to\nestimate invertible functional time series by fitting functional moving average\nprocesses. The idea is to estimate the coefficient operators in a functional\nlinear filter. To do this a functional Innovations Algorithm is utilized as a\nstarting point to estimate the corresponding moving average operators via\nsuitable projections into principal directions. In order to establish\nconsistency of the proposed estimators, asymptotic theory is developed for\nincreasing subspaces of these principal directions. For practical purposes,\nseveral strategies to select the number of principal directions to include in\nthe estimation procedure as well as the choice of order of the functional\nmoving average process are discussed. Their empirical performance is evaluated\nthrough simulations and an application to vehicle traffic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 18:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in. In particular, we\ninvestigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend\non the amount of turbulence in ionised media and the initial mass-to-flux\nratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments. Analysis of the mass within\ncores and filaments show decrease in mass as the degree of turbulence\nincreases. Finally, observed filaments within the Taurus L1495/B213 complex are\nbest reproduced by models with supercritical mass-to-flux ratios and/or at\nleast mildly supersonic turbulence, however, our models show that sterile\nfibres observed within Taurus may occur in highly ionised, subcritical\nenvironments.

Several observational and theoretical considerations suggest\nthat the heating is driven by small, impulsive energy bursts which could be\nParker-style \"nanoflares\" (Parker 1988) that arise via reconnection within the\ntangled and twisted coronal magnetic field. The classical \"smoking gun\"\n(Klimchuk 2009; Cargill et al. 2013) for impulsive heating is the direct\ndetection of widespread hot plasma (T > 6 MK) with a low emission measure. In\nrecent years there has been great progress in the development of Transition\nEdge Sensor (TES) X-ray microcalorimeters that make them more ideal for\nstudying the Sun.

The crux of this problem lies in learning the complex mapping\nbetween low-resolution patches and the corresponding high-resolution patches.\nPrior arts have used either a mixture of simple regression models or a single\nnon-linear neural network for this propose. This paper proposes the method of\nlearning a mixture of SR inference modules in a unified framework to tackle\nthis problem. Specifically, a number of SR inference modules specialized in\ndifferent image local patterns are first independently applied on the LR image\nto obtain various HR estimates, and the resultant HR estimates are adaptively\naggregated to form the final HR image. By selecting neural networks as the SR\ninference module, the whole procedure can be incorporated into a unified\nnetwork and be optimized jointly. Extensive experiments are conducted to\ninvestigate the relation between restoration performance and different network\narchitectures. Compared with other current image SR approaches, our proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-arts restoration results on a wide range of images\nconsistently while allowing more flexible design choices.

Understanding how SSCs form is\nan observational challenge. Theoretical studies establish that, to form such\nclusters, the dynamical timescale of their parent clouds has to be shorter than\nthe timescale of the disruption of their parent clouds by stellar feedback.\nHowever, due to insufficient observational support, it is still unclear how\nfeedback from SSCs acts on their surrounding matter. Studying feedback in SSCs\nis essential to understand how such clusters form. Based on ALMA and VLT\nobservations, we study this process in a SSC in the overlap region of the\nAntennae galaxies. We analyze a unique massive (~10^7 Msun) and young (1-3.5\nMyr) SSC, still associated with compact molecular and ionized gas emission. The\ncluster has two CO velocity components, a low velocity one spatially associated\nwith the cluster and a high velocity one distributed in a bubble-like shape\naround the cluster. Our results on the low velocity component suggest that this\ngas did not participate in the formation of the SSC. We propose that most of\nthe parent cloud has already been blown away, accelerated at the early stages\nof the SSC evolution by radiation pressure, in a timescale ~1 Myr. The high\nvelocity component may trace outflowing molecular gas from the parent cloud.\nSupporting evidence is found in shock heated H2 gas. The low velocity component\nmay be gas that was near the SSC when it formed but not part of its parent\ncloud or clumps that migrated from the SGMC environment. This gas would be\ndispersed by stellar winds and supernova explosions. Within ~100 pc from the\ncluster, we estimate SFE>17%, smaller than the theoretical limit of 30% needed\nto form a bound cluster. Further higher spatial resolution observations are\nneeded to test and quantify our proposed scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

In this thesis, we argue that a combination of top-down and\nbottom-up modelling is advantageous in tackling these two problems.\n  To address the problem of frame-level representation learning, we present the\ncorrespondence autoencoder (cAE), a neural network trained with weak top-down\nsupervision from an unsupervised term discovery system.

In some\nsurprisingly common cases, these tasks can be automated.\n  This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering discipline\nunderlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation\nof parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old\nwheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new\nfrontiers. However, what you get from this book will be determined by what you\nput into it. It is hoped that simply reading this book will be helpful, and\nthat working the Quick Quizzes will be even more helpful. However, the best\nresults come from applying the techniques taught in this book to real-life\nproblems. As always, practice makes perfect.\n  But no matter how you approach it, we sincerely hope that parallel\nprogramming brings you at least as much fun, excitement, and challenge that it\nhas brought to us!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 22:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 16:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 16:09:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 20:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 03:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

We\napproximate such events as subset of the restricted three-body problem by\nconsidering only perturbations of non-interacting low-mass objects initially on\ncircular Keplerian orbits. In this paper we present a new parametrisation of\nthe initial conditions of this problem. Under certain conditions the initial\npositions of the low-mass objects can be specified largely independent of the\ninitial position of the perturber. Exploiting additionally the known scalings\nof the problem reduces the parameter space of initial conditions for one\nspecific perturbation to two dimensions. To this two-dimensional initial\ncondition space we have related the final properties of the perturbed\ntrajectories of the low-mass objects from our numerical simulations. That way,\nmaps showing the effect of the perturbation on the low-mass objects have been\ncreated, which provide a new view on the perturbation process. Comparing the\nmaps for different mass-ratios reveals that the perturbations by low- and\nhigh-mass perturbers are dominated by different physical processes. The\nequal-mass case is a complicated mixture of the other two cases. Since the\nfinal properties of trajectories with similar initial conditions are usually\nalso similar, the results of the limited number of integrated trajectories can\nbe generalised to the full presented parameter space by interpolation. Since\nour results are also unique within the accuracy strived for, they constitute\ngeneral numerical solutions for this subset of the restricted three-body\nproblem.

In contrast to previous studies where a BS always has packets\nto transmit, we assume in this paper that incoming packets intended for all the\nassociated users form a queue in the BS. In order to find the delay limit of\nthe network to support real-time service, we focus on the delay optimization\nproblem by properly tuning the biasing factor of each tier. By adopting a\nthinned Poisson point process (PPP) model to characterize the locations of BSs\nin the busy state, an explicit expression of the average traffic intensity of\neach tier is obtained. On that basis, an optimization problem is formulated to\nminimize a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay. By showing that the\noptimization problem is convex, the optimal biasing factor of each tier can be\nobtained numerically. When the mean packet arrival rate of each user is small,\na closed-form solution is derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the\nnetwork queuing performance can be significantly improved by properly tuning\nthe biasing factor. It is further shown that the network mean queuing delay\nmight be improved at the cost of a deterioration of the network\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage, which indicates a performance\ntradeoff between real-time and non-real-time traffic in HetNets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 05:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

The spectra are high-resolution (R~60000), high\nsignal-to-noise (SNR~150/pixel), and registered onto a common wavelength scale.\nThe library stars have properties derived from interferometry,\nasteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a\nlack of well-characterized late K-dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar\nradii and temperatures for 23 nearby K-dwarfs, using SED modeling and Gaia\nparallaxes. This library represents a uniform dataset spanning the spectral\ntypes ~M5--F1 (Teff ~ 3000-7000K, Rstar ~ 0.1-1.6 Rsun). We also present\n\"Empirical SpecMatch\" (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown\nspectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars,\nSpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 15%\nin stellar radius (Rstar), and 0.09 dex in metallicity [Fe/H]. Because the code\nrelies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ~K4 and\nlater which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers,\nreaching accuracies of 70 K in Teff, 10% in Rstar, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We\nalso validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at\nlower spectral resolution and SNR, enabling the characterization of faint\nlate-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 07:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

A more interesting question to ask is what is the\nminimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$?

A soft experimental\ntechnique is developed that is capable of extracting EELS spectra with one\natomic plane resolution recorded in a single frame. This yields information at\ndifferent depth of the nanoparticle from the surface to the core regions with\nhigh signal to noise ratio and without beam damage. This enables comparing the\nfine structures between the surface and core regions of the nanoparticles. The\nresults confirm earlier observations of uniformly oriented spin canting\nstructure for CFO with additional information on atom site-selective spin\ncanting information. In case of Fe3O4 preferred canting orientation forming\ncore and shell structure is deduced.

First, the minima of the objective function used in learning\ncorrespond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images)\nthat lack semantic similarity with the training data. Second, a clean input can\nbe changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation,\nso that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network. These\nfindings emphasize the differences between the ways DNN and humans classify\npatterns, and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more\naccurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.\n  Our paper examines these questions within the framework of Dense Associative\nMemory (DAM) models. These models are defined by the energy function, with\nhigher order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons. We show\nthat in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy\nfunction is sufficiently large, these models have the following three\nproperties. First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish\nimages, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern. Second,\nartificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to\nhuman subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that\ndecision boundary. Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small\npower of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified\nlinear units (ReLU), fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher order\ninteractions. This opens up a possibility to use higher order models for\ndetecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks. The presented results\nsuggest that DAM with higher order energy functions are closer to human visual\nperception than DNN with ReLUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 09:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

We particularly focus on the optical and near-infrared\nevolution during the period from 50 days up to 400 days from peak, showing that\nthey are all fairly similar in their light curve and spectral evolution.\nLSQ14an shows broad, blue-shifted [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$4959, 5007 lines, as\nwell as a blue-shifted [O II] $\\lambda\\lambda$7320, 7330 and [Ca II]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$7291, 7323. Furthermore, the sample of these four objects shows\ncommon features. Semi-forbidden and forbidden emission lines appear\nsurprisingly early at 50-70 days and remain visible with almost no variation up\nto 400 days. The spectra remain blue out to 400 days. There are small, but\ndiscernible light curve fluctuations in all of them. The light curve of each\nshows a faster decline than $^{56}$Co after 150 days and it further steepens\nafter 300 days. We also expand our analysis presenting X-ray limits for LSQ14an\nand SN2015bn and discuss their diagnostic power in interpreting their common\nfeatures. These features are quite distinct from the faster evolving\nsuperluminous supernovae and are not easily explained in terms of only a\nvariation in ejecta mass. While a central engine is still the most likely\nluminosity source, it appears that the ejecta structure is complex, with\nmultiple emitting zones and at least some interaction between the expanding\nejecta and surrounding material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 09:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

However, this structural decomposition of the word does not\ndirectly give us a semantic representation of the word's meaning. Since\nmorphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word\ncan be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we\npropose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the\nanalysis of a word w into its constituents segments and the synthesis of the\nmeaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to\nsegment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of\nthose morphemes.

In V2G systems,\nsince the PEV users need to obtain system information (e.g., locations of\ncharging/discharging stations, current load and supply of the power grid) to\nachieve the best charging and discharging performance, data communication plays\na crucial role. However, since the PEV users are highly mobile, information\nfrom V2G systems is not always available for many reasons, e.g., wireless link\nfailures and cyber attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel\nconcept using cyber insurance to \"transfer\" cyber risks, e.g., unavailable\ninformation, of a PEV user to a third party, e.g., a cyber insurance company.\nUnder the insurance coverage, even without information about V2G systems, a PEV\nuser is always guaranteed the best price for charging/discharging. In\nparticular, we formulate the optimal energy cost problem for the PEV user by\nadopting a Markov decision process framework. We then propose a learning\nalgorithm to help the PEV user make optimal decisions, e.g., to charge or\ndischarge and to buy or not to buy insurance, in an online fashion. Through\nsimulations, we show that cyber insurance is an efficient solution not only in\ndealing with cyber risks, but also in maximizing revenue of the PEV user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 10:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

This result implies that the enhanced X-ray surface flux due\nto the increase in the rotation rate may be compensated by the decrease in the\nstellar surface area during the pre-main sequence evolution.

We compare the cases where the receiving user\nequipment (UE) operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and full-duplex (FD) mode. In\nthe latter case, the UE simultaneously receives the intended downlink message\nand transmits a jamming signal to strengthen secrecy. We investigate two models\nof (semi)passive eavesdropping: (1) EDs act independently and (2) EDs collude\nto intercept the transmitted message. For both of these models, we obtain\nexpressions for the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for HD and FD UE\noperation. The expressions for HD systems have very accurate approximate or\nexact forms in terms of elementary and/or special functions for all path loss\nexponents.

A closed-form approximation is also derived for the FD case with\ncolluding EDs. The resulting analysis shows that the reduction in the secrecy\noutage probability is logarithmic in the number of antennas used for TAS and\nidentifies conditions under which HD operation should be used instead of FD\njamming at the UE.

The better part of our findings\nseems to convey a rather conservative, old-fashioned version of world\nliterature, but a version derived from reproducible facts revealing an implicit\nliterary canon based on the editing and reading behavior of millions of people.\nWhile still having to solve some known issues, the introduced methods will help\nus build an observatory of world literature to further investigate its\nrepresentativeness and biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 13:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

For this purpose, we have examined the phase separation\npattern of a binary mixture (AB) in presence of stationary spherical particles\n(C) which prefers one of the components of the binary (say, A). Binary AB is\ncomposed of critical composition(50:50) and off-critical compositions(60:40,\n40:60). Particle sizes of 8 units and 16 units are used in the simulations. Two\ntypes of particle loading are used, 5\\% and 10\\%.

If the particles are preferentially wetted by one of the\ncomponents then early stage microstructures show transient concentric alternate\nlayers of preferred and non-preferred phases around the particles. When\nparticles are neutral to binary components then such a ring pattern does not\nform. At late times, neutral preference between particles and binary components\nyields a continuous morphology whereas preferential wetting produces isolated\ndomains of non-preferred phases dispersed in a continuous matrix of preferred\nphase. For off-critical compositions, if minor component wets the particle then\na bicontinuous morphology results whereas if major component wets the network a\ndroplet morphology is seen.

In such alloys phase\nseparation starts near the particle surface and propagates to the bulk at\nintermediate to late times forming spherical or nearly spherical droplets of\nthe minor component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 17:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Considering the type of cloud core where a globular cluster might\nhave formed, we follow the evolution and enrichment of the gas and the time\ndependence of stellar mass. A key assumption is that interactions between\nmassive stars are important at high density, including interactions between\nmassive stars and massive star binaries that can shred stellar envelopes.\nMassive-star interactions should also scatter low-mass stars out of the\ncluster. Reasonable agreement with the observations is obtained for a cloud\ncore mass of ~4x10^6 M_sun and a density of ~2x10^6 cm^{-3}. The results depend\nprimarily on a few dimensionless parameters, including, most importantly, the\nratio of the gas consumption time to the lifetime of a massive star, which has\nto be low, ~10%, and the efficiency of scattering low-mass stars per unit\ndynamical time, which has to be relatively large, such as a few percent. Also\nfor these conditions, the velocity dispersions of embedded globular clusters\nshould be comparable to the high gas dispersions of galaxies at that time, so\nthat stellar ejection by multi-star interactions could cause low-mass stars to\nleave a dwarf galaxy host altogether.

Connecting subsystems modeled using\nfinite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such\nnetwork, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n\n> 1 with a single finite automaton located at each point of the array. One of\nthe oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing\nsynchronization problem, originally proposed by John Myhill in 1957. As with\nany long-standing problem, there are a large number of solutions to the firing\nsynchronization problem. Our goal, and the contribution of this work, is to\nsummarize recent solutions to the problem. We focus primarily on solutions to\nthe original problem, that is, the problem where the network is a\none-dimensional array and there is a single initiator located at one of the\nends. We summarize both minimal-time and non-minimal-time solutions, with an\nemphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on\nsolutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata.\nIn the process we also identify open problems that remain in terms of finding\nminimal-state solutions to the firing synchronization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 15:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

Player\nretention may refer to various duration variables quantifying product use:\ntotal playtime or session playtime are popular research targets, and active\nplaytime is well-suited for subscription games. Such research often has the\ngoal of increasing player retention or conversely decreasing player churn.\nSurvival analysis is a framework of powerful tools well suited for retention\ntype data. This paper contributes new methods to game analytics on how playtime\ncan be analyzed using survival analysis without covariates. Survival and hazard\nestimates provide both a visual and an analytic interpretation of the playtime\nphenomena as a funnel type nonparametric estimate. Metrics based on the\nsurvival curve can be used to aggregate this playtime information into a single\nstatistic. Comparison of survival curves between cohorts provides a scientific\nAB-test. All these methods work on censored data and enable computation of\nconfidence intervals. This is especially important in time and sample limited\ndata which occurs during game development. Throughout this paper, we illustrate\nthe application of these methods to real world game development problems on the\nHipster Sheep mobile game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 10:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

This model describes\nindividual particles in terms of paths of a moving quantum. It is shown that\nthis description allows one to reproduce observable properties as path-averages\nover a period of the fast extended Zitterbewegung in elementary calculations.\nThe general topology of the paths may be described as a helical path, with a\nhelix axis forming a circle around a fixed point in space. The radius of the\nhelix and of the circle are equal and given by half the reduced Compton wave\nlength of a photon of energy equal to the rest energy of the particle\ndescribed. The paths depend on the relative velocity between the described\nentity and the observer, and represent the De Broglie wave. The merits of the\nproposed model are summarized and its role in relation to the established\ndescription by quantum mechanics discussed. It is concluded that it supports\nthe existence of the proposed extended Zitterbewegung, and offers a description\nof quantum behaviour without quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 12:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}
