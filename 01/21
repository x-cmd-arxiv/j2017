Here we study the climatic drivers of\nPicea crassifolia Kom., an endemic to northwest China where climate has\nsignificantly warmed. Picea crassifolia was sampled from its lower\ndistributional margin to its upper distributional margin on the Helan Mountains\nto test the hypothesis that 1) growth at the upper limit is limited by cool\ntemperatures and 2) is limited by drought at its lower limit. We found that\ntrees at the lower distributional margin have experienced a higher rate of\nstem-growth cessation events since 2001 compared to trees at other elevations.\nWhile all populations have a similar climatic sensitivity, stem-growth\ncessation events in trees at lower distributional margin appear to be driven by\nlow precipitation in June as the monsoon begins to deliver moisture to the\nregion. Evidence indicates that mid-summer (July) vapor pressure deficit (VPD)\nexacerbates the frequency of these events. These data and our analysis makes it\nevident that an increase in severity and frequency of drought early in the\nmonsoon season could increase the frequency and severity of stem-growth\ncessation in Picea crassifolia trees at lower elevations. Increases in VPD and\nwarming would likely exacerbate the growth stress of this species on Helan\nMountain. Hypothetically, if the combinations of low moisture and increased VPD\nstress becomes more common, the mortality rate of lower distributional margin\ntrees could increase, especially of those that are already experiencing events\nof temporary growth cessation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 16:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 08:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

Within such a framework the importance of the\ndeuteron D-state in low-energy reactions is normally associated with spin\nobservables and tensor polarization effects - with very minimal influence on\ndifferential cross sections. In contrast, recent work that includes the\ninherent nonlocality of the nucleon optical model potentials in the\nJohnson-Tandy adiabatic-model description of the (d,p) transition amplitude,\nwhich accounts for deuteron break-up effects, shows sensitivity of the reaction\nto the large n-p relative momentum content of the deuteron wave function.

Under perturbation, homoclinics are\nassociated with bifurcations of periodic orbits, and with chaos in higher\ndimensions. Homoclinic connections in nonsmooth systems are complicated by\ntheir interaction with discontinuities in their vector fields. A connection may\ninvolve a regular saddle outside a discontinuity set, or a pseudo-saddle on a\ndiscontinuity set, with segments of the connection allowed to cross or slide\nalong the discontinuity. Even the simplest case, that of connection to a\nregular saddle that hits a discontinuity as a parameter is varied, is\nsurprisingly complex. Bifurcation diagrams are presented here for non-resonant\nsaddles in the plane, including an example in a forced pendulum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 17:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by\nleveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller\nsynthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions\nof separability for control objective functions and system constraints such\nthat the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a\ndistributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel\nsubproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity)\nconstraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local\nmodels and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the\nconvexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a\nconsequence, the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to\nthe size of the global system.

The likely progenitors of today's most massive galaxies are remarkably\nsmall, disky, passive and have already assembled much of their stellar mass at\nredshift z=2. An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not\nfeasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and\nspectroscopic data. In this paper, we present a sample of nearby compact\nelliptical galaxies (CEGs), which bear resemblance to the massive and quiescent\ngalaxy population at earlier times. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field\nintegral field unit (IFU) data have been obtained, and are used to constrain\norbit-based dynamical models and stellar population synthesis (SPS) fits, to\nunravel their structural and dynamical properties. We first show that our\ngalaxies are outliers in the present-day stellar mass-size relation. They are,\nhowever, consistent with the mass-size relation of compact, massive and\nquiescent galaxies at redshift z=2. The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies\nimply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement\nwith the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong\ndissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a\nlargely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital\ndistribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to\nreconcile with a very active (major) merging history. This all supports that we\ncan use nearby CEGs as local analogues of the high-redshift, massive and\nquiescent galaxy population, thus providing additional constraints for models\nof galaxy formation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Recognizing such gestures involves\none shot gesture learning. While most research has focused on the recognition\nof the gestures itself, recently new approaches were proposed to deal with\ngesture perception and production as part of the same problem. The framework\npresented in this work focuses on learning the process that leads to gesture\ngeneration, rather than mining the gesture's associated features. This is\nachieved using kinematic, cognitive and biomechanic characteristics of human\ninteraction. These factors enable the artificial production of realistic\ngesture samples originated from a single observation. The generated samples are\nthen used as training sets for different state-of-the-art classifiers.\nPerformance is obtained first, by observing the machines' gesture recognition\npercentages.

Nevertheless, rather than the\nwhole front, which demands for too many points (especially in a\nhigh-dimensional space), the decision maker might only interest in a partial\nregion, called the region of interest. In this case, solutions outside this\nregion can be noisy to the decision making procedure. Even worse, there is no\nguarantee that we can find the preferred solutions when tackling problems with\ncomplicated properties or a large number of objectives. In this paper, we\ndevelop a systematic way to incorporate the decision maker's preference\ninformation into the decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective\noptimization methods. Generally speaking, our basic idea is a non-uniform\nmapping scheme by which the originally uniformly distributed reference points\non a canonical simplex can be mapped to the new positions close to the\naspiration level vector specified by the decision maker. By these means, we are\nable to steer the search process towards the region of interest either directly\nor in an interactive manner and also handle a large number of objectives. In\nthe meanwhile, the boundary solutions can be approximated given the decision\nmaker's requirements. Furthermore, the extent of the region of the interest is\nintuitively understandable and controllable in a closed form. Extensive\nexperiments, both proof-of-principle and on a variety of problems with 3 to 10\nobjectives, fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for\napproximating the preferred solutions in the region of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 22:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

Numerical examples illustrate the validity of our meshing strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 22:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 12:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In addition, such degraded images drastically\naffect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the\nproblem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult\nproblem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches\nattempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem.\nIn this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single\nimage de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good\nprior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative\nperformance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade\nthe performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and\nclassification. In other words, the de-rained result should be\nindistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator.\nThis criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by\nusing the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks\n(GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual\nquality, a new refined loss function is introduced.

A key question therefore is how\none could eradicate as many cells as possible for a given acceptable risk of\ndrug resistance evolution. We address this general question in a model of drug\nresistance evolution in spatial drug gradients, which recent experiments and\ntheories have suggested as key drivers of drug resistance. Importantly, our\nmodel takes into account the influence of convection, resulting for instance\nfrom blood flow. Using stochastic simulations, we study the fates of individual\nresistance mutations and quantify the trade-off between the killing of\nwild-type cells and the rise of resistance mutations: shallow gradients and\nconvection into the antibiotic region promote wild-type death, at the cost of\nincreasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations. We can\nexplain these observed trends by modeling the adaptation process as a branching\nrandom walk. Our analysis reveals that the trade-off between death and\nadaptation depends on the relative length scales of the spatial drug gradient\nand random dispersal, and the strength of convection.

However, most of this work has\nconcentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport\ncomparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one\nsport to another. In this manuscript, we develop Bayesian state-space models\nusing betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sporting\norganizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes.\nThese models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the\nbetween-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths,\nas well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade\nof play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League\n(NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB),\nfinding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the\nlargest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative\nrandomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judging\ncompetitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and using\ntraditional postseason tournament formats.

The\nknowledge of the amount of symbol misalignment, hence its estimation, is\nimportant to PNC decoding. This paper addresses the problem of\nsymbol-misalignment estimation and the problem of optimal PNC decoding given\nthe misalignment estimate, assuming the APNC system uses the root-raised-cosine\npulse to carry signals (RRC-APNC). First, we put forth an optimal\nsymbol-misalignment estimator that makes use of double baud-rate samples. Then,\nwe devise optimal decoders for RRC-APNC in the presence of inaccurate\nsymbol-misalignment estimates. In particular, we present a new whitening\ntransformation to whiten the noise of the double baud-rate samples. Finally, we\ninvestigate the decoding performance of various estimation-and-decoding schemes\nfor RRC-APNC. Extensive simulations show that: (i) Our double baud-rate\nestimator yields substantially more accurate symbol-misalignment estimates than\nthe baud-rate estimator does. The mean-square-error (MSE) gains are up to 8 dB.\n(ii) An overall estimation-and-decoding scheme in which both estimation and\ndecoding are based on double baud-rate samples yields much better performance\nthan other schemes.

For data\nobserved over large portions of planet Earth it is necessary to take into\naccount the curvature of the planet. Hence the need for random field models\ndefined over spheres across time. In particular, the associated covariance\nfunction should depend on the geodesic distance, which is the most natural\nmetric over the spherical surface. In this work, we propose a flexible\nparametric family of matrix-valued covariance functions, with both marginal and\ncross structure being of the Gneiting type. We additionally introduce a\ndifferent multivariate Gneiting model based on the adaptation of the latent\ndimension approach to the spherical context. Finally, we assess the performance\nof our models through the study of a bivariate space-time data set of surface\nair temperatures and precipitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 11:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 23:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

Determining which time scales play key roles in the SE\nviolation remains elusive without the measurement of $\\eta$. Here we provide\ncomprehensive simulation results of the dynamic properties involving $\\eta$ and\n$D$ in TIP4P/2005 supercooled water. This enabled the thorough identification\nof the appropriate time scales for SE relation $D\\eta/T$. In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that the temperature dependence of various time scales associated\nwith structural relaxation, hydrogen bond breakage, stress relaxation, and\ndynamic heterogeneities can be definitely classified into only two classes.\nThat is, we propose the generalized SE relations that exhibit \"violation\" or\n\"preservation\". The classification depends on the examined time scales that are\ncoupled or decoupled with the diffusion. On the basis of the classification, we\nexplain the physical origins of the violation in terms of the increase in the\nplateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of stress relaxation. This implies\nthat the mechanism of SE violation is attributed to the attained solidity upon\nsupercooling, which is in accord with the growth of non-Gaussianity and\nspatially heterogeneous dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 13:50:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 08:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 02:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 07:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

In\nthis paper, we derive and test structure-preserving numerical schemes for these\ntwo systems. The derivations are based on a discrete version of the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e variational method. This approach relies on a finite\ndimensional approximation of the (Lie) group of diffeomorphisms that preserve\nweighted-volume forms. These weights describe the background stratification of\nthe fluid and correspond to the weighed velocity fields for anelastic and\npseudo-incompressible approximations. In particular, we identify to these\ndiscrete Lie group configurations the associated Lie algebras such that\nelements of the latter correspond to weighted velocity fields that satisfy the\ndivergence-free conditions for both systems. Defining discrete Lagrangians in\nterms of these Lie algebras, the discrete equations follow by means of\nvariational principles. Descending from variational principles, the schemes\nexhibit further a discrete version of Kelvin circulation theorem, are\napplicable to irregular meshes, and show excellent long term energy behavior.\nWe illustrate the properties of the schemes by performing preliminary test\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 16:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 17:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this paper, a comparative study of\nstability between native CMs and CMs cross-linked with genipin (CMs-GP) as a\nfunction of pH is described. Stability to temperature and ethanol were\ninvestigated in the pH range 2.0-7.0. The size and the charge\n($\\zeta$-potential) of the particles were determined by dynamic light\nscattering. Native CMs precipitated below pH 5.5, CMs-GP precipitated from pH\n3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0.\nThe isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability\nagainst heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible\ncoagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of\nethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP\nincreased the stability of CMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 18:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}
