We also analysed the effect of\nbiasedness parameter on the magnitudes of QM violations of different necessary\nconditions of MR for multilevel spin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 16:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 10:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 22:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

In recent years, there has been much development for binary\nclassification with a reject option. Yet, little progress has been made for the\nmulticategory case. In this article, we propose margin-based multicategory\nclassification methods with a reject option. In addition, and more importantly,\nwe introduce a new and unique refine option for the multicategory problem,\nwhere the class of an observation is predicted to be from a set of class\nlabels, whose cardinality is not necessarily one. The main advantage of both\noptions lies in their capacity of identifying error-prone observations.\nMoreover, the refine option can provide more constructive information for\nclassification by effectively ruling out implausible classes.

Although their properties can be well\nrepresented transport model equations, design and analysis approaches have, to\na good extent, been limited to using current-equispaced horizontal and parallel\nisolines of the characteristic surface. Here, we resort to the geometrical\nstructure imposed on BJTs behavior by the Early effect and voltage as a means\nto derive a simple, intuitive and more complete respective model that, though\nexcluding cut-off and saturation regimes, can simplify the design and\ncharacterization of BJTs and respective circuits, including integrated devices.\nThe approach involves using a beam of isolines converging at the Early voltage\nas the model of a BJT.

We show that complete representations ensure that any\ncomputable function has a time bound. Regular representations generalize\nKawamura and Cook's more restrictive notion of a second-order representation,\nwhile still guaranteeing fast computability of the length of the encodings.\nApplying these notions, we investigate the relationship between purely metric\nproperties of a metric space and the existence of a representation such that\nthe metric is computable within bounded time. We show that a bound on the\nrunning time of the metric can be straightforwardly translated into size bounds\nof compact subsets of the metric space. Conversely, for compact spaces and for\nBanach spaces we construct a family of admissible, complete, regular\nrepresentations that allow for fast computation of the metric and provide short\nencodings.

In this\npaper we introduce a homological theory of functions that can be used to\nestablish complexity separations, while also providing other interesting\nconsequences. We propose to associate a topological space $S_A$ to each class\nof functions $A$, such that, to separate complexity classes $A \\subseteq B'$,\nit suffices to observe a change in \"the number of holes\", i.e. homology, in\n$S_A$ as a subclass $B$ of $B'$ is added to $A$. In other words, if the\nhomologies of $S_A$ and $S_{A \\cup B}$ are different, then $A \\not= B'$. We\ndevelop the underlying theory of functions based on combinatorial and\nhomological commutative algebra and Stanley-Reisner theory, and recover Minsky\nand Papert's 1969 result that parity cannot be computed by nonmaximal degree\npolynomial threshold functions. In the process, we derive a \"maximal principle\"\nfor polynomial threshold functions that is used to extend this result further\nto arbitrary symmetric functions. A surprising coincidence is demonstrated,\nwhere the maximal dimension of \"holes\" in $S_A$ upper bounds the VC dimension\nof $A$, with equality for common computational cases such as the class of\npolynomial threshold functions or the class of linear functionals in $\\mathbb\nF_2$, or common algebraic cases such as when the Stanley-Reisner ring of $S_A$\nis Cohen-Macaulay. As another interesting application of our theory, we prove a\nresult that a priori has nothing to do with complexity separation: it\ncharacterizes when a vector subspace intersects the positive cone, in terms of\nhomological conditions. By analogy to Farkas' result doing the same with\n*linear conditions*, we call our theorem the Homological Farkas Lemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 18:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 19:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 07:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-10"}

In the absence of sufficiently deep data\nto constrain the low-mass turnover, it is common practice to fit a\nsingle-sloped power law to the low-mass IMF, or to fit $m_c$ for a lognormal\nwhile holding $\\sigma$ fixed. We show that the former approximation leads to\nbest-fit power law slopes that vary with the mass range observed and can\nlargely explain existing claims of low-mass IMF variations in MW satellites,\neven if satellite galaxies have the same IMF as the MW. In addition, fixing\n$\\sigma$ during fitting leads to substantially underestimated uncertainties in\nthe recovered value of $m_c$ (by a factor of $\\sim 4$ for typical\nobservations). If the IMFs of nearby dwarf galaxies are lognormal and do vary,\nobservations must reach down to $\\sim m_c$ in order to robustly detect these\nvariations.

The outer and inner regions are taken\nto be the Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime and the vacuum ground\nstate anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, respectively. By applying the first law\nof thermodynamics to the extremal shell one shows that its entropy is an\narbitrary function of the gravitational area $A_+$ alone, $S=S(A_+)$. When the\nshell approaches its own gravitational radius $r_+$ and turns into an extremal\nrotating BTZ black hole, it is found that the entropy of the spacetime remains\nsuch a function of $A_+$. It is thus vindicated, that extremal black holes,\nhere extremal BTZ black holes, have different properties from the corresponding\nnonextremal black holes, which have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S(A_+)=\n\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. It is argued that for\nthe extremal case $0\\leq S(A_+)\\leq \\frac{A_+}{4G}$. Thus, rather than having\njust two entropies for extremal black holes, as previous results debated, 0 and\n$\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, it is shown that extremal black holes may have a continuous\nrange of entropies, limited by precisely those two entropies. Surely, the\nentropy that a particular extremal black hole picks must depend on past\nprocesses, notably on how it was formed. It is also found a remarkable relation\nbetween the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility for a massive\nbody to reach the velocity of light. In the procedure, it becomes clear that\nthere are two distinct angular velocities for the shell, the mechanical and\nthermodynamic angular velocities.

We therefore predict that WR X-ray binaries can only harbor black\nholes. The reason why black-hole HMXBs with these orbital periods may survive\nspiral in is: the combination of a radiative envelope of the donor star, and a\nhigh mass of the compact star. In this case, when the donor begins to overflow\nits Roche lobe, the systems are able to spiral in slowly with stable Roche-lobe\noverflow, as is shown by the system SS433.

When the cascades with\ndifferent opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the\nmost likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is\ndetected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade\ncompeting against the rumor. Given a budget $k$, the rumor blocking problem\nasks for $k$ seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that\nthe number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The\nprior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated\nwithin a factor of $(1-1/e-\\delta)$ by a classic greedy algorithm combined with\nMonte Carlo simulation with the running time of $O(\\frac{k^3mn\\ln\nn}{\\delta^2})$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of users and edges,\nrespectively.

Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were\npreviously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of\nnewly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation\nperiods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario\nwhereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar\nremnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements\non the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta\n(accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula),\nenergetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the\nquiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century.\nThe quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the\nshock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the\nsurrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar\nwind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow\nfrom an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be\ntoo young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time\nderivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent\nradio source.

Stability however is restrictive when\ndealing with formalisms with \"fusion\", i.e., where a computational step can not\nonly consume and produce but also merge parts of the state. This happens, e.g.,\nfor graph rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are needed to cover\nsome relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name\npassing). Guided by the need of capturing the semantics of formalisms with\nfusion we leave aside stability and we characterise, as a natural\ngeneralisation of prime algebraic domains, a class of domains, referred to as\nweak prime domains.

Counter-streamings are detected near one endpoint of the filament,\nwith the plane-of-the-sky speed being 7--9 km s$^{-1}$ in the H$\\alpha$\nred-wing filtergrams and 9--25 km s$^{-1}$ in the blue-wing filtergrams. The\nobservations are indicative of that this active region filament is supported by\na sheared arcade without magnetic dips, and the counter-streamings are due to\nunidirectional flows with alternative directions, rather than due to the\nlongitudinal oscillations of filament threads as in many other filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 02:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Current solutions to distributed transaction\ncan spend more than half of the whole transaction processing time in\ndistributed commit. An efficient atomic commit protocol is highly desirable.\nThis paper presents the HACommit protocol, a logless one-phase commit protocol\nfor highly-available systems.

The change enables the removal of both\nthe participant logging and the coordinator logging steps in the distributed\ncommit process; it also makes possible that, after the client initiates the\ntransaction commit, the transaction data is visible to other transactions\nwithin one communication roundtrip time (i.e., one phase). In the evaluation\nwith extensive experiments, HACommit outperforms recent atomic commit solutions\nfor highly-available datastores under different workloads.

We investigate the\nconfinement/deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature in both\noptions, which are compared with the original Yang-Mills theory. For this\npurpose, we measure the distribution of Polyakov-loops and the Polyakov-loop\naverage, the correlation function of the Polyakov loops and the distribution of\nthe chromoelectric flux connecting a quark and antiquark in both confinement\nand deconfinement phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 05:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 03:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

Such systems utilize batteries to smoothen out the random\nfluctuations in harvested energy. These fluctuations induce highly variable\nbattery charge and discharge rates, which affect the efficiencies of practical\nbatteries that typically have non-zero internal resistances. In this paper, we\nstudy an energy harvesting communication system using a finite battery with\nnon-zero internal resistance. We adopt a dual-path architecture, in which\nharvested energy can be directly used, or stored and then used. In a frame,\nboth time and power can be split between energy storage and data transmission.\nFor a single frame, we derive an analytical expression for the rate optimal\ntime and power splitting ratios between harvesting energy and transmitting\ndata. We then optimize the time and power splitting ratios for a group of\nframes, assuming non-causal knowledge of harvested power and fading channel\ngains, by giving an approximate solution. When only the statistics of the\nenergy arrivals and channel gains are known, we derive a dynamic programming\nbased policy and, propose three sub-optimal policies, which are shown to\nperform competitively. In summary, our study suggests that battery internal\nresistance significantly impacts the design and performance of energy\nharvesting communication systems and must be taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 06:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

The\ninformation-theoretical dynamics we articulate considers a process of meaning\ngeneration within cultural evolution: information is imbued with meaning, and\nthrough this process, the number of options for the selection of meaning in\ndiscourse proliferates. The redundancy of possible meanings contributes to a\ncodification of expectations within the discourse. Unlike hard-wired DNA, the\ncodes of non-biological systems can co-evolve with the variations. Spanning\nhorizons of meaning, the codes structure the communications as selection\nenvironments that shape discourses. Discursive knowledge can be considered as\nmeta-coded communication which enables us to translate among differently coded\ncommunications. The dynamics of discursive knowledge production can thus infuse\nthe historical dynamics with a cultural evolution by adding options, that is,\nby increasing redundancy.

Second, it establishes a uniqueness result for binary\nrate-optimal codes, showing that for certain classes of binary linear codes\nwith $(r,2)$ and $(2,3)$-availability, any rate optimal code must be a direct\nsum of shorter rate optimal codes. Third, it presents novel upper bounds on the\nrates of binary linear codes with $(2,t)$ and $(r,3)$-availability. In\nparticular, the main contribution here is a new method for bounding the number\nof cosets of the dual of a code with availability, using its covering\nproperties. Finally, it presents a class of locally repairable linear codes\nassociated with convex polyhedra, focusing on the codes associated with the\nPlatonic solids. It demonstrates that these codes are locally repairable with\n$t = 2$, and that the codes associated with (geometric) dual polyhedra are\n(coding theoretic) duals of each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 07:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

We investigate two models of the Milky Way based on\nstellar population synthesis, Galaxia and TRILEGAL.

In this paper we suggest a new mixed-integer linear\nprogramming model for solving the cell formation problem with a variable number\nof manufacturing cells. The popular grouping efficacy measure is used as an\nobjective function. To deal with its fractional nature we apply the Dinkelbach\napproach. Our computational experiments are performed on two testsets: the\nfirst consists of 35 well-known instances from the literature and the second\ncontains 32 instances less popular. We solve these instances using CPLEX\nsoftware. Optimal solutions have been found for 63 of the 67 considered problem\ninstances and several new solutions unknown before have been obtained. The\ncomputational times are greatly decreased comparing to the state-of-art\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 08:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 19:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

To place an ad automatically and optimally,\nit is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid\nan ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as\na static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression\nindependently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the\nbidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span\nbefore the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by\nthe constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the\nrewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has\ncompleted. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy\nsequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across\nall the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future\nrewards.

We obtain the axial and polar\nperturbation equations in a cosmological de Sitter universe in the usual\ncomoving coordinates, the coordinates we occupy in our galaxy. We write down\nthe relevant equations in terms of Laplace transform with respect to the\ncomoving time $t$ instead of the usual Fourier one that is no longer available\nin a cosmological context. Both axial and polar perturbation equations are\nexpressed in terms of a non trivial mixture of retarded-advanced metric\ncoefficients with respect to the Laplace parameter $s$ (complex translation).\nThe axial case is studied in more detail. In particular, the axial\nperturbations can be reduced to a master linear second-order differential\nequation in terms of the Regge-Wheeler function $Z$ where a coupling with a\nretarded $Z$ with respect to the cosmological time $t$ is present. It is shown\nthat a de Sitter expanding universe can change the frequency $\\omega$ of a\ngravitational wave as perceived by a comoving observer. The polar equations are\nmuch more involved. Nevertheless, we show that also the polar perturbations can\nbe expressed in terms of four independent integrable differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 09:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 07:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

These might be graphs and\nmatroids, but can be much more general or quite different. The theorem asserts\na duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a\nglobal overall tree structure.\n  We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles:\nas orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms.\nThese axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure,\nsuch as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations\nthemselves. This makes it possible to identify tangles, and apply our\ntangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings.\n  Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in\ngraph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width.\nIt yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width.

Existing\nheterogeneous domain adaptation research is relatively well-progressed, but\nonly in situations where the target domain contains at least a few labeled\ninstances. In contrast, heterogeneous domain adaptation with an unlabeled\ntarget domain has not been well-studied. To contribute to the research in this\nemerging field, this paper presents: (1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer\ntheorem that guarantees the correctness of transferring knowledge; and (2) a\nprincipal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of\ndomains: one pair comprises the original source and target domains and the\nother pair comprises two homogeneous representations of two domains. The\ntheorem and the metric have been implemented in an innovative transfer model,\ncalled a Grassmann-Linear monotonic maps-geodesic flow kernel (GLG), that is\nspecifically designed for heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HeUDA).\nThe linear monotonic maps meet the conditions of the theorem and are used to\nconstruct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains. The metric\nshows the extent to which the homogeneous representations have preserved the\ninformation in the original source and target domains. By minimizing the\nproposed metric, the GLG model learns the homogeneous representations of\nheterogeneous domains and transfers knowledge through these learned\nrepresentations via a geodesic flow kernel. To evaluate the model, five public\ndatasets were reorganized into ten HeUDA tasks across three applications:\ncancer detection, credit assessment, and text classification. The experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed model delivers superior performance over the\nexisting baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 10:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 03:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 23:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 23:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 01:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

To do so, we consider a simple illustrative model and a more\nrealistic test case related to seawater intrusion.

Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) pixel-based MCMC\ninversion of plane-wave electromagnetic (EM) data. Using synthetic data, we\ninvestigate how model parameter uncertainty depends on model structure\nconstraints using different norms of the likelihood function and the model\nconstraints, and study the added benefits of joint inversion of EM and\nelectrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. Our results demonstrate that\nmodel structure constraints are a necessity to stabilize the MCMC inversion\nresults of a highly-discretized model.

A drawback is that\nthese constraints may lead to posterior distributions that do not fully include\nthe true underlying model, because some of its features exhibit a low\nsensitivity to the EM data, and hence are difficult to resolve. This problem\ncan be partly mitigated if the plane-wave EM data is augmented with ERT\nobservations. The hierarchical Bayesian inverse formulation introduced and used\nherein is able to successfully recover the probabilistic properties of the\nmeasurement data errors and a model regularization weight.

However, a strong magnetic field $B\\gtrsim 10^{18}$ G disrupts this\nmixed broken phase region and changes a smooth crossover found in the\nweak-field case to a first-order transition for both gaps at almost the same\ncritical density. Our results suggest that in the two-flavor approximation to\nmoderately dense quark matter, strong magnetic field enhances the possibility\nof a mixed phase at high density, with implications for the structure,\nenergetics and vibrational spectrum of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 12:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Our rapid follow-up observations, which include\nmultiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at ~6 hr\npost-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate\nenvironment (<~ 10^15 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was\nsurrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final ~1\nyr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10^-3 solar masses per year. The\ncomplete disappearance of flash-ionised emission lines within the first several\ndays requires that the dense CSM be confined to within <~ 10^15 cm, consistent\nwith radio non-detections at 70--100 days.

Given a subject's data, inference can\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

The asymmetry is\ncaused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the\nstrength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp. The projected\nvelocity field, derived from line observations, shows characteristic\ndeviations, twists and a change in the slope of the rotation curve, from that\nof an unperturbed disc.

Building r\nsuch groups, each one electing its president, to constitute a group of the\ngroups with the r local presidents electing a higher-level president, does\nreduce further the outcome probabilistic aspect. Repeating the process n times\nleads to a n-level bottom-up pyramidal structure.

However, coloring is not free and the overhead can be significant.\nIn particular, for the bipartite-graph partial coloring (BGPC) and distance-2\ngraph coloring (D2GC) problems, which have various use-cases within the\nscientific computing and numerical optimization domains, the coloring overhead\ncan be in the order of minutes with a single thread for many real-life graphs.\n  In this work, we propose parallel algorithms for bipartite-graph partial\ncoloring on shared-memory architectures. Compared to the existing shared-memory\nBGPC algorithms, the proposed ones employ greedier and more optimistic\ntechniques that yield a better parallel coloring performance. In particular, on\n16 cores, the proposed algorithms perform more than 4x faster than their\ncounterparts in the ColPack library which is, to the best of our knowledge, the\nonly publicly-available coloring library for multicore architectures. In\naddition to BGPC, the proposed techniques are employed to devise parallel\ndistance-2 graph coloring algorithms and similar performance improvements have\nbeen observed. Finally, we propose two costless balancing heuristics for BGPC\nthat can reduce the skewness and imbalance on the cardinality of color sets\n(almost) for free. The heuristics can also be used for the D2GC problem and in\ngeneral, they will probably yield a better color-based parallelization\nperformance especially on many-core architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 15:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

It follows that a\nW-near-triangulation H of at least five vertices is non-chordal if and only if\nit contains an internal vertex. This yields a local structural characterization\nthat a plane near-triangulation G is chordal if and only if it does not contain\nan induced wheel of at least five vertices. For W-near-triangulations that are\nfree of induced wheels of five vertices, we derive a similar local criteria,\nthat depends only on the neighbourhoods of individual vertices and faces, for\nchecking perfectness. We show that a W-near-triangulation H that is free of any\ninduced wheel of five vertices is perfect if and only if there exists neither\nan internal vertex x, nor a face f such that, the neighbours of x or f induces\nan odd hole. The above characterization leads to a linear time algorithm for\ndetermining perfectness of this class of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 12:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 23:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-26"}

These studies revealed the dependence on different states of\nconsciousness, particularly that wakefulness is characterized by larger\ncomplexity of brain signals perhaps due to the necessity of the brain to handle\nvaried sensorimotor information. Thus these frameworks are very useful in\nattempts at quantifying cognitive states. We set out to analyze different types\nof signals including scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG), and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG) in subjects during different states of\nconsciousness: awake, sleep stages and epileptic seizures. The signals were\nanalyzed using a statistical (Permutation Entropy) and a deterministic\n(Permutation Lempel Ziv Complexity) analytical method. The results are\npresented in a complexity vs entropy graph, showing that the values of entropy\nand complexity of the signals tend to be greatest when the subjects are in\nfully alert states, falling in states with loss of awareness or consciousness.\nThese results are robust for all three types of recordings. We propose that the\ninvestigation of the structure of cognition using the frameworks of complexity\nwill reveal mechanistic aspects of brain dynamics associated not only with\naltered states of consciousness but also with normal and pathological\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 20:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

Recently,\nartificial, stable and substitutional doping of MoS2 into n- and p-type has\nbeen demonstrated. MoS2 is an interesting material to use for optoelectronic\napplications due to the potential of low-cost production in large quantities,\nstrong light-matter interactions and chemical stability. Here we report the\ncharacterization of the optoelectronic properties of vertical homojunctions\nmade by stacking few-layer flakes of MoS2:Fe (n-type) and MoS2:Nb (p-type). The\njunctions exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.7 %, a maximum open\ncircuit voltage of 0.51 V, they are stable in air and their rectification\ncharacteristics and photovoltaic response are in excellent agreement to the\nShockley diode model. The gate-tunability of the maximum output power, the\nideality factor and the shunt resistance indicate that the dark current is\ndominated by trap-assisted recombination and that the photocurrent collection\ndepends strongly on the spatial extent of the space charge region. We\ndemonstrate a response time faster than 80 ms and highlight the potential to\nintegrate such devices into quasi-transparent and flexible optoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 10:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Moreover, the dominant charge carrier injection process is\ndiffusion, so that a modified Schottky theory can be used to derive a simple\nanalytical equation for the current voltage curve of the diode. Here, we\ncarried out a full analysis of the MIM model for the organic diode. We show\nthat Schottky theory is only valid when charge injection is poor, that is, for\nhigh injection barriers. When the injection barrier is lowered, the current\ngiven by Schottky theory is still valid in the weak injection regime, when the\napplied potential is lower than the diffusion potential. However, it becomes\nlargely overestimated in the strong injection regime. We also show that in the\nstrong injection regime, the current given by the MIM model merges with\nMott-Gurnery space-charge-limited regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 07:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}
