Since then, there has been continued interest in\nunderstanding and predicting protein structure and stability. It is\nwell-established that a large contribution to protein stability originates from\nthe sequestration from solvent of hydrophobic residues in the protein core. How\nare such hydrophobic residues arranged in the core? And how can one best model\nthe packing of these residues? Here we show that to properly model the packing\nof residues in protein cores it is essential that amino acids are represented\nby appropriately calibrated atom sizes, and that hydrogen atoms are explicitly\nincluded. We show that protein cores possess a packing fraction of $\\phi\n\\approx 0.56$, which is significantly less than the typically quoted value of\n0.74 obtained using the extended atom representation. We also compare the\nresults for the packing of amino acids in protein cores to results obtained for\njammed packings from disrete element simulations composed of spheres, elongated\nparticles, and particles with bumpy surfaces. We show that amino acids in\nprotein cores pack as densely as disordered jammed packings of particles with\nsimilar values for the aspect ratio and bumpiness as found for amino acids.\nKnowing the structural properties of protein cores is of both fundamental and\npractical importance. Practically, it enables the assessment of changes in the\nstructure and stability of proteins arising from amino acid mutations (such as\nthose identified as a result of the massive human genome sequencing efforts)\nand the design of new folded, stable proteins and protein-protein interactions\nwith tunable specificity and affinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

This correlation suggests that HJ formation is affected by the\nstellar binary companion. A potential model is high-eccentricity migration, in\nwhich the binary companion induces high-eccentricity Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations in the proto-HJ orbit, triggering orbital migration driven by\ntides. A pitfall of this `binary-LK' model is that the observed stellar\nbinaries hosting HJs are typically too wide to produce HJs in sufficient\nnumbers, because of suppression by short-range forces. We propose a\nmodification to the binary-LK model in which there is a second giant planet\norbiting the proto-HJ at a semimajor axis of several tens of AU. Such\ncompanions are currently hidden to observations, but their presence could be\nmanifested by a propagation of the perturbation of the stellar binary companion\ninwards to the proto-HJ, thereby overcoming the barrier imposed by short-range\nforces. Our model does not require the planetary companion orbit to be\neccentric and/or inclined with respect to the proto-HJ, but its semimajor axis\nshould lie in a specific range given the planetary mass and binary semimajor\naxis, and the inclination with respect to the binary should be near $40^\\circ$\nor $140^\\circ$. Our prediction for planetary companions to HJs in stellar\nbinaries should be testable by future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

To\nmake an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias\nand an idealized geometry for the visibility mask.

In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques.

This category includes a vast\nmajority of neutron sources important in nuclear threat search, safeguards and\nnon-proliferation. Rather than requiring multiple views of the source this\ntechnique relies on the source's intrinsic property of coincidence gamma and\nneutron emission. As a result only a single-view measurement of the source is\nrequired to perform the 3D reconstruction. In principle, any scatter camera\nsensitive to gammas and neutrons with adequate timing and interaction location\nresolution can perform this reconstruction. Using a neutron double scatter\ntechnique, we can calculate a conical surface of possible source locations. By\nincluding the time to a correlated gamma we further constrain the source\nlocation in three-dimensions by solving for the source-to-detector distance\nalong the surface of said cone. As a proof of concept we applied these\nreconstruction techniques on measurements taken with the the Mobile Imager of\nNeutrons for Emergency Responders (MINER). Two Cf-252 sources measured at 50\nand 60 cm from the center of the detector were resolved in their varying depth\nwith average radial distance relative resolution of 26%. To demonstrate the\ntechnique's potential with an optimized system we simulated the measurement in\nMCNPX-PoliMi assuming timing resolution of 200 ps (from 2 ns in the current\nsystem) and source interaction location resolution of 5 mm (from 3 cm). These\nsimulated improvements in scatter camera performance resulted in radial\ndistance relative resolution decreasing to an average of 11%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 19:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Neural network\npruning has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many\ndifferent techniques have been proposed to address this problem. The decision\nof what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our\nassumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in\ndata. In this work, we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about\nneural network learning representations, approaches to pruning and the\nrelevance of one in the context of the other. To accomplish this, we argue in\nfavor of pruning whole neurons as opposed to the traditional method of pruning\nweights from optimally trained networks. We first review the historical\nliterature, point out some common assumptions it makes, and propose methods to\ndemonstrate the inherent flaws in these assumptions.

Efficiently coupling these models is vital for simulating the flow\nand flooding of open channels. Currently, existing methods couple the models\neither at the channel lateral boundaries (lateral methods) or at the location,\nalong the channel flow direction, where the two sub-domains intersect (frontal\nmethods). We classify these methods as horizontal methods since the coupling\npoints are on the horizontal plane. The limitations of these methods include\ntheir inability to recover the 2D channel flow structure during flooding\nwithout losing efficiency, and their inability to switch between lateral and\nfrontal methods, based on the problem. Here, we propose a new paradigm which is\nto think of the channel flow as a two layer flow. This leads to the vertical\ncoupling method (VCM) which is able to recover 2D channel flow structure\nwithout losing efficiency, switch types depending on the flow and is a superset\nof some existing methods. The VCM is based on a user chosen elevation above\nwhich the user considers the channel to be full. From this elevation, all other\nflow quantities are defined including the two layers. The flows in the lower\nand upper layers are assumed to be 1D and 2D respectively, and the appropriate\nflow models with exchange terms are derived. The 2D shallow water flow model is\nretained for the floodplains. Finite volume methods (FVM) are formulated for\nthe flood model; the FVM with the operator splitting approach are also\nformulated to solve and couple the two layer channel flow models.

The long term dynamical behaviour of a point\nunder iteration of the map is translated into a spin system via symbolic\ndynamics. Methods from dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics may\nthen be used to analyse the map, respectively the zeta function and the\ntransfer operator. Intermittency is seen to be problematic to analyze due to\nthe presence of an `indifferent fixed point'. Points under iteration of the map\nmove away from this point extremely slowly creating pathological convergence\ntimes for calculations. This difficulty is removed by going to an appropriate\ninduced subsystem, which also leads to an induced zeta function and an induced\ntransfer operator. Results obtained there can be transferred back to the\noriginal system. The main work is then divided into two sections. The first\ndemonstrates a connection between the induced versions of the zeta function and\nthe transfer operator providing useful results regarding the analyticity of the\nzeta function. The second section contains a detailed analysis of the pressure\nfunction for the induced system and hence the original by considering bounds on\nthe radius of convergence of the induced zeta function.

Generally, active\nBrownian particles can involve either translational or rotational motion. Here,\nwe report the translational dynamics of photon-activated gold nanoparticles\n(NPs) in liquid cell imaged by four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D-EM).\nUnder excitation of femtosecond (fs)-laser pulses, we observed that those\nBrownian NPs exhibit a superfast diffusive behavior with a diffusion constant\nfour to five orders of magnitude greater than that in absence of laser\nexcitation. The measured diffusion constant was found to follow a power-law\ndependence on the fs-laser fluence.

In contrast,\nthe motion of the NPs exhibit superfast ballistic translation at a short time\nscale down to nanoseconds (ns).

The shrinkage is due to the the\nso-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the\nasymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing. However, in some\ncases, increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the\nnucleus due to a growing occupation of so-called `halo' orbits, i.e. weakly\nbound states and resonances in the continuum with low-$\\ell $ values.

However,\nmembership alone, without a complete profile of what a community is and how it\ninteracts with other communities, has limited applications. This motivates us\nto consider systematically profiling the communities and thereby developing\nuseful community-level applications. In this paper, we for the first time\nformalize the concept of community profiling. With rich user information on the\nnetwork, such as user published content and user diffusion links, we\ncharacterize a community in terms of both its internal content profile and\nexternal diffusion profile. The difficulty of community profiling is often\nunderestimated. We novelly identify three unique challenges and propose a joint\nCommunity Profiling and Detection (CPD) model to address them accordingly. We\nalso contribute a scalable inference algorithm, which scales linearly with the\ndata size and it is easily parallelizable. We evaluate CPD on large-scale\nreal-world data sets, and show that it is significantly better than the\nstate-of-the-art baselines in various tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 04:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Improvements\nin detector technology and focusing X-ray optics now enable sensitive\nastrophysical X-ray polarization measurements. These measurements will provide\nnew insights into the processes at work in accreting black holes, the emission\nof X-rays from neutron stars and magnetars, and the structure of AGN jets.\nX-Calibur is a balloon-borne hard X-ray scattering polarimeter. An X-ray mirror\nwith a focal length of 8 m focuses X-rays onto the detector, which consists of\na plastic scattering element surrounded by Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride detectors,\nwhich absorb and record the scattered X-rays. Since X-rays preferentially\nscatter perpendicular to their polarization direction, the polarization\nproperties of an X-ray beam can be inferred from the azimuthal distribution of\nscattered X-rays. A close alignment of the X-ray focal spot with the center of\nthe detector is required in order to reduce systematic uncertainties and to\nmaintain a high photon detection efficiency.

This is the Peierls phase\ntransition in the strained cumulene, which was previously revealed in [Nano\nLett. 14, 4224 (2014)]. The Peierls transition leads to appearance of the\nenergy gap in the electron spectrum of the strained carbyne, and this material\ntransforms from the conducting state to semiconducting or insulating states.\nThe authors of the above paper emphasize that such phenomenon can be used for\nconstruction of various nanodevices.

The Schnakenberg, Gray-Scott and Brusselator\nmodels are special cases of reaction-diffusion systems considered as numerical\nexamples in this paper. For numerical purposes, Crank-Nicolson formulae are\nused for the time discretization and the resulting system is linearized by\nTaylor expansion. In the finite element method, a uniform partition of the\nsolution domain is constructed for the space discretization. Over the mentioned\nmesh, dirac-delta function and trigonometric quintic B-spline functions are\nchosen as the weighted function and the bases functions, respectively. Thus,\nthe reaction-diffusion system turns into an algebraic system which can be\nrepresented by a matrix equation so that the coeffcients are block matrices\ncontaining a certain number of non-zero elements in each row. The method is\ntested on different problems. To illustrate the accuracy, error norms are\ncalculated in the linear problem whereas the relative error is given in other\nnonlinear problems.

The degree of the base polynomial allows the method to be used in\nhigh-order differential equation solutions. The algorithm produces accurate\nresults even when the time increment is larger.

In the first part of the review we describe semi-classical solutions of\nthe Einstein equations which, however, contains a \"quantum\" input through the\nmatter source. We start by reviewing the early model by Bardeen where the\nmetric is regularized by-hand through a short-distance cut-off, which is\njustified in terms of non-linear electro-dynamical effects. This a toy-model\nmodel useful to point-out the common features shared by all regular\nsemi-classical black holes. Then, we solve Einstein equations with a Gaussian\nsource encoding the quantum spread of an elementary particle. We identify, the\na priori arbitrary, Gaussian width with the Compton wavelength of the quantum\nparticle. This Compton-Gauss model leads to the estimate of a terminal density\nthat a gravitationally collapsed object can achieve. We identify this density\nto be the Planck density, and reformulate the Gaussian model assuming this as\nits peak density. All these models, are physically reliable as long as the\nblack hole mass is big enough with respect to the Planck mass. In the truly\nPlanckian regime, the semi-classical approximation breaks down. In this case, a\nfully quantum black hole description is needed. In the last part of this paper,\nwe propose a non-geometrical quantum model of Planckian black hole implementing\nthe Holographic Principle and realizing the \"classicalization\" scenario\nrecently introduced by Dvali and collaborators.

For this halo\nmain-sequence turnoff star, the abundance determination of P and S are the\nfirst published determinations. The LTE profiles of the lines were fitted to\nthe observed spectra. Wherever possible, we corrected the derived abundances\nfor non-LTE effects. Three-dimensional (3D) CO5BOLD model atmospheres have been\nused to determine the abundances of C and O from molecular CH and OH bands. The\nabundances of these light elements in HD 84937 are found to agree well with the\nabundances in classical metal-poor stars. Our HD 84937 carbon abundance\ndetermination points toward a solar (or mildly enhanced) value of [C/Fe]. The\nmodest overabundance of the alpha elements of even atomic number Z, typical of\nhalo turnoff stars, is confirmed in this example. The odd-Z element P is found\nto be somewhat deficient in HD 84937, at [P/Fe]=-0.32, which is again\nconsistent with the handful of existing determinations for turnoff stars of\nsuch low metallicity. We show that the abundance of oxygen, deduced from the OH\nband from 3D computations, is not compatible with the abundance deduced from\nthe red oxygen triplet. This incompatibility is explained by the existence of a\nchromosphere heating the shallow layers of the atmosphere where the OH band, in\n3D computations, is mainly formed.

The discovery of basaltic asteroids in the outer belt challenged\nthe models of the radial extent and the variability of the temperature\ndistribution in the early solar system. We aim to identify new basaltic V-type\nasteroids using near-infrared colors of ~40000 asteroids observed by the\nVHS-VISTA survey and compiled in the MOVIS-C catalogue. We also want to study\ntheir near-infrared colors and to study the near-infrared color distribution of\nthe Vesta dynamical family. We performed a search in the MOVIS-C catalogue of\nall the asteroids with (Y-J) and (J-Ks) in the range (Y-J) > 0.5 and (J-Ks) <\n0.3, associated with V-type asteroids, and studied their color distribution. We\nhave also analyzed the near-infrared color distribution of 273 asteroid members\nof the Vesta family and compared them with the albedo and visible colors from\nWISE and SDSS data. We determined the fraction of V-type asteroids in the\nfamily. We found 477 V-type candidates in MOVIS-C, 244 of them outside the\nVesta dynamical family. We identified 19 V-type asteroids beyond the 3:1 mean\nmotion resonance, 6 of them in the outer main belt, and 16 V-types in the inner\nmain belt with proper inclination i_p < 3.0deg, well below the inclination of\nthe Vesta family. We computed that ~85% of the members of the Vesta dynamical\nfamily are V-type asteroids, and only 1-2% are primitive class asteroids and\nunlikely members of the family. This work almost doubles the sample of basaltic\nasteroid candidates in regions outside the Vesta family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 11:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The latter is the error component due to the\nfact that the model used in the calculation (e.g. Kohn-Sham LDA) must be\ndiscretized in a finite basis set to be solved by a computer.

The nanowires' thickness and structure are well predicted by a\ndouble-staged mechanism. On the first stage the coagulation of cold particles\nin the vortex cores leads to melting of their fusion product, which acquires a\nspherical shape due to surface tension. Then (second stage) when these\nparticles reach a certain size they do not possess sufficient energy to melt\nand eventually coalesce into the nanowires. Nevertheless the assumption of\nmelting for such refractory metal as tungsten, especially in He II, which\npossesses an extremely high thermal conductivity, induces natural skepticism.\nThat is why we decided to register directly the visible thermal emission\naccompanying metals coagulation in He II. The brightness temperatures of this\nradiation for the tungsten, molybdenum, and platinum coagulation were found to\nbe noticeably higher than even the metals' melting temperatures. The region of\nHe II that contained suspended metal particles expanded with the velocity of 50\nm/s, being close to the Landau velocity, but coagulation took place even more\nquickly, so that the whole process of nanowire growth is completed at distances\nabout 1.5 mm from the place of metal injection into He II.

Therefore, learning multiple sets of\nspatially or temporally local, modular abstractions of the inputs would be\nbeneficial. How can a robot learn these local abstractions without a teacher?\nMore specifically, how can it decide from where and when to start learning a\nnew abstraction? A recently proposed algorithm called Curious Dr. MISFA\naddresses this problem. The algorithm is based on two underlying learning\nprinciples called artificial curiosity and slowness.

The model revolves around\nthe concept of hierarchical value and explains the emergence of dissociation\nand splitting in response to emotional pain. The key intuition is that traumas\nare caused by too strong negative emotions, which are in turn made possible by\na low-value self, which is in turn determined by low-value self-associated\nideas. The therapeutic method compiles a list of patient's traumas, identifies\nfor each trauma a list of low-value self-associated ideas, and provides for\neach idea a list of counterexamples, to raise the self value and solve the\ntrauma. Since the psychotherapy proposed has not been clinically tested,\nstatements on its effectiveness are premature.

In addition, we make\nuse of the newest satellite in orbit (MetOp-01) to find correction factors for\n2013 for the NOAA 17 and MetOp-02 satellites. Without taking into account the\nlevel of degradation, the proton data from one satellite cannot be used\nquantitatively for more than 2 to 3 years after launch. As the electron\ndetectors are vulnerable to contamination from energetic protons, the corrected\nproton measurements will be of value for electron flux measurements too. Thus,\nthe correction factors ensure the correctness of both the proton and electron\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 14:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

The SEDIGISM survey covers 78 deg^2 of the inner\nGalaxy (-60 deg < l < +18 deg, |b| < 0.5 deg) in the J=2-1 rotational\ntransition of 13CO. This isotopologue of CO is less abundant than 12CO by\nfactors up to 100. Therefore, its emission has low to moderate optical depths,\nand higher critical density, making it an ideal tracer of the cold, dense\ninterstellar medium. The data have been observed with the SHFI single-pixel\ninstrument at APEX. The observational setup covers the 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1)\nlines, plus several transitions from other molecules. The observations have\nbeen completed. Data reduction is in progress, and the final data products will\nbe made available in the near future.

The analogy with relativity has\nbeen investigated in physics and cosmology, but less has been done to use this\nwork in the field of aeroacoustics. Despite being successfully applied to a\nvariety of fields, Geometric Algebra has yet to be applied to acoustics. Our\naim is to apply these concepts first to a simple problem in aeroacoustics,\nsound propagation in uniform flow, and the more general problem of acoustic\npropagation in non-uniform flows. By using Geometric Algebra we are able to\nprovide a simple geometric interpretation to a transformation commonly used to\nsolve for sound fields in uniform flow. We are then able to extend this concept\nto an acoustic space-time applicable to irrotational, barotropic background\nflows. This geometrical framework is used to naturally derive the requirements\nthat must be satisfied by the background flow in order for us to be able to\nsolve for sound propagation in the non-uniform flow using the simple wave\nequation. We show that this is not possible in the most general situation, and\nprovide an explicit expression that must be satisfied for the transformation to\nexist. We show that this requirement is automatically satisfied if the\nbackground flow is incompressible or uniform, and for both these cases derive\nan explicit transformation. In addition to a new physical interpretation for\nthe transformation, we show that unlike previous investigations, our work is\napplicable to any frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 16:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The smooth distribution across colors for the disk\ngalaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.\nMeanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming\ndisk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is\nsuggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray\nAGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and\ndistributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on\nEddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN\nin the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the\nAGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves\ninto the green valley.

For a given\nrealization of the disorder, a minimally weighted loop/path configuration is\ndetermined by performing a non-trivial transformation of the original lattice\ninto a minimum weight perfect matching problem. For this problem, fast\npolynomial-time algorithms are available, thus we could study large systems\nwith high accuracy.

The on- source region is\ntypically a circular area with radius {\\theta} in which the signal is expected\nto appear with the shape of the instrument point spread function (PSF). This\npaper addresses the question of what is the {\\theta} that maximises the\nprobability of detection for a given PSF width and background event density. In\nthe high count number limit and assuming a Gaussian PSF profile, the optimum is\nfound to be at $\\zeta_\\infty^2 \\approx 2.51$ times the squared PSF width\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{PSF39}^2$.

Suppose that we know for the coming years, economy\nof the US will experience a real growth rate equal to \\%3 and economy of China\nwill experience a real growth as of \\%6. Now, the question is how long does it\ntake for economy of China to catch the economy of the United States. The early\nimpression is that the desired time is the answer of the equation\n$11\\times1.06^X=18\\times1.03^X$. The correct answer however is quite different.\nGDP is not a simple number and the gap between two countries can not be\naddressed simply through their sizes. It is rather a geometrical object.\nCountries pass different paths in the space of production. The gaps between GDP\nof different countries depend on the path that each country passes through and\nlocal metric. To address distance between economies of China and of the US we\nneed to know their utility preferences and the path that China passes to reach\nthe US size. The true gap then can be found if we calculate local metric along\nthis path. It resembles impressions about measurements in the General Theory of\nRelativity. Path dependency of aggregate indexes is widely discussed in the\nIndex Number Theory. Our aim is to stick to the geometrical view presented in\nthe General Relativity to provide a visual understanding of the matter. We show\nthat different elements in the general relativity have their own counterparts\nin economics. We claim that national agencies who provide aggregate data\nresemble falling observers into a curved space time. It is while the World Bank\nor international organizations are outside observers. The vision provided here,\nleaves readers with a clear conclusion. If China keeps its growth rate, then\nthe economy of China should catch the economy of the United States sooner than\nwhat we expect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 11:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 10:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

We call systems of\nideals their single-conclusion counterpart. If they preserve the order of a\ncommutative ordered monoid G and are equivariant w.r.t. its law, we call them\nequivariant systems of ideals for G: they describe all morphisms from G to\nmeet-semilattice-ordered monoids generated by (the image of) G.
