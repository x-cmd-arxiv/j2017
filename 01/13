They\nare particularly well suited to reconfigurable logic devices, which contain an\nabundance of fine-grained compute resources and can result in smaller, lower\npower implementations, or conversely in higher classification rates. Towards\nthis end, the Finn framework was recently proposed for building fast and\nflexible field programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerators for BNNs. Finn\nutilized a novel set of optimizations that enable efficient mapping of BNNs to\nhardware and implemented fully connected, non-padded convolutional and pooling\nlayers, with per-layer compute resources being tailored to user-provided\nthroughput requirements. However, FINN was not evaluated on larger topologies\ndue to the size of the chosen FPGA, and exhibited decreased accuracy due to\nlack of padding. In this paper, we improve upon Finn to show how padding can be\nemployed on BNNs while still maintaining a 1-bit datapath and high accuracy.\nBased on this technique, we demonstrate numerous experiments to illustrate\nflexibility and scalability of the approach. In particular, we show that a\nlarge BNN requiring 1.2 billion operations per frame running on an ADM-PCIE-8K5\nplatform can classify images at 12 kFPS with 671 us latency while drawing less\nthan 41 W board power and classifying CIFAR-10 images at 88.7% accuracy.

For lensing system as an\nisolated astrophysical object, we derive the dark energy contribution to\ngravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing a generic\nequation of state parameter $w$. We find that it generates $w$-dependent and\nposition-dependent modification to the conventional light orbital equation of\n$w=-1$. With post-Newtonian approximation, we compute its direct effect for an\nisolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that the dark energy\nforce can deflect the path of incident light rays. We demonstrate that the\ndark-energy-induced deflection angle $\\Delta\\alpha_{DE}^{}\\propto\nM^{(1+\\frac{1}{3w})}$ (with $1+\\frac{1}{3w}>0$), which increases with the\nlensing mass $M$ and consistently approaches zero in the limit $M \\to 0$. This\neffect is distinctive because dark energy tends to diffuse the rays and\ngenerates concave lensing effect. This is in contrast to the conventional\nconvex lensing effect caused by both visible and dark matter. Measuring such\nconcave lensing effect can directly probe the existence and nature of dark\nenergy. We estimate this effect and show that the current gravitational lensing\nexperiments are sensitive to the direct probe of dark energy at astrophysical\nscales.

Indeed, the dark matter phenomenology on galactic and\nsubgalactic scales appears always, and only, at low accelerations. It is\nstandard to find the $a<a_{0}$ regime towards the low density outskirts of\nastronomical systems, where under a Newtonian interpretation, dark matter\nbecomes conspicuous. Thus, it is standard to find, and to think, of the dense\ncentral regions of observed systems as purely Newtonian.

EV routing problem is\nsolved to minimize the total cost of travel using the Dijkstra algorithm with\nthe input from EVs battery management system, electricity price from charging\nstations, powertrain component efficiencies, and transportation network traffic\nconditions. Through the bidirectional communication of EVs with competing\ncharging stations, EVs charging demand estimation is done much more accurately.\nThen, the optimal power flow problem is solved for the power system, to find\nthe locational marginal price at load buses where charging stations are\nconnected. Finally, the electricity prices are communicated from the charging\nstations to the EVs, and the loop is closed.

Their\ndesign involves a delicate balance between fast lookups, high hit rates, low\naccess energy, and simplicity of implementation. Unfortunately, constraints\nimposed by virtual memory make it difficult to satisfy all these attributes\ntoday. Specifically, the modern staple of supporting virtual-indexing and\nphysical-tagging (VIPT) for parallel TLB-L1 lookups means that L1 caches are\nusually grown with greater associativity rather than sets. This compromises\nperformance -- by degrading access times without significantly boosting hit\nrates -- and increases access energy. We propose VIPT Enhancements for\nSuperPage Accesses or VESPA in response. VESPA side-steps the traditional\nproblems of VIPT by leveraging the increasing ubiquity of superpages; since\nsuperpages have more page offset bits, they can accommodate L1 cache\norganizations with more sets than baseline pages can. VESPA dynamically adapts\nto any OS distribution of page sizes to operate L1 caches with good access\ntimes, hit rates, and energy, for both single- and multi-threaded workloads.\nSince the hardware changes are modest, and there are no OS or application\nchanges, VESPA is readily-implementable.\n  By superpages (also called huge or large pages) we refer to any page sizes\nsupported by the architecture bigger than baseline page size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 20:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 07:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Because single-star evolution at the low stellar mass\nof present-epoch GCs was considered incapable of producing visible PNe, their\norigin presented a puzzle.

FPGAs are well\nknown to be able to perform convolutions efficiently, however, most recent\nefforts to run CNNs on FPGAs have shown limited advantages over other devices\nsuch as GPUs. Previous approaches on FPGAs have often been memory bound due to\nthe limited external memory bandwidth on the FPGA device. We show a novel\narchitecture written in OpenCL(TM), which we refer to as a Deep Learning\nAccelerator (DLA), that maximizes data reuse and minimizes external memory\nbandwidth. Furthermore, we show how we can use the Winograd transform to\nsignificantly boost the performance of the FPGA. As a result, when running our\nDLA on Intel's Arria 10 device we can achieve a performance of 1020 img/s, or\n23 img/s/W when running the AlexNet CNN benchmark. This comes to 1382 GFLOPs\nand is 10x faster with 8.4x more GFLOPS and 5.8x better efficiency than the\nstate-of-the-art on FPGAs. Additionally, 23 img/s/W is competitive against the\nbest publicly known implementation of AlexNet on nVidia's TitanX GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 00:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

We proposed to shift the attention to a geometric\ndescription.

The effective\ndimension for the Gibbs sampling is low because iterative sampling is done from\nonly three conditional posterior PDFs that correspond to three parameter\ngroups, along with sampling of the equation-error precision parameter from\nanother conditional posterior PDF in one of the algorithms where it is not\nintegrated out as a \"nuisance\" parameter. A nice feature from a computational\nperspective is that it is not necessary to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem\nof a structural model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nalgorithms are illustrated by applying them to the IASE-ASCE Phase II simulated\nand experimental benchmark studies. The goal is to use incomplete modal data\nidentified before and after possible damage to detect and assess\nspatially-sparse stiffness reductions induced by any damage. Our past and\ncurrent focus on meeting challenges arising from Bayesian inference of\nstructural stiffness serve to strengthen the capability of vibration-based\nstructural system identification but our methods also have much broader\napplicability for inverse problems in science and technology where system\nmatrices are to be inferred from noisy partial information about their\neigenquantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 02:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

By naturally combining two\nrecently rising techniques: active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL),\nour framework is capable of automatically annotating new instances and\nincorporating them into training under weak expert re-certification. We first\ninitialize the classifier using a few annotated samples for each individual,\nand extract image features using the convolutional neural nets. Then, a number\nof candidates are selected from the unannotated samples for classifier\nupdating, in which we apply the current classifiers ranking the samples by the\nprediction confidence. In particular, our approach utilizes the high-confidence\nand low-confidence samples in the self-paced and the active user-query way,\nrespectively. The neural nets are later fine-tuned based on the updated\nclassifiers.

Instead of addressing conspicuous attacks such as\nswitching-off communication, injecting noise, or denying consensus on group\nkeys, we introduce stealth attacks that can go undetected against\nstate-of-the-art GSK schemes. We propose two forms of attacks, namely: (i)\ndifferent-key attacks, wherein an insider attempts to generate different keys\nat different nodes, especially across nodes that are out of range so that they\nfail to recover group messages despite possessing the group key, and (ii)\nlow-rate key attacks, wherein an insider alters the common source of randomness\nso as to reduce the key-rate. We also discuss various detection techniques,\nwhich are based on detecting anomalies and inconsistencies on the channel\nmeasurements at the legitimate nodes. Through simulations we show that GSK\ngeneration schemes are vulnerable to insider-threats, especially on topologies\nthat cannot support additional secure links between neighbouring nodes to\nverify the attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 05:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

Fast PL decay, peak blueshift and linewidth broadening due to\nphotooxidation have been observed at low excitation power. With further\nincreasing of the excitation power, the PL peak position shows a redshift and\nlinewidth becomes narrow, which is ascribed to the enhanced F$\\ddot{o}$rster\nresonant energy transfer between different QDs by photoinduced agglomeration.\nThe oxygen plays an important role in optically induced PL decay which is\nverified by reduced photobleaching effect in vacuum. When the QDs drop-casted\non MDs, photooxidation and photobleaching are accelerated because the\nexcitation efficiency is greatly enhanced with coupling the pumping laser with\nthe cavity modes. However, when the emitted photons couple with cavity modes, a\nPL enhancement by more than 20 times is achieved because of the increased\nextraction efficiency and Purcell effects of MDs at room temperature (RT), and\n35 times at 20 K. The photobleaching can be avoided with a small excitation\npower but with a strong PL intensity by taking advantages of high quality\nfactor cavities. The high efficient PL emission without photodegradation is\nvery promising for using CuInS$_{2}$ QDs as high efficient photon emitters at\nRT, where the photodegradation has always been limiting the practical\napplications of colloidal quantum dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 09:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

In the framework of the\nmost popular Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (BKTHNY)\ntheory, 2D systems melt through two continuous Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT) transitions with intermediate hexatic phase. The conventional first-order\ntransition is also possible. On the other hand, recently on the basis of\ncomputer simulations the new melting scenario was proposed with continuous BKT\ntype solid-hexatic transition and first order hexatic-liquid transition.\nHowever, in the simulations the hexatic phase is extremely narrow that makes\nits study difficult. In the present paper, we propose to apply the random\npinning to investigate the hexatic phase in more detail. The results of\nmolecular dynamics simulations of two dimensional system having core-softened\npotentials with narrow repulsive step which is similar to the soft disk system\nare outlined. The system has a small fraction of pinned particles giving\nquenched disorder.

At the network layer, the best possible route is selected\naccording to channel state information (e.g., expected transmission count, hop\ncount) from the physical layer. Two types of dynamic routing are applied:\nshortest path routing (SPR), and cooperative multi-path routing (CMR)\nassociated with selection combining. An open-access experimental dataset\nincorporating `everyday' mixed-activities is used for analyzing and comparing\nthe cross-layer optimization with different wireless sensor network protocols\n(i.e., ORPL, LOADng). Negligible packet error rate is achieved by applying CMR\nand SPR techniques with reasonably sensitive receivers. Moreover, at 10% outage\nprobability, CMR gains up to 8, 7, and 6 dB improvements over ORPL, SPR, and\nLOADng, respectively. We show that CMR achieves the highest throughput\n(packets/s) while providing acceptable amount of average end-to-end delay (47.5\nms), at -100 dBm receive sensitivity. The use of alternate paths in CMR reduces\nretransmissions and increases packet success rate, which significantly reduces\nthe maximum amount of end-to-end delay and energy consumption for CMR with\nrespect to other protocols. It is also shown that the combined channel gains\nacross SPR and CMR are gamma and Rician distributed, correspondingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 11:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 03:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 00:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 08:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Another disadvantage of the standard actuator line\nmodel is that more geometrical features of turbine blades cannot be resolved on\na finer mesh. To alleviate these disadvantages of the standard model, we\ndevelop a new class of actuator surface models for turbine blades and nacelle\nto take into account more geometrical details of turbine blades and include the\neffect of turbine nacelle. In the actuator surface model for blade, the\naerodynamic forces calculated using the blade element method are distributed\nfrom the surface formed by the foil chords at different radial locations. In\nthe actuator surface model for nacelle, the forces are distributed from the\nactual nacelle surface with the normal force component computed in the same way\nas in the direct forcing immersed boundary method and the tangential force\ncomponent computed using a friction coefficient and a reference velocity of the\nincoming flow. The actuator surface model for nacelle is evaluated by\nsimulating the flow over periodically placed nacelles. Both the actuator\nsurface simulation and the wall-resolved large-eddy simulation are carried out.\nThe comparison shows that the actuator surface model is able to give acceptable\nresults especially at far wake locations on a very coarse mesh. It is noted\nthat although this model is employed for the turbine nacelle in this work, it\nis also applicable to other bluff bodies. The capability of the actuator\nsurface model in predicting turbine wakes is assessed by simulating the flow\nover the MEXICO (Model experiments in Controlled Conditions) turbine and a\nhydrokinetic turbine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 21:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 23:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 10:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 01:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}
