However, the center of\nmass may be shifted from the star due to the presence of any non-axisymmetric\nmass distribution. As a result, the system exerts a gravity force on the star,\ncausing the star to move in response, which can affect the evolution of the\ncircumstellar disk. We aim at studying the effects of stellar motion on the\nevolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In protostellar disks, a\nnon-axisymmetric distribution of matter in the form of spiral arms or massive\nclumps can form due to gravitational instability. Protoplanetary disks can also\nfeature non-axisymmetric structures caused by a high-mass planet or a\nlarge-scale vortex. We use 2D grid-based hydrodynamic simulations to explore\nthe effect of stellar motion. We adopt a non-inertial polar coordinate system\ncentered on the star, in which the stellar motion is taken into account by\ncalculating the indirect potential caused by the non-axisymmetric disk, a\nhigh-mass planet, or a large-scale vortex. We found that the stellar motion has\na moderate effect on the evolution history in protostellar disks, reducing\nsomewhat the disk size and mass, while having a profound effect on the\ncollapsing envelope, changing its inner shape from an initially axisymmetric to\na non-axisymmetric configuration. Protoplanetary disk simulations show that the\nstellar motion slightly reduces the width of the gap opened by a high-mass\nplanet, decreases the planet migration rate, and strengthens the large-scale\nvortices formed at the viscosity transition.

We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is\nfirmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its\nrelativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight. This is in contrast with the blazar-type modeling of\ntheir multi-band spectral energy distributions. Our work underlines the\nimportance of high-resolution VLBI imaging in confirming the blazar nature of\nhigh-redshift radio sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-12"}

Furthermore, hypercycles are highly susceptible to\nparasites, spatial structure constituting a key protection against them.\nHowever, there is an insufficient experimental validation of these theoretical\npredictions, in addition to little knowledge on how environmental conditions\ncould shape the spatial dynamics of hypercycles. Here, we constructed spatially\nextended hypercycles by using synthetic biology as a way to design mutualistic\nand parasitic {\\em E. coli} strains. A mathematical model of the hypercycle\nfront expansion is developed, providing analytic estimates of front speed\npropagation. Moreover, we explore how the environment affects the mutualistic\nconsortium during range expansions. Interestingly, moderate improvements in\nenvironmental conditions (namely, increasing the availability of\ngrowth-limiting amino acids) can lead to a slowing-down of the front speed. Our\nagent-based simulations suggest that opportunistic depletion of environmental\namino acids can lead to subsequent high fractions of stagnant cells at the\nfront, and thus to the slow-down of the front speed. Moreover, environmental\ndeterioration can also shape the interaction of the parasitic strain towards\nthe hypercycle. On the one hand, the parasite is excluded from the population\nduring range expansions in which the two species mutualism can thrive (in\nagreement with a classical theoretical prediction). On the other hand,\nenvironmental deterioration (e.g., associated with toxic chemicals) can lead to\nthe survival of the parasitic strain, while reshaping the interactions within\nthe three-species.

In this paper, we describe a particular way in which any given tensor\nnetwork can be viewed as a representation of two different quantum many-body\nstates. The two quantum many-body states are said to correspond to each other\nby means of the tensor network. We apply this \"tensor network state\ncorrespondence\"---a correspondence between quantum many-body states mediated by\ntensor networks as we describe---to the multi-scale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of ground states of one\ndimensional (1D) quantum many-body systems. Since the MERA is a 2D hyperbolic\ntensor network (the extra dimension is identified as the length scale of the 1D\nsystem), the two quantum many-body states obtained from the MERA, via tensor\nnetwork state correspondence, are seen to live in the bulk and on the boundary\nof a discrete hyperbolic geometry. The bulk state so obtained from a MERA\nexhibits interesting features, some of which caricature known features of the\nholographic correspondence of String theory. We show how (i) the bulk state\nadmits a description in terms of \"holographic screens\", (ii) the conformal\nfield theory data associated with a critical ground state can be obtained from\nthe corresponding bulk state, in particular, how pointlike boundary operators\nare identified with extended bulk operators.

However, the implied order of magnitude\nHCN abundance variations between Galactic center clouds, and the systematic\nnature of these variations warn of potential biases in the use of HCN as dense\ngas mass tracer in more extreme environments, such as AGN and shock-dominated\nregions. Finally, we also investigate other tracers having transitions near 3\nmm, finding that HNCO, HNC and HCO+ largely behave like HCN, while HC3N, and\nCH3CN are higher fidelity tracers of the amount of gas in clouds like Sgr B2\nthat suffer from strong self-absorption of the HCN 1-0 line.

At high redshift, characteristic galactic dynamical timescales become\ntoo short for supernova feedback to effectively respond to gravitational\ncollapse in galactic discs (an effect recently identified for galactic nuclei),\nwhereas in dwarf galaxies star formation occurs in too few bright star-forming\nregions to effectively average out. Burstiness is also enhanced at high\nredshift owing to elevated gas fractions in the early Universe.

Understanding the physical aspects of the representative\nartificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the\napplications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here,\nwe study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a\nfocus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the\nentanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary\ndimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using\nan exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement,\nimplying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states\nwith massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random\nweight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys\nvolume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the\ncompletely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no\nuniversal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type\nlevel statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is\ncapable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model\nHamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a\nconcrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster\nstates, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically\ncompute the entanglement spectrum.

Such data arises\nnaturally from settings where the outcome, unlike the covariates, is expensive\nto obtain, a frequent scenario in modern studies involving large databases like\nelectronic medical records (EMR). Supervised estimators like the ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) estimator utilize only the labeled data. It is often of interest\nto investigate if and when the unlabeled data can be exploited to improve\nestimation of the regression parameter in the adopted linear model.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of 'Efficient and Adaptive Semi-Supervised\nEstimators' (EASE) to improve estimation efficiency. The EASE are two-step\nestimators adaptive to model mis-specification, leading to improved (optimal in\nsome cases) efficiency under model mis-specification, and equal (optimal)\nefficiency under a linear model. This adaptive property, often unaddressed in\nthe existing literature, is crucial for advocating 'safe' use of the unlabeled\ndata. The construction of EASE primarily involves a flexible\n'semi-non-parametric' imputation, including a smoothing step that works well\neven when the number of covariates is not small; and a follow up 'refitting'\nstep along with a cross-validation (CV) strategy both of which have useful\npractical as well as theoretical implications towards addressing two important\nissues: under-smoothing and over-fitting. We establish asymptotic results\nincluding consistency, asymptotic normality and the adaptive properties of\nEASE. We also provide influence function expansions and a 'double' CV strategy\nfor inference. The results are further validated through extensive simulations,\nfollowed by application to an EMR study on auto-immunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 22:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 18:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

The controversy extends to population synthesis models\nof exoplanet demographics and to hydrodynamical models of the fragmentation\nprocess. The latter refers largely to the handling of radiative transfer in\nthree dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical models, which controls heating and\ncooling processes in gravitationally unstable disks, and hence dense clump\nformation. A suite of models using the $\\beta$ cooling approximation is\npresented here. The initial disks have masses of 0.091 $M_\\odot$ and extend\nfrom 4 to 20 AU around a 1 $M_\\odot$ protostar. The initial minimum Toomre\n$Q_i$ values range from 1.3 to 2.7, while $\\beta$ ranges from 1 to 100. We show\nthat the choice of $Q_i$ is equal in importance to the $\\beta$ value assumed:\nhigh $Q_i$ disks can be stable for small $\\beta$, when the initial disk\ntemperature is taken as a lower bound, while low $Q_i$ disks can fragment for\nhigh $\\beta$. These results imply that the evolution of disks toward low $Q_i$\nmust be taken into account in assessing disk fragmentation possibilities, at\nleast in the inner disk, i.e., inside about 20 AU. The models suggest that if\nlow $Q_i$ disks can form, there should be an as yet largely undetected\npopulation of gas giants orbiting G dwarfs between about 6 AU and 16 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 22:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

This\nsystem can be totally governed by a two-mode Dicke-lattice model, which\nincludes all of the counter-rotating terms and therefore works well in the\nultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments. Attributed to its\nspecial atom-photon coupling scheme, this model supports a global conserved\nexcitation and a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry, rather than the discrete $Z_{2}$\nsymmetry in the standard Dicke-lattice model. This distinct change of symmetry\nvia adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon\nlocalization/delocalization behavior. Specifically, the atom-photon interaction\nfeatures stable Mott-lobe structures of photons and a second-order\nsuperfluid-Mott-insulator phase transition, which share similarities with the\nJaynes-Cummings-lattice and Bose-Hubbard models. More interestingly, the\nMott-lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each\nsite. We also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous $XX$ spin\nmodel.

This approach, whose origins can be traced to machine learning, is\nbased on the leave-one-out bootstrap for prediction error. In machine learning\nthis is called the out-of-bag (OOB) error. To obtain the OOB error for a model,\none draws a bootstrap sample and fits the model to the in-sample data. The\nout-of-sample prediction error for the model is obtained by calculating the\nprediction error for the model using the out-of-sample data. Repeating and\naveraging yields the OOB error, which represents a robust cross-validated\nestimate of the accuracy of the underlying model. By a simple modification to\nthe bootstrap data involving \"noising up\" a variable, the OOB method yields a\nvariable importance (VIMP) index, which directly measures how much a specific\nvariable contributes to the prediction precision of a model. VIMP provides a\nscientifically interpretable measure of the effect size of a variable, we call\nthe \"predictive effect size\", that holds whether the researcher's model is\ncorrect or not, unlike the p-value whose calculation is based on the assumed\ncorrectness of the model. We also discuss a marginal VIMP index, also easily\ncalculated, which measures the marginal effect of a variable, or what we call\n\"the discovery effect\".

A simple\napproach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in\nthe data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the\nspace of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more\nappropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do\nnot tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical\nstudies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite\ndimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also\nleads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends\nto infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with\na very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the\nrisk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical\nresults indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate\nasymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed\nnumerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads\nto extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize\nthe reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness\nalso appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather\nconservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization\nparameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure\nfor ill-posed problems.

However, quantitative estimation of\nenergy transfer along the magnetic field is not enough. There are mainly two\nreason why it is difficult to observe the energy transfer from photosphere to\ncorona; 1) spatial resolution gap between photosphere (a few 0.1 arcsec) and\ncorona (a few arcsec), 2) lack in temperature coverage. Furthermore, there is\nnot enough observational knowledge of the physical parameters in the energy\ndissipation region. There are mainly three reason why it is difficult to\nobserve in the vicinity of the energy dissipation region; 1) small spatial\nscale, 2) short time scale, 3) low emission. It is generally believed that the\nenergy dissipation occurs in the very small scale and its duration is very\nshort (10 second). Further, the density in the dissipation region might be very\nlow.

In this work we study\nthis control-to-state informartion capacity of stochastic dynamic systems in\ncontinuous-time, when the states are observed only partially. The\ncontrol-to-state capacity, known as empowerment, was shown in the past to be\nuseful in solving various Artificial Intelligence & Control benchmarks, and was\nused to replace problem-specific utilities. The higher the value of empowerment\nis, the more optional future states an agent may reach by using its controls\ninside a given time horizon. The contribution of this work is that we derive an\nefficient solution for computing the control-to-state information capacity for\na linear, partially-observed Gaussian dynamic control system in continuous\ntime, and discover new relationships between control-theoretic and\ninformation-theoretic properties of dynamic systems. Particularly, using the\nderived method, we demonstrate that the capacity between the control signal and\nthe system output does not grow without limits with the length of the control\nsignal. This means that only the near-past window of the control signal\ncontributes effectively to the control-to-state capacity, while most of the\ninformation beyond this window is irrelevant for the future state of the\ndynamic system. We show that empowerment depends on a time constant of a\ndynamic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

The\nkinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not\nuniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s^-1 pc^-1. In this scenario, the\ngas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point.

Contrary to ordinary surface plasmons of metallic bulk\nmaterials, their dispersion goes to zero in the long wavelength limit, thus\ncovering a broad range of energies from terahertz to near infrared, and from\nmesoscopic wavelengths down to just a few nanometers. Using specific and most\ncharacteristic examples, we review first the properties of plasmons in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) metallic layers from an experimental point of view. As\ndemonstrated, tuning of their dispersion is possible by changes of charge\ncarrier concentration in the partially filled 2D conduction bands, but for the\nrelativistic electron gas like in graphene only in the long wavelength limit.\nFor short wavelengths, on the other hand, the dispersion turns out to be\nindependent of the position of the Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point.\nA linear dispersion, seen under the latter conditions in graphene, can also be\nobtained in non-relativistic electron gases by coupling between 2D and 3D\nelectronic systems. As a well investigated example, the acoustic surface\nplasmons in Shockley surface states, coupled with the bulk electronic system,\nare discussed. Also the introduction of anisotropy, e.g. by regular arrays of\nsteps, seems to result in linearization (and to partial localization of the\nplasmons normal to the steps, depending on wavelengths). In quasi-one\ndimensional (1D) systems, such as arrays of gold chains on regularly stepped Si\nsurfaces, only the dispersion is 1D, whereas shape and slope of the dispersion\ncurves depend on the 2D distribution of charge within each terrace and on\ncoupling between wires on different terraces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 13:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

Band spectra of 1D\nsystems that are spanned by just one parameter, a Bloch phase, are\ntopologically trivial. Recently, an ensemble of 1D Floquet systems, double\nkicked rotors (DKRs) depending on an external parameter, has been studied. It\nwas shown that a QE band spanned by both the Bloch phase and the external\nparameter is characterized by a Chern integer, which determines the change in\nthe mean angular momentum of a state in a band when the external parameter is\nadiabatically varied by a natural period.

This system can be characterized by a\n\\emph{second} Chern integer which is shown to be connected with the integer\nabove for the DKR ensemble.

The\ndata reveal a strong mechanical beta process. A model is proposed for the shear\nresponse of supercooled liquids. The model is an electrical equivalent-circuit\ncharacterized by additivity of the dynamic shear compliances of the alpha and\nbeta processes. The nontrivial parts of the alpha and beta processes are\nrepresented by a \"Cole-Cole retardation element\", resulting in the Cole-Cole\ncompliance function well-known from dielectrics. The model, which assumes that\nthe high-frequency decay of the alpha shear compliance loss varies with angular\nfrequency as $\\omega^{-1/2}$, has seven parameters. Assuming time-temperature\nsuperposition for the alpha and the beta processes separately, the number of\nparameters varying with temperature is reduced to four. From the temperature\ndependence of the best-fit model parameters the following conclusions are\ndrawn: 1) the alpha relaxation time conforms to the shoving model; 2) the beta\nrelaxation loss-peak frequency is almost temperature independent; 3) the alpha\ncompliance magnitude, which in the model equals the inverse of the\ninstantaneous shear modulus, is only weakly temperature dependent; 4) the beta\ncompliance magnitude decreases by a factor of three upon cooling in the\ntemperature range studied. The final part of the paper briefly presents\nmeasurements of the dynamic adiabatic bulk modulus covering frequencies from 10\nmHz to 10 kHz in the temperature range 172 K to 200 K.

A duality between such BSDEs and SDEs is\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 15:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 13:51:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 02:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

In such\nmaterials electromagnetic waves with these frequencies can not propagate; this\nmakes them interesting for a large number of applications. We focus on crystals\nmade of periodically ordered thin rods with high contrast dielectric\nproperties. We show that the material parameters can be chosen in such a way\nthat transverse magnetic modes with given frequencies can not propagate in the\ncrystal. At the same time, for any frequency belonging to a predefined range\nthere exists a transverse electric mode that can propagate in the medium. These\nresults are related to the spectral properties of a weighted Laplacian and of\nan elliptic operator of divergence type both acting in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. The\nproofs rely on perturbation theory of linear operators, Floquet-Bloch analysis,\nand properties of Schroedinger operators with point interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win\n(\\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\\emph{destructive} control) the\nelection. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems\nwhenadding and deleting voters have a \\emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add\n(resp.\\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\\ delete) a bundle~$\\kappa(v) $\nof voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\\kappa(v)$ may have\nmore than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.\nWe analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for\nthe Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is\ncomputationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling\nrelation is symmetric (i.e.\\ $\\forall w\\colon w \\in \\kappa(v) \\Leftrightarrow v\n\\in \\kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,\nthen destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive\nvariant remains $\\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\\ $\\forall\nw\\colon w \\in \\kappa(v) \\Leftrightarrow \\kappa(v) = \\kappa(w) $), the\nconstructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization\nvariant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient\napproximation algorithm, unless P=NP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

However, a single laser pulse can inject spin waves only with a\nbroad frequency spectrum, resulting in a short propagation distance and low\namplitude. Here we excite a magnetic garnet film by a train of fs-laser pulses\nwith 1 GHz repetition rate so that pulse separation is smaller than decay time\nof the magnetic modes which allows to achieve collective photonic impact on\nmagnetization. It establishes a quasi-stationary source of SWs, namely a\ncoherent magnon accumulation (\"magnon cloud\"). This approach has several\nappealing features: (i) the source is tunable; (ii) the SW amplitude can be\nsignificantly enhanced; (iii) the spectrum of the generated SWs is quite narrow\nthat provides longer propagation distance; (iv) the periodic pumping results in\nalmost constant in time SW amplitude up to 100 um away from the source; and (v)\nthe SW emission shows a pronounced directionality.

These two\nacquisition modes provide complementary pieces of information, offering a\nglobal view of excitations in reciprocal space.

If properly designed, such dual-mode base stations can enhance\nmobility and handover in highly mobile wireless environments. In this paper, a\nnovel approach for analyzing and managing mobility in joint $\\mu$W-mmW networks\nis proposed. The proposed approach leverages device-level caching along with\nthe capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize handover failures,\nreduce inter-frequency measurement energy consumption, and provide seamless\nmobility in emerging dense heterogeneous networks. First, fundamental results\non the caching capabilities, including caching probability and cache duration\nare derived for the proposed dual-mode network scenario. Second, the average\nachievable rate of caching is derived for mobile users. Third, the proposed\ncache-enabled mobility management problem is formulated as a dynamic matching\ngame between mobile user equipments (MUEs) and small base stations (SBSs). The\ngoal of this game is to find a distributed handover mechanism that subject to\nthe network constraints on HOFs and limited cache sizes, allows each MUE to\nchoose between executing an HO to a target SBS, being connected to the\nmacrocell base station (MBS), or perform a transparent HO by using the cached\ncontent. The formulated matching game allows capturing the dynamics of the\nmobility management problem caused by HOFs. To solve this dynamic matching\nproblem, a novel algorithm is proposed and its convergence to a two-sided\ndynamically stable HO policy is proved. Numerical results corroborate the\nanalytical derivations and show that the proposed solution will provides\nsignificant reductions in both the HOF and energy consumption by MUEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 14:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

It is shown that the\nreheating temperature can be affect on the frequency of the spectrum as well.\nThere is constraint on the temperature from cosmological observations based on\nWMAP-9 and Planck. Therefore it is interesting to estimate allowed value of\nfrequencies of the spectrum based on general range of reheating temperature\nlike few MeV $\\lesssim T_{rh}\\lesssim10^{16}$ GeV, WMAP-9 and Planck data then\ncompare the spectrum with sensitivity of future detectors such as LISA, BBO and\nultimate-DECIGIO. The obtained results of this comparison give us some more\nchance for detection of the relic gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 10:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 14:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

A combination of natural language processing and\nmachine learning techniques were used to determine what people are tweeting\nabout Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find\nrelevant tweets on Zika, and then categorize these into the four disease\ncategories. Tweets in each disease category were then examined using latent\ndirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the five main tweet topics for each\ndisease characteristic. Results 1,234,605 tweets were collected. Tweets by\nmales and females were similar (28% and 23% respectively). The classifier\nperformed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F=0.87 and 0.99\nrespectively) and disease characteristics (F=0.79 and 0.90 respectively). Five\ntopics for each category were found and discussed with a focus on the symptoms\ncategory. Through this process, we demonstrate how misinformation can be\ndiscovered so that public health officials can respond to the tweets with\nmisinformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 18:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

Persistent entropy is defined as the Shannon entropy of the\npersistence barcode of a given filtration. In this paper we present new\nimportant properties of persistent entropy of Cech and Vietoris-Rips\nfiltrations. Among the properties, we put a focus on the stability theorem that\nallows to use persistent entropy for comparing persistence barcodes.
