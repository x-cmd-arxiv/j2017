The\nspecific parameters under consideration include the amplitude $Q$ of the\nprimordial density fluctuations, the Planck mass $M_{\\rm pl}$, the\nbaryon-to-photon ratio $\\eta$, and the density ratio $\\Omega_M/\\Omega_b$. In\naddition to structure formation, we use considerations from stellar structure\nand Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to constrain these quantities.

The present\npaper deals with online convex optimization involving adversarial loss\nfunctions and adversarial constraints, where the constraints are revealed after\nmaking decisions, and can be tolerable to instantaneous violations but must be\nsatisfied in the long term. Performance of an online algorithm in this setting\nis assessed by: i) the difference of its losses relative to the best dynamic\nsolution with one-slot-ahead information of the loss function and the\nconstraint (that is here termed dynamic regret); and, ii) the accumulated\namount of constraint violations (that is here termed dynamic fit).

In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation\ngraph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by\nexecuting procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is\nfree to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration\nthus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures,\nand DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in\na way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or\nPython). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic\ncomputation graph is defined anew for every training example, its construction\nmust have low overhead. To achieve this, DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and\nlightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet's speeds are\nfaster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits, and significantly\nfaster than Chainer, another dynamic declaration toolkit.

This has inspired the\ndevelopment of $s$-step Krylov subspace method variants, in which iterations\nare computed in blocks of $s$, which can reduce the number of global\nsynchronizations per iteration by a factor of $O(s)$.\n  Although the $s$-step variants are mathematically equivalent to their\nclassical counterparts, they can behave quite differently in finite precision\ndepending on the parameter $s$. If $s$ is chosen too large, the $s$-step method\ncan suffer a convergence delay and a decrease in attainable accuracy relative\nto the classical method. This makes it difficult for a potential user of such\nmethods - the $s$ value that minimizes the time per iteration may not be the\nbest $s$ for minimizing the overall time-to-solution, and further may cause an\nunacceptable decrease in accuracy.\n  Towards improving the reliability and usability of $s$-step Krylov subspace\nmethods, in this work we derive the \\emph{adaptive $s$-step CG method}, a\nvariable $s$-step CG method where in block $k$, the parameter $s_k$ is\ndetermined automatically such that a user-specified accuracy is attainable.

This enables elements to be split by a\ndiscontinuity, strong or weak and hence requires the integration of\ndiscontinuous functions or functions with discontinuous derivatives over\nelementary volumes. Moreover, in the case of open surfaces and singularities,\nspecial, usually non-polynomial functions must also be integrated. A variety of\napproaches have been proposed to facilitate these special types of numerical\nintegration, which have been shown to have a large impact on the accuracy and\nthe convergence of the numerical solution. The smoothed extended finite element\nmethod (SmXFEM) [1], for example, makes numerical integration elegant and\nsimple by transforming volume integrals into surface integrals. However, it was\nreported in [1, 2] that the strain smoothing is inaccurate when non-polynomial\nfunctions are in the basis. This is due to the constant smoothing function used\nover the smoothing domains which destroys the effect of the singularity. In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits of a recently developed Linear\nsmoothing procedure [3] which provides better approximation to higher order\npolynomial fields in the basis. Some benchmark problems in the context of\nlinear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are solved to compare the standard\nXFEM, the constant-smoothed XFEM (Sm-XFEM) and the linear-smoothed XFEM\n(LSm-XFEM). We observe that the convergence rates of all three methods are the\nsame. The stress intensity factors (SIFs) computed through the proposed\nLSm-XFEM are however more accurate than that obtained through Sm-XFEM. To\nconclude, compared to the conventional XFEM, the same order of accuracy is\nachieved at a relatively low computational effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 06:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

It is\nfound that Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Ge orders magnetically at low temperatures in the\nwhole concentration range of $x \\in [0 \\div 0.9]$. Three different states of\nthe magnetic structure have been found: a short-periodic helical state at $x\n\\leq 0.45$, a long-periodic helical state at $0.45 < x \\leq 0.8$, and a\nferromagnetic state at $x \\sim 0.9$. Taking into account that the relatively\nlarge helical wavevector $k \\gg 1$ nm$^{-1}$ is characteristic for systems with\nmainly Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, we suggest that the\nshort-periodic helical structure at $x \\leq 0.45$ is based on an effective RKKY\ninteraction. Also the decay of $k$ with increasing $x$ is ascribed to a\nreduction of the interaction between second nearest neighbors and, therefore,\nto an increase of the influence of the Dzyaloshinskiy-Moriya interaction (DMI).\nAs a result of the competition between these two interactions the quantum phase\ntransition from a long-range ordered (LRO) to a short-range ordered (SRO)\nhelical structure has been observed upon increase of the Co-concentration at\n$x_{c1} \\sim 0.25$. Further increase of $x$ leads to the appearance of a double\npeak in the scattering profile at $0.45 < x < 0.7$. The transition from a\nhelical structure to a ferromagnetic state found at $x = 0.9$ is caused by the\nweakening of DMI as compared to the cubic anisotropy. In summary, the evolution\nof the magnetic structure of Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Ge with increasing $x$ is an\nexample of a continuous transition from a helical structure based on the\neffective RKKY interaction to a ferromagnetic structure passing through a\nhelical structure based on DMI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 10:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 18:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The accuracy of the numerical path between\ndifferent metastable states usually suffers from the \"clustering problem\" near\nfixed points. The adaptive minimum action method (aMAM) solves this problem by\nrelocating image points equally along arc-length with the help of moving mesh\nstrategy. However, when the time interval is large, the images on the path may\nstill be locally trapped around the transition state in a tangle, due to the\nsingularity of the relationship between arc-length and time at the transition\nstate. Additionally, in most non-gradient dynamics, the tangent direction of\nthe path is not continuous at the transition state so that a geometric corner\nforms, which brings extra challenges for the aMAM. In this note, we improve the\naMAM by proposing a better monitor function that does not contain the numerical\napproximation of derivatives, and taking use of a generalized scheme of the\nEuler-Lagrange equation to solve the minimization problem, so that both the\npath-tangling problem and the non-smoothness in parametrizing the curve do not\nexist.

It develops in nonplanar shells that are\nbounded on either side by a hydrodynamic shock, provided that the amplitude of\nthe seed oscillations is sufficiently large. The hydrodynamic NTSI has a\nmicroscopic counterpart in collisionless plasma. A sinusoidal displacement of a\nthin shell, which is formed by the collision of two clouds of unmagnetized\nelectrons and protons, grows and saturates on timescales of the order of the\ninverse proton plasma frequency. Here we increase the wavelength of the seed\nperturbation by a factor 4 compared to that in a previous study. Like in the\ncase of the hydrodynamic NTSI, the increase in the wavelength reduces the\ngrowth rate of the microscopic NTSI. The prolonged growth time of the\nmicroscopic NTSI allows the waves, which are driven by the competing ion\nacoustic instability, to grow to a large amplitude before the NTSI saturates\nand they disrupt the latter. The ion acoustic instability thus imposes a limit\non the largest wavelength that can be destabilized by the NTSI in collisionless\nplasma. The limit can be overcome by binary collisions. We bring forward\nevidence for an overstability of the collisionless NTSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 14:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In this paper, the MAC-WT has been\nre-visited by considering the situation that the legitimate receiver feeds his\nreceived channel output back to the transmitters via two noiseless channels,\nrespectively. This model is called the MAC-WT with noiseless feedback. Inner\nand outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region of this feedback model are\nprovided. To be specific, we first present a decode-and-forward (DF) inner\nbound on the secrecy capacity region of this feedback model, and this bound is\nconstructed by allowing each transmitter to decode the other one's transmitted\nmessage from the feedback, and then each transmitter uses the decoded message\nto re-encode his own messages, i.e., this DF inner bound allows the independent\ntransmitters to co-operate with each other. Then, we provide a hybrid inner\nbound which is strictly larger than the DF inner bound, and it is constructed\nby using the feedback as a tool not only to allow the independent transmitters\nto co-operate with each other, but also to generate two secret keys\nrespectively shared between the legitimate receiver and the two transmitters.\nFinally, we give a sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of this\nfeedback model. The results of this paper are further explained via a Gaussian\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 14:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}
