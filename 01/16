In a first\nstep, we run chemical models with a high cosmic ray ionisation rate and find\nthat this scenario can only reproduce the lowest abundances of methanol derived\nin this region ($\\sim$10$^{-9}$-10$^{-8}$).

Sharing\ntrained models of these deep neural networks is very important in the rapid\nprogress of researching or developing deep neural network systems. At the same\ntime, it is necessary to protect the rights of shared trained models. To this\nend, we propose to use a digital watermarking technology to protect\nintellectual property or detect intellectual property infringement of trained\nmodels. Firstly, we formulate a new problem: embedding watermarks into deep\nneural networks. We also define requirements, embedding situations, and attack\ntypes for watermarking to deep neural networks. Secondly, we propose a general\nframework to embed a watermark into model parameters using a parameter\nregularizer. Our approach does not hurt the performance of networks into which\na watermark is embedded. Finally, we perform comprehensive experiments to\nreveal the potential of watermarking to deep neural networks as a basis of this\nnew problem.

As an alternative to Bayesian propensity\nscore analysis, we propose a Bayesian posterior predictive approach for\nconstructing doubly robust estimation procedures.

Finding an optimal LDR is a static optimization\nproblem that provides an upper bound on the optimal value of the MSLP, and,\nunder certain assumptions, can be formulated as an explicit linear program.\nSimilarly, as proposed by Kuhn, Wiesemann, and Georghiou (Math. Program., 130,\n177-209, 2011) a lower bound for an MSLP can be obtained by restricting\ndecisions in the dual of the MSLP to follow an LDR. We propose a new\napproximation approach for MSLPs, two-stage LDRs. The idea is to require only\nthe state variables in an MSLP to follow an LDR, which is sufficient to obtain\nan approximation of an MSLP that is a two-stage stochastic linear program\n(2SLP). We similarly propose to apply LDR only to a subset of the variables in\nthe dual of the MSLP, which yields a 2SLP approximation of the dual that\nprovides a lower bound on the optimal value of the MSLP. Although solving the\ncorresponding 2SLP approximations exactly is intractable in general, we\ninvestigate how approximate solution approaches that have been developed for\nsolving 2SLP can be applied to solve these approximation problems, and derive\nstatistical upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of the MSLP. In\naddition to potentially yielding better policies and bounds, this approach\nrequires many fewer assumptions than are required to obtain an explicit\nreformulation when using the standard static LDR approach. A computational\nstudy on two example problems demonstrates that using a two-stage LDR can yield\nsignificantly better primal policies and modestly better dual policies than\nusing policies based on a static LDR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 19:23:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 15:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

The dynamics is calculated for a\nBethe lattice in infinite dimensions with non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field\ntheory. In the absence of driving melting proceeds differently depending on the\nquench of the interactions to hopping ratio $U/J_0$ from the atomic limit. For\n$U \\gg J_0$ decay occurs due to mobile charge-excitations transferring energy\nto the spin sector, while for $J_0 \\gtrsim U$ it is governed by the dynamics of\nresidual quasi-particles.

This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body\nmotion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and\nmake it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5-10 yr.\nCircumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational\nchallenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature\nthat may be difficult to identify. This may help explain their present\nnon-detection, or maybe they simply do not exist. Whilst this paper considers\nbinaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries\nfavourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes to the point of being\nguaranteed.

Additionally,\nif acceleration is efficient then the nonlinear backreaction of accelerated\nparticles on the shock structure modifies the shape of the non-thermal tail of\nthe particle spectra. Both of these modifications to the standard synchrotron\nafterglow impact the luminosity, spectra, and temporal variation of the\nafterglow.

Our system successfully\ndetects water hazards up to more than 100m. Finally, we discuss several\ninteresting challenges and propose future research directions for further\nimproving robust autonomous car perception in hazardous wet conditions using\npolarization sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 05:47:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 07:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is\nthat the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the\nobserved covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition\non, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had\na huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust\nfor all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding\nbetween the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment\ncovariate might have greater bias than estimators without adjusting for this\ncovariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes\ninstrumental variables that are independent of the confounder, and affect the\noutcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this\nphenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill in this gap in\nthe literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon\nhappens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity\nassumptions. We further show that when the treatment follows an additive or\nmultiplicative model conditional on the instrumental variable and the\nconfounder, these monotonicity assumptions can be interpreted as the signs of\nthe arrows of the causal diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 06:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We give a\ncomputable single-letter characterization of control capacity for memoryless\nstationary scalar multiplicative actuation channels. Control capacity allows us\nto answer questions of stabilizability for scalar linear systems: a system with\nactuation uncertainty is stabilizable if and only if the control capacity is\nlarger than the log of the unstable open-loop eigenvalue.\n  For second-moment senses of stability, we recover the classic uncertainty\nthreshold principle result.

To reach such\ncoherence time, we apply a few thousands of dynamical decoupling pulses to\nsuppress the field fluctuation noise. A long-time quantum memory demonstrated\nin this experiment makes an important step for construction of the memory zone\nin scalable quantum computer architectures or for ion-trap-based quantum\nnetworks. With further improvement of the coherence time by techniques such as\nmagnetic field shielding and increase of the number of qubits in the quantum\nmemory, our demonstration also makes a basis for other applications including\nquantum money.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 07:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

Many different approaches\nfor specifying a set of distributions have been proposed. The choice matters,\nbecause it affects the results, and the relative performance of different\nchoices depend on the characteristics of the problems. In this paper, we\nconsider problems in which different random variables exhibit some form of\ndependence, but the exact values of the parameters that represent the\ndependence are not known. We consider various sets of distributions that\nincorporate the dependence structure, and we study the corresponding DRSO\nproblems.\n  In the first part of the paper, we consider problems with linear dependence\nbetween random variables. We consider sets of distributions that are within a\nspecified Wasserstein distance of a nominal distribution, and that satisfy a\nsecond-order moment constraint. We obtain a tractable dual reformulation of the\ncorresponding DRSO problem. This approach is compared with the traditional\nmoment-based DRSO and Wasserstein-based DRSO with no moment constraints.\nNumerical experiments suggest that our new formulation has superior\nout-of-sample performance.\n  In the second part of the paper, we consider problems with various types of\nrank dependence between random variables, including rank dependence measured by\nSpearman's footrule distance between empirical rankings, comonotonic\ndistributions, box uncertainty for individual observations, and Wasserstein\ndistance between copulas associated with continuous distributions. We also\nobtain a dual reformulation of the DRSO problem. A desirable byproduct of the\nformulation is that it also avoids an issue associated with the one-sided\nmoment constraints in moment-based DRSO problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 08:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We aim at gaining information on the physical structure of the\ninterstellar medium from a statistical analysis of many lines from different\nspecies over a large field of view, without requiring detailed radiative\ntransfer or astrochemical modeling. Methods. We coupled a nonlinear rescaling\nof the data with one of the simplest multivariate analysis methods, namely the\nPrincipal Component Analysis, to decompose the observed signal into components\nthat we interpret first qualitatively and then quantitatively based on our deep\nknowledge of the observed region and of the astrochemistry at play.

With respect to journey times in particular, we show how\nexperienced taxi drivers, in the majority of the cases, are able to navigate\nfaster to a destination compared to drivers who rely on modern navigation\nsystems.

In this paper, we propose that the\n$\\Gamma-\\Re$ correlation can be explained within the framework of the\ncondensation of the hot corona onto the cold accretion disc around a\nsupermassive black hole. In the model, it is presumed that, initially, a\nvertically extended hot gas (corona) is supplied to the central supermassive\nblack hole by capturing the interstellar medium and stellar wind. In this\nscenario, when the initial mass accretion rate $\\dot M/ \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}\n\\gtrsim 0.01$, at a critical radius $r_{\\rm d}$, part of the hot gas begins to\ncondense onto the equatorial disc plane of the black hole, forming an inner\ncold accretion disc. Then the matter is accreted in the form of the disc-corona\nstructure extending down to the innermost stable circular orbits of the black\nhole. The size of the inner disc is determined by the initial mass accretion\nrate. With the increase of the initial mass accretion rate, the size of the\ninner disc increases, which results in both the increase of the Compton\nreflection scaling factor $\\Re$ and the increase of the hard X-ray photon index\n$\\Gamma$. By comparing with a sample of Seyfert galaxies with well-fitted X-ray\nspectra, it is found that our model can roughly explain the observations.\nFinally, we discuss the possibility to apply our model to high mass X-ray\nbinaries, which are believed to be fueled by the hot wind from the companion\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 09:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

The CNN can train the model in a\nreasonable time and, thus, is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 11:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 10:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 00:55:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 06:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

As observed in a\nnumber of papers, samplers based on nonreversible diffusion processes can\nsignificantly outperform their reversible counterparts both in terms of\nasymptotic variance and rate of convergence to equilibrium. In this paper, we\ntake advantage of this in order to construct efficient sampling algorithms\nbased on the Lie-Trotter decomposition of a nonreversible diffusion process\ninto reversible and nonreversible components. We show that samplers based on\nthis scheme can significantly outperform standard MCMC methods, at the cost of\nintroducing some controlled bias. In particular, we prove that numerical\nintegrators constructed according to this decomposition are geometrically\nergodic and characterise fully their asymptotic bias and variance, showing that\nthe sampler inherits the good mixing properties of the underlying nonreversible\ndiffusion. This is illustrated further with a number of numerical examples\nranging from highly correlated low dimensional distributions, to logistic\nregression problems in high dimensions as well as inference for spatial models\nwith many latent variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 11:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

With this rapid urban\npopulation growth, city infrastructure is facing major problems, from the need\nto scale urban systems to sustaining the quality of services for citizen at\nscale. Understanding the dynamics of cities is critical towards informed\nstrategic urban planning. This paper showcases QuantifiedCity, a system aimed\nat understanding the complex dynamics taking place in cities. Often, these\ndynamics involve humans, services, and infrastructures and are observed in\ndifferent spaces: physical (IoT-based) sensing and human (social-based)\nsensing. The main challenges the system strives to address are related to data\nintegration and fusion to enable an effective and semantically relevant data\ngrouping. This is achieved by considering the spatio-temporal space as a\nblocking function for any data generated in the city. Our system consists of\nthree layer for data acquisition, data analysis, and data visualization; each\nof which embeds a variety of modules to better achieve its purpose (e.g., data\ncrawling, data cleaning, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity\nrecognition, event detection, time series analysis, etc.) End users can browse\nthe dynamics through three main dimensions: location, time, and event. For each\ndimension, the system renders a set of map-centric widgets that summarize the\nunderlying related dynamics. This paper highlights the need for such a holistic\nplatform, identifies the strengths of the \"Quantified City\" concept, and\nshowcases a working demo through a real-life scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 11:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-12"}

Armed with\ntwo new types of primitives, namely Poisson curves and Poisson regions, PVG can\neasily produce photorealistic effects such as specular highlights, core\nshadows, translucency and halos. Within the PVG framework, users specify color\nas the Dirichlet boundary condition of diffusion curves and control tone by\noffsetting the Laplacian, where both controls are simply done by mouse click\nand slider dragging. The separation of color and tone not only follows the\nbasic drawing principle that is widely adopted by professional artists, but\nalso brings three unique features to PVG, i.e., local hue change, ease of\nextrema control, and permit of intersection among geometric primitives, making\nPVG an ideal authoring tool.\n  To render PVG, we develop an efficient method to solve 2D Poisson's equations\nwith piecewise constant Laplacians. In contrast to the conventional finite\nelement method that computes numerical solutions only, our method expresses the\nsolution using harmonic B-spline, whose basis functions can be constructed\nlocally and the control coefficients are obtained by solving a small sparse\nlinear system. Our closed-form solver is numerically stable and it supports\nrandom access evaluation, zooming-in of arbitrary resolution and anti-aliasing.\nAlthough the harmonic B-spline based solutions are approximate, computational\nresults show that the relative mean error is less than 0.3%, which cannot be\ndistinguished by naked eyes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 14:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

Thus,\nfurther mechanisms are needed to explain the amplitudes of the forced\nlibrations - e.g. moonlet-ring interactions. Here, we develop a model, where\nthe moonlet is allowed to be slightly displaced with respect to its created\ngaps, resulting in a breaking point-symmetry and in a repulsive force. As a\nresult, the evolution of the moonlet's longitude can be described by a harmonic\noscillator. In the presence of external forcings by the outer moons, the\nlibration amplitude gets the more amplified, the more the forcing frequency\ngets close to the eigenfrequency of the disturbed propeller oscillator.\nApplying our model to Bl\\'eriot, it is possible to reproduce a libration period\nof 13 years with an amplitude of about 2000 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 14:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The strange quark mass is tuned to its\nphysical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$\nand $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$\nMeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV. We provide a parametrization of basic thermodynamic quantities that\ncan be readily used in hydrodynamic simulation codes. The results on up to\nsixth order expansion coefficients of bulk thermodynamics are used for the\ncalculation of lines of constant pressure, energy and entropy densities in the\n$T$-$\\mu_B$ plane and are compared with the crossover line for the QCD chiral\ntransition as well as with experimental results on freeze-out parameters in\nheavy ion collisions. These coefficients also provide estimates for the\nlocation of a possible critical point. We argue that results on sixth order\nexpansion coefficients disfavor the existence of a critical point in the QCD\nphase diagram for $\\mu_B/T\\le 2$ and $T/T_c(\\mu_B=0) > 0.9$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 15:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 12:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 17:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

Methods. We used\nVLTI/MIDI interferometric observations, in combination with spectro-photometric\ndata, and compared them with self-consistent dynamic models atmospheres.\nResults: The models can reproduce SED data well at wavelengths longwards of\n1{\\mu}m, and the interferometric observations between 8{\\mu}m and 10{\\mu}m.\nDiscrepancies could be due to a combination of data- and model-related effects.\nThe models best fitting the Miras are significantly extended, with a prominent\nshell-like structure, while the models best fitting the non-Miras are more\ncompact, showing lower average mass-loss. The mass loss is of episodic or\nmulti-periodic nature, but causes the visual amplitudes to be notably larger\nthan the observed ones.

We define a new macroscopic reduction for networks of\ncoupled oscillators motivated by an elegant structure we find in experimental\nmeasurements of circadian gene expression and several mathematical models for\ncoupled biological oscillators. We characterize the emergence of this structure\nthrough a simple argument and demonstrate its applicability to stochastic and\nheterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. Finally, we perform the\nmacroscopic reduction for the heterogeneous stochastic Kuramoto equation and\ncompare the low-dimensional macroscopic model with numerical results from the\nhigh-dimensional microscopic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 13:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

In general an operational DS\ncomprises a series of standalone applications from which the mathematical\nmodeling and simulation of the distribution systems and the managing of the\nuncertainty in the decision-making process are essential in order to obtain\nefficient control and monitoring of the distribution systems. The mathematical\nmodeling and simulation forms the basis for detailed optimization of the\nnetwork operations and the second one uses uncertainty based reasoning in order\nto reduce the complexity of the network system and to increase the credibility\nof its model. This book reports on the integration of the two aspects of\noperational DS into a single computational framework of loop network equations.\nThe proposed DS system will be validated using case studies taken from the\nwater industry. The optimal control of water distribution systems is an\nimportant problem because the models are non-linear and large-scale and\nmeasurements are prone to errors and very often they are incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 15:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 13:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 23:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

The spatial power as a function of the spatial frequency from about\n0.04 to 0.27 (EIT) or up to 0.48 (AIA) 1/Mm depends on the distribution of the\nobserved segmentation-cell dimensions, -- a structure of the solar EUV network.\nThe temporal variations of the spatial power reported by Didkovsky and Gurman\n(Solar Phys., 289, 153) were suggested as decreases at the mid-spatial\nfrequencies for the compared spectra when the power curves at the highest\nspatial frequencies of 0.5 1/pix were adjusted to match each other. That\napproach has been extended in this work to compare spectral ratios at high\nspatial frequencies expressed in the solar spatial frequency units of 1/Mm.\nBased on this approach we represent these ratio changes as a long-term network\ntransformation which may be interpreted as a continuous dissipation of mid-size\nnetwork structures to the smaller-size structures in the transition region. In\ncontrast to expected cycling of the segmentation-cell dimension structures and\nassociated spatial power in the spectra with the solar cycle, the spectra\ndemonstrate a significant and steady change of the EUV network. The temporal\ntrend across these structural spectra is not critically sensitive to any\nlong-term instrumental changes, e.g. degradation of sensitivity, but to the\nchange of the segmentation-cell dimensions of the EUV network structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 01:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

In this model, computation is performed at\nthe edge of the network instead of sending vast amounts of data to the cloud.\nThus, fog computing provides low latency, location awareness to end users, and\nimproves quality-of-services (QoS). One key feature in this model is the\ndesigning of payment plan from network operator (NO) to fog nodes (FN) for the\nrental of their computing resources, such as computation capacity, spectrum,\nand transmission power. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to\ndesign the efficient payment plan to maximize the NO's revenue while\nmaintaining FN's incentive to cooperate through the moral hazard model in\ncontract theory. We propose a multi-dimensional contract which considers the\nFNs' characteristics such as location, computation capacity, storage,\ntransmission bandwidth, and etc. First, a contract which pays the FNs by\nevaluating the resources they have provided from multiple aspects is proposed.\nThen, the utility maximization problem of the NO is formulated. Furthermore, we\nuse the numerical results to analyze the optimal payment plan, and compare the\nNO's utility under different payment plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 19:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}
