Several factors such as the existence of punishment,\nfluctuations in finite systems, repeated interactions and the formation of\nprestige may all contribute to explain the counter-intuitive prevalence of\ncooperation in natural and social systems. The characteristics of the\ninteraction networks have been also signaled as an element favoring the\npersistence of cooperators. Here we consider the invasion dynamics of\ncooperative behaviors in complex topologies. The invasion of a heterogeneous\nnetwork fully occupied by defectors is performed starting from nodes with a\ngiven number of connections (degree) $k_0$. The system is then evolved within a\nPrisoner's Dilemma game and the outcome is analyzed as a function of $k_0$ and\nthe degree $k$ of the nodes adopting cooperation. Carried out using both\nnumerical and analytical approaches, our results show that the invasion\nproceeds following preferentially a hierarchical order in the nodes from those\nwith higher degree to those with lower degree. However, the invasion of\ncooperation will succeed only when the initial cooperators are numerous enough\nto form a cluster from which cooperation can spread. This implies that the\ninitial condition must be a suitable equilibrium between high degree and high\nnumerosity, which usually takes place, when possible, at intermediate values of\n$k_0$. These findings have potential applications, as they suggest that, in\norder to promote cooperative behavior on complex networks, one should infect\nwith cooperators \\emph{high but not too high} degree nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 16:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 12:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

Empirical parameters from similar systems allow for\naccurate predictions of the percolation thresholds (with deviations of $<5\\%$\nin our examples), but even without any empirical parameters, the explicit\napproximations from integral geometry provide, at least for the systems studied\nhere, lower bounds that capture well the qualitative dependence of the\npercolation threshold on the system parameters (with deviations of\n$5\\%$--$30\\%$). As an outlook, we suggest further candidates for explicit and\ngeometric approximations based on second moments of the so-called Minkowski\nfunctionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 17:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The\nreflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene-coated plates are\nexpressed in terms of the polarization tensor of gapped graphene and the\ndielectric permittivity of plate material. Simple approximate expressions for\nthe required combinations of components of the polarization tensor applicable\nin the wide frequency region, where the presence of a gap influences the\noptical properties, are found. Numerical computations of the reflectivities of\ngraphene-coated SiO${}_2$ plates are performed for different values of the\nmass-gap parameter at different temperatures. It is shown that with an\nincreasing gap width the reflectivity of a graphene-coated plate at the normal\nincidence decreases by up to a factor of 8 depending on the values of frequency\nand mass-gap parameter. The angle dependences of reflectivities for both\npolarizations of the incident electromagnetic waves have been computed for Si\nand SiO${}_2$ plates coated with gapped graphene. We demonstrate that the TM\nreflectivity has a minimum value at some angle of incidence depending on the\nmass-gap parameter, frequency and temperature, whereas the TE reflectivity\ndepends on the angle of incidence monotonously. However, for the graphene\ncoatings with a nonzero mass-gap parameter the reflected light cannot be fully\npolarized. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 17:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

The\npopulation is thus a mixture of two subpopulations: the one of cured subjects,\nand the one of `susceptible' subjects. When covariates are present, a so-called\nmixture cure model can be used to model the conditional survival function of\nthe population. It depends on two components: the probability of being cured\nand the conditional survival function of the susceptible subjects. In this\npaper we propose a novel approach to estimate a mixture cure model when the\ndata are subject to random right censoring. We work with a parametric model for\nthe cure proportion (like e.g. a logistic model), while the conditional\nsurvival function of the uncured subjects is unspecified. The approach is based\non an inversion which allows to write the survival function as a function of\nthe distribution of the observable random variables. This leads to a very\ngeneral class of models, which allows a flexible and rich modeling of the\nconditional survival function. We show the identifiability of the proposed\nmodel, as well as the weak consistency and the asymptotic normality of the\nmodel parameters. We also consider in more detail the case where kernel\nestimators are used for the nonparametric part of the model. The new estimators\nare compared with the estimators from a Cox mixture cure model via finite\nsample simulations. Finally, we apply the new model and estimation procedure on\ntwo medical data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 18:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

Photons are a promising candidate for encoding qubits but assembling\na photonic entangled cluster with linear optical elements relies on\nprobabilistic operations. Given a supply of $n$-photon-entangled microclusters,\nusing a linear optical circuit and photon detectors, one can assemble a random\nentangled state of photons that can be subsequently \"renormalized\" into a\nlogical cluster for universal quantum computing. In this paper, we prove that\nthere is a fundamental tradeoff between $n$ and the minimum success probability\n$\\lambda_c^{(n)}$ that each two-photon linear-optical fusion operation must\nhave, in order to guarantee that the resulting state can be renormalized:\n$\\lambda_c^{(n)} \\ge 1/(n-1)$.

We develop such a framework using the black-hole X-ray binary GX\n339-4 as a touchstone source, and we demonstrate three important ramifications:\n(1) Compton scattering of reflection emission in the corona is routinely\nignored, but is an essential consideration given that reflection is linked to\nthe regimes with strongest Comptonization. Properly accounting for this causes\nthe inferred reflection fraction to increase substantially, especially for the\nhard state. Another important impact of the Comptonization of reflection\nemission by the corona is the downscattered tail. Downscattering has the\npotential to mimic the relativistically-broadened red wing of the Fe line\nassociated with a spinning black hole. (2) Recent evidence for a reflection\ncomponent with a harder spectral index than the power-law continuum is\nnaturally explained as Compton-scattered reflection emission. (3) Photon\nconservation provides an important constraint on the hard state's accretion\nrate. For bright hard states, we show that disk truncation to large scales (R\nmuch larger than the ISCO radius) is unlikely as this would require accretion\nrates far in excess of the brightest soft states. Our principal conclusion is\nthat when modeling relativistically-broadened reflection, spectral models\nshould allow for coronal Compton scattering of the reflection features, and\nwhen possible, take advantage of the additional constraining power from linking\nto the thermal disk component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 18:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

One of the earliest steps in\nusing QUS methods is contouring a region of interest (ROI) inside the tumour in\nultrasound B-mode images. While manual segmentation is a very time-consuming\nand tedious task for human experts, auto-contouring is also an extremely\ndifficult task for computers due to the poor quality of ultrasound B-mode\nimages. However, for the purpose of cancer response prediction, a rough\nboundary of the tumour as an ROI is only needed. In this research, a\nsemi-automated tumour localization approach is proposed for ROI estimation in\nultrasound B-mode images acquired from patients with locally advanced breast\ncancer (LABC). The proposed approach comprised several modules, including 1)\nfeature extraction using keypoint descriptors, 2) augmenting the feature\ndescriptors with the distance of the keypoints to the user-input pixel as the\ncentre of the tumour, 3) supervised learning using a support vector machine\n(SVM) to classify keypoints as \"tumour\" or \"non-tumour\", and 4) computation of\nan ellipse as an outline of the ROI representing the tumour.

Monitoring observations\nmay give a biassed view of the underlying population due to limitations on\nobserving time, visibility and instrumental sensitivity. A similar problem\nexists in the life sciences, where animal populations (such as migratory birds)\nor disease prevalence, must be estimated from sparse and incomplete data. The\nclass of methods termed Capture-Recapture is used to reconstruct population\nestimates from time-series records of encounters with the study population.\nThis paper investigates the performance of Capture-Recapture methods in\nastronomy via a series of numerical simulations. The Blackbirds code simulates\nmonitoring of populations of transients, in this case accreting binary stars\n(neutron star or black hole accreting from a stellar companion) under a range\nof observing strategies. We first generate realistic light-curves for\npopulations of binaries with contrasting orbital period distributions. These\nmodels are then randomly sampled at observing cadences typical of existing and\nplanned monitoring surveys. The classical capture-recapture methods,\nLincoln-Peterson, Schnabel estimators, related techniques, and newer methods\nimplemented in the Rcapture package are compared. A general exponential model\nbased on the radioactive decay law is introduced, and demonstrated to recover\n(at 95% confidence) the underlying population abundance and duty cycle, in a\nfraction of the observing visits (10-50%) required to discover all the sources\nin the simulation. Capture-Recapture is a promising addition to the toolbox of\ntime domain astronomy, and methods implemented in R by the biostats community\ncan be readily called from within Python.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 19:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Contrary to previous\nwork, we analyse the stellar density in well-defined magnitude ranges in order\nto be able to constrain stellar masses and ages. The RC and brighter giant\nstars display a core-like surface density profile within a projected radius\nR<0.3 pc of the central black hole, in agreement with previous studies, but\nshow a cusp-like surface density distribution at larger R. The surface density\nof the fainter stars can be described well by a single power-law at R<2 pc. The\ncusp-like profile of the faint stars persists even if we take into account the\npossible contamination of stars in this brightness range by young pre-main\nsequence stars. The data are inconsistent with a core-profile for the faint\nstars.Finally, we show that a 3D Nuker law provides a very good description of\nthe cluster structure. We conclude that the observed stellar density at the\nGalactic Centre, as it can be inferred with current instruments, is consistent\nwith the existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole,\nSgr A*. This cusp is well developed inside the influence radius of about 3 pc\nof Sgr A* and can be described by a single three-dimensional power-law with an\nexponent gamma=1.23+-0.05. The apparent lack of RC stars and brighter giants at\nprojected distances of R < 0.3 pc (R<8\") of the massive black hole may indicate\nthat some mechanism has altered their distribution or intrinsic luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 19:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 10:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The capacity loss due to this switching\noverhead can be significant in many emerging applications, and needs to be\nexplicitly addressed in the design of scheduling policies. For example, in\n60GHz wireless networks with directional antennas, base stations need to train\nand reconfigure their beam patterns whenever they switch from one client to\nanother. Considerable switching overhead can also be observed in many other\nqueueing systems such as transportation networks and manufacturing systems.\nWhile the celebrated Max-Weight policy achieves asymptotically optimal average\ndelay for systems without switching overhead, it fails to preserve\nthroughput-optimality, let alone delay-optimality, when switching overhead is\ntaken into account.

This dismisses any hope for a\nresult showing that finitely forcible graphons possess a simple structure, and\nis surprising when contrasted with the fact that finitely forcible graphons\nform a meager set in the space of all graphons. In addition, since any finitely\nforcible graphon represents the unique minimizer of some linear combination of\ndensities of subgraphs, our result also shows that such minimization problems,\nwhich conceptually are among the simplest kind within extremal graph theory,\nmay in fact have unique optimal solutions with arbitrarily complex structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 22:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2017 00:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2017 21:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 21:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 08:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

The length of\nthis chain scales linearly with the number of time-steps as the same network is\nrun at each time-step. This creates many problems, such as vanishing gradients,\nthat have been well studied. In contrast, a NNEM's architecture recurrent\nactivity doesn't involve a long chain of activity (though some architectures\nsuch as the NTM do utilize a traditional recurrent architecture as a\ncontroller). Rather, the externally stored embedding vectors are used at each\ntime-step, but no messages are passed from previous time-steps. This means that\nvanishing gradients aren't a problem, as all of the necessary gradient paths\nare short. However, these paths are extremely numerous (one per embedding\nvector in memory) and reused for a very long time (until it leaves the memory).\nThus, the forward-pass information of each memory must be stored for the entire\nduration of the memory. This is problematic as this additional storage far\nsurpasses that of the actual memories, to the extent that large memories on\ninfeasible to back-propagate through in high dimensional settings. One way to\nget around the need to hold onto forward-pass information is to recalculate the\nforward-pass whenever gradient information is available.

Instead, we rely on a learned\nautoencoder to reinstate the observation, and then use the embedding network to\nrecalculate the forward-pass.

The position of this article is that only by\naligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we\nstand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI).

We may\nposit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of\nits environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this\nagent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative\nenvironments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment\nas being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is\nobviously irrelevant.

The proposed scheme estimates the\ndelay and Doppler parameters sequentially, in which the delay estimation is\nformulated into a beamspace direction-of- arrival problem and the Doppler\nestimation is translated into a line spectrum estimation problem. Then the\nwell-known spatial and temporal spectrum estimation techniques are used to\nprovide efficient and high-resolution estimates of the delay and Doppler\nparameters. In addition, sufficient conditions on the AIC to guarantee the\nsuccessful estimation of off-grid targets are provided, while the existing\nconditions are mostly related to the on-grid targets.

How to\nallocate the limited computing resources of fog nodes (FNs) to all the DSSs to\nachieve an optimal and stable performance is an important problem.
