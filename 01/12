Then we investigate their analytical\nrelationships in the advertising domain through experiments based on real data\nfrom a Traffic Office.

The model involves a parabolic on-site\npotential with asymmetric rigid constraints (the displacement domain of each\nparticle is finite), and a linear nearest-neighbor coupling. When the particle\napproaches the constraint, it undergoes an impact (not necessarily elastic),\nthat satisfies Newton impact law. Nonlinearity of the system stems from the\nimpacts; their possible non-elasticity is the sole source of damping in the\nsystem. We demonstrate that this vibro-impact model allows derivation of exact\nanalytic solutions for the asymmetric discrete breathers, both in conservative\nand forced-damped settings. The asymmetry makes two types of breathers\npossible: breathers that impact both or only one constraint. Transition between\nthese two types of the breathers corresponds to a grazing bifurcation. Special\ncharacter of the nonlinearity permits explicit derivation of a monodromy\nmatrix. Therefore, the stability of the obtained breather solutions can be\nexactly studied in the framework of simple methods of linear algebra, and with\nrather moderate computational efforts. All three generic scenarios of the loss\nof stability (pitchfork, Neimark-Sacker and period doubling bifurcations) are\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 16:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

In this work the numerical\ndesign of continuous double freeform surfaces from ray mapping methods for\ncollimated beam shaping with arbitrary irradiances is considered. These methods\nconsist of the calculation of a proper ray mapping between the source and the\ntarget irradiance and the subsequent construction of the freeform surfaces. By\ncombining the law of refraction, the constant optical path length and the\nsurface continuity condition, a partial differential equation (PDE) for the ray\nmapping is derived. It is shown that the PDE can be fulfilled in a small-angle\napproximation by a mapping derived from optimal mass transport with a quadratic\ncost function. To overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime we use this\nmapping as an initial iterate for the simultaneous solution of the Jacobian\nequation and the ray mapping PDE by an optimization. The presented approach\nenables the efficient calculation of compact double freeform surfaces for\ncomplex target irradiances. This is demonstrated by applying it to the design\nof a single-lens and a two-lens system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 17:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

To\nthat end, we develop a physics-based continuum model for strain localization in\nsheared granular materials.

Lower\npressures, higher loading rates and higher dilatancy favor a brittle response\nand larger strength drops.

Here, we\ndemonstrate that anisotropic all-dielectric metamaterials open a new degree of\nfreedom in total internal reflection to shorten the decay length of evanescent\nwaves. We experimentally show the reduction of cross-talk by greater than 30\ntimes and the bending loss by greater than 3 times in densely integrated,\nultra-compact photonic circuit blocks. Our prototype all-dielectric\nmetamaterial-waveguide achieves a low propagation loss of approximately 3.7\ndB/cm, comparable to those of silicon strip waveguides. Our approach marks a\ndeparture from interference-based confinement as in photonic crystals or slot\nwaveguides, which utilize nanoscale field enhancement. Its ability to suppress\nevanescent waves without substantially increasing the propagation loss shall\npave the way for all-dielectric metamaterial-based dense integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 18:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 22:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 19:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

When brought together in heterostructure geometries,\nthey show particular promise for spintronics and colossal magnetoresistance\napplications. In this letter, we propose a new mechanism for the coupling\nbetween layers of itinerant ferromagnetic materials in heterostructures. The\ncoupling is mediated by charge carriers that strive to maximally delocalize\nthrough the heterostructure to gain kinetic energy. In doing so, they force a\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling between the constituent layers. To\nillustrate this, we focus on heterostructures composed of SrRuO$_3$ and\nLa$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$ (A=Ca/Sr). Our mechanism is consistent with\nantiferromagnetic alignment that is known to occur in multilayers of\nSrRuO$_3$-La$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$. To support our assertion, we present a\nminimal Kondo-lattice model which reproduces the known magnetization properties\nof such multilayers. In addition, we discuss a quantum well model for\nheterostructures and argue that the spin-dependent density of states determines\nthe nature of the coupling. As a smoking gun signature, we propose that\nbilayers with the same constituents will oscillate between ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic coupling upon tuning the relative thicknesses of the layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 19:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Despite\nbeing well-studied theoretically, systems with high discrete symmetry breakings\nare uncommon in nature and, thus, Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ provides an experimental\nplayground for the study of broken $Z_n$ symmetry, for $n>2$. A recent\ntheoretical work examined the effect of a magnetic field on a pyrochlore\nlattice with broken $Z_6$ symmetry and applied it to Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. This\nstudy predicted multiple domain transitions depending on the crystallographic\norientation of the magnetic field, inducing rich and controllable\nmagnetothermodynamic behavior. In this work, we present neutron scattering\nmeasurements on Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with a magnetic field applied along the [001]\nand [111] directions, and provide the first experimental observation of these\nexotic domain transitions. In a [001] field, we observe a $\\psi_2$ to $\\psi_3$\ntransition at a critical field of 0.18$\\pm$0.05T. We are thus able to extend\nthe concept of the spin-flop transition, which has long been observed in Ising\nsystems, to higher discrete $Z_n$ symmetries. In a [111] field, we observe a\nseries of domain-based phase transitions for fields of 0.15$\\pm$0.03T and\n0.40$\\pm$0.03T. We show that these field-induced transitions are consistent\nwith the emergence of two-fold, three-fold and possibly six-fold Zeeman terms.\nConsidering all the possible $\\psi_2$ and $\\psi_3$ domains, these Zeeman terms\ncan be mapped onto an analog clock - exemplifying a literal clock anisotropy.\nLastly, our quantitative analysis of the [001] domain transition in\nEr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is consistent with order-by-disorder as the dominant ground\nstate selection mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 19:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

We establish a series of network capacity\ncharacterizations for these three fundamental types of network control laws.\nFirst of all, we prove that for global-knowledge/global-decision and\nnetwork-flow/local-decision control where nodes know the information flow\nacross the entire network, there exists a critical number\n$\\big(3/2+\\sqrt{2}\\big)/\\|A_{\\mathrm{G}}\\|_\\infty$, where $3/2+\\sqrt{2}$ is as\nknown as the Xie-Guo constant and $A_{\\mathrm{G}}$ is the network adjacency\nmatrix, defining exactly how much uncertainty in the node dynamics can be\novercome by feedback. Interestingly enough, the same feedback capacity can be\nachieved under max-consensus enhanced local flows where nodes only observe\ninformation flows from neighbors as well as extreme (max and min) states in the\nnetwork. Next, for local-flow/local-decision control, we prove that there\nexists a structure-determined value being a lower bound of the network feedback\ncapacity. These results reveal the important connection between network\nstructure and fundamental capabilities of in-network feedback control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 23:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 16:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

In this\npaper, we introduce and study the Fleming-Viot process in random environment\n(FVRE), when by random environment we mean the fitness of types is a stochastic\nprocess with c\\`adl\\`ag paths. We identify FVRE as the unique solution to a so\ncalled quenched martingale problem and derive some of its properties via\nmartingale and duality methods. We develop the duality methods for general\ntime-inhomogeneous and quenched martingale problems. In fact, some important\naspects of the duality relations only appears for time-inhomogeneous (and\nquenched) martingale problems. For example, we see that duals evolve backward\nin time with respect to the main Markov process whose evolution is forward in\ntime.

The methodology requires a training set of parameter instances at\nwhich the time-dependent surrogate-model error is computed by simulating both\nthe high-fidelity and surrogate models. Using these training data, the method\nfirst determines regression-model locality (via classification or clustering),\nand subsequently constructs a `local' regression model to predict the\ntime-instantaneous error within each identified region of feature space. We\nconsider two uses for the resulting error model: (1) as a correction to the\nsurrogate-model QoI prediction at each time instance, and (2) as a way to\nstatistically model arbitrary functions of the time-dependent surrogate-model\nerror (e.g., time-integrated errors). We apply the proposed framework to model\nerrors in reduced-order models of nonlinear oil--water subsurface flow\nsimulations. The reduced-order models used in this work entail application of\ntrajectory piecewise linearization with proper orthogonal decomposition. When\nthe first use of the method is considered, numerical experiments demonstrate\nconsistent improvement in accuracy in the time-instantaneous QoI prediction\nrelative to the original surrogate model, across a large number of test cases.\nWhen the second use is considered, results show that the proposed method\nprovides accurate statistical predictions of the time- and well-averaged\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 05:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 19:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Over-stretching a music piece will make it uncomfortable\nfor human psychoacoustic hearing. The research on music stretching resistance\nattempts to estimate the maximum stretchability of music pieces to further\navoid over-stretch. It has been observed that musical genres can significantly\nimprove the accuracy of automatic estimation of music stretching resistance,\nbut how musical genres are related to music stretching resistance has never\nbeen explained or studied in detail in the literature. In this paper, the\ncharacteristics of music stretching resistance are compared across different\nmusical genres. It is found that music stretching resistance has strong\nintra-genre cohesiveness and inter-genre discrepancies in the experiments.\nMoreover, the ambiguity and the symmetry of music stretching resistance are\nalso observed in the experimental analysis. These findings lead to a new\nmeasurement on the similarity between different musical genres based on their\nmusic stretching resistance. In addition, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) also\nsupports the findings in this paper by verifying the significance of musical\ngenre in shaping music stretching resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 09:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

However, in the context of reactive power compensation,\nmost existing studies assume that customers can assess their compensation\nvalue, i.e., Var unit, objectively. In this paper, customers are assumed to\nmake decisions that pertain to reactive power coordination. In consequence, the\nway in which those customers evaluate the compensation value resulting from\ntheir individual decisions will impact the overall grid performance. In\nparticular, a behavioral framework, based on the framing effect of prospect\ntheory (PT), is developed to study the effect of both objective value and\nsubjective evaluation in a reactive power compensation game. For example, such\neffect allows customers to optimize a subjective value of their utility which\nessentially frames the objective utility with respect to a reference point.\nThis game enables customers to coordinate the use of their electrical devices\nto compensate reactive power. For the proposed game, both the objective case\nusing expected utility theory (EUT) and the PT consideration are solved via a\nlearning algorithm that converges to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In\naddition, several key properties of this game are derived analytically.\nSimulation results show that, under PT, customers are likely to make decisions\nthat differ from those predicted by classical models. For instance, using an\nillustrative two-customer case, we show that a PT customer will increase the\nconservative strategy (achieving a high power factor) by 29% compared to a\nconventional customer. Similar insights are also observed for a case with three\ncustomers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 13:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

Since the squeezed-limit bispectrum encodes the impact of a\nlarge-scale fluctuation on the small-scale power spectrum, it can be understood\nas how the small-scale power spectrum \"responds\" to the large-scale\nfluctuation. Viewed in this way, the squeezed-limit bispectrum can be\ncalculated using the response approach even in the cases which do not submit to\nperturbative treatment. To illustrate this point, we apply this approach to the\ncross-correlation between the large-scale quasar density field and small-scale\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. In particular, using separate\nuniverse simulations which implement changes in the large-scale density,\nvelocity gradient, and primordial power spectrum amplitude, we measure how the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum responds to the local,\nlong-wavelength quasar overdensity, and equivalently their squeezed-limit\nbispectrum.

The security\nof the communication link is enhanced through cooperative jamming, with the\nhelp of multiple jammers. First, a feasibility condition is derived to achieve\na positive secrecy rate at the destination. Then, we solve the original secrecy\nrate maximization problem, which is not convex in terms of power allocation at\nthe jammers. To circumvent this non-convexity, the achievable secrecy rate is\napproximated for a given power allocation at the jammers and the approximated\nproblem is formulated into a geometric programming one. Based on this\napproximation, an iterative algorithm has been developed to obtain the optimal\npower allocation at the jammers. Next, we provide a bisection approach, based\non one-dimensional search, to validate the optimality of the proposed\nalgorithm. In addition, by assuming Rayleigh fading, the secrecy outage\nprobability (SOP) of the proposed cooperative jamming scheme is analyzed. More\nspecifically, a single-integral form expression for SOP is derived for the most\ngeneral case as well as a closed-form expression for the special case of two\ncooperative jammers and one eavesdropper.

We\nfirst construct a gyroscopic lattice with analytically solvable edge modes, and\nshow how the Lorentz and spring restoring forces conspire to support very\nrobust \"dangling bond\" boundary modes. The chirality and locality of these\nmodes intuitively emerges from microscopic balancing of restoring forces and\ncyclotron tendencies.

Through appropriate synchronization of the AC\ndriving protocol, the Floquet lattice is \"pushed around\" by a rotating\npotential analogous to an object washed ashore by water waves.

In this\npaper, we exploit a control-oriented nonlinear model comparable to MBM to\ndesign an FTC framework with a generalized internal model control (GIMC)\napproach. A fault detector and isolator (FDI) is developed to identify\npotential actuator and sensor faults. A fault compensator is employed to\ncompensate these faults if detected. Comprehensive simulations are carried out\nto evaluate the developed FTC framework with promising results.

However, this raises several security concerns when the relays are\nuntrusted since they may have access to the relayed message. In this paper, we\nstudy the achievable secrecy diversity order of cooperative networks with\nuntrusted relays. In particular, we consider a network with an N-antenna\ntransmitter (Alice), K single-antenna relays, and a single-antenna destination\n(Bob). We consider the general scenario where there is no relation between N\nand K, and therefore K can be larger than N. Alice and Bob are assumed to be\nfar away from each other, and all communication is done through the relays,\ni.e., there is no direct link. Providing secure communication while enhancing\nthe diversity order has been shown to be very challenging. In fact, it has been\nshown in the literature that the maximum achievable secrecy diversity order for\nthe adopted system model is one (while using artificial noise jamming). In this\npaper, we adopt a nonlinear interference alignment scheme that we have proposed\nrecently to transmit the signals from Alice to Bob. We analyze the proposed\nscheme in terms of the achievable secrecy rate and secrecy diversity order.\nAssuming Gaussian inputs, we derive an explicit expression for the achievable\nsecrecy rate and show analytically that a secrecy diversity order of up to\nmin(N,K)-1 can be achieved using the proposed technique. We provide several\nnumerical examples to validate the obtained analytical results and demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed technique to its counterparts that exist in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 10:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

A group of experiments were\ndemonstrated against Wiener's experiments under the condition that the\ninterference fringes made by optical standing waves could have been\ndistinguished from the fringes of equal thickness between the inner surface of\nemulsion and the plane mirror used to build the optical standing waves. It was\nfound that the Bragg diffraction from the interference fringes formed by the\nstanding waves did not exist. This means optical standing waves did not blacken\nthe photographic emulsion, or the electric field did not play such a dominant\nrole. Therefore, instead of the electric-field energy density solely in\nproportion to the electric-field square, Energy Flux in Interference was\nproposed to represent the intensity of optical interference-field and approved\nin the derivation of equations for the interference. The derived equations\nindicate that both the electric-field vector and the magnetic-field vector are\nin phase and have equal amount of energy densities at the interference maxima\nof two light beams. Thus, the magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the\nelectric-field vector on light interacting with substance. The fundamental\nfactor of optical interference is electromagnetic energy flux densities rather\nthan electric-field alone, or the intensity of optical interference fringes\nshould be the energy flux density, not electric-field energy density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 11:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

The initial tightly bound excitonic electron-hole\npair has to dissociate fast enough in order to avoid photocurrent generation\nand thus power conversion efficiency loss via geminate recombination. Such\nprocess takes place assisted by transitional states that lie between the\ninitial exciton and the free charge state. Due to spin conservation rules these\nintermediate charge transfer states typically have singlet character. Here we\npropose a donor-acceptor model for a generic organic photovoltaic cell in which\nthe process of charge separation is modulated by a magnetic field which tunes\nthe energy levels. The impact of a magnetic field is to intensify the\ngeneration of charge transfer states with triplet character via inter-system\ncrossing. As the ground state of the system has singlet character, triplet\nstates are recombination-protected, thus leading to a higher probability of\nsuccessful charge separation. Using the open quantum systems formalism we\ndemonstrate that not only the population of triplet charge transfer states\ngrows in the presence of a magnetic field, but also how the power outcome of an\norganic photovoltaic cell is in that way increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 12:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}
