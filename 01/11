Questions were\noriginally represented by subsets of variables. Pieces of information were then\nrepresented by valuations associated with the domains of variables. This leads\nto an algebraic structure called valuation algebras. The basic axiomatics of\nthis algebraic structure was in essence proposed by Shenoy and Shafer. Here a\nmuch more general view of systems of questions is proposed and pieces of\ninformation are related to the elements of this system of questions. This leads\nto a new and extended system of axioms for information algebras. Classical\nvaluation algebras are essentially a special case of this new system. A full\ndiscussion of the algebraic theory of this new information algebras is given,\nincluding local computation, duality between labeled and domain-free versions\nof the algebras, order of information, finiteness of information and\napproximation, compact and continuous information algebras. Finally a rather\ncomplete discussion of uncertain information, based on random maps into\ninformation algebras is presented.

In the present contribution, the\ninfluence of the longitudinal channel inclination angle on gravity-driven\nturbulent bedload transport is studied in an idealised framework considering\nsteady and uniform flow conditions. From an analytical analysis based on the\ntwo-phase continuous equations, it is shown that : (i) the classical slope\ncorrection of the critical Shields number is based on an erroneous formulation\nof the buoyancy force, (ii) the influence of the slope is not restricted to the\ncritical Shields number but affects the whole transport formula and (iii)\npressure-driven and gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport are not\nequivalent from the slope influence standpoint. Analysing further the granular\nflow driving mechanisms, the longitudinal slope is shown to not only influence\nthe fluid bed shear stress and the resistance of the granular bed, but also to\naffect the fluid flow inside the granular bed - responsible for the transition\nfrom bedload transport to debris flow. The relative influence of these coupled\nmechanisms allows us to understand the evolution of the vertical structure of\nthe granular flow and to predict the transport rate scaling law as a function\nof a rescaled Shields number. The theoretical analysis is validated with\ncoupled fluid-discrete element simulations of idealised gravity-driven\nturbulent bedload transport, performed over a wide range of Shields number\nvalues, density ratios and channel inclination angles. In particular, all the\ndata are shown to collapse onto a master curve when considering the sediment\ntransport rate as a function of the proposed rescaled Shields number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 10:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

In the proposed\narchitecture, live TV content is injected into the network at a few residential\nlocations using satellite dishes.

Fast Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis\nhave been performed and the mean frequency, rms amplitude, and coherence of the\nQPOs are derived; a detailed inspection of individual pulses has also been\nperformed. The observations confirm the probable ubiquity of the QPOs for this\nsource at all epochs when the source is in a high state, with observed mean\namplitude of 2.1 percent (r'), 1.5 percent (He II), and 0.6 percent (u').\nTrains of oscillations are clearly observed in the r' light curve and can be\nmimicked by a superposition of damped sinusoids with various parameters.

By inspecting and running the malicious program, one may gain\ninsight into the potential reasons for non-termination and produce\ncounterexamples for termination.\n  We introduce our method using the concurrent programming language Constraint\nHandling Rules (CHR). Like in other declarative languages, non-termination\noccurs through unbounded recursion. Given a self-recursive rule, we\nautomatically generate one or more devil's rules from it. The construction of\nthe devil's rules is straightforward and involves no guessing. The devil's\nrules can be simple. For example, they are non-recursive for rules with single\nrecursion.\n  We show that the devil's rules are maximally vicious in the following sense:\nFor any program that contains the self-recursive rule and for any infinite\ncomputation through that rule in that program, there is a corresponding\ninfinite computation with the recursive rule and the devil's rules alone. In\nthat case, the malicious rules serve as a finite witness for non-termination.\nOn the other hand, if the devil's rules do not exhibit an infinite computation,\nthe recursive rule is unconditionally terminating. We also identify cases where\nthe static analysis of the devil's rule decides termination or non-termination\nof the recursive rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Methods: We discuss the initial conditions of our\nmajor merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show\nthat such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass\nconcentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a\nsolution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at\neach time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a\ngiven threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value. We also\ncompare the GADGET3 and GIZMO codes, by applying both of them to the same\ninitial conditions. Results: We show that the evolution of isolated\nprotogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our\nprotogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that\nthe problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger\nsimulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution. We show that\nour AGN-like feedback removes this non-physical central mass concentration, and\nthus allows the formation of realistic bars. Note that our AGN-like feedback\nmainly affects the central region of a model, without significantly modifying\nthe rest of the galaxy.

The NEXT collaboration is\nbuilding an EL HPGXe TPC capable of holding 100 kg (NEXT-100) of xenon\nisotopically enriched in ${{}^{136}\\rm Xe}$. The installation and commissioning\nof the NEXT-100 detector at the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC) is\nplanned for 2018. The current estimated background level for the NEXT-100\ndetector is of $4\\times10^{-4}$ counts/keV-kg-yr or less in the energy region\nof interest. Assuming an energy resolution of 0.75$\\%$ FWHM at the\n$Q_{\\beta\\beta}$ and a $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ signal efficiency of about 28$\\%$, this\ngives an expected sensitivity (at 90$\\%$ CL) to the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half\nlife of $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>6.0\\times10^{25}$ yr for an exposure of 275 kg yr. A\nfirst phase of the NEXT experiment, called NEW, is currently being commissioned\nat the LSC. The NEW detector is a scale 1:2 in size (1:10 in mass) of the\nNEXT-100 detector using the same materials and photosensors and will be used to\nperform a characterization of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ backgrounds and a\nmeasurement of the standard double beta decay with neutrinos\n(${2\\nu\\beta\\beta}$). An 8 sigma significance for the ${2\\nu\\beta\\beta}$ signal\nin the NEW detector has been estimated for a 100-day run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 17:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Also, this tendency does not weaken by considering \"large\" galaxies, for\ninstance those with $M_*\\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\\odot$. Besides the tests on the\nhomogeneity of the fits, we also use a sample of 62 galaxies of diverse types\nto perform tests on the quality of the overall fit of each galaxy, and to\nsearch for correlations with stellar mass, gas mass and the disc scale length.\nIn particular, we find that only 13 galaxies are better fitted by the NFW halo;\nand that even for the galaxies with $M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\\odot$ the Burkert\nprofile either fits as good as, or better than, the NFW profile. This result is\nrelevant since different baryonic effects important for the smaller galaxies,\nlike supernova feedback and dynamical friction from baryonic clumps, indicate\nthat at such large stellar masses the NFW profile should be preferred over the\nBurkert profile. Hence, our results either suggest a new baryonic effect or a\nchange of the dark matter physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 17:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

We\nfocus on the case of a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many\nmechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of\ndisorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material,\nlargely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise\nphonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high\nquality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of\ndisorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with\ndirection-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the\nphase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory\nconnects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the\nassociated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 17:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

AS 205A is a late-type\ndwarf (~K5) of ~1 Msun that belongs to a triple system. Independent photometric\nsurveys discovered that AS 205A has two distinct periods (P1=6.78 and P2=24.78\ndays) detected in the light curve that persist over several years. Period P1\nseems to be linked to the axial-rotation of the star and is caused by the\npresence of cool surface spots. Period P2 is correlated with the modulation in\nAS 205A brightness (V) and red color (V-R), consistent with a gravitating\nobject within the accretion disk. We here derive precise Near Infrared radial\nvelocities to investigate the origin of period P2 which is predicted to\ncorrespond to a cool source in a Keplerian orbit with a semi-major axis of\n~0.17 AU positioned close to the inner disk radius of 0.14 AU. The radial\nvelocity variations of AS 205A were found to have a period of P ~ 24.84 days\nand a semi-amplitude of 1.529 kms-1. This result closely resembles the P2\nperiod in past photometric observations (P ~ 24.78 days). The analysis of the\ncross-correlation function bisector has shown no correlation with the radial\nvelocity modulations, strongly suggesting that the period is not controlled by\nstellar rotation. Additional activity indicators should however be explored in\nfuture surveys. Taking this into account we found that the presence of a\nsubstellar companion is the explanation that best fits the results. We derived\nan orbital solution for AS 205A and found evidence of a m2sini 19.25 MJup\nobject in an orbit with moderate eccentricity of e~0.34.

A quarter-car linear suspension model is\nused and an H-infinity filter is designed with both onboard sensor measurements\nand delayed road profile information from the cloud.

By controlling for perturbations due to\nshort-lived flows and due to false motions from feature interactions, I\neffectively isolate the long-lived flows traced by the magnetic features.

SNR G353.6$-$0.7 is one of the five known shell-type\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) emitting in the very high energy (VHE, Energy $>$ 0.1\nTeV) $\\gamma$-ray domain. We observed this TeV SNR with the Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) in 1390, 610 and 325 MHz bands. In this paper, we report\nthe discovery of 325 and 610 MHz radio counterparts of the SNR HESS J1731$-$347\nwith the GMRT. Various filaments of the SNR are clearly seen in the 325 and 610\nMHz bands. However, the faintest feature in the radio bands corresponds to the\npeak in VHE emission. We explain this anti-correlation in terms of a possible\nleptonic origin of the observed VHE $\\gamma$-ray emission. We determine the\nspectral indices of the bright individual filaments, which were detected in\nboth the 610 and the 325 MHz bands. Our values range from $-$1.11 to $-$0.15,\nconsistent with the non-thermal radio emission. We also report a possible radio\ncounterpart of a nearby TeV source HESS J1729$-$345 from the 843 MHz Molonglo\nGalactic Plane Survey and the 1.4 GHz Southern Galactic Plane Survey maps. The\npositive radio spectral index of this possible counterpart suggests a thermal\norigin of the radio emission of this nearby TeV source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 19:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

The\nconfining pressure is either thermal pressure acting on both surfaces, or\nthermal pressure acting on one surface and ram-pressure on the other. In the\nlinear regime of fragmentation, the dispersion relation we obtain agrees well\nwith that derived by Elmegreen & Elmegreen (1978), and consequently deviates\nfrom the dispersion relations based on the thin shell approximation (Vishniac\n1983) or pressure assisted gravitational instability (W\\\"unsch et al. 2010). In\nthe non-linear regime, the relative importance of the confining pressure to the\nself-gravity is a crucial parameter controlling the qualitative course of\nfragmentation. When confinement of the layer is dominated by external pressure,\nself- gravitating condensations are delivered by a two-stage process: first the\nlayer fragments into gravitationally bound but stable clumps, and then these\nclumps coalesce until they assemble enough mass to collapse. In contrast, when\nexternal pressure makes a small contribution to confinement of the layer, the\nlayer fragments monolithically into gravitationally unstable clumps and there\nis no coalescence. This dichotomy persists whether the external pressure is\nthermal or ram. We apply these results to fragments forming in a shell swept up\nby an expanding H II region, and find that, unless the swept up gas is quite\nhot or the surrounding medium has low density, the fragments have low-mass ( ~<\n3 M_Sun ), and therefore they are unlikely to spawn stars that are sufficiently\nmassive to promote sequential self-propagating star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 20:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

We present a qualitative\ndescription of the mechanisms by which condensational latent heating influence\nthe circulation, and then illustrate them using an idealized general\ncirculation model that includes a condensation cycle of silicates with latent\nheating and molecular weight effect due to rainout of condensate.

One remarkable\nfeature of these systems is the appearance of non-local microscopic\n\"topological symmetries\" that descend to topological defects of the resulting\nCFTs. We derive various model-independent properties of these theories and of\nthis topological symmetry / topological defect correspondence. For example, by\nstudying precursors of certain twist and defect fields directly in the anyonic\nchains, we argue that (under mild assumptions) the two-dimensional CFTs\ncorrespond to particular modular invariants with respect to their maximal\nchiral algebras and that the topological defects descending from topological\nsymmetries commute with these maximal chiral algebras. Using this map, we apply\nproperties of defect Hilbert spaces to show how topological symmetries give a\nhandle on the set of allowed relevant deformations of these theories.\nThroughout, we give a unified perspective that treats the constraints from\ndiscrete symmetries on the same footing as the constraints from topological\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 22:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 22:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Integrating multiple\ndifferent but complementary cues, like RGB and Thermal (RGB-T), may be an\neffective way for boosting saliency detection performance. The current research\nin this direction, however, is limited by the lack of a comprehensive\nbenchmark. This work contributes such a RGB-T image dataset, which includes 821\nspatially aligned RGB-T image pairs and their ground truth annotations for\nsaliency detection purpose. The image pairs are with high diversity recorded\nunder different scenes and environmental conditions, and we annotate 11\nchallenges on these image pairs for performing the challenge-sensitive analysis\nfor different saliency detection algorithms.

One of many examples is\nultra-short laser pulse characterization in which the electromagnetic field is\noscillating with ~10^15 Hz and phase information cannot be measured directly\ndue to limitations of the electronic sensors. Phase retrieval is ill-posed in\nmost cases as there are many different signals with the same Fourier transform\nmagnitude. To overcome this fundamental ill-posedness, several measurement\ntechniques are used in practice. One of the most popular methods for complete\ncharacterization of ultra-short laser pulses is the Frequency-Resolved Optical\nGating (FROG). In FROG, the acquired data is the power spectrum of the product\nof the unknown pulse with its delayed replica. Therefore the measured signal is\na quartic function of the unknown pulse. A generalized version of FROG, where\nthe delayed replica is replaced by a second unknown pulse, is called blind\nFROG. In this case, the measured signal is quadratic with respect to both\npulses. In this letter we introduce and formulate FROG-type techniques.

Taking advantage of a fusion penalization based\nconvex clustering criterion, we propose a very fast screening procedure that\nefficiently discards non-informative features by first computing a clustering\nscore corresponding to the clustering tree constructed for each feature, and\nthen thresholding the resulting values. We provide theoretical support for our\napproach by establishing uniform non-asymptotic bounds on the clustering scores\nof the \"noise\" features. These bounds imply perfect screening of\nnon-informative features with high probability and are derived via careful\nanalysis of the empirical processes corresponding to the clustering trees that\nare constructed for each of the features by the associated clustering\nprocedure. Through extensive simulation experiments we compare the performance\nof our proposed method with other screening approaches, popularly used in\ncluster analysis, and obtain encouraging results. We demonstrate empirically\nthat our method is applicable to cluster analysis of big datasets arising in\nsingle-cell gene expression studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 06:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 16:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Hence a better modeling of the thermal instabilities\n(convection) in the advanced burning phases together with a critical analysis\nof the cross sections of the nuclear reactions operating in O burning are\nrelevant for the understanding of the synthesis of Ti44.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 10:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Within a \"wide sheaths\" asymptotic regime, valid for\nlarge-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF+DC model becomes\nlinear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be\nre-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every\nemitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual\ncontributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to\nthe sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal\ndistance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial\nprotrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the\nemitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW\nevanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field\nlines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs\nover a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for |VRF| are found\nsmaller than IC antenna parallel extension.

Robust estimation was\npreviously studied for a varying phase, where the goal was to estimate the\nphase at some time in the past, using the measurement results from both before\nand after that time within a fixed time interval up to current time.

K. Burgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] it was\nshown that a series of frequent measurements can project the dynamics of a\nquantum system onto a subspace in which the dynamics can be more complex. In\nthis subspace even full controllability can be achieved, although the\ncontrollability over the system before the projection is very poor since the\ncontrol Hamiltonians commute with each other. We can also think of the\nopposite: any Hamiltonians of a quantum system, which are in general\nnoncommutative with each other, can be made commutative by embedding them in an\nextended Hilbert space, and thus the dynamics in the extended space becomes\ntrivial and simple. This idea of making noncommutative Hamiltonians commutative\nis called \"Hamiltonian purification.\" The original noncommutative Hamiltonians\nare recovered by projecting the system back onto the original Hilbert space\nthrough frequent measurements. Here we generalize this idea to open-system\ndynamics by presenting a simple construction to make Lindbladians, as well as\nHamiltonians, commutative on a larger space with an auxiliary system. We show\nthat the original dynamics can be recovered through frequently measuring the\nauxiliary system in a non-selective way. Moreover, we provide a universal pair\nof Lindbladians which describes an \"accessible\" open quantum system for generic\nsystem sizes. This allows us to conclude that through a series of frequent\nnon-selective measurements a nonaccessible open quantum system generally\nbecomes accessible. This sheds further light on the role of measurement\nbackaction on the control of quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 12:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

We are motivated by environmental\napplications in which the predictor is the dose of an exposure and the response\nis a health outcome. A main focus in these studies is inference on dose levels\nassociated with a given increase in risk relative to a baseline. Popular\nmethods either dichotomize the continuous response or focus on modeling changes\nwith the dose in the expectation of the outcome. Such choices may lead to\ninformation loss and provide inaccurate inference on dose-response\nrelationships. We instead propose a Bayesian convex mixture regression model\nthat allows the entire distribution of the health outcome to be unknown and\nchanging with the dose.

These routines include Markov chain Monte Carlo via Gibbs sampling,\nexpectation-maximization algorithms, and mean-field variational Bayes for\nscalable inference, thereby stimulating a wider implementation of Bayesian\ndensity regression by practitioners. The algorithms associated with these\nmethods are presented in detail and tested in a toxicology study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 13:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 10:49:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 19:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Here, the\ntransition process in confined 2D jets of two fluids with varying viscosity\nratio is investigated using DNS. Neutral curves for persistent oscillations are\nfound by recording the norm of the velocity residuals in DNS for over 1000\nnondimensional time units, or until the signal has reached a constant level in\na logarithmic scale - either a converged steady state, or a \"statistically\nsteady\" oscillatory state. Oscillatory final states are found for all viscosity\nratios (0.1-10). For uniform viscosity (m=1), the first bifurcation is through\na surface tension-driven global instability. For low viscosity of the outer\nfluid, there is a mode competition between a steady asymmetric Coanda-type\nattachment mode and the surface tension-induced mode. At moderate surface\ntension, the Coanda-type attachment dominates and eventually triggers\ntime-dependent convective bursts. At high surface tension, the surface\ntension-dominated mode dominates. For high viscosity of the outer fluid,\npersistent oscillations appear due to a strong convective instability. Finally,\nthe m=1 jet remains unstable far from the inlet when the shear profile is\nnearly constant. Comparing this to a parallel Couette flow (without inflection\npoints), we show that in both flows, a hidden interfacial mode brought out by\nsurface tension becomes temporally and absolutely unstable in an intermediate\nWeber and Reynolds regime. An energy analysis of the Couette setup shows that\nsurface tension, although dissipative, induces a velocity field near the\ninterface which extracts energy from the flow through a viscous mechanism. This\nstudy highlights the rich dynamics of immiscible planar uniform-density jets,\nwhere several self-sustained and convective mechanisms compete depending on the\nexact parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 13:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Under these assumptions the drift shows properties distinct from the\nclassical drift models, which ignore realistic mutation rates: i) All\n(non-lethal) variants of a site have a characteristic average frequencies,\nwhich are independent of population size, however the magnitude of fluctuations\naround these frequencies depends on population size. ii) There is no\n\"mutational meltdown\" due to \"low efficiency of selection\" for small population\nsize.

In this paper, a generalized\nSchur-complement is applied to the magnetic vector potential formulation, which\nconverts a differential-algebraic equation system of index 1 into a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODE) with reduced stiffness. For the time\nintegration of this ODE system of equations, the explicit Euler method is\napplied. The Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) stability criterion of explicit time\nintegration methods may result in small time steps. Applying a pseudo-inverse\nof the discrete curl-curl operator in nonconducting regions of the problem is\nrequired in every time step. For the computation of the pseudo-inverse, the\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used. The cascaded Subspace\nExtrapolation method (CSPE) is presented to produce suitable start vectors for\nthese PCG iterations. The resulting scheme is validated using the TEAM 10\nbenchmark problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 15:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The negative magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) might be a\npossible mechanism for accomplishing this, but it has mainly been studied in\nsimple systems using an isothermal equation of state without a natural free\nsurface. We study NEMPI in a stratified Cartesian mean-field model where\nturbulence effects are parameterized. We use an ideal equation of state and\ninclude radiation transport, which establishes selfconsistently a free surface.\nWe use a Kramers-type opacity with adjustable exponents chosen such that the\ndeeper layers are approximately isentropic. No convection is therefore possible\nin this model, allowing us to study NEMPI with radiation in isolation. We\nrestrict ourselves to two-dimensional models. We use artificially enhanced\nmean-field coefficients to allow NEMPI to develop, making it therefore possible\nto study the reason why it is much harder to excite in the presence of\nradiation. NEMPI yields moderately strong magnetic flux concentrations a\ncertain distance beneath the surface where optical depth is unity. The\ninstability is oscillatory and in the form of upward travelling waves. This\nseems to be a new effect that has not been found in earlier models without\nradiative transport. The horizontal wavelength is about ten times smaller than\nwhat has been found previously in more idealized isothermal models. In our\nmodels, NEMPI saturates at field strengths too low to explain sunspots.\nFurthermore, the structures appear too narrow and too far beneath the surface\nto cause significant brightness variations at the radiative surface.

Besides being an important step in our understanding of the\ntopological properties of ever more complex skyrmionic systems, our results\nbear great potential in stimulating the discovery of antiferromagnetic\nskyrmions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 15:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

Most of the spatial structure functions\n(SSFs) show that the phase fluctuation increases as a function of baseline\nlength, with a power-law slope of ~0.6. In many cases, we find that the slope\nbecomes shallower (average of ~0.2-0.3) at baseline lengths longer than ~1 km,\nnamely showing a turn-over in SSF. The phase correction method using water\nvapor radiometers (WVRs) works well, especially for the cases where PWV >1 mm,\nwhich reduces the degree of phase fluctuations by a factor of two in many\ncases. However, phase fluctuations still remain after the WVR phase correction,\nsuggesting the existence of other turbulent constituent that cause the phase\nfluctuation. This is supported by occasional SSFs that do not exhibit any\nturn-over; these are only seen when the PWV is low or after WVR phase\ncorrection. This means that the phase fluctuation caused by this turbulent\nconstituent is inherently smaller than that caused by water vapor. Since there\nis no turn-over in the SSF up to the maximum baseline length of ~15 km, this\nturbulent constituent must have scale height of 10 km or more, and thus cannot\nbe water vapor, whose scale height is around 1 km. This large scale height\nturbulent constituent is likely to be water ice or a dry component. Excess path\nlength fluctuation after the WVR phase correction at a baseline length of 10 km\nis large (>200 micron), which is significant for high frequency (>450 GHz or\n<700 micron) observations. These results suggest the need for an additional\nphase correction method, such as fast switching, in addition to the WVR phase\ncorrection. We simulated the fast switching, and the result suggests that it\nworks well, with shorter cycle times linearly improving the coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

It combines the variational quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) solution of the electronic part with the path integral (PI)\nformalism for the quantum nuclear dynamics. On the one hand, the PI molecular\ndynamics includes nuclear quantum effects by adding a set of fictitious\nclassical particles (beads) aimed at reproducing nuclear quantum fluctuations\nvia a harmonic kinetic term. On the other hand, variational QMC can provide\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces with a precision comparable to\nthe most advanced post Hartree-Fock approaches, and with a favorable scaling\nwith the system size. To deal with the intrinsic QMC noise, we generalize the\nPI molecular dynamics using a Langevin thermostat correlated according to the\ncovariance matrix of QMC nuclear forces. The variational parameters of the QMC\nwave function are evolved during the nuclear dynamics, such that the BO\npotential energy surface is unbiased. Statistical errors on the wave function\nparameters are reduced by resorting to bead grouping average, which we show to\nbe accurate and well controlled. Our general algorithm relies on a Trotter\nbreakup between the dynamics driven by ionic forces and the one set by the\nharmonic interbead couplings. The latter is exactly integrated even in presence\nof the Langevin thermostat, thanks to the mapping onto an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. This framework turns out to be very efficient also in the case of\ndeterministic ionic forces. The new implementation is validated on the Zundel\nion by direct comparison with standard PI Langevin dynamics calculations made\nwith a coupled cluster potential energy surface.

Under certain conditions, the superiorized\nalgorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found\nby the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the\nproblem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the\nchosen objective.\n  Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume\na linear measurement model, which in the case of CT corresponds to data\ngenerated from a monoenergetic X-ray beam. Many CT systems generate X-rays from\na polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an\nintegral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum.
