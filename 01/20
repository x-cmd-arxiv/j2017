Like these\nestablished methods, the radio signal is sensitive to the calorimetric energy\nand the position of the maximum of the electromagnetic shower component. This\nmakes antenna arrays an ideal extension for particle-detector arrays above a\nthreshold energy of about 100 PeV of the primary cosmic-ray particles. In the\nlast few years the digital radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers again\nmade significant progress, and there now is a consistent picture of the\nemission mechanisms confirmed by several measurements. Recent results by the\nantenna arrays AERA and Tunka-Rex confirm that the absolute accuracy for the\nshower energy is as good as the other detection techniques. Moreover, the\nsensitivity to the shower maximum of the radio signal has been confirmed in\ndirect comparison to air-Cherenkov measurements by Tunka-Rex. The dense antenna\narray LOFAR can already compete with the established techniques in accuracy for\ncosmic-ray mass-composition. In the future, a new generation of radio\nexperiments might drive the field: either by providing extremely large exposure\nfor inclined cosmic-ray or neutrino showers or, like the SKA core in Australia\nwith its several 10,000 antennas, by providing extremely detailed measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 16:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

The cutoff is\ndetermined by the interlayer spacing d ~13.5 Angstrom, typical for graphene\noxide laminates that swell in water. Achieving smaller d for the laminates\nimmersed in water has proved to be a challenge.Here we describe how to control\nd by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tuneable ion sieving.\nMembranes with d from ~ 9.8 Angstrom to 6.4 Angstrom are demonstrated,\nproviding the sieve size smaller than typical ions' hydrated diameters.In this\nregime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers\nof ~10-100 kJ/mol depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease\nexponentially with decreasing the sieve size but water transport is weakly\naffected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for\nwater molecules entry and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.\nBuilding on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain\ngraphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for\nNaCl.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 17:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

The trade in second-hand tires has been implicated as a\nfactor in this process as they act as mobile reservoirs of mosquito eggs and\nlarvae. Regional transportation of tires can create linkages between rural\nareas with dengue to disease-free urban areas, potentially giving rise to\noutbreaks even in areas with strong local control measures. In this work we\nsought to model the dynamics of mosquito transportation via the tire trade, in\nparticular to predict its role in causing unexpected dengue outbreaks through\nvertical transmission of the virus across generations of mosquitoes. We also\naimed to identify strategies for regulating the trade in second-hand tires,\nimproving disease control. We created a mathematical model which captures the\ndynamics of dengue between rural and urban areas, taking into account the\nmovement, storage time of tires, and mosquito diapause. We simulate a series of\nscenarios. First a mosquito population is introduced to a dengue-free area via\nmovement of tires, either as single or multiple events, increasing the\nlikelihood of a dengue outbreak. An endemic state can be induced regardless of\nwhether urban conditions for an outbreak are met, and an existing endemic state\ncan be enhanced by vector input. Finally we assess the potential for regulation\nof tire processing as a means of reducing the transmission of dengue fever\nusing a specific case study from Puerto Rico. Our work demonstrates the\nimportance of the second-hand tire trade in modulating the spread of dengue\nfever across regions, in particular its role in introducing dengue to\ndisease-free areas. We propose that regulation of tire storage and movement can\nplay a crucial role in containing outbreaks and dengue spread.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 21:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

We remove the fixed effects, and further obtain the estimators of\nparametric and nonparametric components, which do not depend on the fixed\neffects. We establish the asymptotic distribution of their maximum absolute\ndeviation between the estimated nonparametric component and the true\nnonparametric component under some suitable conditions, and hence the result\ncan be used to construct the simultaneous confidence band of the nonparametric\ncomponent. Based on the asymptotic distribution, it becomes difficult for the\nconstruction of the simultaneous confidence band. The reason is that the\nasymptotic distribution involves the estimators of the asymptotic bias and\nconditional variance, and the choice of the bandwidth for estimating the second\nderivative of nonparametric function. Clearly, these will cause computational\nburden and accumulative errors. To overcome these problems, we propose a\nBootstrap method to construct simultaneous confidence band.

We formulate SUPA by solving a graph\nreachability problem on an inter-procedural value-flow graph representing a\nprogram's def-use chains, which are pre-computed efficiently but\nover-approximately. To answer a client query (a request for a variable's\npoints-to set), SUPA reasons about the flow of values along the pre-computed\ndef-use chains sparsely (rather than across all program points), by performing\nonly the work necessary for the query (rather than analyzing the whole\nprogram). In particular, strong updates are performed to filter out spurious\ndef-use chains through value-flow refinement as long as the total budget is not\nexhausted. SUPA facilitates efficiency and precision tradeoffs by applying\ndifferent pointer analyses in a hybrid multi-stage analysis framework.\n  We have implemented SUPA in LLVM (3.5.0) and evaluate it by choosing\nuninitialized pointer detection as a major client on 18 open-source C programs.\nAs the analysis budget increases, SUPA achieves improved precision, with its\nsingle-stage flow-sensitive analysis reaching 97.4% of that achieved by\nwhole-program flow-sensitive analysis by consuming about 0.18 seconds and 65KB\nof memory per query, on average (with a budget of at most 10000 value-flow\nedges per query). With context-sensitivity also considered, SUPA's two- stage\nanalysis becomes more precise for some programs but also incurs more analysis\ntimes. SUPA is also amenable to parallelization.

The initial estimate is intended to be computationally\nfast, albeit suboptimal, but its warping creates a larger, flexible class of\ndensity functions, resulting in substantially improved estimation. The search\nfor optimal warping is accomplished by mapping diffeomorphic functions to the\ntangent space of a Hilbert sphere, a vector space whose elements can be\nexpressed using an orthogonal basis. Using a truncated basis expansion, we\nestimate the optimal warping under a (penalized) likelihood criterion and,\nthus, the optimal density estimate.

The approach avoids many of the computational pitfalls associated\nwith classical conditional-density estimation methods, without losing on\nestimation performance.

Recently, Hegde et al.\nproposed a framework, called approximation-tolerant model-based compressive\nsensing, for recovering signals with structured sparsity. Their framework\nrequires two oracles, the head- and the tail-approximation projection oracles.\nThe two oracles should return approximate solutions in the model which is\nclosest to the query signal. In this paper, we consider two structured sparsity\nmodels and obtain improved projection algorithms. The first one is the tree\nsparsity model, which captures the support structure in the wavelet\ndecomposition of piecewise-smooth signals. We propose a linear time\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for head-approximation projection and a\nlinear time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for tail-approximation\nprojection.

As a corollary, we can recover a constant approximate $k$-sparse signal.\nThe other is the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which is useful\nto model the situation where the positions of the nonzero coefficients of a\nsignal do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal)\nlocations. We obtain the first single criterion constant factor approximation\nalgorithm for the head-approximation projection. The previous best known\nalgorithm is a bicriterion approximation.

How to select the most important variables to improve real-time\ntraffic accident risk prediction has become a concern of many recent studies.\nThis paper proposes a novel variable selection method based on the Frequent\nPattern tree (FP tree) algorithm. First, all the frequent patterns in the\ntraffic accident dataset are discovered. Then for each frequent pattern, a new\ncriterion, called the Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR) which we proposed, is\ncalculated. This ROPR is added to the importance score of the variables that\ndifferentiate one frequent pattern from the others. To test the proposed\nmethod, a dataset was compiled from the traffic accidents records detected by\nonly one detector on interstate highway I-64 in Virginia in 2005. This dataset\nwas then linked to other variables such as real-time traffic information and\nweather conditions. Both the proposed method based on the FP tree algorithm, as\nwell as the widely utilized, random forest method, were then used to identify\nthe important variables or the Virginia dataset. The results indicate that\nthere are some differences between the variables deemed important by the FP\ntree and those selected by the random forest method. Following this, two\nbaseline models (i.e. a nearest neighbor (k-NN) method and a Bayesian network)\nwere developed to predict accident risk based on the variables identified by\nboth the FP tree method and the random forest method. The results show that the\nmodels based on the variable selection using the FP tree performed better than\nthose based on the random forest method for several versions of the k-NN and\nBayesian network models.The best results were derived from a Bayesian network\nmodel using variables from FP tree. That model could predict 61.11% of\naccidents accurately while having a false alarm rate of 38.16%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 05:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 17:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Timing risk is identified with the\nuncertainty associated to the time at which the payoff payment of the barrier\noption is due. Starting from the work by Carr and Picron (1999), where the\nauthors show that the timing risk can be hedged via static positions in plain\nvanilla options, the present paper extends the static hedge formula proposed in\nCarr and Picron (1999) by giving sufficient conditions to decompose a\ngeneralized timing risk into an integral of knock-in options in a\nmulti-dimensional market model. A dedicated study of the semi-static hedge is\nthen conducted by defining the corresponding strategy based on positions in\nbarrier options. The proposed methodology allows to construct not only first\norder hedges but also higher order semi-static hedges, that can be interpreted\nas asymptotic expansions of the hedging error. The convergence of these higher\norder semi-static hedges to an exact hedge is shown. An illustration of the\nmain theoretical results is provided for i) a symmetric case, ii) a one\ndimensional case, where the first order and second order hedging errors are\nderived in analytic closed form. The materiality of the hedging benefit gain of\ngoing from order one to order two by re-iterating the timing risk hedging\nstrategy is discussed through numerical evidences by showing that order two can\nbring to more than 90% reduction of the hedging 'cost' w.r.t. order one\n(depending on the specific barrier option characteristics).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 05:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

The variety of observed\nLi abundances is illustrated by the following objects in different stages of\nevolution: 1) Old stars in the galactic halo, which have a lithium abundance\nlog e(Li)=2.2 (the \"lithium plateau\") that appears to be 0.5 dex lower than the\nprimordial abundance predicted by cosmological models. 2) Young stars in the\ngalactic disk, which have been used to estimate the contemporary initial\nlithium abundance log e(Li)=3.2 +/- 0.1 for stars in the Main sequence.\nPossible sources of lithium enrichment in the interstellar medium during\nevolution of the galaxy are discussed. 3) Evolving FGK dwarfs in the galactic\ndisk, which have lower log e(Li) for lower effective temperature Teff and mass\nM. The \"lithium dip\" near Teff~6600 K in the distribution of log e(Li) with\nrespect to Teff in old clusters is discussed. 4) FGK giants and supergiants, of\nwhich most have no lithium at all. This phenomenon is consistent with rotating\nstar model calculations. 5) Lithium rich cold giants with log e(Li) > 2.0 ,\nwhich form a small, enigmatic group. Theoretical models with rotation can\nexplain the existence of these stars only in the case of low initial rotation\nvelocities V0 < 50 km/s.

The\nentailment rules are determined by the model-theoretic semantics. Incorporating\ncontext of an RDF triple (e.g., provenance, time, and location) into the\ninferencing process requires the formal semantics to be capable of describing\nthe context of RDF triples also in the form of triples, or in other words, RDF\ncontextual triples about triples. The formal semantics should also provide the\nrules that could entail new contextual triples about triples. In this paper, we\npropose the first inferencing mechanism that allows context of RDF triples,\nrepresented in the form of RDF triples about triples, to be the first-class\ncitizens in the model-theoretic semantics and in the logical rules. Our\ninference mechanism is well-formalized with all new concepts being captured in\nthe model-theoretic semantics.

The theory of jet quenching, a commonly used\nalias for the modifications of the parton branching resulting from the\ninteractions with the QGP, has been significantly developed over the last\nyears. Within a weak coupling approach, several elementary processes that build\nup the parton shower evolution, such as single gluon emissions, interference\neffects between successive emissions and corrections to radiative energy loss\nof massive quarks, have been addressed both at eikonal accuracy and beyond by\ntaking into account the Brownian motion that high-energy particles experience\nwhen traversing a hot and dense medium.

A natural solution is to formulate in continuous time, yet uptake\nof this has been slow. This lack of implementation is often excused by a\ndifficulty in interpretation. Here we aim to bolster usage by developing a\ncontinuous-time model with interpretable parameters, similar to those of\npopular discrete-time models that use turning angles and step lengths. Movement\nis defined by a joint bearing and speed process, with parameters dependent on a\ncontinuous-time behavioural switching process, creating a flexible class of\nmovement models.\n  Methodology is presented for Markov chain Monte Carlo inference given\nirregular observations, involving augmenting observed locations with a\nreconstruction of the underlying movement process. This is applied to well\nknown GPS data from elk (\\emph{Cervus elaphus}), which have previously been\nmodelled in discrete time.

We determine the non-local terms in four-vertices required in the\ncase of spin j greater than 4 and show that these non-localities can be\ninterpreted as a result of integrating out a tower of auxiliary ghost-like\nmassless higher spin fields in an extended theory with a local action. We also\nconsider the conformal off-shell extension of the Einstein theory and show that\nits perturbative expansion is the same as of the the non-local action resulting\nfrom integrating out the trace of the graviton field from the Einstein action.\nMotivated by this example, we conjecture the existence of a similar conformal\noff-shell extension of a massless higher spin theory that may be related to the\nabove extended theory and may have the same infinite-dimensional symmetry as\nthe conformal higher spin theory and thus may lead to a trivial S matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 12:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 16:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2017 12:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Only once, in an observation of the\nMartian surface by the Viking 1 lander, was reddening observed up to a certain\nphase angle with bluing beyond, making the reflectance ratio as a function of\nphase angle shaped like an arch.

To investigate this, we measured the\nbidirectional reflectance of particulate samples of several common rock types\nin the 400-1000 nm wavelength range and performed ray-tracing simulations. We\nconfirm the occurrence of the arch for surfaces that are forward scattering,\ni.e. are composed of semi-transparent particles and are smooth on the scale of\nthe particles, and for which the reflectance increases from the lower to the\nhigher wavelength in the reflectance ratio. The arch shape is reproduced by the\nsimulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the\nscale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (1963) fairy castles\nthat can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic\nreddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being\nindistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk\nfunction at visible wavelengths, i.e. Lommel-Seeliger-type scattering. The\nexperiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at\nnear-IR wavelengths.

We obtain expressions\nfor $\\zeta(1/2)L_{-p}(1/2)$, where for primes $p>7$, $L_{-p}(s)$ are certain\n$L$-series, and remarkably tight bounds for the value $\\zeta(1/2)$,\n$\\zeta(s)=\\zeta(s,1)$ being the Riemann zeta function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 18:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

For each step the\nrequired time expenditure was recorded. The character recognition yielded\nexcellent results both on character (97.57%) and word (92.19%) level.\nFurthermore, a comparison of a highly automated (LAREX) and a manual (Aletheia)\nmethod for layout analysis was performed. By considerably automating the\nsegmentation the required human effort was reduced significantly from over 100\nhours to less than six hours, resulting in only a slight drop in OCR accuracy.\nRealistic estimates for the human effort necessary for full text extraction\nfrom incunabula can be derived from this study.

This setup indicates that\nLarmor radiation and Unruh radiation are two counterparts of the same\nphenomenon. Larmor radiation is observed in the inertial frame, while Unruh\nradiation is observed in an accelerated frame. The accelerated observer sees\nthat his detector absorbed a particle inside its own accelerated horizon, while\nthe Larmor radiation is the companion particle which leaves the accelerated\nobserver's horizon.

Quantum many body systems out of equilibrium often manifest\nbehavior, different from the one predicted by standard statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics in equilibrium. Since the dynamics of a many body quantum\nsystem typically involve many excited eigenstates, with a non-thermal\ndistribution, the time evolution of such a system provides an unique way for\ninvestigation of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. Last decade\nsuch new subjects like quantum quenches, thermalization, pre-thermalization,\nequilibration, generalized Gibbs ensemble, etc. are among the most attractive\ntopics of investigation in modern quantum physics. One of the most interesting\nthemes in the study of dynamics of quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium\nis connected with the recently proposed important concept of dynamical quantum\nphase transitions. During the last few years a great progress has been achieved\nin studying of those singularities in the time dependence of characteristics of\nquantum mechanical systems, in particular, in understanding how the quantum\ncritical points of equilibrium thermodynamics affect their dynamical\nproperties. Dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal universality, scaling,\nconnection to the topology, and many other interesting features. Here we review\nthe recent achievements of this quickly developing part of low temperature\nquantum physics. The study of dynamical quantum phase transitions is especially\nimportant in context of their connection to the problem of the modern theory of\nquantum information, where namely non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum\nsystem plays the major role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 15:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

In this study, chitosan was firstly dispersed\n(0.1% m/V) in lactic acid aqueous solutions (pH 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0), and then\nevaluated regarding its thickener and emulsion stabilizer properties.

Emulsions containing\nchitosan were 3 times more viscous than controls without chitosan, and\npresented storage modulus ($G'$) higher than loss modulus ($G''$).
