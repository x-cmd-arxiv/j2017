We\napply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a\nboson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath\nis in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both\ncondensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light\ncoupling and dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light\ncoupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the\nnormal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi\noscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump\nfield frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath\nis in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the\ndipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation\nrate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a\ncharacteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the\ncoupled dipolar exciton gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 16:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Such data\ndo not, by themselves, allow detailed assessments of the spreading of the\ninjected tracer plume. To better understand the transport behavior in a\ngranitic aquifer, we combine tracer test data with single-hole\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection monitoring data. Five successful\ntracer tests were performed under various experimental conditions between two\nboreholes 6 m apart. For each experiment, saline tracer was injected into a\npreviously identified packed-off transmissive fracture while repeatedly\nacquiring single-hole GPR reflection profiles together with electrical\nconductivity logs in the pumping borehole. By analyzing depth-migrated GPR\ndifference images together with tracer breakthrough curves and associated\nsimplified flow and transport modeling, we estimate (1) the number, the\nconnectivity, and the geometry of fractures that contribute to tracer\ntransport, (2) the velocity and the mass of tracer that was carried along each\nflow path, and (3) the effective transport parameters of the identified flow\npaths. We find a qualitative agreement when comparing the time evolution of GPR\nreflectivity strengths at strategic locations in the formation with those\narising from simulated transport. The discrepancies are on the same order as\nthose between observed and simulated breakthrough curves at the outflow\nlocations. The rather subtle and repeatable GPR signals provide useful and\ncomplementary information to tracer test data acquired at the outflow locations\nand may help us to characterize transport phenomena in fractured rock aquifers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 20:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

These features are either\nselected based on prior knowledge, or dimension-reduced from a large pool. In\nthis study, we produce a large number of potential spatial features using two\ncombinations of facial landmarks.

We describe the\nweight-monodromy filtration in terms of the combinatorics of the Langlands dual\ngroup of G and generalizations of the Picard-Lefschetz oscillators found in\n[Sch1]. Our proofs use certain local models for the principal degeneration\nwhose geometry is studied in the second part.\n  Our local models simultaneously provide two types of degenerations of the\nZastava spaces, which together equip the Zastava spaces with the geometric\nanalog of a Hopf algebra structure. The first degeneration corresponds to the\nusual Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion of divisors on the curve. The second\ndegeneration is new and corresponds to what we call Vinberg fusion: It is\nobtained not by degenerating divisors on the curve, but by degenerating the\ngroup G via the Vinberg semigroup. On the level of cohomology the Vinberg\nfusion gives rise to an algebra structure, while the Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion\ngives rise to a coalgebra structure; the Hopf algebra axiom is a consequence of\nthe underlying geometry.\n  It is natural to conjecture that this Hopf algebra agrees with the universal\nenveloping algebra of the positive part of the Langlands dual Lie algebra. The\nabove procedure would then yield a novel and highly geometric way to pass to\nthe Langlands dual side: Elements of the Langlands dual Lie algebra are\nrepresented as cycles on the above moduli spaces, and the Lie bracket of two\nelements is obtained by deforming the cartesian product cycle along the Vinberg\ndegeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 00:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 02:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

New ALMA\nobservations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly spherically symmetric\ndistribution of over a hundred $^{12}$CO J=2$-$1 streamers with velocities\nextending from V$_{LSR}$ =$-$150 to +145 km s$^{-1}$.

Such deviations from spherical symmetry may be caused by ejecta\nrunning into dense gas or the dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected\nthe stars and produced the explosion.

Towards an accurate road traffic control, the short-term\ntraffic forecasting to predict the road traffic at the particular site in a\nshort period is often useful and important. In existing works, Seasonal\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a popular approach.\nThe scheme however encounters two challenges: 1) the analysis on related data\nis insufficient whereas some important features of data may be neglected; and\n2) with data presenting different features, it is unlikely to have one\npredictive model that can fit all situations. To tackle above issues, in this\nwork, we develop a hybrid model to improve accuracy of SARIMA. In specific, we\nfirst explore the autocorrelation and distribution features existed in traffic\nflow to revise structure of the time series model. Based on the Gaussian\ndistribution of traffic flow, a hybrid model with a Bayesian learning algorithm\nis developed which can effectively expand the application scenarios of SARIMA.\nWe show the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal using both analysis and\nexperimental studies. Using the real-world trace data, we show that the\nproposed predicting approach can achieve satisfactory performance in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 06:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

A\nrequest is served by sending it to the root before its deadline at a cost equal\nto the weight of the path from the node in which it resides to the root.\nHowever, requests from different nodes can be aggregated, and served together,\nso as to save on cost. The cost of serving an aggregated set of requests is\nequal to the weight of the subtree spanning the nodes in which the requests\nreside. Thus, the problem is to find a competitive online aggregation algorithm\nthat minimizes the total cost of the aggregated requests.

We demonstrate that the probability density function (PDF) of the\ncoordinate of the random walker has two different scaling limits at large\ntimes. One limit describes the bulk of the PDF. It is the $d-$dimensional\ngeneralization of the one-dimensional L\\'evy distribution and is the\ncounterpart of central limit theorem (CLT) for random walks with finite\ndispersion. In contrast with the one-dimensional L\\'evy distribution and the\nCLT this distribution does not have universal shape. The PDF reflects\nanisotropy of the single-step statistics however large the time is. The other\nscaling limit, the so-called 'infinite density', describes the tail of the PDF\nwhich determines second (dispersion) and higher moments of the PDF. This limit\nrepeats the angular structure of PDF of velocity in one step. Typical\nrealization of the walk consists of anomalous diffusive motion (described by\nanisotropic $d-$dimensional L\\'evy distribution) intermitted by long ballistic\nflights (described by infinite density). The long flights are rare but due to\nthem the coordinate increases so much that their contribution determines the\ndispersion.

In the Lovas-Andai framework, the\nindependent variable $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1]$ is the ratio $\\sigma(V)$ of the\nsingular values of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $V=D_2^{1/2} D_1^{-1/2}$ formed from\nthe two $2 \\times 2$ diagonal blocks ($D_1, D_2$) of a $4 \\times 4$ density\nmatrix $D$.

In particular, in the case where $M$ is finite,\nwe show how to generalize Fano's inequality under both the conventional and\nlist-decision settings. As a counterpart to the generalized Fano's inequality,\nallowing $M$ to be infinite, a lower bound on the Arimoto-R\\'enyi conditional\nentropy is derived as a function of the minimum error probability.
