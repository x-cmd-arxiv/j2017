In contrast to\nthe case in which the wire is proximity-coupled to an external superconductor,\nfor an isolated wire there is no separate phase of a topological, weakly\npaired, superconductor. Rather, this phase is adiabatically connected to the\nLuttinger liquid phase. The properties of the one dimensional topological\nsuperconductor emerge when the number of channels in the wire becomes large.\nThe quantum Hall states that may be formed by an array of single-channel wires\ndepend on the Landau level filling factors. For odd-denominator fillings\n$\\nu=1/(2n+1)$, wires at the Luttinger phase form Laughlin states while wires\nin the strongly paired phase form bosonic fractional quantum Hall state of\nstrongly-bound pairs at a filling of $1/(8n+4)$. The transition between the two\nis of the universality class of Ising transitions in three dimensions. For\neven-denominator fractions $\\nu=1/2n$ the two single-wire phases translate into\nfour quantum Hall states. Two of those states are bosonic fractional quantum\nHall states of weakly- and strongly- bound pairs of electrons. The other two\nare non-Abelian quantum Hall states, which originate from coupling wires close\nto their critical point. One of these non-Abelian states is the Moore-Read\nstate. The transition between all these states are of the universality class of\nMajorana transitions. We point out some of the properties that characterize the\ndifferent phases and the phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 18:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Compared with MDPs, POMDP models a\nsystem more accurate but solving a POMDP generally takes exponential time in\nthe size of its state space. This makes the formal verification and synthesis\nproblems much more challenging for POMDPs, especially when multiple system\ncomponents are involved. As a promising technique to reduce the verification\ncomplexity, the abstraction method tries to find an abstract system with a\nsmaller state space but preserves enough properties for the verification\npurpose. While abstraction based verification has been explored extensively for\nMDPs, in this paper, we present the first result of POMDP abstraction and its\nrefinement techniques. The main idea follows the counterexample-guided\nabstraction refinement (CEGAR) framework. Starting with a coarse guess for the\nPOMDP abstraction, we iteratively use counterexamples from formal verification\nto refine the abstraction until the abstract system can be used to infer the\nverification result for the original POMDP.

In particular,\ncommunications in the mmWave band faces significant challenges due to variable\nchannels, intermittent connectivity, and high energy usage. On the other hand,\nspeeds for electronic processing of data is of the same order as typical rates\nfor mmWave interfaces which makes the use of complex algorithms for tracking\nchannel variations and adjusting resources accordingly impractical. Our\nproposed architecture integrates the RF and mmWave interfaces for beamforming\nand data transfer, and exploits the spatio-temporal correlations between the\ninterfaces. Based on extensive experimentation in indoor and outdoor settings,\nwe demonstrate that an integrated RF/mmWave signaling and channel estimation\nscheme can remedy the problem of high energy usage and delay associated with\nmmWave beamforming. In addition, cooperation between two interfaces at the\nhigher layers effectively addresses the high delays caused by highly\nintermittent mmWave connectivity. We design a scheduler that fully exploits the\nmmWave bandwidth, while the RF link acts as a fallback mechanism to prevent\nhigh delay. To this end, we formulate an optimal scheduling problem over the RF\nand mmWave interfaces where the goal is to maximize the delay-constrained\nthroughput of the mmWave interface. We prove using subadditivity analysis that\nthe optimal scheduling policy is based on a single threshold that can be easily\nadopted despite high link variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 02:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 02:47:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 23:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

Empirically and theoretically, many random CSPs\nhave been shown to exhibit a phase transition. As the ratio of constraints to\nvariables passes certain thresholds, they transition from being almost\ncertainly satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact location of this threshold\nhas been thoroughly investigated, but only for certain common classes of\nconstraints. In this paper, we present new bounds for the location of these\nthresholds in boolean CSPs. Our main contribution is that our bounds are fully\ngeneral, and apply to any fixed constraint function that could be used to\ngenerate an ensemble of random CSPs. These bounds rely on a novel Fourier\nanalysis and can be easily computed from the Fourier spectrum of a constraint\nfunction. Our bounds are within a constant factor of the exact threshold\nlocation for many well-studied random CSPs. We demonstrate that our bounds can\nbe easily instantiated to obtain thresholds for many constraint functions that\nhad not been previously studied, and evaluate them experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 02:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

It is shown that a void with\nhypocycloidal shape can lead to a higher SIF than that induced by a\ncorresponding star-shaped crack; this is counter intuitive as the latter\nusually produces a more severe stress field in the material. Moreover, it is\nobserved that when the order $m$ of the polynomial governing the remote loading\ngrows, the stress fields generated by the hypocycloidal-shaped void and the\nstar-shaped crack tend to coincide, so that they become equivalent from the\npoint of view of a failure analysis.

We also\nshow that the Dicke state, which is well-known to be superradiant, has twice\nlower emission rate in the case of unidirectional quantum interaction. Our\nmodel is supported and verified with the numerical computations of quantum\nemmiters coupled via surface plasmon modes in a metalic nanowire. The obtained\nresults are based on a very general model and can be applied to any chirally\ncoupled system, that gives a new outlook on quantum transport in chiral\nnanophotonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 09:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 13:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 15:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The method relies on observationally measuring the quadrupole\nmoments of the compact binary constituents induced due to their spins.

Recent research shows that temporal correlations in the\nchronological ordering of interactions crucially influence network properties\nand dynamical processes. How these correlations affect our ability to control\nsystems with time-varying interactions remains unclear. In this work, we use\nhigher-order network models to extend the framework of structural\ncontrollability to temporal networks, where the chronological ordering of\ninteractions gives rise to time-respecting paths with non-Markovian\ncharacteristics. We study six empirical data sets and show that non-Markovian\ncharacteristics of real systems can both increase or decrease the minimum time\nneeded to control the whole system. With both empirical data and synthetic\nmodels, we further show that spectral properties of generalisations of graph\nLaplacians to higher-order networks can be used to analytically capture the\neffect of temporal correlations on controllability. Our work highlights that\n(i) correlations in the chronological ordering of interactions are an important\nsource of complexity that significantly influences the controllability of\ntemporal networks, and (ii) higher-order network models are a powerful tool to\nunderstand the temporal-topological characteristics of empirical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 11:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 14:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 21:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

The general definition of these problems captures even\nundecidable problems, but it turns out that obtaining an exponentially small\nadditive approximation is just as hard as solving conventional counting\nproblems. In many cases such an approximation is sufficient and working with\nweighted counting problems tends to be very convenient. We present a structured\nview on weighted counting by defining classes that depend on the range of the\nfunction that assigns weights to paths and by showing the relationships between\nthese different classes.

Weighted counting allows us to easily cast a number of\nfamous results of computational complexity in its terms, especially regarding\ncounting and quantum computation. Moreover, these classes are flexible enough\nand capture the complexity of various problems in fields such as probabilistic\ngraphical models and stochastic combinatorial optimization.

Reaching the optimal performance of the\ncoronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask.\nIn particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage\nthat degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint\nplanetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct\nfor the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center,\ngenerally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity\nfield variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil\ntracking mode. A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex\ncoronagraph has thus been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument.\nThis algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the\ncalibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center and\nstabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. On-sky data show that\nthe QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4\nmas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator\nis probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot\nstop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5\nmas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed.\nThe QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust\nmethod to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition,\nQACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the\nobserving efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used\nfor vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and\nangular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 14:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The central algebraic\nframework is the category of length-graded modules over the Steenrod algebra\nequipped with an unstable action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra, with compatibility\nvia the Nishida relations.\n  A first ingredient is a functor defined on modules over the Steenrod algebra\nthat arose in the work of Kuhn and McCarty on the homology of infinite loop\nspaces.

An important fact\nis that these functors can be calculated as the homology of an explicit Koszul\ncomplex with terms expressed as certain Steinberg functors.

The evidence in favor of the presence of\na pure carbon envelope at the neutron star surface is rather indirect and is\nbased on the assumption that the emission is generated uniformly by the entire\nstellar surface. Although this assumption is supported by the absence of\npulsations, the observational upper limit on the pulsed fraction is not very\nstringent. In an attempt to quantify this evidence, we investigate the\npossibility that the observed spectrum of the neutron star in HESS J1731-347 is\na combination of the spectra produced in a hydrogen atmosphere of the hotspots\nand of the cooler remaining part of the neutron star surface. The lack of\npulsations in this case has to be explained either by a sufficiently small\nangle between the neutron star spin axis and the line of sight, or by a\nsufficiently small angular distance between the hotspots and the neutron star\nrotation poles. As the observed flux from a non-uniformly emitting neutron star\ndepends on the angular distribution of the radiation emerging from the\natmosphere, we have computed two new grids of pure carbon and pure hydrogen\natmosphere model spectra accounting for Compton scattering. Using new hydrogen\nmodels, we have evaluated the probability of a geometry that leads to a pulsed\nfraction below the observed upper limit to be about 8.2 %.

The singularities emerging at the transition may enhance the\ntransition temperature to superconductivity; the Lifshitz transition can be in\nthe origin of the small masses of elementary particles in our Universe; the\nblack hole horizon serves as the surface of Lifshitz transition between the\nvacua with type-I and type-II Weyl points; etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 15:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 14:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 11:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Indeed, according\nto our previous study [Phys. Rev. B 88, 224101 (2013)], the axial displacement\nfield along the nanowire exhibits both a radial and an azimuthal dependence\nwith a twofold symmetry due the <011> orientation. As a consequence, the\ndeviatoric strain term used by LRPS is not suitable to analyze the anisotropic\nstrain fields that should be observed in their atomistic simulations. In this\ncomment, we first illustrate the importance of anisotropy in <011> Pd nanowire\nby calculating the azimuthal dependence of the deviatoric strain term. Then the\nexpression of the anisotropic elastic field is recalled in term of strain\ntensor components to show that image fields should be also considered. The\nother aspect of this comment concerns the supposedly loss of correlation along\nthe nanorod caused by the twist. It is claimed for instance by LRPS that : \"As\nan effect of the dislocation strain and twist, if the cylinder is long enough,\nupper/lower regions tend to lose correlation, as if the rod were made of\ndifferent sub-domains.\". This assertion appears to us misleading since for any\ntwist the position of all the atoms in the nanorod is perfectly defined and\ntherefore prevents any loss of correlation. To clarify this point, it should be\nspecified that this apparent loss of correlation can not be ascribed to the\ntwisted state of the nanowire but is rather due to a limitation of the X-ray\npowder diffraction. Considering for instance coherent X-ray diffraction, we\nshow an example of high twist where the simulated diffractogram presents a\nclear signature of the perfect correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 15:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

The\ncurrent voltage (I-V) measurements of diode were carried out in dark and under\ndifferent illumination intensity at room temperature. The photoelectrical\nproperties of heterojunction based on BTB were investigated using the\nillumination intensity dependent I-V data. The results showed that photo\ncurrent of diode increases with the increase in light intensity. Also, the\nelectrical parameters of device were determined via I-V, and capacitance-\nvoltage (C-V), conductance-voltage (G-V) measurements at different frequencies.\nIt is observed that the excess capacitance is created at low frequencies due to\nthe contribution of interface states charge which can follow the alternative\ncurrent signal to capacitance. It is stated that, both the electrical\nphotoelectrical parameters of diode can be changed, and also the performance of\nthe device could be affected by the organic thin film interlayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

It requires that each process owns the same amount of\ncomputations, and also, the partitioning quality should be proper to reduce the\ncommunications among processes. When calculating the partial differential\nequations using adaptive finite element methods, the grid and the basis\nfunctions adjust in each iteration, which introduce load balancing issues. The\ngrid should be redistributed dynamically. This paper studies dynamic load\nbalancing algorithms and the implementation on the adaptive finite element\nplatform PHG.
