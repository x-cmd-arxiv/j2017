By\ncompactness arguments, local finiteness guarantees several regularity\nproperties. It is generally easy to find counterexamples to such regularity\nresults when the assumption of local finiteness is dropped. The present work\nfocuses on the following problem: determining whether these regularity\nproperties still hold when local finiteness is replaced by an assumption of\ntransitivity.\n  After recalling the locally finite situation, we show that there are Cayley\ngraphs with infinite generating systems that have infinite diameter but do not\ncontain any infinite geodesic ray. We also introduce a notion of generalised\ndiameter. The generalised diameter of a graph is either an ordinal or \"truly\ninfinite\" and captures the extension properties of geodesic paths. It is a\nfinite ordinal if and only if the usual diameter is finite, and in that case\nthe two notions agree. Besides, the generalised diameter is \"truly infinite\" if\nand only if the considered graph contains an infinite geodesic ray. We show\nthat there exist Cayley graphs of abelian groups of arbitrary generalised\ndiameter.\n  Finally, we build Cayley graphs of abelian groups that have isomorphic balls\nof radius R for every R but are not globally isomorphic. This enables us to\nconstruct a non-transitive graph such that for every R and any vertices u and\nv, the ball of centre u and radius R is isomorphic to that of centre v and same\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 16:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

These findings have revived interest in the hypothesis that\nprebiotically important molecules or even nascent life may have formed on Mars\nand been transferred to Earth. UV light plays a key role in prebiotic\nchemistry. Characterizing the early Martian surface UV environment is key to\nunderstanding how Mars compares to Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry.\n  Here, we present two-stream multi-layer calculations of the UV surface\nradiance on Mars at 3.9 Ga, to constrain the surface UV environment as a\nfunction of atmospheric state. We explore a wide range of atmospheric\npressures, temperatures and compositions, corresponding to the diversity of\nMartian atmospheric states consistent with available constraints. We include\nthe effects of clouds and dust. We calculate dose rates to quantify the effect\nof different atmospheric states on UV-sensitive prebiotic chemistry.\n  We find that for normative clear-sky CO2-H2O atmospheres, the UV environment\non young Mars is comparable to young Earth. This similarity is robust to\nmoderate cloud cover: thick clouds ($\\tau$>100) are required to significantly\naffect the Martian UV environment, because cloud absorption is degenerate with\natmospheric CO2. On the other hand, absorption from SO2, H2S, and dust is\nnondegenerate with CO2, meaning if they can build up to high levels, surface UV\nfluence will be suppressed. These absorbers have spectrally variable\nabsorption, meaning that their presence affects prebiotic pathways in different\nways. In particular, high SO2 environments may admit UV fluence that favors\npathways conducive to abiogenesis over pathways unfavorable to it. However,\nbetter measurements of the spectral quantum yields of these pathways are\nrequired to evaluate this hypothesis definitively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 16:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 18:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 10:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The\nconceptual geological models are represented by multiple-point statistics\ntraining images (TIs) featuring the expected lithological units and structural\npatterns. Information from an ensemble of TI realizations is used in two\ndifferent ways. First, dominant modes are identified by analysis of the\nfrequency content in the realizations, which drastically reduces the model\nparameter space in the frequency-amplitude domain. Second, the distributions of\nglobal, summary metrics (e.g. model roughness) are used to formulate a prior\nprobability density function.

The usefulness and applicability of this method is demonstrated on\ntwo case studies in which synthetic crosshole ground-penetrating radar\ntraveltime data are inverted to recover 2-D porosity fields.

In an experimental system of a freestanding two um p-Si\nbeam coated on one side with a thin (25 nm) ferromagnetic spin injection layer,\nwe use the self-heating 3 omega method to measure changes in electrical and\nthermal conductivity under the influence of a magnetic field.

Spin\npolarization leads to softening of phonon modes, a reduction in the group\nvelocity of acoustic modes, and a subsequent decrease in thermal conductivity\nat room temperature.

Phase-matched\ncomparison of the spectroscopically twinned SN 2012cu and SN 2011fe across 10\nepochs results in the best-fit color excess of (E(B-V), RMS) = (1.00, 0.03) and\ntotal-to-selective extinction ratio of (RV , RMS) = (2.95, 0.08) toward SN\n2012cu within its host galaxy.

These relics are thought to trace relativistic\nelectrons in the intracluster plasma accelerated by low-Mach number\ncollisionless shocks generated by cluster-cluster merger events. A\nlong-standing problem is how low-Mach number shocks can accelerate electrons so\nefficiently to explain the observed radio relics. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of a direct connection between a radio relic and a radio galaxy in\nthe merging galaxy cluster Abell 3411-3412. This discovery indicates that\nfossil relativistic electrons from active galactic nuclei are re-accelerated at\ncluster shocks. It also implies that radio galaxies play an important role in\ngoverning the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium in merging\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 04:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

In\nnon-fractionalized systems with only bosonic excitations, this pumping is\nquantified by a dynamical topological index that is a rational number --\nhighlighting its difference from the integer valued invariant underlying\nequilibrium chiral phases (e.g. quantum Hall systems).

A typical Galactic FRB would produce a\nmillisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the\nradio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell\nphones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global\narray of low-cost radio receivers.

Participating phones would continuously listen for\nand record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a\ncentral data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all\nparticipants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from\nan astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times\nreported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,\npotentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating\nat diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield\nthe dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within\nthe Galaxy.

As a result, collisions with\neach other, and with other astrophysical bodies, can occur. We calculate the\nrate and analyze the consequences of three classes of collisions, those\noccurring between a dilute axion star and: another dilute axion star, an\nordinary star, or a neutron star. In all cases we attempt to quantify the most\nimportant astrophysical uncertainties; we also pay particular attention to\nscenarios in which collisions lead to collapse of otherwise stable axion stars,\nand possible subsequent decay through number changing interactions. Collisions\nbetween two axion stars can occur with a high total rate, but the low relative\nvelocity required for collapse to occur leads to a very low total rate of\ncollapses. On the other hand, collisions between an axion star and an ordinary\nstar have a large rate, $\\Gamma_\\odot \\sim 3000$ collisions/year/galaxy, and\nfor sufficiently heavy axion stars, it is plausible that most or all such\ncollisions lead to collapse.

Finally, we\nrevisit the calculation of collision rates between axion stars and neutron\nstars, improving on previous estimates by taking cylindrical symmetry of the\nneutron star distribution into account. Collapse and subsequent decay through\ncollision processes, if occurring with a significant rate, can affect dark\nmatter phenomenology and the axion star mass distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 21:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 18:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The maximum of\nactivity was in 1998, and the variability in the continuum and lines seems to\nhave two periods of around 1200 and 2600 days, however these periodicities\nshould be taken with caution because of the red-noise. Beside these periods,\nthere are several short-term (1-5 days) flare-like events in the light-curves.\nThere are good correlations between the continuum fluxes and H{\\alpha} and\nH{\\beta} line fluxes, but significantly smaller correlation between the He II\nand continuum. We found that the time-lags between the continuum and broad\nlines are different for H{\\beta} (~20 l.d.) and H{\\alpha} (~3 l.d.), and that\nHe II also has a smaller lag (~2-3 l.d.). The H{\\alpha} and H{\\beta} line\nprofiles show a slight red asymmetry, and the broad line profiles did not\nchanged in the 20-year period.

It is found that the electrochemical capacitance in\nthe disordered systems exhibits universal behavior. In the case of single\nconducting channel, the electrochemical capacitance follows a symmetric\nGaussian distribution at weak disorders as expected from the random matrix\ntheory. In the strongly disordered regime, the distribution is found to be a\nsharply one-sided form with a nearly-constant tail in the large capacitance\nregion. This behavior is due to the existence of the necklace states in\ndisordered systems, which is characterized by the multi-resonance that gives\nrise to a large density of states. In addition, it is found that the necklace\nstate also enhances the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance in the case\nof single conducting channel. When the number of conducting channels increases,\nthe influence of necklace states becomes less important. For large number of\nconducting channels, the electrochemical capacitance fluctuation develops a\nplateau region in the strongly disordered regime. The plateau value is\nidentified as universal electrochemical capacitance fluctuation, which is\nindependent of system parameters such as disorder strength, Fermi energy,\ngeometric capacitance, and system size.

However, different from most of these existing\nmechanisms which assume the existence of only one data requester, we consider\nMCS systems with multiple data requesters, which are actually more common in\npractice. Specifically, our incentive mechanism is based on double auction, and\nis able to stimulate the participation of both data requesters and workers. In\nreal practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but\ninteracts with the data aggregation mechanism that aggregates workers' data.\nFor this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for\nmulti-requester MCS systems, consisting of the aforementioned incentive and\ndata aggregation mechanism.

To characterize the performance regime, we\npropose a unified framework analyzing the future 5G wireless networks over\ngeneralized shadowing/fading channels, in which the user association schemes\nbased on the strongest instantaneous received power (SIRP) and the strongest\naverage received power (SARP) can be studied, while NLoS/LoS transmissions and\nmulti-slop path loss model are considered.

The generalized Levenshtein\nbound (GLB) is a lower bound on the maximum aperiodic correlation sum of QCSSs.\nThe bounding expression of GLB is a fractional quadratic function of a weight\nvector $\\mathbf{w}$ and is expressed in terms of three additional parameters\nassociated with QCSS: the set size $K$, the number of channels $M$, and the\nsequence length $N$.

This is in line with the low number of infrared-quiet massive\nclumps and earlier findings that star formation, in particular for high-mass\nobjects is a fast, dynamic process. We propose a scenario in which massive\nclumps start to fragment and collapse before their final mass is accumulated\nindicating that strong self-gravity and global collapse is needed to build up\nrich clusters and the most massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 08:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid precoding structure for multiuser\nOFDM mmWave systems, which greatly simplifies the hybrid precoder design and is\nable to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder. In particular,\ntwo groups of phase shifters are combined to map the signals from radio\nfrequency (RF) chains to antennas. Then an effective hybrid precoding algorithm\nbased on alternating minimization (AltMin) is proposed, which will alternately\noptimize the digital and analog precoders. A major algorithmic innovation is a\nLASSO formulation for the analog precoder, which yields computationally\nefficient algorithms.

(1) In the case of K-Ba122, MHL of the\nunderdoped samples (x < 0.33) exhibits the second magnetization peak (SMP),\nwhich sustains high Jc at high H and high T, exceeding 10^5 A/cm2 at T = 25 K\nand H = 6 T for x = 0.30. On the other hand, SMP is missing in the optimally (x\n~ 0.36-0.40) and overdoped (x ~ 0.50) samples, and consequently Jc rapidly\ndecreases by more than one order of magnitude, although the change in Tc is\nwithin a few K. (2) For Co-Ba122, SMP is always present over the entire\nsuperconducting (SC) dome from the under (x ~ 0.05) to the overdoped (x ~ 0.12)\nregion. However, the magnitude of Jc significantly changes with x, exhibiting a\nsharp maximum at x ~ 0.057, which is a slightly underdoped composition for\nCo-Ba122. (3) For P-Ba122, the highest Jc is attained at x = 0.30 corresponding\nto the highest Tc composition. For the overdoped samples, MHL is characterized\nby SMP located close to the irreversibility field. Common to the three doping\nvariations, Jc becomes highest at the under-doping side of SC dome near the\nphase boundary between SC phase and the antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase.\nAlso, the peak appears in a narrow range of doping, distinct from the Tc dome\nwith broad maximum. These similarities in the three cases indicate that the\nobserved doping dependence of Jc is intrinsic to the BaFe2As2-based\nsuperconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 09:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

We consider three cross-hole ground-penetrating radar examples in\nwhich the new model proposal mechanism is employed within an extended\nMetropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion. The model proposal step\nis about 40 times faster than state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics\nresimulation techniques, the number of necessary MCMC steps is lower and the\nquality of the final model realizations is of similar quality. The model\nproposal mechanism is presently limited to 2-D fields, but the method is\ngeneral and can be applied to a wide range of subsurface settings and\ngeophysical data types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 11:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-09"}

Our goal is to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature with formaldehyde toward six star-forming regions in the LMC. Three\nrotational transitions of para-H2CO near 218 GHz were observed with the APEX\n12m telescope toward six star forming regions in the LMC. Those data are\ncomplemented by C18O 2-1 spectra.

This allows using geophysical data as indirect hydrological\nobservables, while the coupling with a flow- and transport simulator ensures\nphysical consistency. Future research avenues include investigating the\nvalidity of different coupling strategies at various scales, the spatial\nstatistics of near-surface petrophysical relationships, the influence of the\nmodel conceptualization, fully probabilistic joint inversions, and how to\ninclude complex prior information in the joint inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 13:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-09"}

The\nrecently developed Multi-try DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis with\nsampling from past states, MT-DREAM(ZS) is being used to infer, as closely and\nconsistently as possible, the posterior distribution of spatially distributed\nvadose zone soil moisture and/or porosity under saturated conditions.

We illustrate our approach using two\ndifferent case studies involving geophysical data from a synthetic water tracer\ninfiltration study and a real-world field study under saturated conditions. Our\nresults demonstrate that the DCT parameterization yields the most accurate\nestimates of distributed soil moisture for a large range of spatial\nresolutions, and superior MCMC convergence rates.

Current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinions\nrather than empirical evidences. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting\nthe first large-scale measurement study on Airbnb, using a crawled data set\ncontaining 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews.\nWe measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate and\nthe sharing economy. Among others, we find that Airbnb has reached a global yet\nheterogeneous coverage. The majority of its listings across many countries are\nentire homes, suggesting that Airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplace\nrather than a spare-room sharing platform. Analysis on star-ratings reveals\nthat there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward using\npositive words in reviews. The extent of such bias is greater than Yelp\nreviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. We investigate a\nkey issue---commercial hosts who own multiple listings on Airbnb---repeatedly\ndiscussed in the current debate. We find that their existence is prevalent,\nthey are early-movers towards joining Airbnb, and their listings are\ndisproportionately entire homes and located in the US.

A pronounced cancer\ndepressing activity towards at least two kinds of human cancer cells, namely\nbreast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human glioblastoma U87 cancer lines, was\ndemonstrated. After a short treatment at the thinly stratified self-organized\nplasma-liquid interface pattern, the cancer inhibiting media demonstrate well\npronounced depression and apoptosis activities towards tumor cells, not\nachievable without interfacial stratification of plasma jet to thin (of several\num) current filaments, which therefore play a pivotal (yet still not completely\nclear) role in building up the cancer inhibition properties. Moreover, thinly\nstratified, self-organized interfacial discharge is capable to efficiently\ncontrol the ROS and RNS concentrations in the cancer-inhibiting media, and in\nparticular, abnormal ROS/RNS ratios not achievable in discharges which do not\nform stratified thin-filament patterns could be obtained. These results were\nexplained in terms of interaction of thin plasma filaments of the\nself-organized pattern with gas and liquid, where the unusual interaction\nconditions (i.e., high surface-to-volume ratios etc.) cause accumulation of\nROS, RNS and other species in unusual ratios and concentrations, thus forming\npotentially efficient anti-cancer cocktail.

Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical\nshielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules\nunder 0.5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding\nand maintain temperatures of -25 $^{o}$C.

This is critical in making an excavation mission\nfeasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers\nevolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters.

In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are\nextremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and\nlong-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these\nshort simulations are in \"local equilibrium\" within the MSM states. However, in\nthe last over 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially\ndiscussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can\nbe detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM\nestimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these\nissues: We systematically analyze the estimation of Markov state models (MSMs)\nfrom short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the\nerror between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from\nmany short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained\neven from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag\ntimes and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model\n(OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that\ncorrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag\ntimes are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate\nthe exact eigenvalues or relaxation timescales of the system without estimating\nan MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the\ndiscretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular\ndynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration.\nThe improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA as of version 2.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 15:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Recursive Marginal Quantization of the\nEuler scheme has recently been proposed as an efficient numerical method for\nevaluating functionals of solutions of stochastic differential equations. This\nmethod involves recursively quantizing the conditional marginals of the\ndiscrete-time Euler approximation of the underlying process. By generalizing\nthis approach, we show that it is possible to perform recursive marginal\nquantization for two higher-order schemes: the Milstein scheme and a simplified\nweak order 2.0 scheme. As part of this generalization a simple matrix\nformulation is presented, allowing efficient implementation. We further extend\nthe applicability of recursive marginal quantization by showing how absorption\nand reflection at the zero boundary may be incorporated, when this is\nnecessary. To illustrate the improved accuracy of the higher order schemes,\nvarious computations are performed using geometric Brownian motion and its\ngeneralization, the constant elasticity of variance model. For both processes,\nwe show numerical evidence of improved weak order convergence and we compare\nthe marginal distributions implied by the three schemes to the known analytical\ndistributions. By pricing European, Bermudan and Barrier options, further\nevidence of improved accuracy of the higher order schemes is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 04:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

This new method can accurately and easily measure very low\npermeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock\nsample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock\nsample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high\npermeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional\nsteady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability\nas a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny\nmass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of\ntargeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops,\nsectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known\npermeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation\nprinciple in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using\nadditional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across\nthe first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to\nhigh permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to\nform a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the\nmeasurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in\nstudying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently,\nthe advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high\naccuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 20:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 07:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

One problematic feature\nof these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even\nnear-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively\nunaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical\npractices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are\npremised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random\neffects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious\nconvergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4\nunder two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary\ndependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both\ntypes of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to\ngenerate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random\neffects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as\nevidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is\nnot upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully\nspecified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016;\nCarpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost\nentirely in simulations of the same conditions. These results indicate that\nwhen there is known non-zero variance for all slopes and intercepts, under\nrealistic distributions of data and with moderate to severe imbalance, mixed\neffects models in lme4 have moderate to high non-convergence rates which can\ncause linguistic researchers to wrongfully exclude random effect terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 19:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}
