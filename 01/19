In this paper, we train, at large scale, two\nCNN architectures for the specific place recognition task and employ a\nmulti-scale feature encoding method to generate condition- and\nviewpoint-invariant features. To enable this training to occur, we have\ndeveloped a massive Specific PlacEs Dataset (SPED) with hundreds of examples of\nplace appearance change at thousands of different places, as opposed to the\nsemantic place type datasets currently available. This new dataset enables us\nto set up a training regime that interprets place recognition as a\nclassification problem. We comprehensively evaluate our trained networks on\nseveral challenging benchmark place recognition datasets and demonstrate that\nthey achieve an average 10% increase in performance over other place\nrecognition algorithms and pre-trained CNNs. By analyzing the network responses\nand their differences from pre-trained networks, we provide insights into what\na network learns when training for place recognition, and what these results\nsignify for future research in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 16:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

It\ngenerates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on support detection using\nprimal and dual information and root finding. We refer to the algorithm as SDAR\nfor brevity. Under a sparse Rieze condition on the design matrix and certain\nother conditions, we show that with high probability, the $\\ell_2$ estimation\nerror of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound\nin $O(\\sqrt{J}\\log(R))$ steps; and under a mutual coherence condition and\ncertain other conditions, the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ estimation error decays to the\noptimal error bound in $O(\\log(R))$ steps, where $J$ is the number of important\npredictors, $R$ is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients.\nComputational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is $O(np)$ per\niteration. Moreover the oracle least squares estimator can be exactly recovered\nwith high probability at the same cost if we know the sparsity level. We also\nconsider an adaptive version of SDAR to make it more practical in applications.\nNumerical comparisons with Lasso, MCP and greedy methods demonstrate that SDAR\nis competitive with or outperforms them in accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 16:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

The\ndynamics of the system are explored both in the absence and presence of\ndiffusion. The parameter space is fully classified in terms of the types and\nstability of the uniform steady state. In the absence of diffusion the results\non the classification of parameter space are supported by simulations of the\ncorresponding vector-field and some trajectories around the uniform steady\nstate. In the presence of diffusion, the main findings are the quantitative\nanalysis relating the domain-size with the reaction and diffusion rates and\ntheir corresponding influence on the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion system\nwhen perturbed in the neighbourhood of the uniform steady state. Theoretical\npredictions are supported by numerical simulations both in the presence as well\nas in the absence of diffusion. Conditions on the domain size with respect to\nthe diffusion and reaction rates are related to the types of diffusion-driven\ninstabilities namely Turing, Hopf and Transcritical types of bifurcations. The\nfirst condition is an upper bound on the area of a rectangular domain in terms\nof the diffusion and reaction rates, which forbids the existence of Hopf and\nTranscritical types of bifurcations, yet allowing Turing type instability to\noccur. The second condition (necessary) is a lower bound on the domain size in\nterms of the reaction and diffusion rates to give rise to Hopf and\nTranscritical types of bifurcations as well as Turing instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 18:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

Given two independent systems, a natural question\nis how to represent such a situation as a single test space. In other words,\nhow separate contextuality scenarios combine into a joint scenario. Under the\npremise that the the allowed probabilistic models satisfy the No Signalling\nprinciple, Foulis and Randall defined the unique possible way to compose two\ncontextuality scenarios. When composing strictly-more than two test spaces,\nhowever, a variety of possible composition methods have been conceived.\nNevertheless, all these formally-distinct composition methods appear to give\nrise to observationally equivalent scenarios, in the sense that the different\ncompositions all allow precisely the same sets of classical and quantum\nprobabilistic models.

The detection of this thermal component would provide\ninformation regarding the size and density stratification of the GRB progenitor\nstar. Photons from the cocoon are also inverse-Compton (IC) scattered by\nelectrons in the relativistic jet. We present the IC lightcurve and spectrum,\nby post-processing the results of the numerical simulations. The IC spectrum\nlies in 10 keV--MeV band for typical GRB parameters. The detection of this IC\ncomponent would provide an independent measurement of GRB jet Lorentz factor\nand it would also help to determine the jet magnetisation parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 19:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 02:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

There are two major channels to sell ad views.\nThey can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through guaranteed\ncontracts in advance. The former is also known as real-time bidding (RTB), in\nwhich media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single ad view\nand this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction\nmodel. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually\nprogrammatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to\ncustomise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we\npropose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our\nmodel, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests\nsequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a\nhidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to\naccept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be\nwell estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using\ninventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the\nupdated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off\nin RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable\nproperties. First, it is not limited to the demand arrival assumption. Second,\nit will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as\nthere are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected\nrevenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a\npublisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those\nfrom only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct\nsales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 19:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

We are particularly interested in the late phase evolution when the\nstrong shock transforms into a sound wave. We studied the energy partition\nduring such transition with different combinations of $E_{inj}$ and $t_b$. For\nan instantaneous outburst with $t_b\\rightarrow 0$, which corresponds to the\nextension of classic Sedov-Taylor solution with counter-pressure, the fraction\nof energy that can be carried away by sound waves is $\\lesssim$12% of\n$E_{inj}$.

This property is\nachieved by storing the information using a set of non-orthogonal quantum\nstates. The different drawers are realized by different orthogonal set of basis\nfor the measurement. Once the measurement is performed, the information in this\nbasis is retrieved. At the same time, due to wave function collapse the\ninformation in the other basis is lost and cannot be retrieved.

Computationally, the\nchallenge is shifted from the long-range solvers to the detection of the\ninterfaces and to the computation of the particle-interface distances. For\nthese tasks, we present linear-time algorithms that do not rely on global\ncommunication patterns. As a result, the DCM algorithm is suited for large\nsystems of particles and mas- sively parallel computers. To demonstrate its\npotential, we integrated DCM into the LAMMPS open-source molecular dynamics\npackage, and simulated large liquid/vapor systems on two supercomputers:\nSuperMuc and JUQUEEN. In all cases, the accuracy of DCM is comparable to the\ntraditional particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) algorithm, while the\nperformance is considerably superior for large numbers of particles.

Ceres was extended to proof schemata, which\nare templates for usual first-order proofs, with parameters for natural\nnumbers. However, while Ceres is known to be a complete cut-elimination\nalgorithm for first-order logic, it is not clear whether this holds for\nfirst-order schemata too: given in input a proof schema with cuts, does Ceres\nalways produce a schema for a cut-free proof? The difficult step is finding and\nrepresenting an appropriate refutation schema for the characteristic term\nschema of a proof schema. In this thesis, we progress in solving this problem\nby restricting Ceres to propositional schemata, which are templates for\npropositional proofs. By limiting adequately the expressivity of propositional\nschemata and proof schemata, we aim at providing a version of schematic Ceres\nwhich is a complete cut-elimination algorithm for propositional schemata. We\nfocus on one particular step of Ceres: resolution refutation schemata. First,\nwe prove that by naively adapting Ceres for first-order schemata to our case,\nwe end up with an incomplete algorithm. Then, we modify slightly the concept of\nresolution refutation schema: to refute a clause set, first we bring it to a\ngeneric form, and then we use a fixed refutation of that generic clause set.\nOur variation of schematic Ceres is the first step towards completeness with\nrespect to propositional schemata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 22:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

The goal of this work is to discuss the actual\nreversal of the optimal erasure which can serve as the basis for the Maxwell's\ndemon operating with ultimate thermodynamic efficiency as dictated by the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. The demon extracts $k_BT\\ln 2$ of heat from an\nequilibrium reservoir at temperature $T$ per one bit of information obtained\nabout the measured system used by the demon.

RANSAC\ndiscriminates outliers by randomly generating minimalistic sampled hypotheses\nand verifying their consensus over the input data. Its response is based on the\nsingle hypothesis that obtained the largest inlier support. In this article we\nshow that the resulting accuracy can be improved by aggregating all generated\nhypotheses. This yields RANSAAC, a framework that improves systematically over\nRANSAC and its state-of-the-art variants by statistically aggregating\nhypotheses. To this end, we introduce a simple strategy that allows to rapidly\naverage 2D transformations, leading to an almost negligible extra computational\ncost. We give practical applications on projective transforms and\nhomography+distortion models and demonstrate a significant performance gain in\nboth cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 01:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

The Mass-Velocity relation is the familiar Baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation(BTFR) and versions of the other three relations, using magnitude\nrather than baryonic mass, are also well known. These four observed\ncorrelations follow from a pair of more fundamental relations. First, the\ncentripetal acceleration at the edge of the stellar disk is proportional to the\nacceleration predicted by Newtonian physics and secondly, this acceleration is\na constant which is related to Milgrom's constant. The two primary relations\ncan be manipulated algebraically to generate the four observed correlations and\nallow little room for dark matter inside the radius of the stellar disk.

In particular we examine whether zero-mode\noperators analogous to Majorana zero-modes can be found in these models when\none introduces chiral parameters to break time reversal symmetry. The existence\nof such zero-modes implies $N$-fold degeneracies throughout the energy\nspectrum. We address the question directly through these degeneracies by\ncharacterising the entire energy spectrum using perturbation theory and exact\ndiagonalisation. We find that when $N$ is prime, and the length $L$ of the wire\nis finite, the spectrum exhibits degeneracies up to a splitting that decays\nexponentially with system size, for generic values of the chiral parameters.\nHowever, at particular parameter values (resonance points), band crossings\nappear in the unperturbed spectrum that typically result in a splitting of the\ndegeneracy at finite order. We find strong evidence that these preclude the\nexistence of strong zero-modes for generic values of the chiral parameters. In\nparticular we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the resonance points become\ndense in the chiral parameter space. When $N$ is not prime, the situation is\nqualitatively different, and degeneracies in the energy spectrum are split at\nfinite order in perturbation theory for generic parameter values, even when the\nlength of the wire $L$ is finite. Exceptions to these general findings can\noccur at special \"anti-resonant\" points. Here the evidence points to the\nexistence of strong zero modes and, in the case of the achiral point of the the\n$N=4$ model, we are able to construct these modes exactly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 01:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

The proposed method is based on\nGeneralized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) treating a metasurface as a\nspatial discontinuity. The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian\nelectric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, $\\chi_\\text{ee}$ and\n$\\chi_\\text{mm}$, respectively, and its resonant frequencies are periodically\nmodulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields are then\nexpressed in terms of Floquet modes, which when used with the GSTCs, lead to a\nsystem of field matrix equations.

The basic idea is to measure the distance between candidate concepts\nusing the PMING distance, a collaborative semantic proximity measure, i.e. a\nmeasure which can be computed by using statistical results from web search\nengine. Experiments show that the proposed technique can provide users with\nmore satisfying expansion results and improve the quality of web document\nretrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 06:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\n(SPH) method has been used in many of such simulations. Recently, however, it\nhas been shown that SPH cannot handle contact discontinuities or free surfaces\naccurately. There are several reasons for this problem. The first one is that\nSPH requires that the density is continuous and differentiable. The second one\nis that SPH does not have the consistency, and thus the accuracy is zeroth\norder in space. In addition, we cannot express accurate boundary conditions\nwith SPH. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-order scheme for\nparticle-based hydrodynamics of compress- ible fluid. Our method is based on\nkernel-weighted high-order fitting polynomial for intensive variables. With\nthis approach, we can construct a scheme which solves all of the three prob-\nlems described above. For shock capturing, we use a tensor form of\nvon-Neumann-Richtmyer artificial viscosity. We have applied our method to many\ntest problems and obtained excel- lent result. Our method is not conservative,\nsince particles do not have mass or energy, but only their densities.

Just as with the natural proofs notion of Razborov and Rudich for\nboolean circuit lower bounds, our notion of algebraically natural lower bounds\ncaptures nearly all lower bound techniques known. However, unlike the boolean\nsetting, there has been no concrete evidence demonstrating that this is a\nbarrier to obtaining super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic\ncircuits, as there is little understanding whether algebraic circuits are\nexpressive enough to support \"cryptography\" secure against algebraic circuits.\n  Following a similar result of Williams in the boolean setting, we show that\nthe existence of an algebraic natural proofs barrier is equivalent to the\nexistence of succinct derandomization of the polynomial identity testing\nproblem. That is, whether the coefficient vectors of polylog(N)-degree\npolylog(N)-size circuits is a hitting set for the class of poly(N)-degree\npoly(N)-size circuits. Further, we give an explicit universal construction\nshowing that if such a succinct hitting set exists, then our universal\nconstruction suffices.\n  Further, we assess the existing literature constructing hitting sets for\nrestricted classes of algebraic circuits and observe that none of them are\nsuccinct as given. Yet, we show how to modify some of these constructions to\nobtain succinct hitting sets. This constitutes the first evidence supporting\nthe existence of an algebraic natural proofs barrier.\n  Our framework is similar to the Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT) program of\nMulmuley and Sohoni, except that here we emphasize constructiveness of the\nproofs while the GCT program emphasizes symmetry.

Calculations became more complex, work had\nto be distributed over teams of researchers and due to automatization, some\naspects of the intermediate results became more difficult to identify.\n  In my talk I will not be very exhaustive, I will present examples from my\npersonal research only: (i) calculations of spin effects for the process e+ e-\nto tau+tau- gamma at Petra/PEP energies, calculations (with the help of the\n{\\tt Grace} system of Minami-tateya group) and phenomenology of spin amplitudes\nfor (ii) e+ e- to 4f and for (iii) e+ e- to nu_e bar nu_e gamma gamma\nprocesses, (iv) phenomenology of CP-sensitive observables for Higgs boson\nparity in H to tau+ tau- , tau+- to nu 2(3)pi cascade decays\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 08:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

This\nnecessary condition of stability is the constrained minimization of time- and\npath-ensemble-averaged amount of entropy produced per unit time inside the bulk\nof the system; for each system, constraints are provided by the equations of\nmotion. (Thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to identically vanishing amount\nof entropy produced in the bulk, and satisfies trivially this condition). Our\nclass of physical systems includes both macroscopic and mesoscopic systems: the\nproblems of stability of these systems are dual to each other. As particular\ncases, we retrieve some necessary criteria for stability of relaxed states\navailable in the literature concerning current filaments and plasmoids in a\nDense Plasma Focus, flashing ratchets, Brownian motors and dynamo-affected,\nconvection-ruled shells of Sun-like rotating stars - in the latter case, for\nexample, we retrieve the scaling of the average magnetic field to the\nreciprocal of Rossby number. Finally, we argue that the validity of the popular\n\"maximum entropy production principle\" is questionable in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 09:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

PRIVAPPROX provides three properties: (i)\nPrivacy: zero-knowledge privacy guarantees for users, a privacy bound tighter\nthan the state-of-the-art differential privacy; (ii) Utility: an interface for\ndata analysts to systematically explore the trade-offs between the output\naccuracy (with error-estimation) and query execution budget; (iii) Latency:\nnear real-time stream processing based on a scalable \"synchronization-free\"\ndistributed architecture.

One the\nmain unsolved questions is the geometry of the mass-loss process. Taking\nadvantage of the results from the Herschel Mass loss of Evolved StarS (MESS)\nprogramme, we initiated a coordinated effort to characterise the geometry of\nmass loss from evolved red giants at various spatial scales. For this purpose\nwe used the MID-infrared interferometric Instrument (MIDI) to resolve the inner\nenvelope of 14 asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) in the MESS sample. In this\ncontribution we present an overview of the interferometric data collected\nwithin the frame of our Large Programme, and we also add archive data for\ncompleteness. We studied the geometry of the inner atmosphere by comparing the\nobservations with predictions from different geometric models. Asymmetries are\ndetected for five O-rich and S-type, suggesting that asymmetries in the N band\nare more common among stars with such chemistry. We speculate that this fact is\nrelated to the characteristics of the dust grains. Except for one star, no\ninterferometric variability is detected, i.e. the changes in size of the shells\nof non-mira stars correspond to changes of the visibility of less than 10%. The\nobserved spectral variability confirms previous findings from the literature.\nThe detection of dust in our sample follows the location of the AGBs in the\nIRAS colour-colour diagram: more dust is detected around oxygen-rich stars in\nregion II and in the carbon stars in region VII. The SiC dust feature does not\nappear in the visibility spectrum of UAnt and SSct, which are two carbon stars\nwith detached shells. This finding has implications for the theory of SiC dust\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 13:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 15:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

In this\nwork, we propose a new regime to mitigate these drawbacks. We replace the\nglobal-based compressive sensing used in the existing $\\text{L}^2\\text{C}^2$ by\nthe local block (patch) based compressive sensing. We use a single sensor for\neach block, rather than for the entire image, thus forming a multiple but\nspatially parallel sensor $\\text{L}^2\\text{C}^2$. This new camera retains the\nadvantages of existing $\\text{L}^2\\text{C}^2$ while leading to the following\nadditional benefits: 1) Since each block can be very small, {\\em e.g.}$~8\\times\n8$ pixels, we only need to capture $\\sim 10$ measurements to achieve reasonable\nreconstruction. Therefore the capture time can be reduced significantly. 2) The\ncoding patterns used in each block can be the same, therefore the sensing\nmatrix is only of the block size compared to the entire image size in existing\n$\\text{L}^2\\text{C}^2$. This saves the memory requirement of the sensing matrix\nas well as speeds up the reconstruction. 3) Patch based image reconstruction is\nfast and since real time stitching algorithms exist, we can perform real time\nreconstruction. 4) These small blocks can be integrated to any desirable\nnumber, leading to ultra high resolution images while retaining fast capture\nrate and fast reconstruction. We develop multiple geometries of this block-wise\n$\\text{L}^2\\text{C}^2$ in this paper.

Usually\nthis pooling step uses the first-order statistics of frame-level action\npredictions. In this paper, we explore the advantages of using higher-order\ncorrelations; specifically, we introduce Higher-order Kernel (HOK) descriptors\ngenerated from the late fusion of CNN classifier scores from all the frames in\na sequence. To generate these descriptors, we use the idea of kernel\nlinearization. Specifically, a similarity kernel matrix, which captures the\ntemporal evolution of deep classifier scores, is first linearized into kernel\nfeature maps. The HOK descriptors are then generated from the higher-order\nco-occurrences of these feature maps, and are then used as input to a\nvideo-level classifier. We provide experiments on two fine-grained action\nrecognition datasets and show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 14:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

As the steady\nstates at rest are not relevant for blood flow, we construct two well-balanced\nhydrostatic reconstruction techniques designed to preserve low-Shapiro number\nsteady states that may occur in large network simulations. The Shapiro number S\nh = u/c is the equivalent of the Froude number for shallow water equations and\nthe Mach number for compressible Euler equations. The first is the low-Shapiro\nhydrostatic reconstruction (HR-LS), which is a simple and efficient method,\ninspired from the hydrostatic reconstruction technique (HR). The second is the\nsubsonic hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-S), adapted here to blood flow and\ndesigned to exactly preserve all subcritical steady states. We systematically\ncompare HR, HR-LS and HR-S in a series of single artery and arterial network\nnumerical tests designed to evaluate their well-balanced and wave-capturing\nproperties. The results indicate that HR is not adapted to compute blood flow\nin large arteries as it is unable to capture wave reflections and transmissions\nwhen large variations of the arteries' geometrical and mechanical properties\nare considered.

We therefore recommend using HR-LS for 1D blood flow\nsimulations in large arterial network simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 14:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

In this paper, we\nanalyze two two-dimensional deterministic fluid models that incorporate\ncustomer choice behavior based on delayed queue length information with time\nvarying arrivals.

This reduces the latency of communication between a user\ndevice and the cloud, and is the premise of 'fog computing' defined in this\npaper. The aim of this paper is to highlight the feasibility and the benefits\nin improving the Quality-of-Service and Experience by using fog computing. For\nan online game use-case, we found that the average response time for a user is\nimproved by 20% when using the edge of the network in comparison to using a\ncloud-only model. It was also observed that the volume of traffic between the\nedge and the cloud server is reduced by over 90% for the use-case.

Using the properties of radially quantized conformal\nfield theories and the operator-state correspondence, we glean information on\nsome points. The Higuchi bound on the masses of spin-s states in de Sitter is a\ndirect consequence of reflection positivity in radially quantized CFT$_3$ and\nthe fact that scaling dimensions of operators are energies of states. The\npartial massless states appearing in de Sitter correspond from the boundary\nCFT$_3$ perspective to boundary states with highest weight for the conformal\ngroup. We discuss inflationary consistency relations and the role of asymptotic\nsymmetries which transform asymptotic vacua to new physically inequivalent\nvacua by generating long perturbation modes. We show that on the CFT$_3$ side,\nasymptotic symmetries have a nice quantum mechanics interpretation. For\ninstance, acting with the asymptotic dilation symmetry corresponds to evolving\nstates forward (or backward) in \"time\" and the charge generating the asymptotic\nsymmetry transformation is the Hamiltonian itself. Finally, we investigate the\nsymmetries of anisotropic inflation and show that correlators of\nfour-dimensional free scalar fields can be reproduced in the dual picture by\nconsidering an isotropic three-dimensional boundary enjoying dilation symmetry,\nbut with a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the boundary stress-energy\nmomentum tensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 15:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

It requires that any execution of the data structure is\njustified by a linearization --- a linear order on operations satisfying the\ndata structure's sequential specification. Proving linearizability is often\nchallenging because an operation's position in the linearization order may\ndepend on future operations. This makes it very difficult to incrementally\nconstruct the linearization in a proof.\n  We propose a new proof method that can handle data structures with such\nfuture-dependent linearizations. Our key idea is to incrementally construct not\na single linear order of operations, but a partial order that describes\nmultiple linearizations satisfying the sequential specification. This allows\ndecisions about the ordering of operations to be delayed, mirroring the\nbehaviour of data structure implementations.

These events can be caused by run-time\nconfiguration changes, such as a screen rotation, and by context-switches, such\nas a switch from one app to another. When a stop-start event occurs, Android\nsaves the state of the app, handles the event, and finally restores the saved\nstate. To let Android save and restore the state correctly, apps must provide\nthe appropriate support. Unfortunately, Android developers often implement this\nsupport incorrectly, or do not implement it at all. This bad practice makes\napps to incorrectly react to stop-start events, thus generating what we defined\ndata loss problems, that is Android apps that lose user data, behave\nunexpectedly, and crash due to program variables that lost their values. Data\nloss problems are difficult to detect because they might be observed only when\napps are in specific states and with specific inputs.

We start by defining the action of a disformal\ntransformation in the tangent space. Then, we take advantage of the great\neconomy of means of the language of differential forms to compute the full\ntransformation of Horndeski's theory under general disformal transformations.\nWe obtain that Horndeski's action maps onto itself modulo a reduced set of\nnon-Horndeski Lagrangians. These new Lagrangians are found to be invariant\nunder disformal transformation that depend only in the first derivatives of the\nscalar. Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when\nexpressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended\nScalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different\norbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal\ntransformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal\nHorndeski orbits. In addition, we consider generalizations of this framework.\nWe find that there are possible well-defined extended disformal transformations\nthat have not been considered in the literature. However, they generically\ncannot link Horndeski theory with EST theories. Finally, we study further\ngeneralizations in which extra fields with different spin are included.
