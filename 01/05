This is\nachieved by exploiting the freedom for the choice of the starting point of the\nall-order perturbation theory in the inter-cluster hopping. The proposed\nconserving CPT is a self-consistent propagation scheme which respects the\nconservation of energy, particle number and spin, which treats short-range\ncorrelations exactly up to the linear scale of the cluster, and which\nrepresents a mean-field-like approach on length scales beyond the cluster size.\nUsing Green's functions, conservation laws are formulated as local continuity\nequations for the local spin-dependent particle and the doublon density. We\nconsider them as conditional equations to self-consistently fix the\ntime-dependent intra-cluster one-particle parameters. Thanks to the intrinsic\ncausality of the CPT, this can be set up as a step-by-step time propagation\nscheme with a computational effort scaling linearly with the maximum\npropagation time and exponentially in the cluster size. As a proof of concept,\nwe consider the dynamics of the two-dimensional, particle-hole-symmetric\nHubbard model following a weak interaction quench by simply employing two-site\nclusters only. Conservation laws are satisfied by construction. We demonstrate\nthat enforcing them has strong impact on the dynamics. While the doublon\ndensity is strongly oscillating within plain CPT, a monotonic relaxation is\nobserved within the conserving CPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 16:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 15:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

However, operating systems often fall victim to\nsoftware attacks, compromising security of applications as well. To overcome\nthis dependency, Intel introduced SGX, which allows to protect application code\nagainst a subverted or malicious OS by running it in a hardware-protected\nenclave. However, SGX lacks support for generic trusted I/O paths to protect\nuser input and output between enclaves and I/O devices.\n  This work presents SGXIO, a generic trusted path architecture for SGX,\nallowing user applications to run securely on top of an untrusted OS, while at\nthe same time supporting trusted paths to generic I/O devices. To achieve this,\nSGXIO combines the benefits of SGX's easy programming model with traditional\nhypervisor-based trusted path architectures. Moreover, SGXIO can tweak insecure\ndebug enclaves to behave like secure production enclaves. SGXIO surpasses\ntraditional use cases in cloud computing and makes SGX technology usable for\nprotecting user-centric, local applications against kernel-level keyloggers and\nlikewise. It is compatible to unmodified operating systems and works on a\nmodern commodity notebook out of the box.

From the\nbeginnings of metaphysics and the first classical approaches to magnetic poles\nand streamlines of the field, it has inspired modern physics on its way to the\nclassical field description of electrodynamics, and further to the quantum\nmechanical description of internal degrees of freedom of elementary particles.\nMeanwhile, magnetic manifestations have posed and still do pose complex and\noften controversially debated questions. This regards so various and utterly\ndistinct topics as quantum spin systems and the grand unification theory. This\nmay be foremost caused by the fact that all of these effects are based on\ncorrelated structures, which are induced by the interplay of dynamics and\nelementary interactions. It is strongly correlated systems that certainly\nrepresent one of the most fascinating and universal fields of research. In\nparticular, low dimensional systems are in the focus of interest, as they\nreveal strongly pronounced correlations of counterintuitive nature. As regards\nthis framework, the quantum Hall effect must be seen as one of the most\nintriguing and complex problems of modern solid state physics. Even after two\ndecades and the same number of Nobel prizes, it still keeps researchers of\nnearly all fields of physics occupied. In spite of seminal progress, its\ninherent correlated order still lacks understanding on a microscopic level.\nDespite this, it is obvious that the phenomenon is thoroughly fundamental of\nnature.

Aims: The aim of this paper is\nto probe to what extent the choice of reflection and continuum models (and\nuncertainties therein) can affect the conclusions about the disk parameters\ninferred from the reflection component. To this aim we re-analyze all the\navailable public NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Ser X-1 is a well studied source, its\nspectrum has been observed by several instruments, and is therefore one of the\nbest sources for this study. Methods: We use slightly different continuum and\nreflection models with respect to those adopted in literature for this source.\nIn particular we fit the iron line and other reflection features with\nself-consistent reflection models as reflionx (with a power-law illuminating\ncontinuum modified with a high energy cutoff to mimic the shape of the incident\nComptonization spectrum) and rfxconv. With these models we fit NuSTAR and\nXMM-Newton spectra yielding consistent spectral results. Results: Our results\nare in line with those already found by Miller et al. (2013) but less extreme.\nIn particular, we find the inner disk radius at about 13 R_g and an inclination\nangle with respect to the line of sight of about 27 deg. We conclude that,\nwhile the choice of the reflection model has little impact on the disk\nparameters, as soon as a self-consistent model is used, the choice of the\ncontinuum model can be important in the precise determination of the disk\nparameters from the reflection component. Hence broad-band X-ray spectra are\nhighly preferable to constrain the continuum and disk parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 16:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Our first\ncontribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into\nprivate incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the\nprivate batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this\nconstruction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for\nthe private incremental regression problem.

In this work, we\nattempt to address this problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission\nspectra. We introduce POSEIDON, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval\nalgorithm including generalised inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this\nprescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and\nprominent molecular abundances.

Following this event, the galaxy is able to prevent\nfurther SF and stay quiescent via a maintenance mode. We test whether such a\nquenching event is truly necessary using a simple model of quiescence. In this\nmodel, hot gas (all gas above a temperature threshold) in a $\\sim10^{12}\nM_{\\odot}$ halo mass galaxy at redshift $z\\sim3$ is prevented from cooling. The\ncool gas continues to form stars at a decreasing rate and the galaxy stellar\nmass, morphology, velocity dispersion and position on the color magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) proceed to evolve.

Nevertheless, some of these techniques are still\nused to simulate the coronae and winds of solar analogs.

Our recommendation is that polytropic models, which are used to\nestimate mass-loss rates and other parameters of solar analogs, must be first\ncalibrated with solar observations. Alternatively, these models can be\ncalibrated with models that capture more detailed physics of the solar corona\n(such as the AWSOM model), and that can reproduce solar observations in a\nconsistent manner.

Due to the lack of an\nefficient multisplit on GPUs, programmers often choose to implement multisplit\nwith a sort. One way is to first generate an auxiliary array of bucket IDs and\nthen sort input data based on it. In case smaller indexed buckets possess\nsmaller valued keys, another way for multisplit is to directly sort input data.\nBoth methods are inefficient and require more work than necessary: the former\nrequires more expensive data movements while the latter spends unnecessary\neffort in sorting elements within each bucket. In this work, we provide a\nparallel model and multiple implementations for the multisplit problem. Our\nprincipal focus is multisplit for a small (up to 256) number of buckets. We use\nwarp-synchronous programming models and emphasize warp-wide communications to\navoid branch divergence and reduce memory usage. We also hierarchically reorder\ninput elements to achieve better coalescing of global memory accesses. On a\nGeForce GTX 1080 GPU, we can reach a peak throughput of 18.93 Gkeys/s (or 11.68\nGpairs/s) for a key-only (or key-value) multisplit. Finally, we demonstrate how\nmultisplit can be used as a building block for radix sort. In our\nmultisplit-based sort implementation, we achieve comparable performance to the\nfastest GPU sort routines, sorting 32-bit keys (and key-value pairs) with a\nthroughput of 3.0 G keys/s (and 2.1 Gpair/s).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 01:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 00:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

Therefore, when the pulsar travels inside such regions, a\nnon-negligible Lorentz force is experienced by the current sheets, which tends\nto pull them apart at the critical line. As breakage occurs, instabilities\nensue that burst the bubble, allowing closed field lines to snap open and\nrelease large amounts of electromagnetic energy, sufficient to power fast radio\nbursts (FRBs).

Modeling this network as a uniform binomial\npoint process (BPP), we derive the downlink coverage probability of a reference\nreceiver located at an arbitrary position on the ground assuming Nakagami-$m$\nfading for all wireless links. The reference receiver is assumed to connect to\nits closest transmitting node as is usually the case in cellular systems. After\nderiving the distribution of distances from the reference receiver to the\nserving and interfering nodes, we derive an exact expression for downlink\ncoverage probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of\ninterference power distribution. In the downlink of this system, it is not\nunusual to encounter scenarios in which the line-of-sight (LOS) component is\nsignificantly stronger than the reflected multipath components.

It is postulated that the strongly coupled nonperturbative\nsector has a holographic dual in the form of a classical gravity theory in the\nlarge N limit, and the perturbative fields determine the gravitational boundary\nconditions. In this work, we pursue a fundamental derivation of this framework\nparticularly showing how perturbative physics by itself can determine the\nholographic dual of the infrared, and also the interactions between the\nperturbative and the holographic sectors. We firstly demonstrate that the\ninteractions between the two sectors can be constrained through the existence\nof a conserved local energy-momentum tensor for the full system up to hard-soft\ncoupling constants. As an illustration, we set up a bi-holographic toy theory\nwhere both the UV and IR sectors are strongly coupled and holographic with\ndistinct classical gravity duals.

The payoff matrix in this model represents the complicated\ninteractions between selfish individuals, and the mean force imposed on an\nindividual is given by considering the impacts of neighborhood payoff, walls,\nand defector herding. Each passer-by moves to his selected location according\nto the Fermi function, and the average velocity of pedestrian flow is defined\nas a function of the motion rule. Two pedestrian types are included:\ncooperators, who adhere to the evacuation instructions; and defectors, who\nignore the rules and act individually. It is observed that the escape time\nincreases with the panic level, and the system remains smooth for a low panic\nlevel, but exhibits three stages for a high panic level. We prove that the\npanic level determines the dynamics of this system, and the initial density of\ncooperators has a negligible impact. The system experiences three phases, a\nsingle phase of cooperator, a mixed two-phase pedestrian, and a single phase of\ndefector sequentially as the panic level upgrades. The phase transition has\nbeen proven basically robust to the changes of empty site contribution, wall's\npressure, and noise amplitude in the motion rule. It is further shown that\npedestrians derive the greatest benefit from overall cooperation, but are\ntrapped in the worst situation if they are all defectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 08:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

In particular, $\\mathfrak{t}$ induces a quasi-isomorphism between\n$CE^*(\\Lambda)$ and the cobar of the Floer homology of $L$, $\\Omega CF_*(L)$.\nWe use the duality result to show that under certain connectivity and locally\nfiniteness assumptions, $CE^*(\\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to $C_{-*}(\\Omega\nL)$ for any Lagrangian filling $L$ of $\\Lambda$. Our constructions have\ninterpretations in terms of wrapped Floer cohomology after versions of\nLagrangian handle attachments. In particular, we outline a proof that\n$CE^{\\ast}(\\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to the wrapped Floer cohomology of a\nfiber disk $C$ in the Weinstein domain obtained by attaching\n$T^{\\ast}(\\Lambda\\times[0,\\infty))$ to $X$ along $\\Lambda$ (or, in the\nterminology of arXiv:1604.02540 the wrapped Floer cohomology of $C$ in $X$ with\nwrapping stopped by $\\Lambda$).

We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven\nsimulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case\nreaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number\nRm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is\nfeasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis\nhighlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo\ntheory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it\nalso unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this\nstrong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one\norder of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of\nmagnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast\nexists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the\ncylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In\nthe interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a\nvigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the\nformation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell.\nFurthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light\nmaterial within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there.\nTorsional Alfv{\\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the\ntangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent\ncylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic\nenergy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the\nlow-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly\nlarge-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations,\nwithout any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further\nreveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance\nbetween Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align,\nminimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance\nbetween magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live\nat an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance --\ninvolving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3})\nquasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic\nintensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 12:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 12:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our\nlight curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for\n14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were\nbetter than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,\nwhich makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it\ncontinuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to\ndetect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 13:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

The planar problem of magnetostriction in an MAE with soft\nmagnetic inclusions in the form of a thin disk (platelet) having the magnetic\nanisotropy in the plane of this disk is solved analytically. An external\nmagnetic field acts with torques on magnetic filler particles, creates\nmechanical stresses in the vicinity of inclusions, induces shear strain and\nincreases the effective shear modulus of these composite materials. It is shown\nthat the largest effect of the magnetic field on the effective shear modulus\nshould be expected in MAEs with soft elastomer matrices, where the shear\nmodulus of the matrix is less than the magnetic anisotropy constant of\ninclusions. It is derived that the effective shear modulus is non-linearly\ndependent on the external magnetic field and approaches the saturation value in\nmagnetic fields exceeding the field of particle anisotropy. It is shown that\nmodel calculations of the effective shear modulus correspond to a\nphenomenological definition of effective elastic moduli and magnetoelastic\ncoupling constants.

Up to now, while TNE is the standard\ninterpretation of coronal rain, the long-term periodic evolution predicted by\nsimulations has never been observed yet. However, the detection of long-period\nintensity pulsations (periods of several hours) has been recently reported with\nSoHO/EIT, and this phenomenon appears to be very common in loops. Moreover, the\nthree intensity-pulsation events that we recently studied with SDO/AIA show\nstrong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In the present paper, a realistic loop\ngeometry from LFFF extrapolations is used as input to 1D hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our simulations show that for the present loop geometry, the\nheating has to be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyse in detail one\nparticular simulation that reproduces the average thermal behavior of one of\nthe pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We compare the properties of this\nsimulation with the properties deduced from the observations. The magnetic\ntopology of the LFFF extrapolations points to the presence of sites of\npreferred reconnection at one footpoint, supporting the presence of asymmetric\nheating. In addition, we can reproduce the temporal large-scale intensity\nproperties of the pulsating loops. This simulation further strengthens the\ninterpretation of the observed pulsations as signatures of TNE. This thus gives\nimportant information on the heating localization and time scale for these\nloops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 13:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

It is well\nknown that the algorithm works well in the random \\emph{planted bisection\nmodel} -- the standard class of graphs for analysis minimum bisection and\nrelevant problems. In 2001 Feige and Kilian posed the question if Boppana's\nalgorithm works well in the semirandom model by Blum and Spencer. In our paper\nwe answer this question affirmatively.

At a\nfixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher $D_n4000$ have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. $D_n4000$ is a proxy for stellar population age,\nthus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a\ndynamical mass estimator, $\\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar mass, $\\sigma^2 R$\ndepends on $D_n4000$. The S\\'ersic index is also correlated with $D_n4000$. The\ndependence of $\\sigma^2 R$ and S\\'ersic index on $D_n4000$ suggests that\nquiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems.

After accounting for non-homologous\ngalactic structure, we measure $M_\\ast \\propto M_d^{0.998 \\pm 0.004}$ where\n$M_\\ast$ is the stellar mass and $M_d$ is the dynamical mass derived from the\nvelocity dispersion and size; stellar mass is directly proportional to\ndynamical mass. Quiescent galaxies appear to be in approximate virial\nequilibrium and deviations of the fundamental plane parameters from the\nexpected virial relation may result from mass-to-light ratio variations,\nselection effects and the non-homology of quiescent galaxies. We infer the\nredshift evolution of velocity dispersion and size for galaxies in our sample\nassuming purely passive evolution. The inferred evolution is inconsistent with\ndirect measurements at higher redshifts. Thus quiescent galaxies do not\npassively evolve.

While several\napproaches have been proposed for dependent data fusion (e.g., based on copula\ntheory), their advantages come at a high price in terms of computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we treat the detection problem with compressive\nsensing (CS) where compression at each sensor is achieved via low dimensional\nrandom projections. CS has recently been exploited to solve detection problems\nunder various assumptions on the signals of interest, however, its potential\nfor dependent data fusion has not been explored adequately. We exploit the\ncapability of CS to capture statistical properties of uncompressed data in\norder to compute decision statistics for detection in the compressed domain.\nFirst, a Gaussian approximation is employed to perform likelihood ratio (LR)\nbased detection with compressed data. In this approach, inter-modal dependence\nis captured via a compressed version of the covariance matrix of the\nconcatenated (temporally and spatially) uncompressed data vector. We show that,\nunder certain conditions, this approach with a small number of compressed\nmeasurements per node leads to enhanced performance compared to detection with\nuncompressed data using widely considered suboptimal approaches. Second, we\ndevelop a nonparametric approach where a decision statistic based on the second\norder statistics of uncompressed data is computed in the compressed domain. The\nsecond approach is promising over other related nonparametric approaches and\nthe first approach when multimodal data is highly correlated at the expense of\nslightly increased computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 15:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 20:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

PSWS will make five entirely\nnew toolkits accessible to the research community and to industrial partners\nplanning for space missions: a general planetary space weather toolkit, as well\nas three toolkits dedicated to the following key planetary environments: Mars,\ncomets, and outer planets. This will give the European planetary science\ncommunity new methods, interfaces, functionalities and/or plugins dedicated to\nplanetary space weather in the tools and models available within the partner\ninstitutes. It will also create a novel event-diary toolkit aiming at\npredicting and detecting planetary events like meteor showers and impacts. A\nvariety of tools are available for tracing propagation of planetary and/or\nsolar events through the Solar System and modelling the response of the\nplanetary environment (surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres)\nto those events. But these tools were not originally designed for planetary\nevent prediction and space weather applications. PSWS will provide the\nadditional research and tailoring required to apply them for these purposes.\nPSWS will be to review, test, improve and adapt methods and tools available\nwithin the partner institutes in order to make prototype planetary event and\nspace weather services operational in Europe at the end of the programme. To\nachieve its objectives PSWS will use a few tools and standards developed for\nthe Astronomy Virtual Observatory (VO). This paper gives an overview of the\nproject together with a few illustrations of prototype services based on VO\nstandards and protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 15:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

However, inversion of geophysical data\nalone cannot unveil the distribution of hydraulic conductivity. Jointly\ninverting geophysical and hydrological data allows us to benefit from the\nadvantages of geophysical imaging and, at the same time, recover the\nhydrological parameters of interest. We have applied a coupling strategy\nbetween geophysical and hydrological models that is based on structural\nsimilarity constraints.

This structural coupling does not require introducing a potentially\nweak, unknown, and nonstationary petrophysical relation to link the models. The\nmethod was first tested on synthetic data sets and then applied to two\ncombinations of geophysical/hydrological data sets from a saturated gravel\naquifer in northern Switzerland. Crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR)\ntraveltimes were jointly inverted with hydraulic tomography data, as well as\nwith tracer mean arrival times, to retrieve the 2D distribution of GPR\nvelocities and hydraulic conductivities. In the synthetic case, incorporating\nthe GPR data through a joint inversion framework improved the resolution and\nlocalization properties of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field.

This system has the advantage of allowing several disks at the\nsame level, and thus multi-jugate config- urations. We provide partial results\ntoward proving that the attractor for S is entirely composed of rhombic tilings\nand is a strongly normally attracting branched manifold and conjecture that\nthis attractor persists topologically in nearby systems. A key tool in\nunderstanding the geometry of tilings and the dynamics of S is the concept of\npri- mordia front, which is a closed ring of tangent disks around the cylinder.\nWe show how fronts determine the dynamics, including transitions of parastichy\nnumbers, and might explain the Fibonacci number of petals often encountered in\ncompositae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 20:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

We report an unprecedented nano strain-amplifier structure with an\nultra-high residual strain up to 8% utilizing the natural residual stress\nbetween epitaxial 3C SiC and Si. In addition, the applied strain can be tuned\nby changing the dimensions of the amplifier structure. The possibility of\nintroducing such a controllable and ultra-high strain will open the door to\ninvestigating the physics of SiC in large strain regimes, and the development\nof ultra sensitive mechanical sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 02:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

However, this flexibility has its\nprice: As the R interpreter has no information about the expected variable\ntype, many base functions automatically convert the input instead of raising an\nexception. Unfortunately, this frequently leads to runtime errors deeper down\nthe call stack which obfuscates the original problem and renders debugging\nchallenging. Even worse, unwanted conversions can remain undetected and skew or\ninvalidate the results of a statistical analysis. As a resort, assertions can\nbe employed to detect unexpected input during runtime and to signal\nunderstandable and traceable errors.\n  The package \"checkmate\" provides a plethora of functions to check the type\nand related properties of the most frequently used R objects and variable\ntypes. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any unnecessary performance\noverhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise, well-tested\nassertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Furthermore,\ncheckmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework \"testthat\" by\nextending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered C\nroutines are available for package developers to perform assertions on\narbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in\nC) in compiled code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 09:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The total solvation response, as measured by the probe is\ndecomposed in terms of its interactions with (i) protein core, (ii) side-chain\natoms and (iii) water molecules. Significant anti cross-correlations among\nthese contributions are observed as a result of side-chain assisted energy flow\nbetween protein core and hydration layer, which is important for the proper\nfunctionality of a protein. It is also observed that there are rotationally\nfaster as well as slower water molecules than that of bulk solvent, which are\nconsidered to be responsible for the multitude of timescales that are observed\nin solvation dynamics. We also establish that slow solvation derives a\nsignificant contribution from protein side-chain fluctuations.

Matrix denoising methods are generally based on shrinkage or\nthresholding of singular values with a predetermined shrinkage parameter or\nthreshold. However, most of the existing adaptive shrinkage methods use\nmultiple parameters to obtain a better flexibility in shrinkage. The optimal\nvalue of these parameters using either cross-validation or Stein's principle.\nIn both the cases, the iterative estimation of various parameters render the\nexisting shrinkage methods computationally latent for most of the real-time\napplications. This paper presents an efficient data dependent shrinkage\nfunction whose parameters are estimated using Stein's principle but in a\nnon-iterative manner, thereby providing a comparatively faster shrinkage\nmethod. In addition, the proposed estimator is found to be consistent with the\nrecently proposed asymptotically optimal estimators using the results from\nrandom matrix theory. The experimental studies on artificially generated\nlow-rank matrices and on the magnetic resonant imagery data, show the efficacy\nof the proposed denoising method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 02:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 04:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}
