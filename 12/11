For example,\nGottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called stabilizer\ncircuits, which can be simulated efficiently using group-theory techniques and\ninsights from quantum physics. Realistic circuits enriched with quantum\nerror-correcting codes and fault-tolerant procedures are dominated by\nstabilizer subcircuits and contain a relatively small number of non-Clifford\ncomponents. Therefore, we develop new data structures and algorithms that\nfacilitate parallel simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more\ncompact storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated\nbookkeeping. Our implementation, called Quipu, simulates certain quantum\narithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial time\nand space for equal superpositions of $n$-qubits. On such instances, known\nlinear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the (state-of-the-art)\nBDD-based simulator QuIDDPro, take exponential time. We simulate quantum\nFourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant circuits using Quipu, and the\nresults demonstrate that our stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms\nQuIDDPro in all cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware\nsimulations of quantum circuits were difficult to parallelize, we demonstrate\nthat Quipu can be parallelized with a nontrivial computational speedup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 16:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Graph CNNs are attracting\nincreasing attention due to their effectiveness and efficiency. However, the\nexisting convolution approaches focus only on regular data forms and require\nthe transfer of the graph or key node neighborhoods of the graph into the same\nfixed form. During this transfer process, structural information of the graph\ncan be lost, and some redundant information can be incorporated. To overcome\nthis problem, we propose the disordered graph convolutional neural network\n(DGCNN) based on the mixed Gaussian model, which extends the CNN by adding a\npreprocessing layer called the disordered graph convolutional layer (DGCL). The\nDGCL uses a mixed Gaussian function to realize the mapping between the\nconvolution kernel and the nodes in the neighborhood of the graph. The output\nof the DGCL is the input of the CNN. We further implement a\nbackward-propagation optimization process of the convolutional layer by which\nwe incorporate the feature-learning model of the irregular node neighborhood\nstructure into the network. Thereafter, the optimization of the convolution\nkernel becomes part of the neural network learning process. The DGCNN can\naccept arbitrary scaled and disordered neighborhood graph structures as the\nreceptive fields of CNNs, which reduces information loss during graph\ntransformation. Finally, we perform experiments on multiple standard graph\ndatasets.

Inspired by recent advances in image filtering, we propose\na new geometry filtering technique called static/dynamic filter, which utilizes\nboth static and dynamic guidances to achieve state-of-the-art results. The\nproposed filter is based on a nonlinear optimization that enforces smoothness\nof the signal while preserving variations that correspond to features of\ncertain scales.

The\nfilter can be applied to mesh face normals followed by vertex position update,\nto achieve scale-aware and feature-preserving filtering of mesh geometry.

Above a\ncritical value, the ion temperature gradient leads to the growth of a\nmicroinstability -- the ion temperature gradient mode -- that often dominates\nthe ion energy transport. It has recently been discovered that energetic ions\ngenerated by auxiliary heating may reduce the growth of this instability. By\napplying the gyrokinetic formalism and performing linear simulations using the\nlocal continuum gyrokinetic code GS2, we explore the linear physics of this\nstabilising effect. In order to isolate important effects due to the presence\nof fast ions, we make use of the flexibility of GS2 to change the plasma and\nmagnetic geometry parameters independently. We assess the possibility to\nneglect magnetic geometry changes to simplify the analysis, by investigating\nits contribution to the stabilising effect. For the cases studied we find that\nthe Shafranov shift and safety factor profile might have to be taken into\naccount. For fixed fast ion density and temperature a destabilising influence\nof their density gradient is found, while the high fast ion temperature\ngradient is stabilising, both as predicted by theoretical models. A large part\nof the observed stabilisation comes from the fast ion contribution to the\nplasma $\\beta$. In addition, the effect of $\\beta$ is enhanced because of the\nlarge density and temperature gradients of the fast ions. We investigate the\nrole of hot ion mass and charge in order to evaluate the stabilisation of\ndifferent types of hot ions. Also the possibility of adjusting the electron and\nion profiles to account for the presence of fast ions without including them as\na kinetic species, is considered. Finally, quasi-linear theory is invoked for\nlinking linear results to saturated values of the nonlinear heat fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 20:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

ATM has important\napplications to many real-world engineering problems (e.g., manufacturing\noptimization, product design, molecular engineering), where the objective to\noptimize is black-box and expensive, and the design space is inherently\ndiscrete. One weakness of existing methods is that they are not robust: these\nmethods perform well under certain assumptions, but yield poor results when\nsuch assumptions (which are difficult to verify in black-box problems) are\nviolated. ATM addresses this via the use of marginal tail means for\noptimization, which combines both rank-based and model-based methods. The\ntrade-off between rank- and model-based optimization is tuned by first\nidentifying important main effects and interactions, then finding a good\ncompromise which best exploits additive structure. By adaptively tuning this\ntrade-off from data, ATM provides improved robust optimization over existing\nmethods, particularly in problems with (i) a large number of factors, (ii)\nunordered factors, or (iii) experimental noise.

To allow fully-autonomous\nremote missions in complex environments, real-time environment-aware navigation\nis required both with respect to terrain and strong wind drafts. This paper\npresents two relevant initial contributions: First, the literature's first-ever\n3D wind field prediction method which can run in real time onboard a UAV is\npresented. The approach retrieves low-resolution global weather data, and uses\npotential flow theory to adjust the wind field such that terrain boundaries,\nmass conservation, and the atmospheric stratification are observed. A\ncomparison with 1D LIDAR data shows an overall wind error reduction of 23% with\nrespect to the zero-wind assumption that is mostly used for UAV path planning\ntoday. However, given that the vertical winds are not resolved accurately\nenough further research is required and identified. Second, a sampling-based\npath planner that considers the aircraft dynamics in non-uniform wind\niteratively via Dubins airplane paths is presented. Performance optimizations,\ne.g. obstacle-aware sampling and fast 2.5D-map collision checks, render the\nplanner 50% faster than the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) implementation.\nTest cases in Alpine terrain show that the wind-aware planning performs up to\n50x less iterations than shortest-path planning and is thus slower in low\nwinds, but that it tends to deliver lower-cost paths in stronger winds. More\nimportantly, in contrast to the shortest-path planner, it always delivers\ncollision-free paths. Overall, our initial research demonstrates the\nfeasibility of 3D wind field prediction from a UAV and the advantages of\nwind-aware planning. This paves the way for follow-up research on\nfully-autonomous environment-aware navigation of UAVs in real-life missions and\ncomplex terrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 23:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Specifically, we determine\nthe conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO$_2$ degassing\nlarge enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not\nto exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh\nrock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation\nand an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with\ninitial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO$_2$ budgets\nranging from $\\sim 10^{-2} -1$ times Earth's estimated CO$_2$ budget, can\nmaintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for $\\approx 1-5$\nGyrs; larger CO$_2$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller\nbudgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates\nfavor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO$_2$ outgassing longer. Thus,\nthe results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a\nlong-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model\nis necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal\nevolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some\nfirst order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at\nwhich habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of\ninitial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet\nheat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 00:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

By examining the capacity of proofs in several QBF\nsystems, we are able to use the technique to obtain lower bounds based on cost\nalone.\n  As applications of the technique, we first prove exponential lower bounds for\na new family of simple QBFs representing equality. The main application is in\nproving exponential lower bounds with high probability for a class of randomly\ngenerated QBFs, the first `genuine' lower bounds of this kind, which apply to\nthe QBF analogues of resolution, Cutting Planes, and Polynomial Calculus.\nFinally, we employ the technique to give a simple proof of hardness for the\nprominent formulas of Kleine B\\\"uning, Karpinski and Fl\\\"ogel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 02:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 10:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 13:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 12:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

Due to the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a\ntime dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface. This time\nevolution solution can be used not only for the flux evaluation across a cell\ninterface and its time derivative, but also time accurate evolution solution at\na cell interface. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables\ninside each control volume, the GKS can get the cell averaged slopes inside\neach control volume as well through the differences of flow variables at the\ncell interfaces. So, with the updated flow variables and their slopes inside\neach cell, the HWENO reconstruction can be naturally implemented for the\ncompact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of next step. Therefore, a\ncompact higher-order GKS, such as the two-stages fourth-order compact scheme\ncan be constructed. This scheme is as robust as second-order one, but more\naccurate solution can be obtained. In comparison with compact fourth-order DG\nmethod, the current scheme has only two stages instead of four within each time\nstep for the fourth-order temporal accuracy, and the CFL number used here can\nbe on the order of $0.5$ instead of $0.11$ for the DG method. Through this\nresearch, it concludes that the use of high-order time evolution model rather\nthan the first order Riemann solution is extremely important for the design of\nrobust, accurate, and efficient higher-order schemes for the compressible\nflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 02:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Although the SFK\nrelation overestimates the SFR in this clump (possibly due to the ignorance of\nmagnetic field), it provides the best prediction among the available models.\nFinally, we compare the star formation and gas properties of this high-redshift\ngalaxy to local star-forming regions and find that the SFK relation provides\nthe best estimates of SFR in both local and high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 07:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 04:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 05:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 22:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

All these spaces are countably-based.\nExtending descriptive set theory and its effective counterpart to general\nrepresented spaces, including non-countably-based spaces has been started in\n[Pauly, de Brecht 2015].\n  We study the spaces $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{N}^\\mathbb{N})$,\n$\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{N}^\\mathbb{N},2)$ and the Kleene-Kreisel spaces\n$\\mathbb{N}\\langle\\alpha\\rangle$. We show that there is a $\\Sigma^0_2$-subset\nof $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{N}^\\mathbb{N})$ which is not Borel.

In order to obtain these results, we develop general\ntechniques which are refinements of Cantor's diagonal argument involving\nmulti-valued fixed-point free functions and that are interesting on their own\nright.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 09:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

This reduces the\nmagnitude of the loop voltage seen by the plasma as also delays its buildup.\nAlso the induced currents alter the null location of magnetic field. This will\nhave serious implications on the plasma breakdown and startup and corrective\nmeasures may be required in case of an insufficient loop voltage or an improper\nnull. Further, the eddy currents distribution will be vital for the plasma\nequilibrium and need to be considered while reconstructing the equilibrium.\nEvolution of the toroidal eddy currents in SST-1 passive structures has been\nstudied using a toroidal-filament model.

The main dependence stems from the\n$\\tilde c_R - \\tilde t_R$ mixing in the decays to up-type squarks because there\nhold strong constraints from B-physics on the other quark-flavour mixing\nparameters. Including the full one-loop corrections, the changes of the gluino\ndecay widths are mostly negative and of the order of about -10%. The QFV part\nstays small in the total width but can vary up to -8% for the decay width into\nthe lightest squark. For the corresponding branching ratio, however, the effect\nis smaller by at least a factor of two. The electroweak corrections can become\n35% of the SUSY QCD corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 12:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

By utilizing\nperiodic density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections,\nherein we report for the first time the energetically and thermodynamically\nfavorable homolytic dissociative adsorption behavior of water over magnesia\n(001) films deposited on metal substrate. The water adsorption on pristine\nmagnesia (001) is quite weak and the heterolytic dissociation is the only\nfragmentation pathway, which is highly endothermic with large activation\nbarrier of 1.167 eV. The binding strength for the molecular and dissociative\nadsorption configurations of water on hybrid MgO(001) films are significantly\nlarger than corresponding configurations on bare magnesia (001). The homolytic\ndissociative adsorption energy of water on monolayer oxide is calculated to be\n-1.192 eV, which is even larger than all the heterolytic dissociative\nadsorption states. With the increase of the oxide thickness, the homolytic\ndissociative adsorption energy decreases promptly, indicating the nanoscale of\noxide film play a crucial role in homolytic splitting of water. The homolytic\ndissociative adsorption structure could be obtained by transformation reaction\nfrom heterolytic dissociative adsorption structure, presenting activation\nbarriers 0.733, 1.103, 1.306, 1.571, and 1.849 eV for reactions on 1 ML to 5 ML\nfilms.

Besides sections on the four domains of QT,\nwe have included sections on Quantum Theory and Software, and on Quantum\nControl, as both are important areas of research that cut across all four\ndomains. Each section, after a short introduction to the domain, gives an\noverview on its current status and main challenges and then describes the\nadvances in science and technology foreseen for the next ten years and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 13:55:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

Until now, the radio scale height could only be determined for\na few edge-on galaxies because of missing sensitivity at high resolution.\n  We developed a sophisticated method for the scale height determination of\nedge-on galaxies. With this we determined the scale heights and radial scale\nlengths for a sample of 13 galaxies from the CHANG-ES radio continuum survey in\ntwo frequency bands.\n  The sample average value for the radio scale heights of the halo are 1.1 +/-\n0.3kpc in C-band and 1.4 +/- 0.7kpc in L-band. From the frequency dependence\nanalysis of the halo scale heights we found that the wind velocities (estimated\nusing the adiabatic loss time) are above the escape velocity. We found that the\nhalo scale heights increase linearly with the radio diameters. In order to\nexclude the diameter dependence, we defined a normalized scale height which is\nquite similar for all sample galaxies at both frequency bands and does not\ndepend on the star formation rate or the magnetic field strength. However, the\nnormalized scale height shows a tight anticorrelation with the mass surface\ndensity.\n  The sample galaxies with smaller scale lengths are more spherical in the\nradio emission, while those with larger scale lengths are flatter. The radio\nscale height depends mainly on the radio diameter of the galaxy. The sample\ngalaxies are consistent with an escape-dominated radio halo with convective\ncosmic ray propagation, indicating that galactic winds are a widespread\nphenomenon in spiral galaxies.

While many recent works focus on reducing the redundancy by eliminating\nunneeded weight parameters, it is not possible to apply a single deep\narchitecture for multiple devices with different resources. When a new device\nor circumstantial condition requires a new deep architecture, it is necessary\nto construct and train a new network from scratch. In this work, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework, called a nested sparse network, which exploits\nan n-in-1-type nested structure in a neural network. A nested sparse network\nconsists of multiple levels of networks with a different sparsity ratio\nassociated with each level, and higher level networks share parameters with\nlower level networks to enable stable nested learning. The proposed framework\nrealizes a resource-aware versatile architecture as the same network can meet\ndiverse resource requirements. Moreover, the proposed nested network can learn\ndifferent forms of knowledge in its internal networks at different levels,\nenabling multiple tasks using a single network, such as coarse-to-fine\nhierarchical classification. In order to train the proposed nested sparse\nnetwork, we propose efficient weight connection learning and channel and layer\nscheduling strategies.

The algebraic\nstructures the most encountered here are magmas, posets, associative algebras,\ndendriform algebras, Hopf bialgebras, operads, and pros. This work explores the\naforementioned research direction and provides many constructions having the\nparticularity to build algebraic structures on combinatorial objects. We\ndevelop for instance a functor from nonsymmetric colored operads to\nnonsymmetric operads, from monoids to operads, from unitary magmas to\nnonsymmetric operads, from finite posets to nonsymmetric operads, from stiff\npros to Hopf bialgebras, and from precompositions to nonsymmetric operads.\nThese constructions bring alternative ways to describe already known structures\nand provide new ones, as for instance, some of the deformations of the\nnoncommutative Fa\\`a di Bruno Hopf bialgebra of Foissy and a generalization of\nthe dendriform operad of Loday. We also use algebraic structures to obtain\nenumerative results. In particular, nonsymmetric colored operads are promising\ndevices to define formal series generalizing the usual ones. These series come\nwith several products (for instance a pre-Lie product, an associative product,\nand their Kleene stars) enriching the usual ones on classical power series.\nThis provides a framework and a toolbox to strike combinatorial questions in an\noriginal way.

The amount of veiling is often\nconsidered as a measure of the mass-accretion rate. We analysed high-resolution\nphotospheric spectra of accreting T Tauri stars LkHa 321, V1331 Cyg, and AS 353\nA with the aim of clarifying the nature of the line-dependent veiling. Each of\nthese objects shows a highly veiled, strong emission line spectrum and powerful\nwind features indicating high rates of accretion and mass loss. Equivalent\nwidths of hundreds of weak photospheric lines were measured in the observed\nspectra and compared with those in synthetic spectra with the same spectral\ntype. We found that the veiling is strongly line-dependent: larger in stronger\nphotospheric lines and weak or absent in the weakest ones. No dependence of\nveiling on excitation potential within 0 to 5 eV was found. Different physical\nprocesses responsible for these unusual veiling effects are discussed in the\nframework of the magnetospheric accretion model. The observed veiling has two\norigins: 1) an abnormal structure of stellar atmosphere heated up by the\naccreting matter, and 2) a non-photospheric continuum radiated by a hot spot\nwith temperature lower than 10000 K. The true level of the veiling continuum\ncan be derived by measuring the weakest photospheric lines with equivalent\nwidths down to $\\approx$10 m\\AA. A limited spectral resolution and/or low\nsignal-to-noise ratio results in overestimation of the veiling continuum.

The origin of this discrepancy is that fully 3D\nDNS cannot reach low enough values of the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$. To\nbypass this limitation and investigate dynamo saturation at very low $Pm$, we\nfocus on the vicinity of the dynamo threshold in a rapidly rotating flow: the\nvelocity field then depends on two spatial coordinates only, while the magnetic\nfield consists of a single Fourier mode in the third direction.

It has been shown in\nthe literature (Rashidi 2016) that the ideal Chandrasekhar limit ceases to\nexist when the modified equation of state due to the generalized uncertainty is\ntaken into account. To assess the situation in a more complete fashion, we\nanalyze in detail the mass-radius relation of Newtonian white dwarfs whose\nhydrostatic equilibria are governed by the equation of state of the degenerate\nrelativistic electron gas subjected to the generalized uncertainty principle.\nAs the constraint of minimal length imposes a severe restriction on the\navailability of high momentum states, it is speculated that the central Fermi\nmomentum cannot have values arbitrarily higher than $p_{\\rm\nmax}\\sim\\beta^{-1/2}$.

Elastic\nand elasto-plastic material models, compressible and incompressible fluid\nmodels and different geometrical characteristics of the wavy surface are used.\nWe show that in case of incompressible fluid, due to its pressurization, the\nreal contact area and the global coefficient of friction decrease monotonically\nwith the increasing external pressure.
