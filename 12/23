Aimed at a broad audience, the paper starts\nwith an introduction to the basic load balancing scenario, consisting of a\nsingle dispatcher where tasks arrive that must immediately be forwarded to one\nof $N$ single-server queues.\n  A popular class of load balancing algorithms are so-called power-of-$d$ or\nJSQ($d$) policies, where an incoming task is assigned to a server with the\nshortest queue among $d$ servers selected uniformly at random. This class\nincludes the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy as a special case ($d = N$),\nwhich has strong stochastic optimality properties and yields a mean waiting\ntime that vanishes as $N$ grows large for any fixed subcritical load. However,\na nominal implementation of the JSQ policy involves a prohibitive communication\nburden in large-scale deployments. In contrast, a random assignment policy ($d\n= 1$) does not entail any communication overhead, but the mean waiting time\nremains constant as $N$ grows large for any fixed positive load.\n  In order to examine the fundamental trade-off between performance and\nimplementation overhead, we consider an asymptotic regime where $d(N)$ depends\non $N$. We investigate what growth rate of $d(N)$ is required to match the\nperformance of the JSQ policy on fluid and diffusion scale. The results\ndemonstrate that the asymptotics for the JSQ($d(N)$) policy are insensitive to\nthe exact growth rate of $d(N)$, as long as the latter is sufficiently fast,\nimplying that the optimality of the JSQ policy can asymptotically be preserved\nwhile dramatically reducing the communication overhead. We additionally show\nhow the communication overhead can be reduced yet further by the so-called\nJoin-the-Idle-Queue scheme, leveraging memory at the dispatcher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 16:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent,\nwhich helps determine both query time and space usage.\n  In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS `06) constructed an LSH family\nbased on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of\n1/c^2 for the l_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor\nand Panigrahy (SIDMA `07) and O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT `14). Although\noptimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally\nexpensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more\npractical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational\nresults using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical\nanalysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the\nexponent of lattice based LSH.\n  In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices\nachieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry\nof numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space\npartitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which\nadditional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low\nspace and query complexity, remains an important open problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 16:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

When implemented following the paradigms of classical\nfinite element methods, the computational resources required by the $k-$method\nare prohibitive even for moderate degree. In order to address this issue, we\npropose a matrix-free strategy combined with weighted quadrature, which is an\nad-hoc strategy to compute the integrals of the Galerkin system. Matrix-free\nweighted quadrature (MF-WQ) speeds up matrix operations, and, perhaps even more\nimportant, greatly reduces memory consumption. Our strategy also requires an\nefficient preconditioner for the linear system iterative solver. In this work\nwe deal with an elliptic model problem, and adopt a preconditioner based on the\nFast Diagonalization method, an old idea to solve Sylvester-like equations. Our\nnumerical tests show that the isogeometric solver based on MF-WQ is faster than\nstandard approaches (where the main cost is the matrix formation by standard\nGaussian quadrature) even for low degree. But the main achievement is that,\nwith MF-WQ, the $k$-method gets orders of magnitude faster by increasing the\ndegree, given a target accuracy. Therefore, we are able to show the\nsuperiority, in terms of computational efficiency, of the high-degree\n$k$-method with respect to low-degree isogeometric discretizations. What we\npresent here is applicable to more complex and realistic differential problems,\nbut its effectiveness will depend on the preconditioner stage, which is as\nalways problem-dependent.

We present new, highly sensitive, Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nvisible-light images of the HR 4796A circumstellar debris system and its\nenvironment over a very wide range of stellocentric angles from 0.32\" (23 au)\nto ~ 15\" (1100 au). These very high contrast images were obtained with the\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) using 6-roll PSF-template\nsubtracted coronagraphy suppressing the primary light of HR 4796A and using\nthree image plane occulters and simultaneously subtracting the background light\nfrom its close angular proximity M2.5V companion. The resulting images\nunambiguously reveal the debris ring embedded within a much larger,\nmorphologically complex, and bi-axially asymmetric exoring scattering\nstructure. These images at visible wavelengths are sensitive to, and map, the\nspatial distribution, brightness, and radial surface density of micron size\nparticles over 5 dex in surface brightness. These particles in the exo-ring\nenvironment may be unbound from the system and interacting with the local ISM.\nHerein we present a new morphological and photometric view of the larger than\nprior seen HR 4796A exoplanetary debris system with sensitivity to small\nparticles at stellocentric distances an order of magnitude greater than has\npreviously been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The key players involved in this\nprocess are mechanosensitive ion channels. They are located in the stereocilia\nof hair cells and opened by the tension in specialized molecular springs, the\ntip links, connecting adjacent stereocilia. When channels open, the tip links\nrelax, reducing the hair-bundle stiffness. This gating compliance makes hair\ncells especially sensitive to small stimuli. The classical explanation for the\ngating compliance is that the conformational rearrangement of a single channel\ndirectly shortens the tip link. However, to reconcile theoretical models based\non this mechanism with experimental data, an unrealistically large structural\nchange of the channel is required. Experimental evidence indicates that each\ntip link is a dimeric molecule, associated on average with two channels at its\nlower end. It also indicates that the lipid bilayer modulates channel gating,\nalthough it is not clear how. Here, we design and analyze a model of\nmechanotransduction where each tip link attaches to two channels, mobile within\nthe membrane. Their states and positions are coupled by membrane-mediated\nelastic forces arising from the interaction between the channels' hydrophobic\ncores and that of the lipid bilayer. This coupling induces cooperative opening\nand closing of the channels. The model reproduces the main properties of\nhair-cell mechanotransduction using only realistic parameters constrained by\nexperimental evidence. This work provides an insight into the fundamental role\nthat membrane-mediated ion-channel cooperativity can play in sensory\nphysiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

In this paper, we explore the usage of\ndifferent holistic features for automated skill assessment using only robot\nkinematic data and propose a weighted feature fusion technique for improving\nscore prediction performance.\n  Methods: We perform our experiments on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset\nand evaluate four different types of holistic features from robot kinematic\ndata - Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),\nDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn). The features\nare then used for skill classification and exact skill score prediction. Along\nwith using these features individually, we also evaluate the performance using\nour proposed weighted combination technique.\n  Results: Our results demonstrate that these holistic features outperform all\nprevious HMM based state-of-the-art methods for skill classification on the\nJIGSAWS dataset. Also, our proposed feature fusion strategy significantly\nimproves performance for skill score predictions achieving up to 0.61 average\nspearman correlation coefficient.\n  Conclusions: Holistic features capturing global information from robot\nkinematic data can successfully be used for evaluating surgeon skill in basic\nsurgical tasks on the da Vinci robot.

The zero-field light yield is 15.0 and 14.0 photoelectrons/keV\nat 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV, respectively, and the corresponding values at an\nelectron drift field of 1 kV/cm are 10.8 and 7.9 photoelectrons/keV. The charge\nyields at these energies are 28 and 31 electrons/keV, with the proportional\nscintillation yield of 24 photoelectrons per one electron extracted into the\ngas phase, and an electron lifetime of 200 $\\mu$s. The relative energy\nresolution, $\\sigma/E$, is 11.9 % and 5.8 % at 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV,\nrespectively using a linear combination of the scintillation and ionisation\nsignals.

In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be\ncommunicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep\nlearning channel. We identify several possible architectures for this learning\nchannel (Bidirectional, Conjoined, Twin, Distinct) and six symmetry challenges:\n1) symmetry of architectures; 2) symmetry of weights; 3) symmetry of neurons;\n4) symmetry of derivatives; 5) symmetry of processing; and 6) symmetry of\nlearning rules. Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses the second and third\nsymmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the\nfirst and the fourth symmetry. Here we address the last two desirable\nsymmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the\nlearning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations. Specifically,\nrandom backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same\nnon-linear neurons used in the main input-output forward channel, and the\nconnections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm\nused in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in\nthe learning channel. Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases\nshowing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels\nconverge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions. In symmetric\narchitectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization,\nadaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric\nduring and after learning. Biological connections are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

The well-known example by non-Abelian gauge group breaking is the\npotential for the \"invisible\" QCD axion, via the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which\nconstitutes a major part of this review. Even if there is no breaking terms\nfrom gauge anomalies, there can be explicit breaking terms $\\Delta V$ in the\npotential in which case the leading term suppressed by $f$ determines the\npseudoscalar mass scale. If the breaking term is extremely small and the decay\nconstant is trans-Planckian, the corresponding pseudoscalar can be a candidate\nfor a `quintessential axion'. In general, $(\\Delta V)^{1/4}$ is considered to\nbe smaller than $f$, and hence the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass scales are\nconsidered to be smaller than the decay constants. In such a case, the\npotential of the pseudo-Goldstone boson at the grand unification scale is\nsufficiently flat near the top of the potential that it can be a good candidate\nfor an inflationary model, which is known as `natural inflation'. We review all\nthese ideas in the bosonic collective motion framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 20:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 02:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is the most\nfavored extension of the Standard Model that solves many of its limitations, if\npredicted SUSY particles exist at the TeV scale. The Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN has opened a new phase of exploration into new physics at the TeV\nscale after increasing the center-of-mass energy of the proton-proton\ncollisions to 13 TeV. The ATLAS experiment has collected this collision data\nwith over 90% efficiency due to the excellent performance of many of its\nsystems, in particular the data acquisition system. The work described in this\ndissertation ensures the efficient collection of ATLAS data as well as the\nanalysis of this data to search for SUSY. The search for strongly produced\nsupersymmetric particles decaying into final states with multiple energetic\njets and either two leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge\nor at least three leptons was performed using the proton-proton collision\ndataset of 36 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and\n2016. Due to the low Standard Model background, these final states are\nparticularly adapted to searches for gluinos or third generation squarks in\nseveral supersymmetric production topologies determined from a variety of\nsimplified and phenomenological models. The absence of excess over the Standard\nModel prediction is interpreted in terms of limits on the masses of\nsuperpartners derived at 95% confidence level.

Appropriate priors or penalties are\nrequired to enable the reconstruction. The commonly used L2-norm can enforce\nthe stability to preserve local smoothness, and the current L1-norm can enforce\nthe sparsity to preserve sharp edges. Considering the fact that L2-norm penalty\nalways makes the solution overly smooth and L1-norm penalty always makes the\nsolution too sparse, elastic-net regularization approach with a convex\ncombination term of L1-norm and L2-norm emerges for fully nonlinear EIT inverse\nproblems.

Nonlinearity and\nnon-smoothness of the generated composite minimization problem make it\nchallenging to find an efficient numerical solution. Then we develop one simple\nand fast numerical optimization scheme based on the split Bregman technique for\nthe joint penalties regularization.

Many machine learning applications employ\nneighborhood-based measures to characterize the similarity among the nodes,\nsuch as the pairwise number of common neighbors (CN) and related metrics. While\nthe number of node pairs that share neighbors is potentially enormous, only a\nrelatively small proportion of them have many common neighbors. This motivates\nfinding a weighted sampling approach to preferentially sample these node pairs.\nThis paper presents a new sampling algorithm that provides a fixed size\nunbiased estimate of the similarity matrix resulting from a bipartite graph\nstream projection. The algorithm has two components. First, it maintains a\nreservoir of sampled bipartite edges with sampling weights that favor selection\nof high similarity nodes. Second, arriving edges generate a stream of\n\\textsl{similarity updates} based on their adjacency with the current sample.\nThese updates are aggregated in a second reservoir sample-based stream\naggregator to yield the final unbiased estimate.

General Relativity is an intrinsically\nnonlinear theory, establishing a nonlinear relation between the metric and the\ndensity field. Representing the metric perturbations with the curvature\nperturbation zeta, it is known that nonlinearity produces effective\nnon-Gaussian terms in the nonlinear perturbations of the matter density field,\neven if the primordial zeta is Gaussian. Here we generalise these results to\nthe case of a non-Gaussian primordial zeta. Using a standard parametrization of\nprimordial non-Gaussianity in zeta in terms of fNL, gNL, hNL..., we show how at\nhigher order (from third and higher) nonlinearity also produces a mixing of\nthese contributions to the density field at large scales, e.g. both fNL and gNL\ncontribute to the third order in the density contrast. This is the main result\nof this paper. Our analysis is based on the synergy between a gradient\nexpansion (aka long-wavelength approximation) and standard perturbation theory\nat higher order. In essence, mathematically the equations for the gradient\nexpansion are equivalent to those of first order perturbation theory, thus\nfirst-order results convert into gradient expansion results and, vice versa,\nthe gradient expansion can be used to derive results in perturbation theory at\nhigher order and large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 00:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 12:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

In this strategy, the transmitters split their information\nstreams into multiple independent information streams, each adapted to a\nspecific actual channel realization. The major distinction between the proposed\nstrategy and the existing ones is that in the existing approaches, each\ntransmitter adapts its transmission strategy only to the fading process of its\ndirect channel to the receiver, hence directly adopting a single-user strategy\npreviously designed for the single-user channels. However, the contribution of\neach user to a network-wide measure (e.g., sum-rate capacity) depends not only\non the user's direct channel to the receiver, but also on the qualities of\nother channels. Driven by this premise, this paper proposes an alternative\nbroadcast strategy in which the transmitters adapt their transmissions to the\ncombined states resulting from all users' channels. This leads to generating a\nlarger number of information streams by each transmitter and adopting a\ndifferent decoding strategy by the receiver. An achievable rate region and an\nouter bound that capture the trade-off among the rates of different information\nlayers are established, and it is shown that the achievable rate region\nsubsumes the existing known capacity regions obtained based on adapting the\nbroadcast approach to the single-user channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 06:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Previously, we established that\n$p$-adic Koba-Nielsen string amplitudes are finite sums of multivariate Igusa's\nlocal zeta functions, consequently, they are convergent integrals that admit\nmeromorphic continuations as rational functions. The meromorphic continuation\nof local zeta functions has been used for several authors to regularize\nparametric Feynman amplitudes in field and string theories. Denef and Loeser\nestablished that the limit $p \\to 1$ of a Igusa's local zeta function gives\nrise to an object called topological zeta function. By using Denef-Loeser's\ntheory of topological zeta functions, we show that limit $p \\to 1$ of\ntree-level $p$-adic string amplitudes give rise to certain amplitudes, that we\nhave named Denef-Loeser string amplitudes.

We establish the link between the pseudospin\norientation and the components of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT): the\nmetric tensor and the Berry curvature. We show how the k-dependent pseudospin\norientation can be measured in photonic systems with radiative modes. We\nconsider the specific example: a 2D planar cavity with two polarization\neigenmodes, where the pseudospin measurement can be performed via\npolarization-resolved photoluminescence. We also consider the s-band of a\nstaggered honeycomb lattice for polarization-degenerate modes (scalar photons).\nThe sublattice pseudospin can be measured by performing spatially resolved\ninterferometric measurements. In the second part, we consider a more\ncomplicated four-band model, which can be mapped to two entangled pseudospins.\nWe show how the QGT components can be obtained by measuring six angles. The\nspecific four-band system we considered is the s-band of a honeycomb lattice\nfor polarized (spinor) photons. We show that all six angles can indeed be\nmeasured in this system. We simulate realistic experimental situations in all\ncases. We find the photon eigenstates by solving Schrodinger equation including\npumping and finite lifetime, and then simulate the measurement of the relevant\nangles to finally extract realistic mappings of the k-dependent QGT components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 08:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

It is possible that for every individual,\ntreatment has a positive effect on surrogate, and surrogate has a positive\neffect on primary outcome, but for some individuals, treatment has a negative\neffect on primary outcome. For example, a treatment may be substantially\neffective in preventing the stroke for everyone, and lowering the risk of\nstroke is universally beneficial for a longer survival time, however, the\ntreatment may still cause death for some individuals. We define such\nparadoxical phenomenon as individual surrogate paradox. The individual\nsurrogate paradox is preposed to capture the treatment effect heterogeneity,\nwhich is unable to be described by either the surrogate paradox based on\naverage causal effect (ACE) (Chen et al., 2007) or that based on distributional\ncausal effect (DCE) (Ju and Geng, 2010). We investigate existing surrogate\ncriteria in terms of whether the individual surrogate paradox could manifest.\nWe find that only the strong binary surrogate can avoid such paradox without\nadditional assumptions. Utilizing the sharp bounds, we propose novel criteria\nto exclude the individual surrogate paradox. Our methods are illustrated in an\napplication to determine the effect of the intensive glycemia on the risk of\ndevelopment or progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 08:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

However, its modern values derived by various\nmethods still disagree from each other by almost 10%; the greater values being\nobtained by measurements at the relatively small distances (e.g., by Cepheid\nstars as the standard candles), while the smaller values being characteristic\nof the methods associated with huge spatial scales (e.g., the analysis of the\ncosmic microwave background fluctuations). A reasonable way to resolve this\npuzzle is to assume that the Hubble constant is inherently scale-dependent.\nThis idea seems to be particularly attractive in light of the latest\nobservational results on the early-type galaxies, where the dark-matter haloes\nare almost absent. Therefore, an average contribution of the\nirregularly-distributed dark matter to the rate of the cosmological expansion\nshould be substantially different at various spatial scales. As follows from\nthe rough estimates, the corresponding variation of the Hubble constant can be\n10% and even more, which well explains the spread in its values obtained by the\nvarious methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 11:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

The support of multiple sub-carrier spacing options\nallows NR to operate in a wide range of carrier frequency from sub-6 GHz band\nto mmWave band with appropriate handling of multi-path delay spread and phase\nnoise depending on the carrier frequency. In addition, the introduction of the\nnew bandwidth part concept allows to flexibly and dynamically configure User\nEquipment's (UE's) operating bandwidth, which will make NR an energy efficient\nsolution despite the support of wide bandwidth.

Now-a-days, real-time multimedia applications have evolved largely\nover the Internet. Most of multimedia services are unresponsive during network\ncongestion. Unresponsive traffic streams steal most network bandwidth and\nstarve out some other flows which are responsive during network congestion. In\nthe presence of these unresponsive traffic flows, protection of responsive\nflows has become a major issue. Many Active Queue Management (AQM) based\nsolutions have been recommended to protect responsive traffic flows from\nunresponsive ones and to ensure fairness among all traffic flows. The thesis\nproposes a novel AQM scheme CHOKeD, to deliver fairness among all flows of a\ncongested link. It is a completely stateless approach. CHOKeD is based on\ndynamic drawing factor to penalize unresponsive traffic. It successfully\nprotects responsive flows in the presence of unresponsive flows.
