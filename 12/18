First, even when the data follows a Gaussian distribution, its\nvariance may change over time. Such variance is also related to important\ntemporal economic indicators such as the market volatility. Second, financial\ntime-series data often requires learning datasets generated by the generalized\nGaussian distribution with an additional shape parameter that is important to\napproximate heavy-tailed distributions.

Observation of human behaviour suggests that the\nextent to which punishment is adopted depends on the usage of alternative\nmechanisms, including partner switching. In this study, we investigate the\ncombined effect of punishment and partner switching in evolutionary prisoner's\ndilemma games conducted on a network. In the model, agents are located on the\nnetwork and participate in the prisoner's dilemma games with punishment. In\naddition, they can opportunistically switch interaction partners to improve\ntheir payoff. Our Monte Carlo simulation showed that a large frequency of\npunishers is required to suppress defectors when the frequency of partner\nswitching is low.

In sub-Neptunes most of the planet mass is in\nthe rocky part (hereafter core) which is surrounded by a modest hydrogen-helium\nenvelope. As a result, the total initial heat content of such a planet is\ndominated by that of the core. Nonetheless, most studies contend that the core\ncooling will only have a minor effect on the radius evolution of the gaseous\nenvelope, because the core's cooling is in sync with the envelope, i.e., most\nof the initial heat is released early on timescales of about 10-100 Myr. In\nthis Letter we examine the importance of the core cooling rate for the thermal\nevolution of the envelope. Thus, we relax the early core cooling assumption and\npresent a model where the core is characterized by two parameters: the initial\ntemperature and the cooling time. We find that core cooling can significantly\nenhance the radius of the planet when it operates on a timescale similar to the\nobserved age, i.e. several Gyr. Consequently, the interpretation of\nsub-Neptunes' mass-radius observations depends on the assumed core thermal\nproperties and the uncertainty therein. The degeneracy of composition and core\nthermal properties can be reduced by obtaining better estimates of the planet\nages (in addition to their radii and masses) as envisioned by future\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

This behavior can be explained by the proposal of SmB6 representing a new\nstate of matter, a Topological Kondo insulator, in which a Kondo gap is\ndeveloped and topologically protected surface conduction dominates\nlow-temperature transport. Exploiting its non-linear dynamics, a tunable SmB6\noscillator device was recently demonstrated, where a small DC current generates\nlarge oscillating voltages at frequencies from a few Hz to hundreds of MHz.\nThis behavior was explained by a theoretical model describing the thermal and\nelectronic dynamics of coupled surface and bulk states. However, a crucial\naspect of this model, the predicted temperature oscillation in the surface\nstate, hasn't been experimentally observed to date. This is largely due to the\ntechnical difficulty of detecting an oscillating temperature of the very thin\nsurface state. Here we report direct measurements of the time-dependent surface\nstate temperature in SmB6 with a RuO micro-thermometer. Our results agree\nquantitatively with the theoretically simulated temperature waveform, and hence\nsupport the validity of the oscillator model, which will provide accurate\ntheoretical guidance for developing future SmB6oscillators at higher\nfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The results show that, contrary to\nother FV methods, the accuracy of the FCFV method is not sensitive to mesh\ndistortion and stretching.

A DNN is made by layers of internal units (or\nneurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the\nunits in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the\ncorresponding value (also known as activation). A commonly-used nonlinear\noperator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just\nthe maximum between its input value and zero.

Here we used a simulation framework capable of analyzing 10$^{5}$\nwavy CNTs with realistic stochastic morphologies to study the influence of\nwaviness on the compliance contribution of wavy A-CNTs to the effective elastic\nmodulus of A-PNCs, and show that waviness is responsible for the orders of\nmagnitude \\textit{over-prediction} of the A-PNC effective modulus by existing\ntheoretical frameworks that both neglect the shear deformation mechanism and do\nnot properly account for the CNT morphpology. Additional work to quantify the\nmorphology of A-PNCs in three dimensions and simulate their full elastic\nconstitutive relations is planned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 21:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

With the converter interface, the rotor inertia\nof doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine generator is\neffectively decoupled from the system, causing a reduction in inertial\nresponse. This can be compensated by enabling the DFIG to provide fast\nfrequency response. This paper proposes a quantitative control approach for\nDFIG to deliver fast frequency response in the inertial response time scale. A\nsupplementary power surge function is added to the active power reference of\nDFIG. The exact amount of power surge that is available from DFIG-based wind\nturbine is quantified based on estimation of maximum extractable energy.\nMoreover, the operational constraints such as rotor limits and converter\nover-load limit are considered at the same time. Thus, the proposed approach\nnot only provides adequate inertial response but also ensures the rotor speed\nis kept within a specified operating range.

We apply this model to the collapse of the North Tower of the\nWorld Trade Center to determine the energy dissipation per storey during the\ncollapse. Our findings are (at most) 250\\,MJ during the first 4.6 sec. In the\ntime interval between 4.6 and 7.7 sec after collapse initiation we find an\nadditional energy dissipation per storey of 2500\\,MJ. Because the steel columns\nincrease in strength towards the ground this value corresponds to a value of\n2000\\,MJ for the storeys in the aircraft impact zone. After 7.7 sec the value\nreduces again. These results have two possible interpretations: (1) If due to\nthe building design (column strength, shape etc.) the energy dissipation per\nstorey cannot reach the high values which we observed, then the collapse cannot\nbe described by the gravity-driven collapse model. (2) If the collapse is\ndescribed correctly by the gravity-driven collapse model, then then we fond\ndirect evidence that the collapse mechanism did not follow the same pattern\nduring the whole of the collapse. The possible amount of energy dissipation was\nreduced by an order of magnitude during two long time time intervals. In both\ncases there is no a priori reason to justify the sometimes expressed belief\nthat the collapse was inevitable even after the falling top section had gained\na significant amount of momentum. In fact, if the amount of energy dissipation\nhad stayed only little longer on the high level, then a gravity-driven collapse\nwould have arrested. Note that (1) implies that if in principle the\ngravity-driven collapse model describes gravity-driven collapses of tall\nbuildings, then the collapse was not gravity-driven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 23:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 20:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 14:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 20:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 01:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 17:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

Before analyzing data, one\nusually needs to process the raw data. However, traditional data processing\nbased on exactly match often misses lots of valid information. To get\nhigh-quality analysis results and fit in the big data era, this thesis studies\nthe error-tolerant big data processing. As most of the data in real world can\nbe represented as a sequence or a set, this thesis utilizes the widely-used\nsequence-based and set-based similar functions to tolerate errors in data\nprocessing and studies the approximate entity extraction, similarity join and\nsimilarity search problems. The main contributions of this thesis include:\n  1. This thesis proposes a unified framework to support approximate entity\nextraction with both sequence-based and set-based similarity functions\nsimultaneously. The experiments show that the unified framework can improve the\nstate-of-the-art methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.\n  2. This thesis designs two methods respectively for the sequence and the set\nsimilarity joins. For the sequence similarity join, this thesis proposes to\nevenly partition the sequences to segments. It is guaranteed that two sequences\nare similar only if one sequence has a subsequence identical to a segment of\nanother sequence. For the set similarity join, this thesis proposes to\npartition all the sets into segments based on the universe. This thesis further\nextends the two partition-based methods to support the large-scale data\nprocessing framework, Map-Reduce and Spark. The partition-based method won the\nstring similarity join competition held by EDBT and beat the second place by 10\ntimes.\n  3.

This formulation allows our algorithm to produce a\npanoramic background component that automatically stitches together corrupted\ndata from partially overlapping frames to reconstruct the full field of view.\nWe model the registered video as the sum of a low-rank component that captures\nthe background, a smooth component that captures the dynamic foreground of the\nscene, and a sparse component that isolates possible outliers and other sparse\ncorruptions in the video. The low-rank portion of our model is based on a\nrecent low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink) that has been shown to yield\nsuperior low-rank subspace estimates in practice.

We give a testing procedure of whether or not a Laplace prior is\nappropriate and accordingly, whether or not using a lasso penalized estimate is\nappropriate.

The coherence time can thus be significantly extended. Ionospheric\neffects, which can still be significant, remain however uncalibrated after FPT\nas well as the instrumental effects. In this work, we implement a further phase\ntransfer between two FPT residuals (i.e. so-called FPT-square) to calibrate the\nionospheric effects based on their frequency dependence. We show that after\nFPT-square, the coherence time at 3 mm can be further extended beyond 8~hours,\nand the residual phase errors can be sufficiently canceled by applying the\ncalibration of another source, which can have a large angular separation from\nthe target (>20 deg) and significant temporal gaps. Calibrations for all-sky\ndistributed sources with a few calibrators are also possible after FPT-square.\nOne of the strengths and uniqueness of this calibration strategy is the\nsuitability for high-frequency all-sky survey observations including very weak\nsources.

Ultrasonic guided wave based crack\nidentification is one of the most important and accepted approaches applied to\ndetect unseen small flaws in structures. Numerical simulations of ultrasonic\nguided wave propagation have caught more and more attention due to the fast\ndevelopment of hardware and software in the last few years. From all the\nnumerical simulation methods, wavelet based finite element method has been\nproved to be one of the most efficient methods due to its better spatial\nresolution, which means it needs fewer elements to get the same accuracy and it\ncan improve the calculation cost significantly. However, it needs a very small\ntime interval. Laplace transform can easily convert the time domain into a\nfrequency domain and then revert it back to a time domain. Laplace transform\nhas thus the advantage of finding better results with a very large time\ninterval. which can save a lot of time cost. This paper will present an\ninnovative method combining Laplace transform and the B-spline wavelet on\ninterval (BSWI) finite element method. This novel method allows to get results\nwith the same accuracy and with a significantly lower time cost, which would\nnot only decrease the total number of elements in the structure but also\nincrease the time integration interval. The numerical Laplace transform and\nBSWI finite element will be introduced. Moreover, this innovative method is\napplied to simulate the ultrasonic wave propagation in a beam structure in\ndifferent materials.

We find\nthat the predicted X-ray image shows a filamentary structure that arises even\nin the absence of disc gas inhomogeneity. This structure stems from warm clumps\nmade of disc material being lifted by the injected gas. We show that as much as\nhalf of the total X-ray emission comes from regions surrounding warm clumps\nthat are made of a mix of disk and injected gas. This scenario has the\npotential to explain the origin of the observed extra-planar X-ray emission\naround star forming galaxies and can be used to understand the observed\nsublinear relation between the $L_X$ and SFR. We quantify the mass contained in\nthese `bow-shock' regions. We also show that the top-most region of the outer\nshock above the central area emits harder X-rays than the rest.

It has also been\nconjectured that key critical exponents $\\phi$, measuring the growth of the\ncontacts with the surface at the adsorption point, and $1/\\delta$, which\nmeasures the finite-size shift of the critical temperature, are not the same.\nHowever, applying standard scaling arguments the two key critical exponents\nshould be identical, thus pointing to a potential breakdown of these standard\nscaling arguments. This is in contrast to the well studied situation in two\ndimensions, where there are exact results from conformal field theory: these\nexponents are both accepted to be $1/2$ and universal. We use the flatPERM\nalgorithm to simulate self-avoiding walks and trails on the hexagonal, square\nand simple cubic lattices up to length $1024$ to investigate these claims.\nWalks can be seen as a repulsive limit of inter-monomer interaction for trails,\nallowing us to probe the universality of adsorption.

We test our methodology on the\ntwo-dimensional cases and the resulting spread in values for $\\phi$ and\n$1/\\delta$ indicates that there is a systematic error that exceeds the\nstatistical error usually reported. We further suggest a methodology for\nconsistent estimation of the key adsorption exponents which gives\n$\\phi=1/\\delta=0.484(4)$ in three dimensions. We conclude that in three\ndimensions these critical exponents indeed differ from the mean-field value of\n$1/2$, but cannot find evidence that they differ from each other.

Up\nto now, theories for analyzing contact behavior of rough surfaces in literature\ncan be generally categorized into two groups: the asperity-based Hertz contact\nmodels initiated by Greenwood and Williamson (G-W model), which is shown more\naccurate under small indentation distance, and the magnification-based pressure\ndiffusion theory initiated by Persson, which is shown to work well under full\ncontact conditions. The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical model\nthat can effectively formulate the contact status of rough surfaces during the\nentire compression process. This is achieved by integrating the idea of\nmagnification, or evolving resolution into an asperity representation of rough\nsurfaces, and a magnification-based multi-asperity model is thus established.\nIn the derived model, the originally complex contact problem is decomposed into\na family of sub-problems each defined on a morphologically simpler contact\nislands. Benefiting from the explicit results given by Greenwood and\nWilliamson, the proposed method is relatively easy for numerical\nimplementation.

Due to the large size of these\nmodels, they are typically run on clusters of CPUs or GPUs. However, power\nrequirements and cost budgets can be a major hindrance in adoption of CNN for\nIoT applications. Recent research highlights that CNN contain significant\nredundancy in their structure and can be quantized to lower bit-width\nparameters and activations, while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Low\nbit-width and especially single bit-width (binary) CNN are particularly\nsuitable for mobile applications based on FPGA implementation, due to the\nbitwise logic operations involved in binarized CNN. Moreover, the transition to\nlower bit-widths opens new avenues for performance optimizations and model\nimprovement. In this paper, we present an automatic flow from trained\nTensorFlow models to FPGA system on chip implementation of binarized CNN. This\nflow involves quantization of model parameters and activations, generation of\nnetwork and model in embedded-C, followed by automatic generation of the FPGA\naccelerator for binary convolutions. The automated flow is demonstrated through\nimplementation of binarized \"YOLOV2\" on the low cost, low power Cyclone- V FPGA\ndevice.

This paper focuses on the slow phase, which\nwe take as a dispersion of inclusions of arbitrary shape. We revisit the linear\ndiffusion problem in such inclusions in order to identify the structure of the\neffective (average) inclusion response to a chemical load applied on the\ninclusion boundary. We identify a chemical creep function (similar to the creep\nfunction of viscoelasticity), from which we construct estimates with a reduced\nnumber of relaxation modes. The proposed estimates admit an equivalent\nrepresentation based on a finite number of internal variables.

The mass spectrum of heavy-light baryons in the situation with single-\nand double-heavy baryon is derived by solving the eigen equation of the\nquantized collective Hamiltonian.

Superior current solutions will prefer the closest candidates for\nefficient local exploitation while inferior ones will favor the farthest for\nexploration purpose. In this way, the rule could synthesize exploitation and\nexploration, making the evolution more effective.

The X-ray/UV emission clearly shows a large\nvariation over the orbit, and their intensity maximum (or minimum) is located\nat the superior conjunction (or inferior conjunction) of the M-type star orbit.\nThe hardness ratio of the X-ray emission shows a small variation over the\norbital phase, and shows no indication of the absorption by an accretion\ncolumn. These properties are naturally explained by the emission from the\nM-type star surface rather than from the accretion column on the WD's star\nsimilar to the usual IPs.

It is considered that the\nmagnetic dissipation/reconnection process on the M-type star surface heats up\nthe plasma to a temperature of several keV, and also accelerates the electrons\nto the relativistic speed. The relativistic electrons are trapped in the WD's\nclosed magnetic field lines by the magnetic mirror effect. In this model, the\nobserved pulsed component is explained by the emissions from the first magnetic\nmirror point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 11:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

For this purpose,\nwe analyze a simple model - the Holstein model - in which the junction is\ndescribed by a single electronic level that is coupled to two metallic leads\nand to a single vibrational mode. Using the Keldysh Green's function technique,\nwe calculate the nonsymmetrized current noise to the leading order in the\ncharge-vibration interaction. For the noise associated to the latter, we\nidentify distinct terms corresponding to the mean-field noise and the vertex\ncorrection. The mean-field result can be further divided into an elastic\ncorrection to the noise and in an inelastic correction, the second one being\nrelated to energy exchange with the vibration. To illustrate the general\nbehavior of the noise induced by the charge-vibration interaction, we consider\ntwo limit cases. In the first case, we assume a strong coupling of the dot to\nthe leads with an energy-independent transmission whereas in the second case we\nassume a weak tunneling coupling between the dot and the leads such that the\ntransport occurs through a sharp resonant level. We find that the noise\nassociated to the vibration-charge interaction shows a complex pattern as a\nfunction of the frequency $\\omega$ and of the transmission function or of the\ndot's energy level. Several transitions from enhancement to suppression of the\nnoise occurs in different regions, which are determined, in particular, by the\nvibrational frequency. Remarkably, in the regime of an energy-independent\ntransmission, the zero order elastic noise vanishes at perfect transmission and\nat positive frequency whereas the noise related to the charge-vibration\ninteraction remains finite enabling the analysis of the pure\nvibrational-induced current noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We show that these\nmotions can resemble or even exceed the motions needed to support gas against\nits own self-gravity throughout typical galaxy disks. The importance of the\ngalactic potential in spiral arms and galaxy centers suggests that the response\nto self-gravity does not always dominate the motions of gas at GMC scales, with\nimplications for observed gas kinematics, virial equilibrium and cloud\nmorphology. We describe how a uniform treatment of gas motions in the plane and\nin the vertical direction synthesizes the two main mechanisms proposed to\nregulate star formation: vertical pressure equilibrium and shear/Coriolis\nforces as parameterized by Toomre Q~1. As the modeled motions are coherent and\ncontinually driven by the external potential, they represent support for the\ngas that is distinct from that conventionally attributed to turbulence, which\ndecays rapidly and requires thus maintenance, e.g. via feedback from star\nformation. Thus our model suggests the galaxy itself can impose an important\nlimit to star formation, as we explore in a second paper in this series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

As a function of increasing\npressure, our calculations show a valley feature in T$_c$, followed by an\neventual decrease for higher pressures. We demonstrate that this T$_c$ valley\nat low pressures is due to two nearby Lifshitz transitions, as we analyze the\nband-resolved contributions to the \\emph{e-ph} coupling. Below the first\nLifshitz transition, the phonon hardening and shrinking of the $\\gamma$ Fermi\nsurface with $s$ orbital character results in a decreased T$_c$ with increasing\npressure.

For higher pressures, the phonon hardening\nfinally dominates, and T$_c$ decreases again.

An upper bound built upon the min-max converse is compared to two\nlower bounds: the first one relies on a noncoherent transmission strategy in\nwhich the fading channel is not estimated explicitly at the receiver; the\nsecond one employs pilot-assisted transmission (PAT) followed by\nmaximum-likelihood channel estimation and scaled mismatched nearest-neighbor\ndecoding at the receiver.

For example, for\nthe case when a coded packet of $168$ symbols is transmitted using a channel\ncode of rate $0.48$ bits/channel use, over a block-fading channel with block\nsize equal to $8$ symbols, PAT requires an additional $1.2$ dB of energy per\ninformation bit to achieve a packet error probability of $10^{-3}$ compared to\na suitably designed noncoherent transmission scheme.

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a\nclassifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that\nthis loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the\nlearning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the\nLeast Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least\nsquares loss for both the discriminator and the generator. We show that\nminimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson\n$\\chi^2$ divergence. We also show that the derived objective function that\nyields minimizing the Pearson $\\chi^2$ divergence performs better than the\nclassical one of using least squares for classification. There are two benefits\nof LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality\nimages than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stably during the\nlearning process. For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitative\nand quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs can\ngenerate higher quality images than regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate the\nstability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regular\nGANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussian\nmixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a newly proposed method ---\ndatasets with small variability, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs. The\nother one is to compare between LSGANs with gradient penalty (LSGANs-GP) and\nWGANs with gradient penalty (WGANs-GP).

Its flux is\nsufficiently strong at HE to allow us to bin the Fermi-LAT data in 3-day\nintervals, enabling us to investigate the temporal evolution of the flux in\nunprecedented detail. Several flaring episodes were detected and evidence for\nan overall trend of increasing flux over the span of the 10 years was observed.\nThese light curves, in addition to the spectra, are presented. This unique data\nset will help us to advance our understanding of the underlying physical\nprocesses in blazar jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 14:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

It has been recently argued that the behavior of the time asynchrony\n(different aging of twins) between two flying clocks along closed loops can be\nattributed to the existence of an absolute spacetime, which makes Mach's\nprinciple unfeasible. In this paper, we shall revisit, and support, this\nargument from a different viewpoint using the Sagnac delay. This is possible\nsince the above time asynchrony is known to be exactly the same as the Sagnac\ndelay between two circumnavigating light rays re-uniting at the orbiting\nsource/receiver.

While we do not measure\nspacetime itself, we do measure the Sagnac effect, which signifies an absolute\nsubstantive Minkowski spacetime instead of a void.

Failing to properly set the gas costs of EVM operations\nallows attackers to launch DoS attacks on Ethereum. Although Ethereum recently\nadjusted the gas costs of EVM operations to defend against known DoS attacks,\nit remains unknown whether the new setting is proper and how to configure it to\ndefend against unknown DoS attacks. In this paper, we make the first step to\naddress this challenging issue by first proposing an emulation-based framework\nto automatically measure the resource consumptions of EVM operations. The\nresults reveal that Ethereum's new setting is still not proper. Moreover, we\nobtain an insight that there may always exist exploitable under-priced\noperations if the cost is fixed. Hence, we propose a novel gas cost mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts the costs of EVM operations according to the number\nof executions, to thwart DoS attacks. This method punishes the operations that\nare executed much more frequently than before and lead to high gas costs. To\nmake our solution flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Ethereum\nclient, we design a special smart contract that collaborates with the updated\nEVM for dynamic parameter adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod can effectively thwart both known and unknown DoS attacks with flexible\nparameter settings.

The data from these networks have been instrumental in\nadvancing our understanding of the Earth's interior structure and dynamic\nbehaviour. However, almost all seismic stations are located on land and\nearthquakes of magnitude smaller than 4 at the bottom of the oceans remain\nlargely undetected. Here we show that ordinary telecommunication optical fibre\nlinks can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency\nmetrology techniques. We have detected earthquakes over terrestrial and\nsubmarine optical fibre links with length ranging from 75 to 535 km and a\ngeographical distance from the earthquake's epicentre ranging from 25 to 18,500\nkm. In contrast to existing commercial reflectometry-based acoustic sensing\nmethods used widely in the oil and gas industry, which are limited to only a\nfew tens of kilometres, the technique presented here can be extended over\nthousands of kilometres, paving the way for detection of remote underwater\nearthquakes. By using the proposed technique on the existing extensive\nsubmarine optical fibre infrastructure, which already criss-crosses the seas\nand oceans, a global seismic network for real-time detection of underwater\nearthquakes could be implemented. The ability to detect off-shore earthquakes\ncloser to the source could also enable a cost-effective solution for early\ndetection of tsunamis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 14:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

In\ncontrast to the widely used tight-binding description of the electronic states\nthat considers only the nearest-neighbor coupling between the atoms, our\napproach is more accurate and general, as it captures the electron-core\ninteractions between all atoms in the structure. Therefore, as we demonstrate,\nthe DNQM approach enables the investigation of the optical coupling between two\nclosely separated, but chemically unbound GNFs. We also find that the optical\nresponse of GNFs depends crucially on their shape, size, and symmetry\nproperties. Specifically, increasing the size of nanoflakes is found to shift\ntheir accommodated quantum plasmon oscillations to lower frequency.\nImportantly, we show that by embedding a cavity into GNFs, one can change their\nsymmetry properties, tune their optical properties, or enable otherwise\nforbidden second-harmonic generation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 06:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Many works have been dedicated\nto the modelling and optimisation of the cantilevered geometry to increase\npower density, bandwidth, etc. The increased efficiency coming from the use of\ntrapezoidal beams has been recognised, but little has been done to produce the\nsame uniform strain within the most commonly available rectangular beams. This\nwork proposes a new approach via a smart compliant structure which permits to\ndeform a set of bimorphs in pure bending. Furthermore, since the deflections\nare synchronous, the power signals produced are in phase and power conditioning\nis simplified and made more efficient. The kinematic requirements for uniform\nstrain are discussed, the novel structure is proposed and modelled with finite\nelements, a prototype is presented and characterised to support the modelling.\nThe proposed structure induces almost perfectly uniform strain in the\npiezoelectric beams for all useful rotation angles, demonstrating that,\ncompared to a traditional cantilever, twice as many charges can be produced\nwhen the same maximum strain is applied to the material. Synchronicity is also\nexperimentally verified for the prototype, as power signals resulting from\nimpact excitation are observed to be in phase. The principle of synchronous\npure bending via helper structures can be applied in general to increase the\nperformance of piezoelectric energy harvesters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 14:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}
