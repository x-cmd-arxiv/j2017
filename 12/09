This is made possible by\nintroducing a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) regularising algorithm. We\ndemonstrate the advantages and scalability of CRL over existing\nstate-of-the-art attribute recognition and imbalanced data learning models on\ntwo large scale imbalanced benchmark datasets, the CelebA facial attribute\ndataset and the X-Domain clothing attribute dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 16:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

One such barrier, relevant for compact\ngrains in the inner regions of the disc, is the `bouncing barrier' in which\nlarge grains ($\\sim$ mm size) tend to bounce off each other rather than\nsticking. However, by maintaining a population of small grains it has been\nsuggested that cm-size particles may grow rapidly by sweeping up these small\ngrains. We present the first numerically resolved investigation into the\nconditions under which grains may be lucky enough to grow beyond the bouncing\nbarrier by a series of rare collisions leading to growth (so-called\n`breakthrough'). Our models support previous results, and show that in simple\nmodels breakthrough requires the mass ratio at which high velocity collisions\ntransition to growth instead of causing fragmentation to be low, $\\phi \\lesssim\n50$. However, in models that take into account the dependence of the\nfragmentation threshold on mass-ratio, we find breakthrough occurs more\nreadily, even if mass transfer is relatively inefficient. This suggests that\nbouncing may only slow down growth, rather than preventing growth beyond a\nthreshold barrier. However, even when growth beyond the bouncing barrier is\npossible, radial drift will usually prevent growth to arbitrarily large sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 17:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Let $K_r^{(k)}$ denote the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $r$\nvertices. For integers $k,r,n$ such that $2\\le k <r<n$, a $k$-uniform\nhypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices is uniquely $K_r^{(k)}$-saturated if $H$ does\nnot contain $K_r^{(k)}$ but adding to $H$ any $k$-set that is not a hyperedge\nof $H$ results in exactly one copy of $K_r^{(k)}$. Among uniquely\n$K_r^{(k)}$-saturated hypergraphs, the interesting ones are the primitive ones\nthat do not have a dominating vertex---a vertex belonging to all possible\n${n-1\\choose k-1}$ edges. Translating the concept to the complements of these\nhypergraphs, we obtain a natural restriction of $\\tau$-critical hypergraphs: a\nhypergraph $H$ is uniquely $\\tau$-critical if for every edge $e$,\n$\\tau(H-e)=\\tau(H)-1$ and $H-e$ has a unique transversal of size $\\tau(H)-1$.\n  We have two constructions for primitive uniquely $K_r^{(k)}$-saturated\nhypergraphs. One shows that for $k$ and $r$ where $4\\le k<r\\le 2k-3$, there\nexists such a hypergraph for every $n>r$. This is in contrast to the case $k=2$\nand $r=3$ where only the Moore graphs of diameter two have this property. Our\nother construction keeps $n-r$ fixed; in this case we show that for any fixed\n$k\\ge 2$ there can only be finitely many examples. We give a range for $n$\nwhere these hypergraphs exist. For $n-r=1$ the range is completely determined:\n$k+1\\le n \\le {(k+2)^2\\over 4}$. For larger values of $n-r$ the upper end of\nour range reaches approximately half of its upper bound. The lower end depends\non the chromatic number of certain Johnson graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 18:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Because most workloads can typically run most efficiently\non certain types of cores, mapping tasks on the best available resources can\nnot only save energy but also deliver high performance. However, optimal task\nscheduling for performance and/or energy is yet to be solved for heterogeneous\nplatforms. The work presented herein mathematically formulates the optimal\nheterogeneous system task scheduling as an optimization problem using queueing\ntheory. We analytically solve for the common case of two processor types, e.g.,\nCPU+GPU, and give an optimal policy (CAB). We design the GrIn heuristic to\nefficiently solve for near-optimal policy for any number of processor types\n(within 1.6% of the optimal). Both policies work for any task size distribution\nand processing order, and are therefore, general and practical. We extensively\nsimulate and validate the theory, and implement the proposed policy in a\nCPU-GPU real platform to show the optimal throughput and energy improvement.\nComparing to classic policies like load-balancing, our results range from\n1.08x~2.24x better performance or 1.08x~2.26x better energy efficiency in\nsimulations, and 2.37x~9.07x better performance in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 18:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

The extracted cross sections are separated into the\ntransverse (T), longitudinal (L), and LT, TT interference terms. The analyzed\ndata were part of experiment E01-004 (Fpi-2), which used 2.6-5.2GeV electron\nbeams and HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C. The primary objective\nwas to detect coincidence pion in the forward-angle, where the backward-angle\nomega events were fortuitously detected. The experiment has central Q2 values\nof 1.60 and 2.45GeV2, at W=2.21GeV. There was significant coverage in phi and\nepsilon, which allowed separation of sigma_T,L,LT,TT. The data set has a unique\nu coverage of -u~0, which corresponds to -t>4GeV2.\n  The separated sigma_T result suggest a flat ~1/Q^(1.33+/-1.21) dependence,\nwhereas sigma_L seems to hold a stronger 1/Q^(9.43+/-6.28) dependence. The\nsigma_L/sigma_T ratio indicate sigma_T dominance at Q2=2.45 GeV2 at the ~90%\nconfidence level.

Through comparison of our sigma_T data with the\nprediction of the Transition Distribution Amplitude (TDA) model, and signs of\nsigma_T dominance, promising indications of the applicability of the TDA\nfactorization are demonstrated at a much lower Q2 value than its preferred\nrange of Q2>10GeV2.

Originally BTC is a linear classifier which works based on the\nassumption that the samples of the classes of a given dataset are linearly\nseparable. However, in practice those samples may not be linearly separable. In\nthis context, we also propose another algorithm namely kernel basic\nthresholding classifier (KBTC) which is a non-linear kernel version of the BTC\nalgorithm. KBTC can achieve promising results especially when the given samples\nare linearly non-separable. For both proposals, we introduce sufficient\nidentification conditions (SICs) under which BTC and KBTC can identify any test\nsample in the range space of a given dictionary. By using SICs, we develop\nparameter estimation procedures which do not require any cross validation. Both\nBTC and KBTC algorithms provide efficient classifier fusion schemes in which\nindividual classifier outputs are combined to produce better classification\nresults. For instance, for the application of face identification, this is done\nby combining the residuals having different random projectors. For spatial\napplications such as hyper-spectral image classification, the fusion is carried\nout by incorporating the spatial information, in which the output residual maps\nare filtered using a smoothing filter. Numerical results on publicly available\nface and hyper-spectral datasets show that our proposal outperforms well-known\nsupport vector machines (SVM)-based techniques, multinomial logistic regression\n(MLR)-based methods, and sparsity-based approaches like $l_1$-minimization and\nsimultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 18:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Independent of any assumptions of X-ray\nefficiency, however, if the remnant is a rapidly-rotating, magnetized, neutron\nstar, the total energy in the external shock should rise by a factor\n$\\sim$$10^2$ (to $\\sim$$10^{52}$ erg) after a few years, therefore, Chandra\nobservations over the next year or two that do not show substantial brightening\nwill rule out such a remnant. The same observations can distinguish between two\ndifferent models for the relativistic outflow, either an angular or radially\nvarying structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 06:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of\nthe matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension\nreduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new\nformalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the\noscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where\nall oscillators are completely synchronized. In the case of networks of\nidentically coupled oscillators, this corresponds to breaking the symmetry of\nthe system as a means to preserve the symmetry of the dynamical state---a\nrecently discovered effect termed asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync).\nOur framework enables us to identify communication delay as a new and\npotentially common mechanism giving rise to AISync, which we demonstrate using\nnetworks of delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators.

COPER provides a theoretical framework for studying compression-based\nphase retrieval. The number of measurements required by COPER is connected to\n$\\kappa$, the $\\alpha$-dimension (closely related to the rate-distortion\ndimension) of the given family of compression codes. To finds the solution of\nCOPER, an efficient iterative algorithm called gradient descent for COPER\n(GD-COPER) is proposed. It is proven that under some mild conditions on the\ninitialization, if the number of measurements is larger than $ C \\kappa^2\n\\log^2 n$, where $C$ is a constant, GD-COPER obtains an accurate estimate of\nthe input vector in polynomial time. In the simulation results, JPEG2000 is\nintegrated in GD-COPER to confirm the superb performance of the resulting\nalgorithm on real-world images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 20:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 21:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 19:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

State of the art HAMR media consists of grains of FePtX ordered alloys\nexhibiting high perpendicular anisotropy separated by insulating grain\nboundaries. Nearby the plasmonic antenna, the difference of temperature between\ntwo 8nm wide neighboring grains in the media can reach 80K, representing a\ngigantic thermal gradient of ~40K/nm across the grain boundary. Such situations\nwith much weaker thermal gradient (~1K/nm, already considered as very large)\nhave already been studied in the field of spincaloritronics. There, it was\nshown that very large spin transfer torques due to thermal gradients can arise\nin magnetic tunnel junctions which can even yield magnetization switching.\nConsidering that two neighboring grains separated by an insulating grain\nboundary in a HAMR media can be viewed as a magnetic tunnel junction and that\nthe thermal gradients in HAMR are one to two orders of magnitude larger than\nthose existing in conventional spincaloritronics, one may expect a major impact\nfrom these thermal torques on magnetization switching dynamics and therefore on\nHAMR recording performances.

Yet conventional astrophysics would tell us that a 10 solar-mass\nseed, created by a Pop II/III supernova, should have taken at least 820 Myr to\ngrow via Eddington-limited accretion. This failure by LCDM constitutes one of\nits most serious challenges, requiring exotic `fixes', such as anomalously high\naccretion rates, or the creation of enormously massive (~10^5 solar-mass)\nseeds, neither of which is ever seen in the local Universe, or anywhere else\nfor that matter. Indeed, to emphasize this point, J1342+0928 is seen to be\naccreting at about the Eddington rate, negating any attempt at explaining its\nunusually high mass due to such exotic means. In this paper, we aim to\ndemonstrate that the discovery of this quasar instead strongly confirms the\ncosmological timeline predicted by the R_h=ct universe.

Symmetric potentials correspond to $a(\\lambda)\\equiv0$. If the\npotentials of the connecting edges belong to different asymmetry classes, then\ntypically the Floquet surface is not reducible. An exception occurs when two\ncopies of certain bipartite graphs are coupled; the Floquet surface in this\ncase is always reducible. This includes AA-stacked bilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 00:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 17:19:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 18:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Popular reinforcement learning approaches with a single controller\nperform poorly on IQA owing to the large and diverse state space. We propose\nthe Hierarchical Interactive Memory Network (HIMN), consisting of a factorized\nset of controllers, allowing the system to operate at multiple levels of\ntemporal abstraction.

The important feature is generating code\ndynamically for a specific query. We present the technique of code generation\nthat is applied to query processing on a raw file. The idea was to customize a\nquery program with a given query and generate a machine- and query-specific\nsource code. The generated code is compiled by GCC, Clang or any other C/C++\ncompiler, and the compiled file is dynamically linked to the main program for\nfurther processing. Code generation reduces the cost of generalizing query\nprocessing. It also avoids the overhead of the conventional interpretation\nduring achieve high performance. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) perform\nexcellent jobs in many aspects of big data, such as storage, indexing, and\nanalysis. DBMSs typically format entire data and load them into their storage\nlayer. They increase data-to-query time, which is the cost time it takes to\nconvert data into a specific schema and persist them in a disk. Ideally, DBMSs\nshould adapt to the input data and extract one/some of columns, not the entire\ndata, that is/are associated with a given query. Therefore, the query engine on\na raw file can reduce the cost of conventional general operators and avoid some\nunnecessary procedures, such as fully scanning, tokenizing and paring the whole\ndata. In the current study, we introduce our code-generation approach for\nin-situ processing of raw files, which is based on the template approach and\nthe hype approach. The approach minimizes the data-to-query time and achieves a\nhigh performance for query processing. There are some benefits from our work:\nreducing branches and instructions, unrolling loops, eliminating unnecessary\ndata type checks and optimizing the binary code with a compiler on a local\nmachine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 00:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

The models solve radiative\ntransfer equation in comoving frame, kinetic equilibrium equations (also known\nas NLTE equations), and hydrodynamical equations from (quasi-)hydrostatic\natmosphere to expanding stellar wind. The models allow us to predict wind\ndensity, velocity, and temperature (consequently also the terminal wind\nvelocity and the mass-loss rate) just from basic global stellar parameters. As\na result of their lower metallicity, the line radiative driving is weaker\nleading to lower wind mass-loss rates with respect to the Galactic stars.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to off-policy TD methods, called\nas ADFQ, which updates beliefs on state-action values, Q, through an online\nBayesian inference method known as Assumed Density Filtering. We formulate an\nefficient closed-form solution for the value update by approximately estimating\nanalytic parameters of the posterior of the Q-beliefs. Uncertainty measures in\nthe beliefs not only are used in exploration but also provide a natural\nregularization for the value update considering all next available actions.\nADFQ converges to Q-learning as the uncertainty measures of the Q-beliefs\ndecrease and improves common drawbacks of other Bayesian RL algorithms such as\ncomputational complexity. We extend ADFQ with a neural network. Our empirical\nresults demonstrate that ADFQ outperforms comparable algorithms on various\nAtari 2600 games, with drastic improvements in highly stochastic domains or\ndomains with a large action space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 02:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 03:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 19:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 05:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

To tackle this\nchallenge, mobile edge caching has emerged as a promising paradigm recently, in\nwhich the service providers (SPs) prefetch some popular contents in advance and\ncache them locally at the network edge. When requested, those locally cached\ncontents can be directly delivered to users with low latency, thus alleviating\nthe traffic load over backhaul channels during peak hours and enhancing the\nquality-of-experience (QoE) of users simultaneously. Due to the limited\navailable cache space, it makes sense for the SP to cache the most profitable\ncontents. Nevertheless, users' true valuations of contents are their private\nknowledge, which is unknown to the SP in general. This information asymmetry\nposes a significant challenge for effective caching at the SP side. Further,\nthe cached contents can be delivered with different quality, which needs to be\nchosen judiciously to balance delivery costs and user satisfaction. To tackle\nthese difficulties, in this paper, we propose an optimal auction mechanism from\nthe perspective of the SP. In the auction, the SP determines the cache space\nallocation over contents and user payments based on the users' (possibly\nuntruthful) reports of their valuations so that the SP's expected revenue is\nmaximized. The advocated mechanism is designed to elicit true valuations from\nthe users (incentive compatibility) and to incentivize user participation\n(individual rationality). In addition, we devise a computationally efficient\nmethod for calculating the optimal cache space allocation and user payments. We\nfurther examine the optimal choice of the content delivery quality for the case\nwith a large number of users and derive a closed-form solution to compute the\noptimal delivery quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 02:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

A few of matrix decomposition methods have been extended\nfor such multi-view data integration and pattern discovery.

To this end, we propose a joint matrix\ndecomposition framework (BJMD), which models the heterogeneity of noise by\nGaussian distribution in a Bayesian framework. We develop two algorithms to\nsolve this model: one is a variational Bayesian inference algorithm, which\nmakes full use of the posterior distribution; and another is a maximum a\nposterior algorithm, which is more scalable and can be easily paralleled.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nBJMD considering the heterogeneity of noise is superior or competitive to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 02:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

The exact definitions of maps, however, are often\napplication-specific and hand-crafted for different scenarios (e.g. 3D\nlandmarks, lines, planes, bags of visual words). We propose to represent maps\nas a deep neural net called MapNet, which enables learning a data-driven map\nrepresentation. Unlike prior work on learning maps, MapNet exploits cheap and\nubiquitous sensory inputs like visual odometry and GPS in addition to images\nand fuses them together for camera localization. Geometric constraints\nexpressed by these inputs, which have traditionally been used in bundle\nadjustment or pose-graph optimization, are formulated as loss terms in MapNet\ntraining and also used during inference. In addition to directly improving\nlocalization accuracy, this allows us to update the MapNet (i.e., maps) in a\nself-supervised manner using additional unlabeled video sequences from the\nscene.

The observed AGN fractions at $z=1.5-3$ is\nfound to be 90$^{+8}_{-19}$\\% and $57^{+23}_{-25}$\\% for the ultra/luminous\ninfrared galaxies with $\\log L_{\\rm IR}/L_{\\odot} = 12-12.8$ and $\\log L_{\\rm\nIR}/L_{\\odot} = 11.5-12$, respectively. The majority ($\\sim$2/3) of the ALMA\nand/or Herschel detected X-ray AGNs at $z=1.5-3$ appear to be star-formation\ndominant populations, having $L_{\\rm X}$/ $L_{\\rm IR}$ ratios smaller than the\n\"simultaneous evolution\" value expected from the local black-hole mass to\nstellar mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$) relation. On the basis of the $L_{\\rm X}$ and\nstellar mass relation, we infer that a large fraction of star-forming galaxies\nat $z=1.5-3$ have black hole masses smaller than those expected from the local\n$M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation. This is opposite to previous reports on luminous\nAGN at same redshifts detected in wider and shallower surveys, which are\nsubject to selection biases against lower luminosity AGN. Our results are\nconsistent with an evolutionary scenario that star formation occurs first, and\nan AGN-dominant phase follows later, in objects finally evolving into galaxies\nwith classical bulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 07:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Because the majority of a\nprogram faults may be revealed as undesired joint effect of the program\nstatements on each other and on program termination state, unlike the\nstate-of-the-art methods, Inforence tries to identify and select groups of\ninterdependent statements which altogether may affect the program failure.

This includes precision frequency\nmeasurements for atomic clock applications carried out with Ramsey\nspectroscopy. With the aim of eliminating probe-induced perturbations, a method\nof generalized auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy (GABRS) is presented and\nrigorously substantiated. Here, the usual local oscillator frequency control\nloop is augmented with a second control loop derived from secondary Ramsey\nsequences interspersed with the primary sequences and with a different Ramsey\nperiod. This second loop feeds back to a secondary clock variable and\nultimately compensates for the perturbation of the clock frequency caused by\nthe measurements in the first loop. We show that such a two-loop scheme can\nlead to perfect compensation of measurement-induced light shifts and does not\nsuffer from the effects of relaxation, time-dependent pulse fluctuations and\nphase-jump modulation errors that are typical of other hyper-Ramsey schemes.\nSeveral variants of GABRS are explored based on different secondary variables\nincluding added relative phase shifts between Ramsey pulses, external\nfrequency-step compensation, and variable second-pulse duration. We demonstrate\nthat a universal anti-symmetric error signal, and hence perfect compensation at\nfinite modulation amplitude, is generated only if an additional frequency-step\napplied during both Ramsey pulses is used as the concomitant variable\nparameter.

SN\n2012ab was a Type IIn (SN IIn) event discovered near the nucleus of spiral\ngalaxy 2MASXJ12224762+0536247. While its light curve resembles that of SN\n1998S, its spectral evolution does not. We see indications of CSM interaction\nin the strong intermediate-width emission features, the high luminosity (peak\nat absolute magnitude $M=-19.5$), and the lack of broad absorption features in\nthe spectrum. The H$\\alpha$ emission undergoes a peculiar transition. At early\ntimes it shows a broad blue emission wing out to $-14{,}000$ km\n$\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and a truncated red wing. Then at late times ($>$\n100$\\,$days) it shows a truncated blue wing and a very broad red emission wing\nout to roughly $+20{,}000$ km $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This late-time broad red wing\nprobably arises in the reverse shock. Spectra also show an asymmetric\nintermediate-width H$\\alpha$ component with stronger emission on the red side\nat late times. The evolution of the asymmetric profiles requires a density\nstructure in the distant CSM that is highly aspherical.

Employing the\nreduced density operator and a general master equation formalism, we find that\nboth the Rashba interaction and the photon field can significantly modulate the\nspin polarization and the thermospin polarization current. Tuning the Rashba\ncoupling constant, degenerate energy levels are formed corresponding to the\nAharonov-Casher destructive phase interference in the quantum ring system. Our\nanalysis indicates that the maximum spin polarization can be observed at the\npoints of degenerate energy levels due to spin accumulation in the system\nwithout the photon field. The thermospin current is thus suppressed. In the\npresence of the cavity, the photon field leads to an additional kinetic\nmomentum of the electron. As a result the spin polarization can be enhanced by\nthe photon field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 13:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

As\na key step to reach the necessary reliability of the operation, we develop a\ncombination of tilted wires called the syphon structure at the entrances of the\ncross.

The scattering of\nelectrically neutral particles on such space-times is described by amplitudes\nthat exhibit resonant behaviour when the scattering and deficit angles\ncoincide. This, in turn, leads to ring-like structures where the cross sections\nare formally divergent (\"singular lensing\").

Moreover, the massive amounts of available trajectory data make\ntrajectory mining and analyses very challenging. In this paper, we briefly\ndiscuss (i) an improved trajectory representation that takes into consideration\nspace-time structures, context and semantic properties of trajectories; (ii)\nnew forms of relations between the dimensions of a pair of trajectories; and\n(iii) big data approaches that can be used to develop a novel spatial-temporal\nclustering framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 16:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

In this\npaper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine\nlearning techniques, namely Deep Learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and\nlearning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics\nand identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning\nperspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We\nalso discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in\nthese types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL\ntechniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and\nchallenges are introduced.

The key formula \\[E(AB|a,b) = \\int\nA(a,b,\\lambda)B(a,b,\\lambda)\\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda\\] follows from the logic of\nplausible reasoning (the objective Bayesian interpretation of probability\ntheory) taken alone, without any further assumptions about realism. The space\n$\\Lambda$, usually interpreted as some space of `hidden variables', can be\nconstructed for an arbitrary `field of discourse' using Stone's theorem. The\nrejection of superdeterminism follows from logical independence -- the\nnon-existence of information which suggest a dependence -- of the free\ndecisions of the experimenters from everything else.\n  To prove the Bell inequality it is, then, sufficient to reduce this to\n\\[E(AB|a,b) = \\int A(a,\\lambda)B(b,\\lambda)\\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda.\\] This\nfollows for space-like separated measurements from Einstein causality alone.\nSo, the consequence of the violation of Bell's inequality is that Einstein\ncausality has been empirically falsified, without any loopholes left.\n  We consider and reject the idea of weakening the logic of plausible reasoning\ncould be used to create a loophole. Finally, we discuss what can be used to\nreplace Einstein causality. While weak (signal) Einstein causality holds, it\nfollows either from a notion of strong causality or from human inability to\nprepare states which violate quantum uncertainty, which makes it uninteresting\nfor fundamental considerations. A notion of strong causality has either\nunacceptable causal loops or requires a hidden preferred frame. Given that a\nhidden preferred frame is completely compatible with modern physics, it is\nargued that this choice is preferable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 12:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 13:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

A pair of vector-like SU(3) multiplet fermions in a\nhigher-dimensional representation is introduced in the bulk, and the DM\nparticle is identified with the lightest mass eigenstate among the components\nin the multiplets. In the original model description, the DM particle\ncommunicates with the Standard Model (SM) particles only through the bulk gauge\ninteraction, and hence our model is the GHU version of the MDM scenario. There\nare two typical realizations of the DM particle in 4-dimensional effective\ntheory: (i) the DM particle is mostly composed of the SM SU(2)_L multiplets, or\n(ii) the DM is mostly composed of the SM SU(2)_L singlets.
