Currently, a\nnetwork would first need to execute sometimes hundreds of intermediate layers\nthat specialize in unrelated aspects. Ideally, the more a network already knows\nabout an image, the better it should be at deciding which layer to compute\nnext. In this work, we propose convolutional networks with adaptive inference\ngraphs (ConvNet-AIG) that adaptively define their network topology conditioned\non the input image. Following a high-level structure similar to residual\nnetworks (ResNets), ConvNet-AIG decides for each input image on the fly which\nlayers are needed. In experiments on ImageNet we show that ConvNet-AIG learns\ndistinct inference graphs for different categories. Both ConvNet-AIG with 50\nand 101 layers outperform their ResNet counterpart, while using 20% and 38%\nless computations respectively. By grouping parameters into layers for related\nclasses and only executing relevant layers, ConvNet-AIG improves both\nefficiency and overall classification quality. Lastly, we also study the effect\nof adaptive inference graphs on the susceptibility towards adversarial\nexamples.

Our method, which falls into the\nclass of infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) methods, uses a\nprobabilistic representation for such sensitivities as the expectation of a\nfunctional of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process.\nThe latter process is the unique solution to a constrained linear stochastic\ndifferential equation with jumps whose coefficients, domain and directions of\nreflection are modulated by the reflected diffusion. We propose an\nasymptotically unbiased estimator for such sensitivities using an Euler\napproximation of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process.\nProving that the Euler approximation converges is challenging because the\nderivative process jumps whenever the reflected diffusion hits the boundary (of\nthe domain). A key step in the proof is establishing a continuity property of\nthe related derivative map, which is of independent interest. We compare the\nperformance of our IPA estimator to a standard likelihood ratio estimator\n(whenever the latter is applicable), and provide numerical evidence that the\nvariance of the former is substantially smaller than that of the latter.

We demonstrate here that large\nslow slip events are in fact a cluster of short-duration slow transients.

The\ngoal of this article is to measure the tendency of CNNs to learn surface\nstatistical regularities of the dataset. To this end, we use Fourier filtering\nto construct datasets which share the exact same high level abstractions but\nexhibit qualitatively different surface statistical regularities. For the SVHN\nand CIFAR-10 datasets, we present two Fourier filtered variants: a low\nfrequency variant and a randomly filtered variant. Each of the Fourier\nfiltering schemes is tuned to preserve the recognizability of the objects. Our\nmain finding is that CNNs exhibit a tendency to latch onto the Fourier image\nstatistics of the training dataset, sometimes exhibiting up to a 28%\ngeneralization gap across the various test sets. Moreover, we observe that\nsignificantly increasing the depth of a network has a very marginal impact on\nclosing the aforementioned generalization gap.

Instead, the radio data requires a mildly relativistic\nwide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high velocity\ntail of the neutron-rich material dynamically ejected during the merger or a\ncocoon of material that breaks out when a jet transfers its energy to the\ndynamical ejecta. The cocoon scenario can explain the radio light curve of\nGW170817 as well as the gamma-rays and X-rays (possibly also ultraviolet and\noptical emission), and hence is the model most consistent with the\nobservational data.

To shed light on the mechanism of this phenomenon, we present the first\ncomprehensive theory of polariton-assisted remote energy transfer (PARET) based\non strong-coupling of donor and/or acceptor chromophores to surface plasmons.\nApplication of our theory demonstrates that PARET up to a micron is indeed\npossible via strong-coupling. In particular, we report two regimes for PARET:\nin one case, strong-coupling to a single type of chromophore leads to transfer\nmediated largely by surface plasmons while in the other case, strong-coupling\nto both types of chromophores creates energy transfer pathways mediated by\nvibrational relaxation. Importantly, we highlight conditions under which\ncoherence enhances or deteriorates these processes. For instance, while\nexclusive strong-coupling to donors can enhance transfer to acceptors, the\nreverse turns out not to be true. However, strong-coupling to acceptors can\nshift energy levels in a way that transfer from acceptors to donors can occur,\nthus yielding a chromophore role-reversal or \"carnival effect.\" This\ntheoretical study demonstrates the potential for confined electromagnetic\nfields to control and mediate PARET, thus opening doors to the design of remote\nmesoscale interactions between molecular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 18:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 23:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Using a simple Leaky Box Model\n(LBM) for galactic propagation we have not been able to simultaneously\nreproduce the individual He and C nuclei spectra and the large increase in He/C\nratio that is observed at low energies. However, using a truncated LBM with\ndifferent truncation parameters for each nucleus that are related to their rate\nof energy loss by ionization which is ~Z2/A, these different features can be\nmatched. This suggests that we are observing the effects of the source\ndistribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy on the low energy spectra of cosmic\nray nuclei and that there may be a paucity of nearby sources. In this\npropagation model we start very specific source spectra for He and C which are\n~dj/dP = P-2.24, the same for each nucleus and also for all rigidities.

We conclude that as opposed to flat-cosmology, for the\nnon-flat cosmology models (i) the escape fraction needs steep redshift\nevolution and even unrealistically high values at some redshifts and (ii) most\nof the physical parameters require to have non-monotonic redshift evolution,\nespecially apparent when Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter data is included in the\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 10:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The sources powering\nboth their extremely high luminosities and dust temperatures are thought to be\ndeeply buried and rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Hot DOGs\ncould therefore represent a key evolutionary phase in which the SMBH growth\npeaks. X-ray observations can be used to study their obscuration levels and\nluminosities.

While imaginary time treatments of scattering are possible, imaginary\ntime is not a natural framework for treating scattering problems. Purpose: To\ntest a recently introduced method for performing direct calculations of\nscattering observables using real-time path integrals. Methods: The\ncomputations are based on a new interpretation of the path integral as the\nexpectation value of a potential functional on a space of continuous paths with\nrespect to a complex probability distribution. The method has the advantage\nthat it can be applied to arbitrary short-range potentials.

Here we describe an approach for deriving the probability\nthat anthropogenic forcings have caused a given observed change.

We argue that these concepts are\nalso relevant, and can be straightforwardly extended to, the context of\ndetection and attribution of long term trends associated to climate change\n(D&A). For this purpose, and in agreement with the principle of\n\"fingerprinting\" applied in the conventional D&A framework, a trajectory of\nchange is converted into an event occurrence defined by maximizing the causal\nevidence associated to the forcing under scrutiny. Other key assumptions used\nin the conventional D&A framework, in particular those related to numerical\nmodels error, can also be adapted conveniently to this approach. Our proposal\nthus allows to bridge the conventional framework with the standard causal\ntheory, in an attempt to improve the quantification of causal probabilities.

This hybrid method makes the fast calculation of ion transport\npossible at the price of lost details. We show that the implicit-water model is\nan appropriate representation of the explicit-water model when we look at the\nsystem at the device (i.e., input vs.\\ output) level. The two models produce\nqualitatively similar behavior of the electrical current for different voltages\nand model parameters.

Therefore, reduced models can suffice for general\ndevice understanding and device design, but more detailed models might be\nneeded for molecular level understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 20:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

Viewed abstractly, these problems often have a flavor not just of\ntime series modeling but also of regime detection, a problem with a rich\nhistory across a variety of applications, including speech recognition [Fox et\nal., 2011], finance [Lee, 2009], EEG analysis [Camilleri et al., 2014], and\ngeophysics [Weatherley and Mora, 2002]. In spite of the parallels, regime\ndetection methods are rarely used in microbiome analysis, most likely due to\nthe fact that references for these methods are scattered across several\nliteratures, descriptions are inaccessible outside limited research\ncommunities, and implementations are difficult to come across.\n  We distill the core ideas of different regime detection methods, provide\nexample applications, and share reproducible code, making these techniques more\naccessible to microbiome researchers.

The state-of-the-art in object detection is represented by\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the fast R-CNN algorithm.

The most reliable methods of MCMC are\ncomputationally expensive. Sequential ensemble methods such as ensemble Kalman\nfilers and particle filters provide a favourable alternative. However, Ensemble\nKalman Filter has an assumption of Gaussianity. Ensemble Transform Particle\nFilter does not have this assumption and has proven to be highly beneficial for\nan initial condition estimation and a small number of parameter estimation in\nchaotic dynamical systems with non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper we\nemploy Ensemble Transform Particle Filter (ETPF) and Ensemble Transform Kalman\nFilter (ETKF) for parameter estimation in nonlinear problems with 1, 5, and\n2500 uncertain parameters and compare them to importance sampling (IS). We\nprove that the updated parameters obtained by ETPF lie within the range of an\ninitial ensemble, which is not the case for ETKF. We examine the performance of\nETPF and ETKF in a twin experiment setup and observe that for a small number of\nuncertain parameters (1 and 5) ETPF performs comparably to ETKF in terms of the\nmean estimation. For a large number of uncertain parameters (2500) ETKF is\nrobust with respect to the initial ensemble while ETPF is sensitive due to\nsampling error. Moreover, for the high-dimensional test problem ETPF gives an\nincrease in the root mean square error after data assimilation is performed.\nThis is resolved by applying distance-based localization, which however\ndeteriorates a posterior estimation of the leading mode by largely increasing\nthe variance. A possible remedy is instead of applying localization to use only\nleading modes that are well estimated by ETPF, which demands a knowledge at\nwhich mode to truncate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 22:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 15:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Here we consider an\noptomechanical system consisting of two vibrating mirrors coupled to an optical\nresonator. We find that motional forces can determine noticeable coupling rates\nbetween the two spatially separated vibrating mirrors. We show that, by tuning\nthe two mechanical oscillators into resonance, energy is exchanged between them\nat the quantum level. This coherent motional coupling is enabled by the\nexchange of virtual photon pairs, originating from the dynamical Casimir\neffect. The process proposed here shows that the electromagnetic quantum vacuum\nis able to transfer mechanical energy somewhat like an ordinary uid.

In this paper, I\nexplicitly clarify that the convergence is in the strong sense, and not the\nuniform sense, and furthermore, that the convergence occurs for any input state\nto the protocol, including the infinite-energy Basel states defined and\ndiscussed here. I also prove, in contrast to the above result, that the\nteleportation simulations of pure-loss, thermal, pure-amplifier, amplifier, and\nadditive-noise channels converge both strongly and uniformly to the original\nchannels, in the limit of ideal squeezing and detection for the simulations.\nFor these channels, I give explicit uniform bounds on the accuracy of their\nteleportation simulations. I then extend these uniform convergence results to\nparticular multi-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. These convergence statements\nhave important implications for mathematical proofs that make use of the\nteleportation simulation of bosonic Gaussian channels, some of which have to do\nwith bounding their non-asymptotic secret-key-agreement capacities.

Speech is largely produced during exhalation. In order to\nreplenish air in the lungs, speakers must periodically inhale. When inhalation\noccurs in the midst of continuous speech, it is generally through the mouth.\nIntra-speech breathing behavior has been the subject of much study, including\nthe patterns, cadence, and variations in energy levels. However, an often\nignored characteristic is the {\\em sound} produced during the inhalation phase\nof this cycle. Intra-speech inhalation is rapid and energetic, performed with\nopen mouth and glottis, effectively exposing the entire vocal tract to enable\nmaximum intake of air. This results in vocal tract resonances evoked by\nturbulence that are characteristic of the speaker's speech-producing apparatus.\nConsequently, the sounds of inhalation are expected to carry information about\nthe speaker's identity. Moreover, unlike other spoken sounds which are subject\nto active control, inhalation sounds are generally more natural and less\naffected by voluntary influences. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that\nbreath sounds are indeed bio-signatures that can be used to identify speakers.\nWe show that these sounds by themselves can yield remarkably accurate speaker\nrecognition with appropriate feature representations and classification\nframeworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 03:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 17:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

However,\nrecently, a rolling shutter camera has been widely used due to its low cost\nimaging capability and, since the rolling shutter camera captures the image\nline-by-line, the relative pose estimation of a rolling shutter camera is more\ndifficult than that of a global shutter camera. In this paper, we propose to\nexploit inertial measurements (gravity and angular velocity) for the rolling\nshutter relative pose estimation problem. The inertial measurements provide\ninformation about the partial relative rotation between two views (cameras) and\nthe instantaneous motion that causes the rolling shutter distortion. Based on\nthis information, we simplify the rolling shutter relative pose estimation\nproblem and propose effective methods to solve it. Unlike the previous methods,\nwhich require 44 (linear) or 17 (nonlinear) points with the uniform rolling\nshutter camera model, the proposed methods require at most 9 or 11 points to\nestimate the relative pose between the rolling shutter cameras.

However, the current challenge lies in the lack of a general\nmathematical formulation that applies to objects of arbitrary shape. We propose\nthat a measure of shape complementarity can be obtained from the extent of\napproximate overlap between shape skeletons. A space-continuous implicit\ngeneralization of the skeleton, called the skeletal density function (SDF) is\ndefined over the Euclidean space that contains the individual assembly\npartners. The SDF shape descriptors capture the essential features that are\nrelevant to proper contact alignment, and are considerably more robust than the\nconventional explicit skeletal representations. We express the shape\ncomplementarity score as a convolution of the individual SDFs. The problem then\nbreaks down to a global optimization of the score over the configuration space\nof spatial relations, which can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier\ntransforms (FFTs) on nonequispaced samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe scoring approach for several examples from 2D peg-in-hole alignment to more\ncomplex 3D examples in mechanical assembly and protein docking.

Then a spectral\nefficiency (SE) analysis framework for SM-LDM systems is proposed, which is\nsuitable for the SM-LDM systems with linear combining. Moreover, the\nclosed-form SE lower bound of SM-LDM systems with maximum ratio combining (MRC)\nis derived, which is based on this framework. Since the theoretical SE analysis\nof single transmit antenna (TA) LDM systems with MRC and spatial multiplexing\n(SMX) aided LDM systems with MRC lacks a closed-form expression, the\nclosed-form SE is also derived for these systems. Monte Carlo simulations are\nprovided to verify the tightness of our proposed SE lower bound. Furthermore,\nit can be shown via simulations that our proposed SM-LDM systems always have a\nbetter SE performance than single-TA LDM systems, which can even outperform the\nSE of SMX aided LDM (SMX-LDM) systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 09:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 10:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:16:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 08:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

In these situations, applying DL\ntechniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting.\nThus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results\non these tasks.

Our\nfirst contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way\nto 1D or 2D images.

The accuracy of such algorithms depends\nsignificantly on the size of the underlying training dataset; in reality a\nsmall or medium sized organization often does not have the necessary data to\ntrain a reasonably accurate model. For such organizations, a realistic solution\nis to train their machine learning models based on their joint dataset (which\nis a union of the individual ones). Unfortunately, privacy concerns prevent\nthem from straightforwardly doing so. While a number of privacy-preserving\nsolutions exist for collaborating organizations to securely aggregate the\nparameters in the process of training the models, we are not aware of any work\nthat provides a rational framework for the participants to precisely balance\nthe privacy loss and accuracy gain in their collaboration.

Our method estimates a distribution of the\nquality function for randomised networks to calculate a likelihood of each\ncommunity in the given network. We illustrate our algorithm by synthetic and\nempirical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 13:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 15:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

Controlled amounts of magnetic\nflux were injected from a point along the edge of a square sample, which at 2.5\nK responds by nucleation of a thermomagnetic avalanche. Magneto-optical imaging\nwas used to show that when such films are cooled in the presence of in-plane\nmagnetic fields they become anisotropic, and the morphology of the avalanches\nchange systematically, both with the direction and magnitude of the field. The\nimages reveal that the avalanching dendrites consistently bend towards the\ndirection perpendicular to that of the in-plane field.

Model order reduction\n(MOR) techniques are often used to reduce the order of spatially-discretized\nsystems and hence reduce computational complexity. A particular class of MOR\ntechniques are $\\mathcal H_2$-optimal methods such as the iterative rational\nKrylov subspace algorithm (IRKA) and related schemes. However, these methods\nare used to obtain good approximations on a infinite time-horizon. Thus, in\nthis work, our main goal is to discuss MOR schemes for time-limited linear\nsystems. For this, we propose an alternative time-limited $\\mathcal H_2$-norm\nand show its connection with the time-limited Gramians. We then provide\nfirst-order optimality conditions for an optimal reduced order model (ROM) with\nrespect to the time-limited $\\mathcal H_2$-norm. Based on these optimality\nconditions, we propose an iterative scheme, which, upon convergence, aims at\nsatisfying these conditions approximately. Then, we analyze how far away the\nobtained ROM due to the proposed algorithm is from satisfying the optimality\nconditions. We test the efficiency of the proposed iterative scheme using\nvarious numerical examples and illustrate that the newly proposed iterative\nmethod can lead to a better reduced-order compared to the unrestricted IRKA in\nthe finite time interval of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 13:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

We\nanalyze the behavior of the mixing dynamics in different scenarios using an\ninterface deformation model. We show that the scalar dissipation rate, which is\nrelated to the dissolution fluxes, is controlled by interfacial processes,\nspecifically the equilibrium between interface compression and diffusion, which\ndepends on the flow field configuration. We consider different scenarios of\nincreasing complexity. First, we analyze a double-gyre synthetic velocity\nfield. Second, a Rayleigh-B\\'enard instability (the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood\nproblem), in which stagnation points are located at a fixed interface. This\nsystem experiences a transition from a diffusion controlled mixing to a chaotic\nconvection as the Rayleigh number increases. Finally, a Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability with a moving interface, in which mixing undergoes three different\nregimes: diffusive, convection dominated, and convection shutdown. The\ninterface compression model correctly predicts the behavior of the systems. It\nshows how the dependency of the compression rate on diffusion explains the\nchange in the scaling behavior of the scalar dissipation rate. The model\nindicates that the interaction between stagnation points and the correlation\nstructure of the velocity field is also responsible for the transition between\nregimes. We also show the difference in behavior between the dissolution fluxes\nand the mixing state of the systems. We observe that while the dissolution flux\ndecreases with the Rayleigh number, the system becomes more homogeneous. That\nis, mixing is enhanced by reducing diffusion. This observation is explained by\nthe effect of the instability patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 14:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

If Hawking radiation is well\napproximated by an outgoing particle generated from pair creation around the\nblack hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There\nshould be a unitary mechanism to reduce the number of states inside the horizon\nfor black hole evaporation. Because the infalling antiparticle has negative\nenergy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that the\ntwo particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy\nsystem by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model\ncalculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible\nbefore the Page time while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after\nthe Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair\nforms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically\nincrease, which is supported by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS)\nargument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the\nentire system; hence, the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based\non these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant\npicture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity,\nsemi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black\nhole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time\nat the latest; hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be\napplied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 14:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive trans-allelic\nprediction model, a generalized version of our previous biophysical model, that\ncan predict peptide interactions for all three human MHC-II loci (HLA-DR,\nHLA-DP and HLA-DQ), using both peptide sequence data and structural information\nof MHC-II molecules.

Unsupervised cross-modal hashing is more flexible and applicable\nthan supervised methods, since no intensive labeling work is involved. However,\nexisting unsupervised methods learn hashing functions by preserving inter and\nintra correlations, while ignoring the underlying manifold structure across\ndifferent modalities, which is extremely helpful to capture meaningful nearest\nneighbors of different modalities for cross-modal retrieval. To address the\nabove problem, in this paper we propose an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial\nCross-modal Hashing approach (UGACH), which makes full use of GAN's ability for\nunsupervised representation learning to exploit the underlying manifold\nstructure of cross-modal data. The main contributions can be summarized as\nfollows: (1) We propose a generative adversarial network to model cross-modal\nhashing in an unsupervised fashion. In the proposed UGACH, given a data of one\nmodality, the generative model tries to fit the distribution over the manifold\nstructure, and select informative data of another modality to challenge the\ndiscriminative model. The discriminative model learns to distinguish the\ngenerated data and the true positive data sampled from correlation graph to\nachieve better retrieval accuracy. These two models are trained in an\nadversarial way to improve each other and promote hashing function learning.\n(2) We propose a correlation graph based approach to capture the underlying\nmanifold structure across different modalities, so that data of different\nmodalities but within the same manifold can have smaller Hamming distance and\npromote retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments compared with 6\nstate-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 15:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

The main goal of the theory is to formulate all the\nnavigation observables within the General Relativity Theory. The same approach\nshould be applied also to the intersatellite GPS-communications (in perspective\nalso between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this\npaper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites\nmoving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits, based on the introduction of two\ngravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal\nsatellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the\nsatellites during their uncorrelated motion.The intersection of the two null\ncones defines a distance, which can be found from a differential equation in\nfull derivatives. This distance is the space-time interval in GRT. Applying\nsome theorems from higher algebra, it was proved that this space-time distance\ncan become zero, consequently it can be also negative and positive. But in\norder to represent the geodesic distance travelled by the signal, the\nspace-time interval has to be \"compatible\" with the Euclidean distance. So this\n\"compatibility condition\", conditionally called \"condition for ISC\", is the\nmost important consequence of the theory. The other important consequence is\nthat the geodesic distance turns out to be the space-time interval, but with\naccount also of the \"condition for ISC\". This interpretation enables the strict\nmathematical proof that the geodesic distance is greater than the Euclidean\ndistance - a result, entirely based on the \"two null cones approach\" and\nmoreover, without any use of the Shapiro delay formulae. Consistency between\nseveral other newly derived numerical parameters is noted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 11:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 18:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Crucial for\naddressing such issue, is the need of quantitative predictions for both CME\nsignal and the non-CME background consistently, with sophisticated modeling\ntool.

Analyzing the\ncorrelations of collected data from human brain activities and representing\nactivity patterns are two problems in brain decoding based on functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. However, existing correlation\nanalysis methods mainly focus on the strength information of voxel, which\nreveals functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex. They tend to neglect\nthe structural information that implies the intracortical or intrinsic\nconnections; that is, structural connectivity. Hence, the effective\nconnectivity inferred by these methods is relatively unilateral. Therefore, we\nproposed a correlation network (CorrNet) framework that could be flexibly\ncombined with diverse pattern representation models. In the CorrNet framework,\nthe topological correlation was introduced to reveal structural information.\nRich correlations were obtained, which contributed to specifying the underlying\neffective connectivity. We also combined the CorrNet framework with a linear\nsupport vector machine (SVM) and a dynamic evolving spike neuron network (SNN)\nfor pattern representation separately, thus providing a novel method for\ndecoding cognitive activity patterns. Experimental results verified the\nreliability and robustness of our CorrNet framework and demonstrated that the\nnew method achieved significant improvement in brain decoding over comparable\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 11:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}
