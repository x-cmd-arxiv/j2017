We consider a network coding deployed wireless ad hoc\nnetwork where source nodes are connected to terminal nodes with the help of\nintermediate nodes. We show that mixing operations in network coding can induce\npacket anonymity that allows the inter-connections in a network to be\ndecoupled. This enables each intermediate node to consider complex network\ninter-connections as a node-environment interaction such that the Markov\ndecision process (MDP) can be employed at each intermediate node. The optimal\npolicy that can be obtained by solving the MDP provides each node with optimal\namount of changes in transmission range given network dynamics (e.g., the\nnumber of nodes in the range and channel condition). Hence, the network can be\nadaptively and optimally evolved by responding to the network dynamics. The\nproposed strategy is used to maximize long-term utility, which is achieved by\nconsidering both current network conditions and future network dynamics. We\ndefine the utility of an action to include network throughput gain and the cost\nof transmission power.

The key of\nthis new form of learning is to design a proxy task (e.g. image colorization),\nfrom which a discriminative loss can be formulated on unlabeled data. Many\nproxy tasks, however, lack the critical supervision signals that could induce\ndiscriminative representation for the target image segmentation task. Thus\nself-supervision's performance is still far from that of supervised\npre-training. In this study, we overcome this limitation by incorporating a\n\"mix-and-match\" (M&M) tuning stage in the self-supervision pipeline. The\nproposed approach is readily pluggable to many self-supervision methods and\ndoes not use more annotated samples than the original process. Yet, it is\ncapable of boosting the performance of target image segmentation task to\nsurpass fully-supervised pre-trained counterpart. The improvement is made\npossible by better harnessing the limited pixel-wise annotations in the target\ndataset. Specifically, we first introduce the \"mix\" stage, which sparsely\nsamples and mixes patches from the target set to reflect rich and diverse local\npatch statistics of target images. A \"match\" stage then forms a class-wise\nconnected graph, which can be used to derive a strong triplet-based\ndiscriminative loss for fine-tuning the network. Our paradigm follows the\nstandard practice in existing self-supervised studies and no extra data or\nlabel is required.

One possible\nmodification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that\ngives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of\nthe circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed\nduring their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure\ngravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational\nwaves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as\nan example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider\ngravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational\nwave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them\nusing a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly\ndistributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find\nthat the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from\nGW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while\naLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds\nfrom stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and\nestimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are\nconsistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two\nthird-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger\nthan current binary pulsar bounds.

A particular challenge is to\ndemonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of\nstability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the\nfact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans.\nHere we present a computational model that combines simulations of several\nbiochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show\nthat the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of\nthe model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one\ninvolving the atypical protein kinase PKM{\\zeta} and its messenger RNA, the\nother involving PKM{\\zeta} and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate\nthat robust bistability - stable equilibria both in the synapse's potentiated\nand unpotentiated states - can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions.\nThe model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including\ninduction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation\nand the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 23:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 20:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

This paper introduces the\nGeometry-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GAGAN) for incorporating\ngeometric information into the image generation process. Specifically, in GAGAN\nthe generator samples latent variables from the probability space of a\nstatistical shape model. By mapping the output of the generator to a canonical\ncoordinate frame through a differentiable geometric transformation, we enforce\nthe geometry of the objects and add an implicit connection from the prior to\nthe generated object. Experimental results on face generation indicate that the\nGAGAN can generate realistic images of faces with arbitrary facial attributes\nsuch as facial expression, pose, and morphology, that are of better quality\nthan current GAN-based methods.

Many practitioners make\nthe choice of a Bayesian framework to conduct this assessment for accounting of\nparametric uncertainties, which are typically high in such analyses\ncharacterized by a low number of observations. Nonetheless, such approaches can\nprovide large credibility domains for $\\xi$, including negative and positive\nvalues, which does not allow to conclude on the nature of the tail. Considering\nthe block maxima framework, a generic approach of the determination of the\nvalue and sign of $\\xi$ arises from model selection between the Fr\\'echet,\nGumbel and Weibull possible domains of attraction conditionally to\nobservations. Opposite to the common choice of the GEV as an appropriate model\nfor {\\it sampling} extreme values, this model selection must be conducted with\ngreat care. The elicitation of proper, informative and easy-to use priors is\nconducted based on the following principle: for all parameter dimensions they\nact as posteriors of noninformative priors and virtual samples. Statistics of\nthese virtual samples can be assessed from prior predictive information, and a\ncompatibility rule can be carried out to complete the calibration, even though\nthey are only semi-conjugated.

By introducing the \"local\" versions of\nthese invariants, $\\sigma_T(v)$ for the sum of distance from $v$ to all other\nvertices and $F_T(v)$ for the number of subtrees containing $v$, extremal\nproblems can be raised and studied for vertices within a tree.

This is further exacerbated under dynamic conditions\n(e.g., moving vehicles) where the access to the base station (access point) is\nhighly dynamic with intermittent on-off periods, requiring more frequent beam\nalignment and signal training. To mitigate this issue, we consider an online\nstochastic optimization formulation where the goal is to maximize the\ndirectivity gain (i.e., received energy) of the beam alignment policy within a\ntime period. We exploit the inherent correlation and unimodality properties of\nthe model, and demonstrate that contextual information improves the\nperformance. To this end, we propose an equivalent structured Multi-Armed\nBandit model to optimally exploit the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In\ncontrast to the classical MAB models, the contextual information makes the\nlower bound on regret (i.e., performance loss compared with an oracle policy)\nindependent of the number of beams. This is a crucial property since the number\nof all combinations of beam patterns can be large in transceiver antenna\narrays, especially in massive MIMO systems. We further provide an\nasymptotically optimal beam alignment algorithm, and investigate its\nperformance via simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 03:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

In this paper, we propose a novel simple\nyet effective framework of \"Feature Agglomeration Networks\" (FANet) to build a\nnew single stage face detector, which not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance but also runs efficiently. As inspired by Feature Pyramid Networks\n(FPN), the key idea of our framework is to exploit inherent multi-scale\nfeatures of a single convolutional neural network by aggregating higher-level\nsemantic feature maps of different scales as contextual cues to augment\nlower-level feature maps via a hierarchical agglomeration manner at marginal\nextra computation cost. We further propose a Hierarchical Loss to effectively\ntrain the FANet model. We evaluate the proposed FANet detector on several\npublic face detection benchmarks, including PASCAL face, FDDB and WIDER FACE\ndatasets and achieved state-of-the-art results.

An object detector, trained with low IoU\nthreshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection\nperformance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main\nfactors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to\nexponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch\nbetween the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input\nhypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is\nproposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors\ntrained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective\nagainst close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage,\nleveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution\nfor training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively\nimproved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of\nexamples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade\nprocedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the\nhypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of\nthe Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the\nchallenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is\nwidely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains\nindependently of the baseline detector strength.

For X-ray pulsars, the standard has been the $Z^2$ statistic, which sums\nover more than one harmonic. For $\\gamma$-rays, the $H$-test, which optimizes\nthe number of harmonics to sum, is often used. These periodograms all suffer\nfrom the same problem, namely artefacts caused by correlations in the Fourier\ncomponents that arise from testing frequencies with a non-integer number of\ncycles. This article addresses this problem. The modified Rayleigh statistic is\ndiscussed, its generalization to any harmonic, $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$, is\nformulated, and from the latter, the modified $Z^2$ statistic, $\\mathcal{Z}^2$,\nis constructed. Versions of these statistics for binned data and point\nmeasurements are derived, and it is shown that the variance in the\nuncertainties can have an important influence on the periodogram. It is shown\nhow to combine the information about the signal frequency from the different\nharmonics to estimate its value with maximum accuracy. The methods are applied\nto an $\\textit{XMM-Newton}$ observation of the Crab pulsar for which a\ndecomposition of the pulse profile is presented, and shows that most of the\npower is in the second, third, and fifth harmonics. The statistical detection\npower of the $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ statistic is superior to the FFT and equivalent\nto the Lomb-Scargle (LS). Response to gaps in the data is assessed, and it is\nshown that the LS does not protect against the distortions they cause. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the classical $R^2$ and $Z^2$ should be\nreplaced by $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ and $\\mathcal{Z}^2$ in all applications with\nevent data, and the LS should be replaced by the $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ when the\nuncertainty varies from one point measurement to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 09:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

In spite of numerous research and development\nefforts over the last two decades, the industrial adoption of haptic-assisted\nVP/VA has been slower than expected. Putting hardware limitations aside, the\nmain roadblocks faced in software development can be traced to the lack of\neffective and efficient computational models of haptic feedback. Such models\nmust 1) accommodate the inherent geometric complexities faced when assembling\nobjects of arbitrary shape; and 2) conform to the computation time limitation\nimposed by the notorious frame rate requirements---namely, 1 kHz for haptic\nfeedback compared to the more manageable 30-60 Hz for graphic rendering. The\nsimultaneous fulfillment of these competing objectives is far from trivial.\n  This survey presents some of the conceptual and computational challenges and\nopportunities as well as promising future directions in haptic-assisted VP/VA,\nwith a focus on haptic assembly from a geometric modeling and spatial reasoning\nperspective.

In the mean time, it is always assumed\nthat the channel state sequence is known at the eavesdropper and unknown at the\ntransmitter. Capacity results of both stochastic code (with random encoder and\ndeterministic decoder) and random code (with random encoder and decoder) are\ndiscussed.

Single-letter lower bounds on the secrecy capacities are given, which\nare proved to be the secrecy capacities when the main channel is less noisy\nthan the wiretap channel. The coding scheme is based on Csiszar's almost\nindependent coloring scheme and Ahlswede's elimination technique.

We find that in regime I the motor displacement during the\nfolding process is counteracted by a reverse displacement during the unfolding,\nwhile in regime II this counteraction is much weaker.

For\nfast foldings the motor trajectories differ significantly from the opposite\ntrajectories induced by the following unfolding process, resulting in a more\nefficient global motion than for slow foldings.

Because Bell\nscenarios are interested in quantum effects between nonlocal measurement\ndevices, we assign an observer to each device: Alice and Bob. Given that the\nobservers are stationary and space-like separated, each observer is privy to\ndifferent information along their shared equi-temporal lines due to\npermutations in the order they observe events. Therefore, each observer is\ninclined to assign different probability distributions to the same set of\npropositions due to these informational differences. The observers are\nobligated to update their probability distributions on the basis of locally\nobserved events, and in this sense, factuality is informational locality. In\nthis framework, only local variables or detections may be factual, but nothing\nprevents an observer from inquiring or making if-then inferences on the\ncounterfactual basis of a nonlocal proposition being true. Indeed the objects\npertaining to these nonlocal counterfactual propositions may be far outside an\nobserver's light cone. The MOPA arrives at the conclusion that the CHSH\ninequality is only nonlocally violated \"counterfactually\" by each observer\nwhereas local violations of the CHSH may be factual or counterfactual. We\nbelieve the MOPA to better gel probability theory (and thus QM) with Special\nRelativity than does the standard locality conditions imposed in the Bell and\nCHSH inequalities. The no-signaling condition is reinterpreted, and perhaps\nfurther clarified, in the MOPA and statements about counterfactuality and\nobserver dependent QM are made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 02:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 18:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

This is among the first\ninvestigations on the outsourcing relationships in software startups. By\nconducting exploratory case studies at six startups, we found a mixed\nexperience with outsourcing. The experimental nature of an early product\ndevelopment makes outsourcing a feasible option, although startups often suffer\nfrom its uncertainty and managing commitments from partners.

A positive Poisson ratio is a feature of the\nmajority of materials. Some materials, however, display auxetic behaviors (i.e.\npossess negative Poisson ratios). Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials\ndisplay different deformation mechanisms. Revealing these differences and their\neffects on the mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance. In\nthis study, effects of Poisson ratio on the mechanics of auxetic and\nnon-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided on effects\nof Poisson ratio on the static bending and free vibration behaviors of auxetic\nnanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed to model the nonlocal\neffects. Unlike Eringen nonlocal theory, the general nonlocal theory uses\ndifferent attenuation functions for the longitudinal and lateral strains. This\ntheory can reveal the Poisson ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics\nof nanomaterials. The obtained results showed that Poisson ratio is an\nessential parameter for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is\nrevealed that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or\nhardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the\nlongitudinal and lateral strains of the beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 21:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

To overcome these\nparadoxes, nonlocal boundary conditions should be correctly formed. However,\nstill forming these boundary conditions for differential nonlocal models is a\nchallenging task. To resolve the trouble, in this study, the iterative nonlocal\nresidual approach is employed. In the context of this approach, the field\nequation is solved in the local field with an imposed nonlocal residuals. This\nnonlocal residual is iteratively formed (not determined) depending on a\npre-determined local field. The iterative nonlocal residual approach permits\napplying the local boundary conditions. Thus, the paradoxes of differential\nnonlocal models due to the nonlocal boundary conditions are effectively solved.\nThe paradoxes of differential nonlocal models and reasons behind them are\ndiscussed. Moreover, a nonlocal beam model based on the iterative nonlocal\nresidual approach is proposed. This nonlocal beam model is employed to\ninvestigate the static bending and free vibration of differential nonlocal\ncantilever beams. Comparisons between the results of the iterative nonlocal\nresidual approach and results of integral nonlocal beam models are carried out.\nIt is demonstrated that the iterative nonlocal residual approach gives the same\nresults as integral nonlocal models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 22:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

However, although they may be characterized by\nbetter accuracy, larger DNNs require significant energy and area, thereby\nlimiting their wide adoption. The energy consumption of DNNs is driven by both\nmemory accesses and computation. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), as a\ntrade-off between accuracy and energy consumption, can achieve great energy\nreduction, and have good accuracy for large DNNs due to its regularization\neffect. However, BNNs show poor accuracy when a smaller DNN configuration is\nadopted. In this paper, we propose a new DNN model, LightNN, which replaces the\nmultiplications to one shift or a constrained number of shifts and adds. For a\nfixed DNN configuration, LightNNs have better accuracy at a slight energy\nincrease than BNNs, yet are more energy efficient with only slightly less\naccuracy than conventional DNNs. Therefore, LightNNs provide more options for\nhardware designers to make trade-offs between accuracy and energy. Moreover,\nfor large DNN configurations, LightNNs have a regularization effect, making\nthem better in accuracy than conventional DNNs. These conclusions are verified\nby experiment using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for different DNN\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 21:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}
