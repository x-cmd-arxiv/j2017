The collisions have\nbeen studied theoretically using a previously presented method based on an\nasymptotic two-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) model of\nionic-covalent interactions in the neutral atom-hydrogen-atom system, together\nwith the multichannel Landau-Zener model. The method has been extended to\ninclude configurations involving excited states of hydrogen using an estimate\nfor the two-electron transition coupling, but this extension was found to not\nlead to any remarkably high rates. Rate coefficients are calculated for\ntemperatures in the range 1000 - 20000 K, and charge transfer and\n(de)excitation processes involving the first excited S-states, 4s.5So and\n4s.3So, are found to have the highest rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 16:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 07:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

They are also predicted to form in the\ncontext of string theory. The main mechanism for a network of Nambu-Goto cosmic\nstrings to lose energy is through the production of loops and the subsequent\nemission of gravitational waves, thus offering an experimental signature for\nthe existence of cosmic strings. Here we report on the analysis conducted to\nspecifically search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string loops in\nthe data of Advanced LIGO 2015-2016 observing run (O1). No evidence of such\nsignals was found in the data, and as a result we set upper limits on the\ncosmic string parameters for three recent loop distribution models. In this\npaper, we initially derive constraints on the string tension $G\\mu$ and the\nintercommutation probability, using not only the burst analysis performed on\nthe O1 data set, but also results from the previously published LIGO stochastic\nO1 analysis, pulsar timing arrays, cosmic microwave background and Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis experiments. We show that these data sets are complementary in\nthat they probe gravitational waves produced by cosmic string loops during very\ndifferent epochs. Finally, we show that the data sets exclude large parts of\nthe parameter space of the three loop distribution models we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 16:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 13:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In principle this challenge can be overcome: hierarchical Bayesian\ninference provides a principled method for model selection and it converges on\nthe same posterior for both off-line (i.e. batch) and online learning. However,\nmaintaining a parameter posterior for each model in parallel has in general an\neven higher memory cost than storing the entire data set and is consequently\nclearly unfeasible. Alternatively, maintaining only a limited set of models in\nmemory could limit memory requirements. However, sufficient statistics for one\nmodel will usually be insufficient for fitting a different kind of model,\nmeaning that the agent loses information with each model change. We propose\nthat episodic memory can circumvent the challenge of limited memory-capacity\nonline model selection by retaining a selected subset of data points.

In an attempt to answer this question, we\nadopted a mixed-method research approach comprising a systematic literature\nreview and embedded case study of a commercial software development team. Our\nresearch has identified activities that comprise the Scrum Master role, and\nwhich additional roles are actually performed by Scrum Masters in practice. We\nfound nine activities that are performed by Scrum Masters. In addition, we\nfound that Scrum Masters also perform other roles, most importantly as Project\nManagers.

For example, shot charts, that is,\nmaps capturing locations of (made or missed) shots, and spatio-temporal\ntrajectories for all the players on the court can capture information about the\noffensive and defensive tendencies and schemes of a team. Characterization of\nthese processes is important for player and team comparisons, pre-game\nscouting, game preparation etc. Playing tendencies among teams have\ntraditionally been compared in a heuristic manner.

However, extremely luminous quasars at\nhigh redshift are very rare objects. Only wide area surveys have a chance to\nconstrain their population. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has so far\nprovided the most widely adopted measurements of the quasar luminosity function\n(QLF) at $z>3$. However, a careful re-examination of the SDSS quasar sample\nrevealed that the SDSS quasar selection is in fact missing a significant\nfraction of $z\\gtrsim3$ quasars at the brightest end. We have identified the\npurely optical color selection of SDSS, where quasars at these redshifts are\nstrongly contaminated by late-type dwarfs, and the spectroscopic incompleteness\nof the SDSS footprint as the main reasons. Therefore we have designed the\nExtremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS), based on a novel near-infrared JKW2\ncolor cut using WISE AllWISE and 2MASS all-sky photometry, to yield high\ncompleteness for very bright ($m_{\\rm{i}} < 18.0$) quasars in the redshift\nrange of $3.0\\leq z\\leq5.0$. It effectively uses random forest machine-learning\nalgorithms on SDSS and WISE photometry for quasar-star classification and\nphotometric redshift estimation. The ELQS will spectroscopically follow-up\n$\\sim 230$ new quasar candidates in an area of $\\sim12000\\,\\rm{deg}^2$ in the\nSDSS footprint, to obtain a well-defined and complete quasars sample for an\naccurate measurement of the bright-end quasar luminosity function at $3.0\\leq\nz\\leq5.0$. In this paper we present the quasar selection algorithm and the\nquasar candidate catalog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 17:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

It is shown\nthat the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver\ndelivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel\nunder an average power constraint.

As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power\ntransfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated\nnonlinear model of the harvester is used.

The physical predictions of such\nmodels crucially depend on the eigenvalue distribution of the Hessian matrix at\npotential minima. In particular, the stability of vacua and the dynamics of\nslow-roll inflation are sensitive to the magnitude of the smallest eigenvalues.\nThe Hessian eigenvalue distribution has been studied earlier, using the saddle\npoint approximation, in the leading order of $1/N$ expansion, where $N$ is the\ndimensionality of the landscape. This approximation, however, is insufficient\nfor the small eigenvalue end of the spectrum, where sub-leading terms play a\nsignificant role. We extend the saddle point method to account for the\nsub-leading contributions. We also develop a new approach, where the eigenvalue\ndistribution is found as an equilibrium distribution at the endpoint of a\nstochastic process (Dyson Brownian motion).

For this purpose,\nfor a given EFT, I introduce associated idealized low energy observers who only\nhave access to the energy scale below the UV cut-off scale of the EFT. In the\nframework of EFT, there is a clear difference between the particles lighter\nthan the UV cut-off scale and the particles which are heavier than the UV\ncut-off scale, as the lighter particles can be created below the UV cut-off\nscale while the heavier particles are not. This difference implies that the\nknowledge of the low energy observers on the stable heavy particles can be\nlimited, as the availability of the stable heavy particles is determined by the\nenvironment prepared by some UV theory unknown to the low energy observers. The\nlimitation of the knowledge of the low energy observers regarding the stable\nheavy particles whose mass is above the UV cut-off scale of the EFT leads to\nthe limitation of the WGC for constraining EFTs. To illustrate these points in\nan example, I analyze a model proposed by Saraswat arXiv:1608.06951 which\nrespects the WGC at high energy, but which may appear to violate the WGC for\nthe low energy observers.

While propulsion\nspeed is an important property of locomotion, efficiency is another factor that\nmay determine the swimming gait adopted by a micro-organism in order to\nlocomote in an energetically favorable manner. The efficiency of swimming in a\nNewtonian fluid is well characterized for different biological and artificial\nswimmers. However, these swimmers often encounter biological fluids displaying\nshear-thinning viscosities. Little is known about how this nonlinear rheology\ninfluences the efficiency of locomotion. Does the shear-thinning rheology\nrender swimming more efficient or less? How does the swimming efficiency depend\non the propulsion mechanism of a swimmer and rheological properties of the\nsurrounding shear-thinning fluid?

We propose\nthat this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons\nand dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or\nad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the\nfollowing three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is\ncomparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy\nwith baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM\ncross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely\nproportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle\nphysics model that gives a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and\nvelocity dependence. Direct detection constraints require our DM particles to\nbe either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding\nrespectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our\nmechanism applies and an equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached.\nHere, we focus on the heavy DM/cooling case as it is technically simpler. Under\nthese assumptions, we find that rotationally-supported disk galaxies could\nnaturally settle to equilibrium configurations satisfying a MDAR at all radii\nwithout invoking finely tuned feedback processes. We also discuss issues\nrelated to the small scale clumpiness of baryons, as well as predictions for\npressure-supported systems. We argue in particular that galaxy clusters do not\nfollow the MDAR despite being DM-dominated because they have not reached their\nequilibrium configuration.

The nature and origin of the multiverse idea presented in this\npaper, that is shared by the fields in the standard model coupled to gravity,\nis different from other notions of a multiverse. Via analyticity we are able to\nestablish definite relations among the universes. In this paper we illustrate\nthese properties for the extended Rindler space, while black hole spacetime and\nthe cosmological geometry of mini-superspace (see Appendix B) will appear in\nlater papers. In classical general relativity, extended Rindler space is\nequivalent to flat Minkowski space; it consists of the union of the four wedges\nin (u,v) light-cone coordinates as in Fig.(1). In quantum mechanics, the\nwavefunction is an analytic function of (u,v) that is sensitive to branch\npoints at the horizons u=0 or v=0, with branch cuts attached to them. The\nwavefunction is uniquely defined by analyticity on an infinite number of sheets\nin the cut analytic (u,v) spacetime. This structure is naturally interpreted as\nan infinite stack of identical Minkowski geometries, or universes, connected to\neach other by analyticity across branch cuts, such that each sheet represents a\ndifferent Minkowski universe when (u,v) are analytically continued to the real\naxis on any sheet.

The cards are laid\nface-down. A move consists of revealing two cards, chosen adaptively. If these\ncards match, i.e., they bear the same picture, they are removed from play;\notherwise, they are turned back to face down. The object of the game is to\nclear all cards while minimizing the number of moves. Past works have\nthoroughly studied the expected number of moves required, assuming optimal play\nby a player has that has perfect memory. In this work, we study the Memory game\nin a space-bounded setting.\n  We prove two time-space tradeoff lower bounds on algorithms (strategies for\nthe player) that clear all cards in $T$ moves while using at most $S$ bits of\nmemory. First, in a simple model where the pictures on the cards may only be\ncompared for equality, we prove that $ST = \\Omega(n^2 \\log n)$. This is tight:\nit is easy to achieve $ST = O(n^2 \\log n)$ essentially everywhere on this\ntradeoff curve. Second, in a more general model that allows arbitrary\ncomputations, we prove that $ST^2 = \\Omega(n^3)$. We prove this latter tradeoff\nby modeling strategies as branching programs and extending a classic counting\nargument of Borodin and Cook with a novel probabilistic argument. We conjecture\nthat the stronger tradeoff $ST = \\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^2)$ in fact holds even in\nthis general model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 20:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 22:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

It is a fourth order nonlinear singular perturbation\nequation arises from the binary alloy problem in materials science, and its\nlimit is proved to approach the Hele-Shaw flow. If the $L^2(\\Omega)$ error\nestimate is considered directly as in paper \\cite{elliott1989nonconforming}, we\ncan only prove that the error bound depends on the exponential function of\n$\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. Instead, this paper derives the error bound which depends\non the polynomial function of $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ by considering the discrete\n$H^{-1}$ error estimate first. There are two main difficulties in proving this\npolynomial dependence of the discrete $H^{-1}$ error estimate. Firstly, it is\ndifficult to prove discrete energy law and discrete stability results due to\nthe complex structure of the bilinear form of the Morley element\ndiscretization. This paper overcomes this difficulty by defining four types of\ndiscrete inverse Laplace operators and exploring the relations between these\ndiscrete inverse Laplace operators and continuous inverse Laplace operator.\nEach of these operators plays important roles, and their relations are crucial\nin proving the discrete energy law, discrete stability results and error\nestimates. Secondly, it is difficult to prove the discrete spectrum estimate in\nthe Morley element space because the Morley element space intersects with the\n$C^1$ conforming finite element space but they are not contained in each other.\nInstead of proving this discrete spectrum estimate in the Morley element space,\nthis paper proves a generalized coercivity result by exploring properties of\nthe enriching operators and using the discrete spectrum estimate in its $C^1$\nconforming relative finite element space, which can be obtained by using the\nspectrum estimate of the Cahn-Hilliard operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 20:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 22:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 22:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 21:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

We\nlabel the pseudo scalar component of the chiral fields axions and their real\nparts saxions. Thus in the models only one combination of axions will be a\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-boson which will act as the inflaton. The proposed\nmodels constitute consistent inflation for the following reasons: The inflation\npotential arises dynamically with stabilized saxions, the axion decay constant\ncan lie in the sub-Planckian region, and consistency with the Planck data is\nachieved. The axion landscape consisting of $m$ axion pairs is assumed with the\naxions in each pair having opposite charges. A fast roll--slow roll splitting\nmechanism for the axion potential is proposed which is realized with a special\nchoice of the axion basis. In this basis the $2m$ coupled equations split into\n$2m-1$ equations which enter in the fast roll and there is one unique linear\ncombination of the $2m$ fields which controls the slow roll and thus the power\nspectrum of curvature and tensor perturbations. It is shown that a significant\npart of the parameter space exists where inflation is successful, i.e., $N_{\\rm\npivot} = {[50, 60]}$, the spectral index $n_s$ of curvature perturbations, and\nthe ratio $r$ of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations and curvature\nperturbations, lie in the experimentally allowed regions given by the Planck\nexperiment.

At the laser intensity at the order of $10^{23}$ W/cm$^2$, the\neffects of RR are significant in a few laser period for a relativistic\nelectron. However, the laser at such intensity is tightly focused and the laser\nenergy is usually assumed to be fixed. Then, the signal of RR and energy\nconservation cannot be guaranteed. To assess the effects of RR in a tightly\nfocused laser pulse and the evolution of the laser energy, we simulate this\ninteraction with a beam of $10^9$ electrons by means of Particle-in-Cell (PIC)\nmethod. We observed that the effects of RR are suppressed due to the\nponderomotive force and accompanied by a non-negligible amount of laser field\nenergy reduction. This is due to the ponderomotive force that prevents the\nelectrons from approaching the center of the laser pulse and leads to the\ninteraction at weaker field region. At the same time, the laser energy is\nabsorbed through ponderomotive acceleration. Thus, the kinetic energy of the\nelectron beam has to be carefully selected such that the effects of RR become\nobvious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 21:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The assumption that an assortment of SUSY breaking F and D terms are\npresent in the hidden sector, and their values are uniformly distributed in the\nlandscape of D=4, N=1 effective supergravity models, leads to the expectation\nthat the landscape pulls towards large values of soft terms favored by a power\nlaw behavior P(m(soft))~ m(soft)^n. On the other hand, similar to Weinberg's\nprediction of the cosmological constant, one can assume an anthropic selection\nof weak scales not too far from the measured value characterized by m(W,Z,h)~\n100 GeV. Working within a fertile patch of gravity-mediated low energy\neffective theories where the superpotential mu term is << m(3/2), as occurs in\nmodels such as radiative breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry, this biases\nstatistical distributions on the landscape by a cutoff on the parameter\nDelta(EW), which measures fine-tuning in the m(Z)-mu mass relation. The\ncombined effect of statistical and anthropic pulls turns out to favor low\nenergy phenomenology that is more or less agnostic to UV physics.

The surface confined wave modes such as surface plasmons or\nwaveguide modes are excited in the dielectric-metal bilayer by obliquely\nincident $p$ waves. In the purely linear case, we find that the interplay\nbetween linear gain and surface confined wave modes can generate a large\nreflectance peak with its value much greater than 1. As the linear gain\nparameter increases, the peak appears at smaller incident angles, and the\nassociated modes also change from surface plasmons to waveguide modes. When the\nnonlinear gain is turned on, the reflectance shows very strong multistability\nnear the incident angles associated with surface confined wave modes. As the\nnonlinear gain parameter is varied, the reflectance curve undergoes complicated\ntopological changes and sometimes displays separated closed curves. When the\nnonlinear gain parameter takes an optimally small value, a giant amplification\nof the reflectance by three orders of magnitude occurs near the incident angle\nassociated with a waveguide mode.

As RPs\ngenerate texture visual patterns, we transform the problem of sensor data\nclassification to a problem of texture classification. Experiments for\nclassifying human activities based on accelerometer data showed that the\nproposed approach obtains the highest accuracies, outperforming time- and\nfrequency-domain features directly extracted from sensor data. The best results\nare obtained when using RGB RPs, in which each RGB channel corresponds to the\nRP of an independent accelerometer axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 00:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Often used as a\npreliminary step for dimensionality reduction or to facilitate interpretation,\nfinding robust and stable clusters is often crucial for appropriate for\ndownstream analysis. In the present work, we consider Bayesian nonparametric\n(BNP) models, a particularly popular set of Bayesian models for clustering due\nto their flexibility. Because of its complexity, the Bayesian posterior often\ncannot be computed exactly, and approximations must be employed. Mean-field\nvariational Bayes forms a posterior approximation by solving an optimization\nproblem and is widely used due to its speed. An exact BNP posterior might vary\ndramatically when presented with different data. As such, stability and\nrobustness of the clustering should be assessed.\n  A popular mean to assess stability is to apply the bootstrap by resampling\nthe data, and rerun the clustering for each simulated data set. The time cost\nis thus often very expensive, especially for the sort of exploratory analysis\nwhere clustering is typically used. We propose to use a fast and automatic\napproximation to the full bootstrap called the \"linear bootstrap\", which can be\nseen by local data perturbation. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply this\nidea to a data analysis pipeline, consisting of an MFVB approximation to a BNP\nclustering posterior of time course gene expression data. We show that using\nauto-differentiation tools, the necessary calculations can be done\nautomatically, and that the linear bootstrap is a fast but approximate\nalternative to the bootstrap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 01:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

While\nvariable reflection nebulae around LMYSOs were among the earliest signs of star\nformation, little is known on the variability of scattered light from embedded\nclusters, the birthplaces of HMYSOs. Since the few most massive stars dominate\nthis emission, their variability is literally reflected in scattered light.\nMoreover, because of their high luminosity, for a given ambient dust density\nand source distance, the associated nebulosities are much larger than those of\nLMYSOs.

Their median total IR luminosity ($L_{IR}$) is\n$5\\times10^{11} L_{\\odot}$ (SFR $\\sim$50 $M_{\\odot}/yr)$, and 27\\% of the whole\nsample has $L_{IR}>10^{12} L_{\\odot}$ (SFR $>$100 $M_{\\odot}/yr$). Using ten\nW4BCGs that have Chandra X-ray data, we show that seven of them are possibly in\nCC clusters. However, in most cases (five out of seven) the mass deposition\nrate cannot account for the observed SFR. This casts doubt to the idea that\ncooling flows are the cause of the star formation in non-quiescent BCGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 05:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

A key characteristic of facial expression of pain is the\nsimultaneous occurrence of pain-related AU combinations, whose automated\ndetection would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain\nmonitoring. Existing general Automated Facial Expression Recognition (AFER)\nsystems prove inadequate when applied specifically for detecting pain as they\neither focus on detecting individual pain-related AUs but not on combinations\nor they seek to bypass AU detection by training a binary pain classifier\ndirectly on pain intensity data but are limited by lack of enough labeled data\nfor satisfactory training.

The method\nis to calculate the exact short time dynamics in the single electron subspace,\nfor a given configuration of the ions. This differs from the usual kinetic\ntheory approach in which an average over the ions is performed as well. In this\nway the effective ion-electron interaction is treated exactly and shown to be\ndetermined from DFT. The correlation functions have the random phase\napproximation for an inhomogeneous system, but with renormalized ion-electron\nand electron-electron potentials. The dynamic structure function, density\nresponse function, and electrical conductivity are calculated as examples. The\nstatic local field corrections in the dielectric function are identified in\nthis way. The current analysis is limited to semi-classical electrons (quantum\nstatistical potentials), so important quantum conditions are excluded. However,\na quantization of the kinetic theory is identified for broader application\nwhile awaiting its detailed derivation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 06:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

We\nexplore the shapes and the temporal dynamics of a plane non-magnetizable\ndroplet levitating inside ferrofluid against gravity due to a spatially\ncomplex, but systematically generated, magnetic field in two dimensions. The\neffect of the viscosity ratio, the stability of the levitation path and the\npossibility of existence of multiple-stable equilibrium states is investigated.\nWe find, for certain conditions on the viscosity ratio, that there can be\ndevelopments of cusps and singularities at the droplet surface; this phenomenon\nwe also observe experimentally and compared with the simulations. Our\nsimulations closely replicate the singular projection on the surface of the\nlevitating droplet. Finally, we present an dynamical model for the vertical\ntrajectory of the droplet. This model reveals a condition for the onset of\nlevitation and the relation for the equilibrium levitation height. The\nlinearization of the model around the steady state captures that the nature of\nthe equilibrium point goes under a transition from being a spiral to a node\ndepending upon the control parameters, which essentially means that the\ntemporal route to the equilibrium can be either monotonic or undulating.

This paper builds\nupon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced\nwithout compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent\naccuracy loss, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be\nadjusted for each layer. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer\nlimited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or lead\nto a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work\nintroduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the\ndesign of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion,\na bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing\nelements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers.\nThis flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the\ncommunication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy.

You can seek a balance between speed and accuracy by\nchanging the number of cutpoints specified in the algorithm.

Understanding the evolution of\ncoronal holes is critical for solar magnetism as well as for accurate space\nweather forecasts. We study here the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synoptic maps at\nthree wavelengths (195A/193A, 171A and 304A) measured by Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) and Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) instruments. The two\ndatasets are first homogenized by scaling the SDO/AIA data to the SOHO/EIT\nlevel by means of histogram equalization. We then develop a novel automated\nmethod to identify CHs from these homogenized maps by determining the intensity\nthreshold of CH regions separately for each synoptic map. This is done by\nidentifying the best location and size of an image segment, which optimally\ncontains portions of coronal holes and the surrounding quiet Sun allowing us to\ndetect the momentary intensity threshold. Our method is thus able to adjust\nitself to the changing scale size of coronal holes and to temporally varying\nintensities. To make full use of the information in the three wavelengths we\nconstruct, a composite CH distribution, which is more robust than distributions\nbased on one wavelength. Using the composite CH dataset we discuss the temporal\nevolution of CHs during the solar cycles 23 and 24.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 08:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Telemetry collection leads to\nimproved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally\ndifferentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool\nthat allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while\npreserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically\nvery strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly\nwhen telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms\nare not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app\nusage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards\nrepeated collection of counter data, with formal privacy guarantees even after\nbeing executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical\ntasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for\nrepeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same\naccuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms.

Therefore the rotating stars with convective\nenvelope can produce the large-scale magnetic field generated solely due to the\nturbulent cross-helicity effect (we call it {\\gamma} 2 -dynamo).

This corresponds to\nsituations of the purely {\\gamma} 2 or {\\alpha} 2 dynamos. Combination of these\nscenarios, i.e., the {\\gamma} 2 {\\alpha} 2 dynamo can generate preferably\naxisymmetric, a dipole-like magnetic field of strength several kGs. Thus we\nfound a new dynamo scenario which is able to generate the axisymmetric magnetic\nfield even in the case of the solid body rotation of the star. We discuss the\npossible applications of our findings to stellar observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 08:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 03:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In the proposed\napproach, each sensor node employs a sparse sensing vector with known support\nfor data compression, meanwhile enabling making local inference about the\nunknown support of the sparse signal vector of interest. This naturally leads\nto a ternary censoring protocol, whereby each sensor (i) directly transmits the\nreal-valued compressed data if the sensing vector support is detected to be\noverlapped with the signal support, (ii) sends a one-bit hard decision if empty\nsupport overlap is inferred, (iii) keeps silent if the measurement is judged to\nbe uninformative. Our design then aims at minimizing the error probability that\nempty support overlap is decided but otherwise is true, subject to the\nconstraints on a tolerable false-alarm probability that non-empty support\noverlap is decided but otherwise is true, and a target censoring rate. We\nderive a closed-form formula of the optimal censoring rule; a low complexity\nimplementation using bi-section search is also developed. In addition, the\naverage communication cost is analyzed.

Increasing the drop size, a transition between these two extremes is\nfound. This is due to surfactants present in the system, and previous work has\nled to the stagnant-cap model. We present here an alternative approach which we\ncall the continuous-interface model. In contrast to the stagnant-cap model, we\ndo not consider a surfactant advection-diffusion equation at the interface.\nTaking instead the normal and tangential interfacial stresses into account, we\nsolve the Stokes equation analytically for the falling drop with varying\ninterfacial tension. Some of the solutions thus obtained, e.g. the hovering\ndrop, violate conservation ofenergy unless energy is provided directly to the\ninterface. Considering the energy budget of the drop, we show that the terminal\nvelocity is bounded by the Stokes and the Hadamard-Rybczynski results. The\ncontinuous-interface model is then obtained from the force balance for\nsurfactants at the interface. The resulting expressions gives the transition\nbetween the two extremes, and also predicts that the critical radius, below\nwhich drops fall like hard spheres, is proportional to the interfacial\nsurfactant concentration. By analysing experimental results from the\nliterature, we confirm this prediction, thus providing strong arguments for the\nvalidity of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 10:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The cylinder is free to oscillate in the\ndirection transverse to the incoming flow. The cylinder is attached to a magnet\nthat can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. The magnet\nand the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the\ncylinder undergoes VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the\ncoil, which is connected to a resistive load. By Lenz's law, induced current in\nthe coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively, the electrical\ngenerator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying\ndamping coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds\nnumber is restricted to Re < 200, so that the flow is laminar and\ntwo-dimensional (2D). The incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations are solved\nusing an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects of\nthe electromagnetic (EM) damping constant xi_m, coil dimensions (radius a,\nlength L), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It\nis found that there is an optimal value of xi_m (xi_opt) at which maximum\nelectrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil is\nincreased, the value of xi_opt is observed to increase. Although the maximum\naverage power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a\nmore robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be\nextracted when xi_m is far from xi_opt, unlike the constant damping ratio case.\nThe average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily\nthrough the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased\nReynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general\nqualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number VIV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 12:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

An\nadditional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these\ndevices, resulting in serious reliability and financial implications.\nPhysically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to\nhelp address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as\nthey require minimal or no additional hardware for their operation. However,\ncurrent memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for\nconstructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including making them\nvulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we propose the design of a new\nmemory-based combination PUF that intelligently combines two memory\ntechnologies, SRAM and DRAM, to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed\ncombination PUF exhibits high entropy, supports a large number of\nchallenge-response pairs, and is intrinsically reconfigurable. We have\nimplemented the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA board and\nseveral off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Experimental results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability\nto resist various attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide\ntemperature range (20 - 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months)\ndemonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, which achieves a 100%\ntrue-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication across these\nparameter ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 13:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Using synthetically generated face images, we\nstudy the face recognition rate as a function of interpretable parameters such\nas face pose and light. The proposed method allows valuable details about the\ngeneralization performance of different DCNN architectures to be observed and\ncompared. In our experiments, we find that: 1) Indeed, dataset bias has a\nsignificant influence on the generalization performance of DCNNs. 2) DCNNs can\ngeneralize surprisingly well to unseen illumination conditions and large\nsampling gaps in the pose variation. 3) Using the presented methodology we\nreveal that the VGG-16 architecture outperforms the AlexNet architecture at\nface recognition tasks because it can much better generalize to unseen face\nposes, although it has significantly more parameters. 4) We uncover a main\nlimitation of current DCNN architectures, which is the difficulty to generalize\nwhen different identities to not share the same pose variation. 5) We\ndemonstrate that our findings on synthetic data also apply when learning from\nreal-world data.

These mechanisms guide\nexploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep\nlearning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made\ngreat advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human\nlearning.

There exist a handful of research work that focus on feature\nextraction to obtain gender specific information from facial images. However,\nanalyzing different facial regions and their fusion help in deciding the gender\nof a person from facial images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to\nidentify gender from frontal facial images that is robust to background,\nillumination, intensity, and facial expression. In our framework, first the\nfrontal face image is divided into a number of distinct regions based on facial\nlandmark points that are obtained by the Chehra model proposed by Asthana et\nal. The model provides 49 facial landmark points covering different regions of\nthe face, e.g. forehead, left eye, right eye, lips. Next, a face image is\nsegmented into facial regions using landmark points and features are extracted\nfrom each region. The Compass LBP feature, a variant of LBP feature, has been\nused in our framework to obtain discriminative gender-specific information.\nFollowing this, a Support Vector Machine based classifier has been used to\ncompute the probability scores from each facial region. Finally, the\nclassification scores obtained from individual regions are combined with a\ngenetic algorithm based learning to improve the overall classification\naccuracy. The experiments have been performed on popular face image datasets\nsuch as Adience, cFERET (color FERET), LFW and two sketch datasets, namely CUFS\nand CUFSF. Through experiments, we have observed that, the proposed method\noutperforms existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 14:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The last decade has witnessed considerable\nprogress in the accurate treatment of pairing correlations, one of the major\ncomponents in medium-sized nuclei, reaching accuracies below the 1% level of\nthe correlation energy.\n  Purpose: Development of a quantum many-body method for pairing correlations\nthat is (a) competitive in the 1% error range, and (b) can be systematically\nimproved with a fast (exponential) convergence rate.\n  Method: The present paper capitalizes upon ideas from Richardson-Gaudin\nintegrability.

At the second step, the complete set of excited states on top of\nthis Richardson-Gaudin ground state is used as an optimal basis for a\nConfiguration Interaction method in an increasingly large effective Hilbert\nspace.\n  Results: The performance of the variational Richardson-Gaudin (varRG) and\nRichardson-Gaudin Configuration Interaction (RGCI) method is benchmarked\nagainst exact results using an effective $G$-matrix interaction for the Sn\nregion.

There are several symbolic execution tools\navailable off-the-shelf, and we need a practical benchmark approach to learn\ntheir capabilities. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach to\nbenchmark symbolic execution tools in a fine-grained and efficient manner. In\nparticular, our approach evaluates the performance of such tools against the\nknown challenges faced by general symbolic execution techniques, such as\nfloating-point numbers and symbolic memories. To this end, we first survey\nrelated papers and systematize the challenges of symbolic execution. We extract\n12 distinct challenges from the literature and categorize them into two\ncategories: symbolic-reasoning challenges and path-explosion challenges. Then,\nwe develop a dataset of logic bombs and a framework to benchmark symbolic\nexecution tools automatically. For each challenge, our dataset contains several\nlogic bombs, each of which is guarded by a specific challenging problem. If a\nsymbolic execution tool can find test cases to trigger logic bombs, it\nindicates that the tool can handle the corresponding problems. We have\nconducted real-world experiments with three popular symbolic execution tools:\nKLEE, Angr, and Triton. Experimental results show that our approach can reveal\ntheir capabilities and limitations in handling particular issues accurately and\nefficiently.

It thus is crucial to have both\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of the probabilities of system\nproperties. Such analysis can be conducted by constructing a formal model of\nthe system under verification and using Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC).\nHowever, this method is infeasible for large systems, due to the state space\nexplosion. In this article, we demonstrate the successful use of Statistical\nModel Checking (SMC) to carry out such analysis directly from large SystemC\nmodels and allow designers to express a wide range of useful properties. The\nfirst contribution of this work is a framework to verify properties expressed\nin Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) for SystemC models with both timed and\nprobabilistic characteristics. Second, the framework allows users to expose a\nrich set of user-code primitives as atomic propositions in BLTL. Moreover,\nusers can define their own fine-grained time resolution rather than the\nboundary of clock cycles in the SystemC simulation. The third contribution is\nan implementation of a statistical model checker. It contains an automatic\nmonitor generation for producing execution traces of the\nmodel-under-verification (MUV), the mechanism for automatically instrumenting\nthe MUV, and the interaction with statistical model checking algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 21:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

Specifically, in a\nRGB-D based action recognition task, it cooperatively trains a single\nconvolutional neural network (named c-ConvNet) on both RGB visual features and\ndepth features, and deeply aggregates the two kinds of features for action\nrecognition. Differently from the conventional ConvNet that learns the deep\nseparable features for homogeneous modality-based classification with only one\nsoftmax loss function, the c-ConvNet enhances the discriminative power of the\ndeeply learned features and weakens the undesired modality discrepancy by\njointly optimizing a ranking loss and a softmax loss for both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous modalities. The ranking loss consists of intra-modality and\ncross-modality triplet losses, and it reduces both the intra-modality and\ncross-modality feature variations. Furthermore, the correlations between RGB\nand depth data are embedded in the c-ConvNet, and can be retrieved by either of\nthe modalities and contribute to the recognition in the case even only one of\nthe modalities is available. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on\ntwo large RGB-D action recognition datasets, ChaLearn LAP IsoGD and NTU RGB+D\ndatasets, and one small dataset, SYSU 3D HOI, and achieved state-of-the-art\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 07:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

In contrast to what happens\nwith the spreading of epidemics, observations of general perturbations are\noften very sparse in time (there is a single observation of the perturbed\nsystem) and in \"space\" (only a few perturbed and unperturbed units are\nobserved). A major challenge in many areas, from biology to the social\nsciences, is to infer the propagation paths from observations of the effects of\nperturbation under these sparsity conditions. We address this problem and show\nthat it is possible to go beyond the usual approach of using the shortest paths\nconnecting the known perturbed nodes. Specifically, we show that a simple and\ngeneral probabilistic model, which we solved using belief propagation, provides\nfast and accurate estimates of the probabilities of nodes being perturbed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 17:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}
