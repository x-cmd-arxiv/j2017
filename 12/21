The exact reformulation is carried out using the recently\ndeveloped abelian color flux method where the action is decomposed into\ncommuting minimal terms that connect different colors on neighboring sites.\nExpanding the Boltzmann factors for these commuting terms allows one to\nreorganize the gauge field contributions according to links such that the gauge\nfields can be integrated out in closed form. The emerging constraints give the\ndual variables the structure of worldlines for the fermions and worldsheets for\nthe gauge degrees of freedom. The partition sum has the form of a strong\ncoupling expansion and with the abelian color flux approach discussed here all\ncoefficients of the expansion are known in closed form.

In this paper, we first show that the\ntraditional beamspace-MIMO suffers from spatial power leakage and imperfect\nchannel statistics estimation. A beam combination module is hence proposed,\nwhich consists of a small number (compared with the number of antenna elements)\nof low-resolution (possibly one-bit) digital (discrete) phase shifters after\nthe beamspace transformation to further compress the beamspace signal\ndimensionality, such that the number of RF chains can be reduced beyond\nbeamspace transformation and beam selection. The optimum discrete beam\ncombination weights for the uplink are obtained based on the branch-and-bound\n(BB) approach. The key to the BB-based solution is to solve the embodied\nsub-problem, whose solution is derived in a closed-form.

Aims: We searched the outskirts of the Local Group\nspiral galaxy M33 (the Triangulum) for PNe to gain new insights into the\nextended stellar substructure on the northern side of the disc and to study the\nexistence of a faint classical halo. Methods: The search is based on wide field\nimaging covering a 4.5 square degree area out to a maximum projected distance\nof about 40 kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The PN candidates are detected\nby the combination of images obtained in narrowband filters selecting the\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007\\AA$ and H$\\alpha$ + [NII] nebular lines and in the continuum\ng' and r' broadband filters. Results:Inside the bright optical disc of M33,\neight new PN candidates were identified, three of which were spectroscopically\nconfirmed. No PN candidates were found outside the limits of the disc. Fourteen\nadditional sources showing [OIII] excess were also discovered. Conclusions:The\nabsence of bright PN candidates in the area outside the galaxy disc covered by\nthis survey sets an upper limit to the luminosity of the underlying population\nof $\\mathrm{\\sim1.6\\cdot10^{7}L_{\\odot}}$, suggesting the lack of a massive\nclassical halo, which is in agreement with the results obtained using the RGB\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

In particular, our results indicate that the solutes with a\nsmaller size mismatch can be more effective in suppressing dislocation emission\nfrom grain boundaries. Bearing in mind that dislocation slip originating from\ngrain boundaries or their triple junctions is the dominant mechanism of plastic\ndeformation when grain sizes are reduced to the nanoscale, we emphasize the\nimportance of the search for the optimal solute additions, which would\nstabilize the nanocrystalline material against grain growth and, at the same\ntime, effectively suppress the dislocation nucleation from the grain\nboundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

The two parallel\nchains consist of identical SQUIDs, with magnetic-flux tunable inductance,\ncoupled to each other at each node via a capacitance much larger than the\njunction capacitance. Thanks to this capacitive coupling, the system sustains\nelectromagnetic modes with a wide frequency dispersion. The internal quality\nfactor of the modes is maintained as high as possible, and the damping is\nintroduced by a uniform coupling of the modes to a transmission line, itself\nconnected to an amplification and readout circuit. For sufficiently long\nchains, containing several thousands of junctions, the resulting admittance is\na smooth function versus frequency in the microwave domain, and its effective\ndissipation can be continuously monitored by recording the emitted radiation in\nthe transmission line. We show that by varying in-situ the SQUIDs' inductance,\nthe double chain can operate as tunable ohmic resistor in a frequency band\nspanning up to one GHz, with a resistance that can be swept through values\ncomparable to the resistance quantum R_q = (h/4e^2) ~ 6.5 k{\\Omega}.

Meanwhile, it is equally important to\nimprove the simulation efficiency as the modeling scope and complexity of the\ndetailed system in the EMT simulation increases. To meet both requirements,\nthis paper introduces an advanced EMT and phasor-domain hybrid simulation\napproach. This approach has two main features: 1) a comprehensive phasor-domain\nmodeling framework which supports positive-sequence, three-sequence,\nthree-phase and mixed three-sequence/three-phase representations and 2) a\nrobust and flexible simulation mode switching scheme. The developed scheme\nenables simulation switching from hybrid simulation mode back to pure\nphasor-domain dynamic simulation mode to achieve significantly improved\nsimulation efficiency.

Here we revisit the model\nof Quaternary climate dynamics that was proposed by Saltzman and Maasch (1988).\nWe show that it is quantitatively similar to a scalar equation for the ice\ndynamics only when combining the remaining components into a single delayed\nfeedback term. The delay is the sum of the internal times scales of ocean\ntransport and ice sheet dynamics, which is on the order of 10 kyr. We find\nthat, in the absence of astronomical forcing, the delayed feedback leads to\nbistable behaviour, where stable large-amplitude oscillations of ice volume and\nan equilibrium coexist over a large range of values for the delay. We then\napply astronomical forcing. We perform a systematic study to show how the\nsystem response depends on the forcing amplitude. We find that over a wide\nrange of forcing amplitudes the forcing leads to a switch from small-scale\noscillations of 41 kyr to large-amplitude oscillations of roughly 100 kyr\nwithout any change of other parameters. The transition in the forced model\nconsistently occurs near the time of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition as observed\nin data records. This provides evidence that the MPT could have been primarily\na forcing-induced switch between attractors of the internal dynamics. Small\nadditional random disturbances make the forcing-induced transition near 800 kyr\nBP even more robust. We also find that the forced system forgets its initial\nhistory during the small-scale oscillations, in particular, nearby initial\nconditions converge prior to transitioning.

Concretely, we propose\nSWATS, a simple strategy which switches from Adam to SGD when a triggering\ncondition is satisfied. The condition we propose relates to the projection of\nAdam steps on the gradient subspace. By design, the monitoring process for this\ncondition adds very little overhead and does not increase the number of\nhyperparameters in the optimizer. We report experiments on several standard\nbenchmarks such as: ResNet, SENet, DenseNet and PyramidNet for the CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 data sets, ResNet on the tiny-ImageNet data set and language modeling\nwith recurrent networks on the PTB and WT2 data sets. The results show that our\nstrategy is capable of closing the generalization gap between SGD and Adam on a\nmajority of the tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 18:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

In this paper, we study how viewpoint-invariant visual servoing\nskills can be learned automatically in a robotic manipulation scenario. To this\nend, we train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine\nwhich actions move the end-point of a robotic arm to a desired object. The\nproblem that must be solved by this controller is fundamentally ambiguous:\nunder severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the\nactions in a single feedforward operation.

Smooth elliptical mass profiles were previously shown to be\ninadequate in reproducing the quad population. In this paper, we explore the\ndeviations from such smooth elliptical mass distributions. Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have\ngenerated thousands of quads from synthetic populations of lenses with\nsubstructure consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such\nperturbations are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads\nrelative to the FSQ. The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii. We\nshow that combination of these effects is a promising way of accounting for\nquad population properties. We conclude that the quad population provides a\nunique and sensitive tool for constraining detailed mass distribution in the\ncenters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

Over time, the adversary will change\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which will also change the data\ngenerated. If the IOCs are not kept up-to-date with the adversary's new TTPs,\nthe adversary will no longer be detected once all of the IOCs become invalid.\nTracking the Known (TTK) is the problem of keeping IOCs, in this case regular\nexpressions (regexes), up-to-date with a dynamic adversary. Our framework\nsolves the TTK problem in an automated, cyclic fashion to bracket a previously\ndiscovered adversary. This tracking is accomplished through a data-driven\napproach of self-adapting a given model based on its own detection\ncapabilities.\n  In our initial experiments, we found that the true positive rate (TPR) of the\nadaptive solution degrades much less significantly over time than the naive\nsolution, suggesting that self-updating the model allows the continued\ndetection of positives (i.e., adversaries). The cost for this performance is in\nthe false positive rate (FPR), which increases over time for the adaptive\nsolution, but remains constant for the naive solution. However, the difference\nin overall detection performance, as measured by the area under the curve\n(AUC), between the two methods is negligible. This result suggests that\nself-updating the model over time should be done in practice to continue to\ndetect known, evolving adversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues\nfrom news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is\noften intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news.

The social\ncontext during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent\ntri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users,\nwhich has potential to improve fake news detection.

Securebox enables\nremote management of networks through a cloud security service (CSS) with\nminimal user intervention required. To reduce costs and improve the\nscalability, Securebox is based on virtualized middleboxes provided by CSS. Our\nproposal differs from the existing solutions by integrating the SDN and cloud\ninto a unified edge security solution, and by offering a collaborative\nprotection mechanism that enables rapid security policy dissemination across\nall connected networks in mitigating new threats or attacks detected by the\nsystem.

The utility informs the\naggregator of an anticipated DR event. The aggregator calls on a subset of its\npool of recruited agents to reduce their electricity use. Agents are paid for\nreducing their energy consumption from contractually established baselines.\nBaselines are counter-factual consumption estimates of the energy an agent\nwould have consumed if they were not participating in the DR program. Baselines\nare used to determine payments to agents. This creates an incentive for agents\nto inflate their baselines. We propose a novel self-reported baseline mechanism\n(SRBM) where each agent reports its baseline and marginal utility. These\nreports are strategic and need not be truthful.

The mechanism is specified by the\nprobability with which agents are called, reward prices for called agents, and\npenalty prices for agents who are not called. Under SRBM, we show that truthful\nreporting of baseline consumption and marginal utility is a dominant strategy.\nThus, SRBM eliminates the incentive for agents to inflate baselines. SRBM is\nassured to meet the load reduction target. SRBM is also nearly efficient since\nit selects agents with the smallest marginal utilities, and each called agent\ncontributes maximally to the load reduction target.

Commodity DDR DRAM refreshes cells at the rank level. This degrades\nperformance significantly because it prevents an entire rank from serving\nmemory requests while being refreshed. DRAM designed for mobile platforms,\nLPDDR DRAM, supports an enhanced mode, called per-bank refresh, that refreshes\ncells at the bank level. This enables a bank to be accessed while another in\nthe same rank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance\nimpact of refreshes. However, there are two shortcomings of per-bank refresh.\nFirst, the per-bank refresh scheduling scheme does not exploit the full\npotential of overlapping refreshes with accesses across banks because it\nrestricts the banks to be refreshed in a sequential round-robin order. Second,\naccesses to a bank that is being refreshed have to wait.\n  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, we propose two\ncomplementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh Parallelization) and\nSARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal is to address the\ndrawbacks of per-bank refresh by building more efficient techniques to\nparallelize refreshes and accesses within DRAM. First, instead of issuing\nper-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to\nidle banks in an out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP schedules refreshes\nduring intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP\nexploits the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With\nminor modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory\naccesses to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed.\nExtensive evaluations show that our mechanisms improve system performance and\nenergy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art refresh policies and the benefit\nincreases as DRAM density increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 00:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

Soon after the discovery of charge stripe order\nat T(charge)=65K in Nd3+ co-doped LSCO ($T_{c}\\simeq6$~K) [Tranquada et al.,\nNature {\\bf 375} (1995) 561], Hunt et al. demonstrated that\nLa$_{1.48}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ and superconducting LSCO with x~1/8 (Tc\n~ 30K) share nearly identical NMR anomalies near $T_{charge}$ of the former\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 82} (1999) 4300]. Their inevitable conclusion that LSCO\nalso undergoes charge order at a comparable temperature became controversial,\nbecause diffraction measurements at the time were unable to detect Bragg peaks\nassociated with charge order. Recent advances in x-ray diffraction techniques\nfinally led to definitive confirmations of the charge order Bragg peaks in LSCO\nwith an onset at as high as T(charge)=80K. Meanwhile, improved instrumental\ntechnology has enabled routine NMR measurements that were not feasible two\ndecades ago. Motivated by these new developments, we revisit the charge order\ntransition of a LSCO single crystal based on 63Cu NMR techniques. We\ndemonstrate that 63Cu NMR properties of the nuclear spin $I_{z}$ = -1/2 to +1/2\ncentral transition below T(charge) exhibit unprecedentedly strong dependence on\nthe measurement time scale set by the NMR pulse separation time $\\tau$; a new\nkind of anomalous, very broad wing-like 63Cu NMR signals gradually emerge below\nT(charge) only for extremely short $\\tau \\lesssim 4~\\mu$s, while the spectral\nweight of the normal NMR signals is progressively wiped out. The NMR linewidth\nand relaxation rates depend strongly on $\\tau$ below T(charge), and their\nenhancement in the charge ordered state indicates that charge order turns on\nstrong but inhomogeneous growth of Cu spin-spin correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 03:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

The loss of Goldstones may be\ndue to a redundancy or the generation of a gap. This phenomena is called an\nInverse Higgs Mechanism (IHM). However, there are cases when a Goldstone boson\nassociated with a broken generator does not appear in the low energy theory\ndespite the lack of the existence of an associated IHM. In this paper we will\nshow that in such cases the relevant broken symmetry can be realized, without\nthe aid of an associated Goldstone, if there exists a proper set of operator\nconstraints, which we call a Dynamical Inverse Higgs Mechanism (DIHM). We\nconsider the spontaneous breaking of boosts, rotations and conformal\ntransformations in the context of Fermi liquids, finding three possible paths\nto symmetry realization: pure Goldstones, no Goldstones and DIHM, or some\nmixture thereof. We show that in the two dimensional degenerate electron system\nthe DIHM route is the only consistent way to realize spontaneously broken\nboosts and dilatations, while in three dimensions these symmetries could just\nas well be realized via the inclusion of non-derivatively coupled Goldstone\nbosons. We have present the action, including the leading order\nnon-linearities, for the rotational Goldstone (angulon), and discuss the\nconstraint associated with the possible DIHM that would need to be imposed to\nremove it from the spectrum. Finally we discuss the conditions under which\nGoldstone bosons are non-derivatively coupled, a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a Dynamical Inverse Higgs Constraint (DIHC), generalizaing the\nresults for Vishwanath and Wantanabe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 05:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 15:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

To be specific, we\npresent a novel lower-granularity patch representation that properly decouples\nthe search subspaces of likely-buggy locations, operation types and potential\nfix ingredients, enabling GP to explore the search space more effectively.\nBased on this new representation, we formulate automated program repair as a\nmulti-objective search problem and use NSGA-II to look for simpler repairs. To\nreduce the computational effort and search space, we introduce a test filtering\nprocedure that can speed up the fitness evaluation of GP and three types of\nrules that can be applied to avoid unnecessary manipulations of the code.\nMoreover, we also propose a type matching strategy that can create new\npotential fix ingredients by exploiting the syntactic patterns of the existing\nstatements.

Deep learning models usually assume a fixed\nscale for their training and input data. To allow deep learning applications to\nhandle a wide range of input data, popular frameworks, such as Caffe,\nTensorFlow, and Torch, all provide data scaling functions to resize input to\nthe dimensions used by deep learning models. Image scaling algorithms are\nintended to preserve the visual features of an image after scaling. However,\ncommon image scaling algorithms are not designed to handle human crafted\nimages. Attackers can make the scaling outputs look dramatically different from\nthe corresponding input images.\n  This paper presents a downscaling attack that targets the data scaling\nprocess in deep learning applications. By carefully crafting input data that\nmismatches with the dimension used by deep learning models, attackers can\ncreate deceiving effects.

There have been numerous interference management (IM) proposals at the\ninterfering transmitter or the victim transmitter/receiver separately or\ncooperatively. Moreover, the existing IM schemes rely mainly on the use of\nchannel state information (CSI). However, in some communication scenarios, the\noption to adjust the interferer is not available, and, in the case of downlink\ntransmission, it is always difficult or even impossible for the victim receiver\nto acquire necessary information for IM.

The\ncrucial step is to find a polynomial, for example a q-analog, that satisfies\nthe CSP conditions for an action. This polynomial will give us a lot of\ninformation about the symmetry and structure of the set under the action. In\nthis paper, we study the cyclic sieving phenomenon of the cyclic group $C_{2n}$\nacting on $P_{n,k}$, which is the set of matchings of $2n$ points on a circle\nwith $k$ crossings. The noncrossing matchings ($k=0$) was recently studied as a\nCatalan object. In this paper, we study more general cases, the matchings with\nmore number of crossings. We prove that there exists $q$-analog polynomials\n$f_{n,k}(q)$ such that $(P_{n,k},f_{n,k},C_{2n})$ exhibits the cyclic sieving\nphenomenon for $k=1,2,3$. In the proof, we also introduce an efficient\nrepresentation of the elements in $P_{n,k}$, which helps us to understand the\nsymmetrical structure of the set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 07:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

However the relative impact of baryons and dark\nmatter in shaping this distribution is still debated. Using the simulation\nHorizon-AGN, the angular distribution of satellite galaxies with respect to\ntheir central counterpart and halo is quantified. Below one Rvir, satellites\ncluster more strongly in the plane of the central, rather than merely tracing\nthe shape of their host halo. This is due to the increased isotropy of inner\nhaloes acquired through their inside-out assembly in vorticity-rich flows along\nthe cosmic web. While the effect of centrals decreases with distance, halos'\ntriaxiality increases, impacting more and more the satellite's distribution.\nEffects become comparable just outside one virial radius. Above this scale, the\nfilamentary infall also impacts the satellites distribution, dominating above\ntwo virial radii. The central's morphology plays a governing role: the\nalignment w.r.t. the central plane is four times stronger in haloes hosting\nstellar discs than in spheroids. But the impact of the galactic plane decreases\nfor lower satellite-to-central mass ratios, suggesting this might not hold for\ndwarf satellites of the Local group.

Practical examples of the new methods are derived and the\nefficiency and superiority are confirmed and demonstrated by three numerical\nexperiments including a nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. As a byproduct of\nthis paper, arbitrary-order trigonometric/RKN collocation methods are also\npresented and analysed for second-order highly oscillatory/general systems.

The cases of both strict and non-strict phase\nrotation are considered and can further be formulated as convex optimization\nproblems. For optimization with strict phase rotation, we mathematically derive\nthe optimal beamforming structure with Lagrangian and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nconditions. By formulating its dual problem, the optimization problem is\nfurther shown to be equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) over a simplex,\nwhich can be solved more efficiently.

Therefore, we reanalyze the\nhigh-resolution spectra obtained in 2013--2014 with the Reflection Grating\nSpectrometer (RGS) aboard \\textit{XMM}-Newton to provide an alternative\ninterpretation of the X-ray narrow emission features. We find that the X-ray\nnarrow emission features in NGC\\,5548 can be described by a two-phase\nphotoionized plasma with different ionization parameters ($\\log \\xi=1.3$ and\n$0.1$) and kinematics ($v_{\\rm out}=-50$ and $-400~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$), and no\nfurther absorption by the warm absorber components.

The X-ray NELR is not the\ncounterpart of the UV/X-ray absorber outside the line of sight because their\ndistances and kinematics are not consistent. In addition, X-ray broad emission\nfeatures that we find in the spectrum can be accounted for by a third\nphotoionized emission component.

There are\nexcess of spins aligned along $B_0$ (spin up with lower energy) than spins\naligned opposite (spin down with higher energy) to the field $B_0$. A natural\nquestion is what is the source of this excess spin polarization because\nrelaxation mechanisms can flip a up spin to a down spin and vice-versa. The\nanswer lies in the density of states. When a molecule with spin down flips to\nspin up it loses energy. This energy goes into increasing the kinetic energy of\nthe molecule in the gas/solution phase. At this increased kinetic energy, there\nare more rotational-translational states accessible to the molecule than at\nlower energy. This increases the probability the molecule will spend in spin up\nstate (higher kinetic energy state). This is the source of excess polarization.\nIn this paper, we use an argument based on equipartition of energy to\nexplicitly count the excess states that become accessible to the molecule when\nits spin is flipped from down to up. Using this counting, we derive the\nfamiliar Boltzmann distribution of the ratio of up vs down spins. Although\nprima facie, there is nothing new in this paper, we find the mode counting\nargument for excess states interesting. Furthermore, the paper stresses the\nfact that spin polarization arises from higher density of states at increased\nkinetic energy of molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

It has been conjectured that there is an analogy to the\nconcept of entropy in statistical mechanics. In this context, in the\nundifferentiated state the entropy would be large since fewer constraints exist\non the gene expression programs of the cell. As differentiation progresses,\ngene expression programs become more and more constrained and thus the entropy\nwould be expected to decrease. Such an entropy decrease would, in analogy to\nstatistical mechanics, require some form of free energy to decrease\naccordingly. In order to assess these predictions, we compute the Shannon\nentropy for time-resolved single-cell gene expression data in two different\nexperimental setups of haematopoietic differentiation. We find that the\nbehaviour of this entropy measure is in contrast to these predictions. In\nparticular, we find that the Shannon entropy is not a decreasing function of\ndevelopmental pseudo-time but instead it increases toward the point of\ncommitment before decreasing again. This behaviour is consistent with an\nincrease in gene expression disorder observed in populations sampled at the\npoint of commitment. Single cells in these populations exhibit different\ncombinations of regulator activity that suggest the presence of multiple\nconfigurations of a potential differentiation network as a result of multiple\nentry points into the committed state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

This is especially true of algorithms that operate in\nhigh-dimensional spaces or that train non-linear models such as tensor models\nand deep networks.\n  The freedom to express the learning problem as a non-convex optimization\nproblem gives immense modeling power to the algorithm designer, but often such\nproblems are NP-hard to solve. A popular workaround to this has been to relax\nnon-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the\n(convex) relaxed optimization problems.

In particular, a strong diffuse peak at the corner of the\nBrillouin zone ($R$ point), which coincides with the propagation vector of the\nelusive antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) order in CeB$_6$, is rapidly suppressed by\nboth La and Nd doping, like the AFQ order itself.

For\nseveral dye concentrations we accurately determine the radius of the condensate\nas a function of the number of condensate photons, and derive an effective\ninteraction strength parameter $\\tilde{g}$. For all concentrations we find\n$\\tilde{g} \\sim 10^{-2}$, one order larger than previously reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 13:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic\nfairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper\nproposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\\theta$) which enables a\ncontinuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More\nspecifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.\nFirst, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between\nspecific concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the\nalgorithm enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ``worldviews'' on\nthe degree of discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to\nthe extreme cases of ``we're all equal'' (WAE) and ``what you see is what you\nget'' (WYSIWYG) proposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal\ntransport theory, and specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize\ndecision maker utility under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the\nalgorithm is able to handle cases of intersectionality, i.e., of\nmulti-dimensional discrimination of certain groups on grounds of several\ncriteria. We discuss three main examples (credit applications; college\nadmissions; insurance contracts) and map out the legal and policy implications\nof our approach. The explicit formalization of the trade-off between individual\nand group fairness allows this post-processing approach to be tailored to\ndifferent situational contexts in which one or the other fairness criterion may\ntake precedence. Finally, we evaluate our model experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 10:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In this paper, we\nconcentrate on a very specific period of time prior to the massive outbursts\nobserved from the source. During this period, Cygnus X-3 is in a so-called\nhypersoft state, where the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are found to be at their\nlowest values (or non-detected), the soft X-ray flux is at its highest values,\nand sporadic gamma-ray emission is observed.

We found\nthat the spectra and timing properties of the multiwavelength observations can\nbe explained by a scenario where the jet production is turned off or highly\ndiminished in the hypersoft state and the missing jet pressure allows the wind\nto refill the region close to the black hole.

Energy efficiency is\ntherefore essential to the design of algorithms in WASNs. One way to reduce\nenergy costs is to only select the sensors which are most informative, a\nproblem known as {\\it sensor selection}. In this way, only sensors that\nsignificantly contribute to the task at hand will be involved. In this work, we\nconsider a more general approach, which is based on rate-distributed spatial\nfiltering. Together with the distance over which transmission takes place, bit\nrate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery\nusage due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance.\nThis results in an efficient rate allocation strategy, which depends on the\nunderlying signal statistics, as well as the distance from sensors to a fusion\ncenter (FC). Under the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance\n(LCMV) beamformer, the problem is derived as a semi-definite program.\nFurthermore, we show that rate allocation is more general than sensor\nselection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special case of the presented\nrate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined by\nthresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for the application of\nestimating several target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the microphone subset selection based approaches in the\nsense of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the FC and close\nto point sources are allocated with higher rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 13:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

In this paper, we study the joint transportation\nand charging scheduling for PV systems to balance the transportation and\ncharging demands, ensuring the long-term operation. We adopt a cake cutting\ngame model to capture the interactions among PV groups, the cloud and smart\ngrids. The cloud announces strategies to coordinate the allocation of\ntransportation and energy resources among PV groups.

We point out the\nnecessity of distinguishing between energy flows towards/from the reservoirs\nand those within the system. We show that energy flow between the reservoirs\noccurs via a direct transfer induced by long-range couplings and a diffusive\nprocess through the chain. To this aim, we introduce a decomposition of the\nsteady-state heat current that explicitly accounts for such direct transfer of\nenergy between the reservoir. For $0\\leq \\alpha<1$, the direct transfer term\ndominates, meaning that the system can be effectively described as a set of\noscillators each interacting with the thermal baths. Also, the heat current\nexchanged with the reservoirs depends on the size of the thermalised regions:\nin the case in which such size is proportional to the system size $N$, the\nstationary current is independent on $N$. For $\\alpha > 1$, heat transport\nmostly occurs through diffusion along the chain: for the rotors transport is\nnormal, while for FPU the data are compatible with an anomalous diffusion,\npossibly with an $\\alpha$ -dependent characteristic exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The mass modifications of these mesons\nin the effective hadronic model, arise due to their interactions with the\nprotons, neutrons and the scalar mesons (non-strange isoscalar $\\sigma$,\nstrange isoscalar, $\\zeta$ and non-strange isovector, $\\delta$), in the\nmagnetized nuclear matter. In the presence of magnetic field, for the charged\nbaryon, i.e., the proton, the number density as well as the scalar density have\ncontributions due to the summation over the Landau energy levels.

Despite the phenomenal advances in Optical Coherence\nTomography (OCT) and Adaptive Optics systems, in vivo imaging of many of these\ncells is limited by the fact that cell contrast in reflection is extremely low.\nHere, we report on a major advance by proposing and demonstrating a radically\ndifferent method compared with OCT to visualize retinal cells with high\ncontrast, resolution and an acquisition time suitable for clinical use. The\nmethod uses a transscleral illumination which provides a high numerical\naperture in a dark field configuration. The light backscattered by the Retinal\nPigment Epithelium (RPE) and the choroid provides a forward illumination for\nthe upper layer of the retina, thus providing a transmission illumination\ncondition. By collecting the scattered light through the pupil, the partially\ncoherent illumination produces dark field images, which are combined to\nreconstruct a quasi-quantitative phase image with twice the numerical aperture\ngiven by the eye's pupil. The retrieved quasi-quantitative phase images (QPI)\nof cells in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are validated with those taken with a\nstandard QPI system. We then apply the technique in vivo on human eye, without\npupil dilation, we demonstrated the feasibility to image retinal cells up to\nthe retinal pigment epithelium within a few seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

While man-made\nsystems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the\nstructure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well\nunderstood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of\nsuch groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of\nrumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must\nreliably flow into the rest of the population.\n  In order to study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups\nthat lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task, we consider a noisy\nversion of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which implies that,\nin the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the\ncommunication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which\nagents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources. Our results\nthus show an exponential separation between the uniform PUSH and PULL\ncommunication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be\ninterpreted as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading,\na system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or,\nalternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise.\n  We corroborate our theoretical findings with a new analysis of experimental\ndata regarding recruitment in Cataglyphis niger desert ants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

Their trajectories are\nchosen at random according to a Gibbs distribution, which favours trajectories\nwith low interference, measured in terms of signal-to-interference ratio. This\nmodel was introduced in our earlier paper [KT18], where we expressed, in the\nlimit of a high density of users, the typical distribution of the family of\ntrajectories in terms of a law of large numbers. In the present work, we derive\nits qualitative properties. We analytically identify the emerging typical\nscenarios in three extreme regimes. We analyse the typical number of hops and\nthe typical length of a hop, and the deviation of the trajectory from the\nstraight line, (1) in the limit of a large communication area and large\ndistances, and (2) in the limit of a strong interference weight. In both\nregimes, the typical trajectory approaches a straight line quickly, in regime\n(1) with equal hop lengths. Interestingly, in regime (1), the typical length of\na hop diverges logarithmically in the distance of the transmitter to the base\nstation.
