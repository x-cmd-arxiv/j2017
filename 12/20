It has also been\nsuggested that the fast neutrino flavor conversion require a crossing in the\nelectron lepton number (ELN) angular distribution or spectrum. We study a few\nsimple analytical models with which we elucidate the roles of the dense matter\nand the ELN spectrum crossing in neutrino fast flavor conversions.

In particular, recent developments to\nsolve the edge-disjoint paths problem and the prize-collecting Steiner tree\nproblem on graphs have shown remarkable results for several classes of graphs\nand for benchmark instances. Here we propose a generalization of these\ntechniques for two variants of the Steiner trees packing problem where multiple\n\"interacting\" trees have to be sought within a given graph. Depending on the\ninteraction among trees we distinguish the vertex-disjoint Steiner trees\nproblem, where trees cannot share nodes, from the edge-disjoint Steiner trees\nproblem, where edges cannot be shared by trees but nodes can be members of\nmultiple trees. Several practical problems of huge interest in network design\ncan be mapped into these two variants, for instance, the physical design of\nVery Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips. The formalism described here relies\non two components edge-variables that allows us to formulate a massage-passing\nalgorithm for the V-DStP and two algorithms for the E-DStP differing in the\nscaling of the computational time with respect to some relevant parameters. We\nwill show that one of the two formalisms used for the edge-disjoint variant\nallow us to map the max-sum update equations into a weighted maximum matching\nproblem over proper bipartite graphs. We developed a heuristic procedure based\non the max-sum equations that shows excellent performance in synthetic networks\n(in particular outperforming standard multi-step greedy procedures by large\nmargins) and on large benchmark instances of VLSI for which the optimal\nsolution is known, on which the algorithm found the optimum in two cases and\nthe gap to optimality was never larger than 4 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 16:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 10:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 18:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

In particular, Inside-Out Planet Formation is a scenario in which\nplanets coalesce sequentially in the disk, at the local gas pressure maximum\nnear the inner boundary of the dead zone. The pressure maximum arises from a\ndecline in viscosity, going from the active innermost disk (where thermal\nionization of alkalis yields high viscosities via the magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI)) to the adjacent dead zone (where the MRI is quenched).\nPrevious studies of the pressure maximum, based on $\\alpha$-disk models, have\nassumed ad hoc values for the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ in the active zone,\nignoring the detailed physics of the MRI. Here we explicitly couple the MRI\ncriteria to the $\\alpha$-disk equations, to find steady-state (constant\naccretion rate) solutions for the disk structure. We consider the effects of\nboth Ohmic and ambipolar resistivities, and find solutions for a range of disk\naccretion rates ($\\dot{M}$ = $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-8}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$/yr),\nstellar masses ($M_{\\ast}$ = 0.1 - 1 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), and fiducial values of\nthe $non$-MRI $\\alpha$-viscosity in the dead zone ($\\alpha_{\\rm {DZ}} =\n10^{-5}$ - $10^{-3}$).

The adoption of new and emerging sensor technologies like\nanisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) sensors are mainly driven by their integrability and\nenhanced sensitivity. At the core of such sensors, a microstructured\nferromagnetic thin film element transduces the magnetic signal. Such elements\nusually switch via multi-domain, C- or S-shaped magnetization states and,\ntherefore, often exhibit an open non-linear hysteresis curve. Linearity and\nhysteretic effects, as well as magnetic noise are key features in the\nimprovement of such sensors. Here, we report on the physical origin of these\ndisturbing factors and the inherent connection of noise and hysteresis.\nCritical noise sources are identified by means of analytic and micromagnetic\nmodels. The dominant noise source is due to irreproducible magnetic switching\nof the transducer element at external fields close to the Stoner Wohlfarth\nswitching field. Furthermore, a solution is presented to overcome these\nlimiting factors: a disruptive sensor design is proposed and analyzed which\nrealizes a topologically protected magnetic vortex state in the transducer\nelement. Compared to state of the art sensors the proposed sensor layout has\nnegligible hysteresis, a linear regime about an order of magnitude higher and\nlower magnetic noise making the sensor ideal candidate for applications ranging\nfrom automotive industry to biological application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 17:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

These nonlocalities are well understood in the ultraviolet\nregime but much less in the infrared, where they could in principle give rise\nto important cosmological effects. Here we systematize and extend previous work\nof our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\\Lambda$ is dynamically\ngenerated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum\neffective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual\naspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of\nthese models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution\nseverely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the\nso-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the\nconformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,\nwhere the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom\nequation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological\nconstant. (2) Cosmological perturbations are well behaved. (3) Implementing the\nmodel in a Boltzmann code and comparing with observations we find that the RR\nmodel fits the CMB, BAO, SNe, structure formation data and local $H_0$\nmeasurements at a level statistically equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM. (4) Bayesian\nparameter estimation shows that the value of $H_0$ obtained in the RR model is\nhigher than in $\\Lambda$CDM, reducing to $2.0\\sigma$ the tension with the value\nfrom local measurements. (5) The RR model provides a prediction for the sum of\nneutrino masses that falls within the limits set by oscillation and terrestrial\nexperiments.

Rayleigh considered the instability of a\ncylinder of viscous liquid under capillary force, the so-called\nPlateau-Rayleigh instability. In this work, in linear approximation, he\nobtained a dispersion equation describing the increment of this instability as\na function of wavelength, the radius of cylinder, the mass density, surface\ntension, and viscosity of the liquid. Hundreds of authors referred to this\nwork, but none of them used his dispersion equation in its complete form; they\nused only the asymptotic solutions of his equation for zero and infinitely\nlarge viscousities. A reason for this is, probably, that Rayleigh's writing is\nvery difficult and his dispersion equation is quite complex. Then, in 1961, S\nChandrasekhar, in his monograph, also considered the stability of a viscous\ncylindrical jet and obtained his dispersion equation which is also quite\ncomplex and differs from the one obtained by Rayleigh. As in the case of\nRayleigh's dispersion equation, other works use only the asymptotic solution of\nChandrasekhar's equation that corresponds to the case where the viscosity is\nvery large in comparison to inertia.

This has led to many developments, in particular in the\ncontext of chiral logarithmic CFT. We consider in this paper a possible\ngeneralization of the idea to the case of bulk conformal field theory. This is\nof course considerably more difficult, since there is no obvious way of merging\ntwo closed spin chains into a big one. In an earlier paper, two of us had\nproposed a \"topological\" way of performing this operation in the case of models\nbased on the affine Temperley-Lieb (ATL) algebra, by exploiting the associated\nbraid group representation and skein relations. In the present work, we\nestablish - using, in particular, Frobenius reciprocity - the resulting fusion\nrules for standard modules of ATL in the generic as well as partially\ndegenerate cases. These fusion rules have a simple interpretation in the\ncontinuum limit. However, unlike in the chiral case this interpretation does\nnot match the usual fusion in non-chiral CFTs. Rather, it corresponds to the\nglueing of the right moving component of one conformal field with the left\nmoving component of the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 17:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 14:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

It\nhas been speculated that these high energy neutrinos might originate either\nfrom purely conventional astrophysical sources or from the late decay of a\nsuper heavy (PeV scale) dark matter (DM) particle. In order for decaying DM to\nbe a dominant source of the IceCube high-energy neutrinos, it would require an\nunusually suppressed value of the coupling of DM to neutrinos. We attempt to\nexplain this small coupling in the context of an $R$-parity conserving minimal\nsupergravity model which has right-handed neutrino superfields. With the main\nassumptions of super-partner masses at the PeV scale and also a reheating\ntemperature not much larger than the PeV scale, we find in our model several\nnatural order-of-magnitude \"miracles\", (i) the gravitino is produced via\nfreeze-in as a DM candidate with the correct relic density (ii) the\nright-handed (RH) sneutrino makes up only a tiny fraction ($10^{-6})$, of the\npresent day energy density of the universe, yet its decay lifetime to the\ngravitino and neutrinos is such that it naturally predicts the right\norder-of-magnitude for the IceCube neutrino flux. The long lifetime of the RH\nsneutrino is explained by the existence of a global $R$-symmetry which is only\nbroken due to supersymmetry breaking effects. Our model also predicts a flux of\n100 TeV gamma rays from the decaying RH sneutrino which are within the current\nobservational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 06:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

In our model the two-atom system is envisaged as an open\nsystem coupled with a massless scalar field prepared in one of the physical\nvacuum states of interest. We employ the quantum master equation in the\nBorn-Markov approximation in order to describe the time evolution of the atomic\nsubsystem. We investigate two different states of motion for the atoms, namely\nstatic atoms and also stationary atoms with zero angular momentum. The purpose\nof this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming\nfrom the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the\nHawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the\nscenario of rotating black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is\nsignificantly modified due to the phenomenon of superradiance in comparison\nwith the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In the perspective of a\nzero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), one is allowed to probe entanglement\ndynamics inside the ergosphere, since static observers cannot exist within such\na region. On the other hand, the presence of superradiant modes could be a\nsource for violation of complete positivity. This is verified when the quantum\nfield is prepared in the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state. In this exceptional\nsituation, we raise the possibility that the loss of complete positivity is due\nto the breakdown of the Markovian approximation, which means that any arbitrary\nphysically admissible initial state of the two atoms would not be capable to\nhold, with time evolution, its interpretation as a physical state inasmuch as\nnegative probabilities are generated by the dynamical map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 02:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

This method examines the tail\nbehavior of both the marginal and joint degree distributions and is based on\nextreme value theory.

In this paper, we present two combinatorial approaches of D2D coded\ncaching network design with reduced packetizations and desired throughput gain\ncompared to the conventional uncoded unicasting. The first approach uses a\n\"hypercube\" design, where each user caches a \"hyperplane\" in this hypercube and\nthe intersections of \"hyperplanes\" represent coded multicasting codewords.

In a\nnatural conversation, there is an additional source of information to take into\naccount: utterances produced earlier in a conversation can also be referred to\nand a conversational IR system has to keep track of information conveyed by the\nuser during the conversation, even if it is implicit.\n  We argue that the process of building a representation of the conversation\ncan be framed as a machine reading task, where an automated system is presented\nwith a number of statements about which it should answer questions. The\nquestions should be answered solely by referring to the statements provided,\nwithout consulting external knowledge. The time is right for the information\nretrieval community to embrace this task, both as a stand-alone task and\nintegrated in a broader conversational search setting.\n  In this paper, we focus on machine reading as a stand-alone task and present\nthe Attentive Memory Network (AMN), an end-to-end trainable machine reading\nalgorithm. Its key contribution is in efficiency, achieved by having an\nhierarchical input encoder, iterating over the input only once. Speed is an\nimportant requirement in the setting of conversational search, as gaps between\nconversational turns have a detrimental effect on naturalness. On 20 datasets\ncommonly used for evaluating machine reading algorithms we show that the AMN\nachieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models, while using\nconsiderably fewer computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 21:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

While state-of-the-art work on learning Gaussian mixture\nmodels has focused primarily on improving separation bounds and their\ngeneralization to arbitrary classes of mixture models, less emphasis has been\npaid to practical computational efficiency of the proposed solutions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel and highly efficient clustering algorithm for $n$\npoints drawn from a mixture of two arbitrary Gaussian distributions in\n$\\mathbb{R}^p$. The algorithm involves performing random 1-dimensional\nprojections until a direction is found that yields a user-specified clustering\nerror $e$.

Protein dihedral angles provide a detailed description of protein\nlocal conformation. Predicted dihedral angles can be used to narrow down the\nconformational space of the whole polypeptide chain significantly, thus aiding\nprotein tertiary structure prediction. However, direct angle prediction from\nsequence alone is challenging.\n  Method. In this study, we present a novel method to predict real-valued\nangles by combining clustering and deep learning. That is, we first generate\ncertain clusters of angles (each assigned a label) and then apply a deep\nresidual neural network to predict the label posterior probability. Finally, we\noutput real-valued prediction by a mixture of the clusters with their predicted\nprobabilities. At the same time, we also estimate the bound of the prediction\nerrors at each residue from the predicted label probabilities.\n  Result. In this article, we present a novel method (named RaptorX-Angle) to\npredict real-valued angles by combining clustering and deep learning.

All previous studies have focused on\nmagnetic vortex-core switching via external magnetic fields, spin-polarized\ncurrents, or spin waves, which have largely prohibited the investigation of\nnovel spin configurations that could emerge from the ground states in\nferromagnetic disks and their underlying dynamics. Here, we report in situ\nvisualization of femtosecond laser quenching induced magnetic vortex change in\nvarious symmetric ferromagnetic Permalloy disks by Lorentz phase imaging using\n4D electron microscopy. Besides the switching of magnetic vortex chirality and\npolarity, we observed with distinct occurrence frequencies a plenitude of\ncomplex magnetic structures that have never been observed by magnetic field or\ncurrent assisted switching. These complex magnetic structures consist of a\nnumber of newly created topological magnetic defects (vortex and antivortex)\nstrictly conserving the topological winding number, demonstrating the direct\nimpact of topological invariant on the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic\ndisks. Their spin configurations show mirror or rotation symmetry due to the\ngeometrical confinement of the disks. Combined micromagnetic simulations with\nthe experimental observations reveal the underlying magnetization dynamics and\nformation mechanism of the optical quenching induced complex magnetic\nstructures. Their distinct occurrence rates are pertinent to their\nformation-growth energetics and pinning effects at the disk edge.

Nonetheless, the predictive causality approach may\noverlook the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of causal interactions observed\nin real world phenomena. Here, we present a causal decomposition approach that\nis not based on prediction, but based on the instantaneous phase dependency\nbetween the intrinsic components of a decomposed time series. The method\ninvolves two assumptions: (1) any cause effect relationship can be quantified\nwith instantaneous phase dependency between the source and target decomposed as\nintrinsic components at specific time scale, and (2) the phase dynamics in the\ntarget originating from the source are separable from the target itself.

The remarkable agreement\nbetween TRMOKE experiment and the prediction of breathing Fermi-surface model\nconfirms that a large Elliott-Yafet spin-mixing parameter is relevant to the\nstrong spin-orbital coupling at the Co/Ni interface.

The latter is the flux through a dividing\nsurface (DS) between the two corresponding regions and it is exact only if it\nis free of recrossings. For time-independent barriers, the DS can be attached\nto the top of the corresponding saddle point of the potential energy surface,\nand in time-dependent systems, the DS is a moving object. The precise\ndetermination of reaction rates, eg using transition state theory, requires the\nactual construction of a DS for a given saddle geometry which is in general a\ndemanding methodical and computational task, especially in high-dimensional\nsystems. In this paper, we demonstrate how such time-dependent, global, and\nrecrossing-free DSs can be constructed using neural networks. In our approach,\nthe neural network uses the bath coordinates and time as input and it is\ntrained in a way that its output provides the position of the DS along the\nreaction coordinate. An advantage of this procedure is that, once the neural\nnetwork is trained, the complete information about the dynamical phase space\nseparation is stored in the network's parameters, and a precise distinction\nbetween reactants and products can be made for all possible system\nconfigurations, all times, and with little computational effort.

Probing these gravitational\nemissions requires the gravitational-wave detectors to have high sensitivity\nabove 1 kHz. Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable\ngap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high\nfrequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by\nreducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter,\nfrequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise\nlevel from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit and is a factor\nof 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors. This will allow\nfor precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of the binary neutron\nstar, (ii) late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown of low-mass black\nhole-neutron star systems, and possible detection of (iii) high-frequency modes\nduring supernovae explosions. This design tries to maximize the science return\nof current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is\ncomplementary to the longer-baseline third-generation detectors: the10 km\nEinstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main\ntechnical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated\nresearch programs.

It was suggested that some SNe Ic-BL are\npowered by magnetar spin-down. iPTF16asu is a peculiar broad-lined type Ic\nsupernova discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory.

The mass-loss\nrate of the progenitor and ejecta mass are consistent with a progenitor that\nexperienced a common envelope evolution in a binary. An alternative model for\nthe early rapid rise of the light curve is the cooling of a shock propagating\ninto an extended envelope of the progenitor. It is difficult at this stage to\ntell which model (interaction+magnetar+56Ni or cooling+magnetar+56Ni) is better\nfor iPTF16asu.

Then the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequation, which plays a key role in the present paper, is derived from the\ncorresponding functional. The zoology of the form factors appearing in GP\nequation is studied in details. The classes of proper for the description of\nspatially non-uniform condensates form factors are chosen.

Current multi-exposure fusion (MEF) approaches use\nhand-crafted features to fuse input sequence. However, the weak hand-crafted\nrepresentations are not robust to varying input conditions. Moreover, they\nperform poorly for extreme exposure image pairs. Thus, it is highly desirable\nto have a method that is robust to varying input conditions and capable of\nhandling extreme exposure without artifacts. Deep representations have known to\nbe robust to input conditions and have shown phenomenal performance in a\nsupervised setting. However, the stumbling block in using deep learning for MEF\nwas the lack of sufficient training data and an oracle to provide the\nground-truth for supervision. To address the above issues, we have gathered a\nlarge dataset of multi-exposure image stacks for training and to circumvent the\nneed for ground truth images, we propose an unsupervised deep learning\nframework for MEF utilizing a no-reference quality metric as loss function.

The bilayers consist of $\\leq$ 100 nm of\nepitaxial $\\alpha$-U (grown on a Nb buffer deposited on sapphire) with a\nUO$_{2}$ overlayer of thicknesses of between 20 and 80 nm. The oxides were made\neither by depositing via reactive magnetron sputtering, or allowing the uranium\nmetal to oxidise in air at room temperature. The bilayers were exposed to\nhydrogen, with sample temperatures between 80 and 200 C, and monitored via\nin-situ x-ray diffraction and complimentary experiments conducted using\nScanning Transmission Electron Microscopy - Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy\n(STEM-EELS). Small partial pressures of H$_{2}$ caused rapid consumption of the\nU metal and lead to changes in the intensity and position of the diffraction\npeaks from both the UO$_{2}$ overlayers and the U metal. There is an\norientational dependence in the rate of U consumption. From changes in the\nlattice parameter we deduce that hydrogen enters both the oxide and metal\nlayers, contracting the oxide and expanding the metal. The air-grown oxide\noverlayers appear to hinder the H$_{2}$-reaction up to a threshold dose, but\nthen on heating from 80 to 140 C the consumption is more rapid than for the\nas-deposited overlayers. STEM-EELS establishes that the U-hydride layer lies at\nthe oxide-metal interface, and that the initial formation is at defects or\ngrain boundaries, and involves the formation of amorphous and/or\nnanocrystalline UH$_{3}$. This explains why no diffraction peaks from UH$_{3}$\nare observed. {\\textcopyright British Crown Owned Copyright 2017/AWE}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 09:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Our proposition makes it possible to\nautomatically obtain, from a representation of the system application domain in\nthe form of ontologies, the structural part of the Event-B specification which\nwill be used to formally validate the consistency of system requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

Since stars emit only a small fraction\nof their total luminosity in the X-ray band, the stellar XMMSL2 sources ought\nto have relatively bright optical counterparts. Therefore the stellar\nidentifications are obtained by an automatic crossmatch of the XMMSL2 catalog\nwith the first Gaia data release (Gaia DR1), the 2MASS and the Tycho2 catalogs.\nThe reliability of this procedure is verified by a comparison with the\nindividually classified Einstein Observatory medium sensitivity survey X-ray\nsources and by a crossmatch with the Chandra Source Catalog. We identify 6815\nof the 23252 unique XMMSL2 sources to be stellar sources, while 893 sources are\nflagged as unreliable. For every counterpart a matching probability is\nestimated based upon the distance between the XMMSL2 source and the\ncounterpart. Given this matching probability the sample is expected to be\nreliable to 96.7 % and complete to 96.3 %. The sample contains stars of all\nspectral types and luminosity classes, with late-type dwarfs having the largest\nshare. For many stellar sources the fractional contribution of the X-ray band\nto the total energy output is found above the saturation limit of previous\nstudies ($L_\\mathrm{X}/L_\\mathrm{bol}=10^{-3}$), because the XMMSL2 sources are\nmore affected by flares due to their short exposure times of typically 6 s. A\ncomparison with the \"Second ROSAT all-sky survey (2RXS) source catalog\" shows\nthat about 25 % of the stellar XMMSL2 sources are previously unknown X-ray\nsources. The results of our identification procedure can be accessed via\nVizieR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

A crucial step in all momentum-based methods is the choice of the\nmomentum parameter $m$ which is always suggested to be set to less than $1$.\nAlthough the choice of $m < 1$ is justified only under very strong theoretical\nassumptions, it works well in practice even when the assumptions do not\nnecessarily hold. In this paper, we propose a new momentum based method\n$\\textit{ADINE}$, which relaxes the constraint of $m < 1$ and allows the\nlearning algorithm to use adaptive higher momentum. We motivate our hypothesis\non $m$ by experimentally verifying that a higher momentum ($\\ge 1$) can help\nescape saddles much faster. Using this motivation, we propose our method\n$\\textit{ADINE}$ that helps weigh the previous updates more (by setting the\nmomentum parameter $> 1$), evaluate our proposed algorithm on deep neural\nnetworks and show that $\\textit{ADINE}$ helps the learning algorithm to\nconverge much faster without compromising on the generalization error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 11:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

The drawback to this solution is\nthat the histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the\nmolecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of\nthis heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most\nprior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a\ncounting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the\ntransmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that\nthe molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be\ncoming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this\nidea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and\ntime is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is\napproximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing\nspherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the\ncharacteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved\nperformance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit\nerror rate is found analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 12:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

The challenge in the approximate inference for the GP regression with\nthe Student-t probabilistic model, lies in the analytical intractability of the\nposterior distribution and the lack of concavity of the log-likelihood\nfunction. We present the natural gradient adaptation for the estimation process\nwhich primarily relies on the property that the Student-t model naturally has\northogonal parametrization with respect to the location and scale paramaters.\nDue to this particular property of the model, we also introduce an alternative\nLaplace approximation by using the Fisher information matrix in place of the\nHessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function.

Taking advantage of the\nmulti-dimensional structure of EEG data through tensor analysis offers a\nframework to extract relevant developmental features present in paediatric\nresting-state EEG datasets. Methods. Three paediatric datasets from varying\ndevelopmental states and populations were analyzed using a developed two-step\nconstrained Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition. The datasets\nincluded the Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Children's Hospital Boston-MIT and\nthe Child Mind Institute, outlining two impaired and one healthy population,\nrespectively.

We examine atypical events when a unexpected large\nproportion of users are disconnected or connected by proposing a hybrid\napproach based on ray launching simulation and point process theory. This work\nis motivated by recent results using large deviations theory applied to the\nsignal-to-interference ratio. This theory provides a tool for the stochastic\nanalysis of atypical but disruptive events, particularly when the density of\ntransmitters is high. For a section of a European city, we introduce a new\nstochastic model of a single network cell that uses ray launching data\ngenerated with the open source RaLaNS package, giving deterministic path loss\nvalues. We collect statistics on the fraction of (dis)connected users in the\nuplink, and observe that the probability of an unexpected large proportion of\ndisconnected users decreases exponentially when the transmitter density\nincreases. This observation implies that denser networks become more stable in\nthe sense that the probability of the fraction of (dis)connected users\ndeviating from its mean, is exponentially small. We also empirically obtain and\nillustrate the density of users for network configurations in the disruptive\nevent, which highlights the fact that such bottleneck behaviour not only stems\nfrom too many users at the cell boundary, but also from the near-far effect of\nmany users in the immediate vicinity of the base station.

Extensive experiments and comparisons on two large-scale\nbenchmarks (i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO) show that our model achieves superior\nperformance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and\nefficiency as well as explicitly identifying image-level semantic labels to\nspecific object regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

Its derivation starts from the observation that the\ntypical approach of depth integrating the Navier-Stokes equations along the\ndirection of gravity forces is not exact in the general case of a tilted curved\nbottom. We claim that an integration path that better adapts to the shallow\nwater hypotheses follows the \"cross-flow\" surface, i.e., a surface that is\nnormal to the velocity field at any point of the domain. Because of the\nimplicitness of this definition, we approximate this \"cross-flow\" path by\nperforming depth integration along a local direction normal to the bottom\nsurface, and propose a rigorous derivation of this approximation and its\nnumerical solution as an essential step for the future development of the full\n\"cross-flow\" integration procedure. We start by defining a local coordinate\nsystem, anchored on the bottom surface to derive a covariant form of the\nNavier-Stokes equations. Depth integration along the local normals yields a\ncovariant version of the shallow water equations, which is characterized by\nflux functions and source terms that vary in space because of the surface\nmetric coefficients and related derivatives. The proposed model is discretized\nwith a first order FORCE-type Godunov Finite Volume scheme that allows\nimplementation of spatially variable fluxes. We investigate the validity of our\nSW model and the effects of the bottom geometry by means of three synthetic\ntest cases that exhibit non negligible slopes and surface curvatures. The\nresults show the importance of taking into consideration bottom geometry even\nfor relatively mild and slowly varying curvatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 13:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In this work, aiming at a general and comprehensive\nway for neural network acceleration, we develop a Wavelet-like Auto-Encoder\n(WAE) that decomposes the original input image into two low-resolution channels\n(sub-images) and incorporate the WAE into the classification neural networks\nfor joint training.

Usually they are\nmotivated as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In this case one of their most\nimportant features is that their coupling to other particles is suppressed by a\nlarge scale, the vacuum expectation value of the field breaking the symmetry\nthat gives rise to them. This naturally endows them with very weak interactions\nbut also restricts the maximal field value and therefore the regions where\nsufficient dark matter is produced. In this paper we investigate deviations\nfrom this simplest setup, where the potential and interactions are as expected\nfor a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, but the kinetic term has singularities.\nThis leads to a significantly increased area in parameter space where such\nparticles can be dark matter and can be probed by current and near future\nexperiments. We discuss cosmological limits and in the course of this give a\nsimple derivation of a formula for isocurvature fluctuations in models with\ngeneral anharmonic potentials. As an application of this formula we give an\nupdate of the isocurvature constraints for QCD axion dark matter models, using\nthe most recent results for the QCD topological susceptibility and the newest\nPlanck data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 14:46:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 15:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We find extremely low strengths of around one Pa or less (one\nto five Pa, when scaled to a metre length). The presence of eroded material at\nthe base of most overhangs, as well as the observed collapse of two features\nand implied previous collapse of another, suggests that they are prone to\nfailure and that true material strengths are close to these lower limits\n(although we only consider static stresses and not dynamic stress from, for\nexample, cometary activity). Thus, a tensile strength of a few pascals is a\ngood approximation for the tensile strength of 67P's nucleus material, which is\nin agreement with previous work. We find no particular trends in overhang\nproperties with size, over the $\\sim10-100$ m range studied here, or location\non the nucleus. There are no obvious differences, in terms of strength, height\nor evidence of collapse, between the populations of overhangs on the two\ncometary lobes, suggesting that 67P is relatively homogenous in terms of\ntensile strength.

As for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in\nmiscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. The\nfocus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth\nof disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of\nforcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these\ndisturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial\ntension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost\nassociated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For\nmiscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic\nan effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be\nrelevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing\nmechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities,\nhighlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension\nposes deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear\nstability analysis.

We study harmonic mappings, i.e.\nminimizers of the Dirichlet energy provided that the values on the boundary d\nOmega are fixed.

This line\nis emitted from 1 keV ($T \\approx 10^7$ K) plasma, and we use it to measure the\nbulk radial velocity and velocity dispersion of the plasma at this temperature.\nIn contrast to the intermediate-temperature FUV lines, [\\ion{Fe}{xxi}] is\nblueshifted relative to M87 and matches the bulk velocity of a nearby filament\nto the south. We hypothesize that this line arises from the approaching face of\nthe radio bubble expanding through this sightline, while the filament lies on\nthe receding side of the bubble.

This recovery procedure constitutes a core part\nof any conservative GRMHD scheme and it is closely tied to the equation of\nstate (EOS) of the fluid.

Moreover, we\nextracted the linking number by detecting the Berry phase associated with\ndifferent loops encircling nodal lines. This topological invariant clearly\nreveals the nontrivial topology of the Hopf-link semimetal.

To\nunderstand and ultimately be able to predict such dynamics, we propose an\nunderlying mechanism based on sharp thresholds of a local generalized energy\ndensity that naturally leads to negative feedback. We find a transition from a\ncontinuous regime to an intermittent one, in which avalanches can be predicted\ndespite the stochastic nature of the process. This model may have applications\nin many natural and social complex systems where a rapid depletion of resources\nor generalized energy drives the dynamics. In particular, we show how this\nmodel accurately describes the time evolution and avalanches present in a real\nsocial system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 09:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 19:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

In addition to that, uniform space-time variational\nmethods appear to be advantageous for stability and a priori error analyses of\nthe discrete schemes.
