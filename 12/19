The metallicity upper limit is based on the Ca II K line, that at the\nresolving power of the OSIRIS spectrograph cannot be resolved from possible\ninterstellar calcium. The star could be the most iron-poor unevolved star\nknown, and is also amongst the ones with the largest overabundances of carbon.\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy of J0815+4729 will certainly help to derive other\nimportant element abundances, possibly providing new fundamental constraints on\nthe early stages of the Universe, the formation of the first stars and the\nproperties of the first supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 16:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Low signal-to-noise ratio signals need\ntemplated searches with long coherent integration times and thus fine\nparameter-space resolution. Longer integration increases sensitivity. Low-mass\nx-ray binaries (LMXBs) such as Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) may emit accretion-driven\nCWs at strains reachable by current ground-based observatories. Binary orbital\nparameters induce phase modulation. This paper describes how resampling\ncorrects binary and detector motion, yielding source-frame time series used for\ncross-correlation. Compared to the previous, detector-frame, templated\ncross-correlation method, used for Sco X-1 on data from the first Advanced LIGO\nobserving run (O1), resampling is about 20x faster in the costliest,\nmost-sensitive frequency bands.

Let $R$ be a\ncommutative ring, $V$ an $R$-module, $E=\\mathrm{End}_R(V)$ the ring of\n$R$-endomorphisms of $V$, and $W$ a subgroup of $(E,+)$ such that $ab=ba$ for\nevery $a$, $b\\in W$ and $1+a$ is invertible for every $a\\in W$. Then\n$Q_{R,V}(W)$ defined on $W\\times V$ by $(a,u)(b,v) = (a+b,u(1+b)+v(1-a))$ is an\nautomorphic loop.\n  A special case occurs when $R=k<K=V$ is a field extension and $W$ is a\n$k$-subspace of $K$ such that $k1\\cap W = 0$, naturally embedded into\n$\\mathrm{End}_k(K)$ by $a\\mapsto M_a$, $bM_a = ba$. In this case we denote the\nautomorphic loop $Q_{R,V}(W)$ by $Q_{k<K}(W)$.\n  We call the parameters tame if $k$ is a prime field, $W$ generates $K$ as a\nfield over $k$, and $K$ is perfect when $\\mathrm{char}(k)=2$. We describe the\nautomorphism groups of tame automorphic loops $Q_{k<K}(W)$, and we solve the\nisomorphism problem for tame automorphic loops $Q_{k<K}(W)$. A special case\nsolves a problem about automorphic loops of order $p^3$ posed by Jedli\\v{c}ka,\nKinyon and Vojt\\v{e}chovsk\\'y.\n  We conclude the paper with a construction of an infinite $2$-generated\nabelian-by-cyclic automorphic loop of prime exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 16:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

The basic building block of a quantum network is an X-shaped\npotential well made by crossing two quantum wires, and we consider a massive\nparticle in such an X well. The system is analyzed using a variational method\nbased on an expansion into modes with fast convergence and it provides a very\nclear intuition for the physics of the problem. The particle is found to have a\nground state that is exponentially localized to the center of the X well, and\nthe other symmetric solutions are formed so to be orthogonal to the ground\nstate. This is in contrast to the predictions of the conventionally used\nso-called Kirchoff boundary conditions in quantum graph theory that predict a\ndifferent sequence of symmetric solutions that cannot be physically realized.\nNumerical methods have previously been the only source of information on the\nground-state wave function and our results provide a different perspective with\nstrong analytical insights. The ground-state wave function has the shape of a\nsolitonic solution to the non-linear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation, enabling an\nanalytical prediction of the wave number. When combining multiple X wells into\na network or grid, each site supports a solitonic localized state. The solitons\nonly couple to each other and are able to jump from one site to another as if\nthey were trapped in a discrete lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 17:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

A central reason is that\nwhile random mutation generally works in low dimensions, a random perturbation\nof thousands or millions of weights is likely to break existing functionality,\nproviding no learning signal even if some individual weight changes were\nbeneficial. This paper proposes a solution by introducing a family of safe\nmutation (SM) operators that aim within the mutation operator itself to find a\ndegree of change that does not alter network behavior too much, but still\nfacilitates exploration. Importantly, these SM operators do not require any\nadditional interactions with the environment. The most effective SM variant\ncapitalizes on the intriguing opportunity to scale the degree of mutation of\neach individual weight according to the sensitivity of the network's outputs to\nthat weight, which requires computing the gradient of outputs with respect to\nthe weights (instead of the gradient of error, as in conventional deep\nlearning). This safe mutation through gradients (SM-G) operator dramatically\nincreases the ability of a simple genetic algorithm-based neuroevolution method\nto find solutions in high-dimensional domains that require deep and/or\nrecurrent neural networks (which tend to be particularly brittle to mutation),\nincluding domains that require processing raw pixels.

For that reason, the recent result from OpenAI showing that a\nparticular kind of evolution strategy (ES) can rival the performance of\nSGD-based deep RL methods with large neural networks provoked surprise. This\nresult is difficult to interpret in part because of the lingering ambiguity on\nhow ES actually relates to SGD. The aim of this paper is to significantly\nreduce this ambiguity through a series of MNIST-based experiments designed to\nuncover their relationship. As a simple supervised problem without domain noise\n(unlike in most RL), MNIST makes it possible (1) to measure the correlation\nbetween gradients computed by ES and SGD and (2) then to develop an SGD-based\nproxy that accurately predicts the performance of different ES population\nsizes. These innovations give a new level of insight into the real capabilities\nof ES, and lead also to some unconventional means for applying ES to supervised\nproblems that shed further light on its differences from SGD. Incorporating\nthese lessons, the paper concludes by demonstrating that ES can achieve 99%\naccuracy on MNIST, a number higher than any previously published result for any\nevolutionary method.

To this end, we\nstart by obtaining the hitherto overlooked dissipative interaction of a domain\nwall and its quantum magnon bath to linear order in the domain-wall velocity\nand to quadratic order in magnon fields. An exact expression for the pertinent\nscattering matrix is obtained with the aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.\nWe then derive the magnon-induced frictional force on a domain wall in two\ndifferent frameworks: time-dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics\nand the Keldysh formalism, which yield identical results. The latter, in\nparticular, allows us to verify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem explicitly\nby providing both the frictional force and the correlator of the associated\nstochastic Langevin force. The potential for magnons induced by a domain wall\nis reflectionless, and thus the resultant frictional force is non-Markovian\nsimilarly to the case of solitons in superfluids. They share an intriguing\nconnection to the Abraham-Lorentz force that is well-known for its causality\nparadox. The dynamical responses of a domain wall are studied under a few\nsimple circumstances, where the non-Markovian nature of the frictional force\ncan be probed experimentally.

A commensurate investment in R&D for the software for\nacquiring, managing, processing and analyzing HL-LHC data will be critical to\nmaximize the return-on-investment in the upgraded accelerator and detectors.\nThe strategic plan presented in this report is the result of a\nconceptualization process carried out to explore how a potential Scientific\nSoftware Innovation Institute (S2I2) for High Energy Physics (HEP) can play a\nkey role in meeting HL-LHC challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 17:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 18:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

Here we point out that this can not only be\nused to provide a method to determine the standard relation between halo mass\nand concentration, but also to use large samples of objects in order to place\nconstraints on dark matter self-interactions that can be more robust than\nconstraints derived from individual objects. We demonstrate our method by\nconsidering a sample of about 50 objects distributed across the whole halo mass\nrange, and by modelling the effect of self-interactions in a way similar to\nwhat has been previously done in the literature. Using additional input from\nsimulations then results in a constraint on the self-interaction cross section\nper unit dark matter mass of about $\\sigma/m_\\chi\\lesssim 0.3$ cm$^2$/g. We\nexpect that these constraints can be significantly improved in the future, and\nmade more robust, by i) an improved modelling of the effect of\nself-interactions, both theoretical and by comparison with simulations, ii)\ntaking into account a larger sample of objects and iii) by reducing the\ncurrently still relatively large uncertainties that we conservatively assign to\nthe surface densities of individual objects. The latter can be achieved in\nparticular by using kinematic observations to directly constrain the average\nhalo mass inside a given radius, rather than fitting the data to a pre-selected\nprofile and then reconstruct the mass. For a velocity-independent\ncross-section, our current result is formally already somewhat smaller than the\nrange $0.5-5$ cm$^2$/g that has been invoked to explain potential\ninconsistencies between small-scale observations and expectations in the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 18:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

These standard\nprocedures, based on either the Hamiltonian or the path integral, however, do\nnot work in the case of a relativistic particle. As a result we do not have a\nsingle particle description of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Instead,\nthe correct approach requires a transmutation of dynamical variables from the\nposition and momentum of a single particle to a field and its canonical\nmomentum. Particles, along with antiparticles, reappear in a very non-trivial\nmanner as the excitations of the field. The fact that one needs to adopt\ncompletely different languages to describe relativistic and non-relativistic\nfree particle implies that obtaining the NRQM limit of QFT is conceptually\nnon-trivial. I examine this limit in several approaches (like, for e.g.,\nHamiltonian dynamics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian path integrals, field\ntheoretic description etc.) and identify the precise issues which arise when\none attempts to obtain the NRQM from QFT in each of these approaches. The\ndichotomy of description between NRQM and QFT does not originate just from the\nsquare root in the Hamiltonian or from the demand of Lorentz invariance, as it\nis sometimes claimed. The real difficulty has its origin in the necessary\nexistence of antiparticles to ensure a particular notion of relativistic\ncausality. Because of these conceptual issues, it turns out that one cannot, in\nfact, obtain some of the popular descriptions of NRQM by any sensible limiting\nprocedure applied to QFT. To obtain NRQM from QFT in a seamless manner, it is\nnecessary to work with NRQM expressed in a language closer to that of QFT.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 09:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The SXS was\noperated with an energy resolution of $\\sim$5 eV (full width at half maximum)\nat 5.9 keV. Not only fine structures of K-shell lines in He-like ions but also\ntransitions from higher principal quantum numbers are clearly resolved from Si\nthrough Fe. This enables us to perform temperature diagnostics using the line\nratios of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and to provide the first direct measurement of\nthe excitation temperature and ionization temperature in the Perseus cluster.\nThe observed spectrum is roughly reproduced by a single temperature thermal\nplasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium, but detailed line ratio\ndiagnostics reveal slight deviations from this approximation. In particular,\nthe data exhibit an apparent trend of increasing ionization temperature with\nincreasing atomic mass, as well as small differences between the ionization and\nexcitation temperatures for Fe, the only element for which both temperatures\ncan be measured. The best-fit two-temperature models suggest a combination of 3\nand 5 keV gas, which is consistent with the idea that the observed small\ndeviations from a single temperature approximation are due to the effects of\nprojection of the known radial temperature gradient in the cluster core along\nthe line of sight. Comparison with the Chandra/ACIS and the XMM-Newton/RGS\nresults on the other hand suggests that additional lower-temperature components\nare present in the ICM but not detectable by Hitomi SXS given its 1.8--20 keV\nenergy band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

When the electric field is constant, the mean\nnumber of pairs which are produced depends on the electric field and the\ncoupling constant in a non-analytic manner, showing that this result cannot be\nobtained from the standard perturbation theory of quantum electrodynamics. When\nthe electric field varies with time and vanishes asymptotically, the result may\ndepend on the coupling constant either analytically or non-analytically.

The wave packet\nis unambiguously determined by analytical properties of Wightman functions in\ncomplex coordinate space naturally connected with its minimization properties.\nThe packet gives natural relativistic generalization of non relativistic\nGaussian wave packet but it contains covariant states of particle\n(antiparticle) only with positive (negative) energy sign and propagates without\ntheir mixing and without changing of its relativistically invariant width. For\nthe diagrammatic treatment of oscillation with the use of these wave packets\nfor external particles, the notion of covariant composite wave function for\nintermediate neutrino is introduced. It strictly and naturally connects both\noscillation pictures, giving an effective language for detailed description of\nthis process, and resolves the problems with causality and with covariant equal\ntime prescription for the intermediate neutrino picture. It is closely related\nto overlap function of neutrino creation/detection vertices, elucidating a\ncovariant meaning of the `pole integration' procedure.

A detection based counting method will\nestimate crowds accurately in low density scenes, while its reliability in\ncongested areas is downgraded. A regression based approach, on the other hand,\ncaptures the general density information in crowded regions. Without knowing\nthe location of each person, it tends to overestimate the count in low density\nareas. Thus, exclusively using either one of them is not sufficient to handle\nall kinds of scenes with varying densities. To address this issue, a novel\nend-to-end crowd counting framework, named DecideNet (DEteCtIon and Density\nEstimation Network) is proposed. It can adaptively decide the appropriate\ncounting mode for different locations on the image based on its real density\nconditions. DecideNet starts with estimating the crowd density by generating\ndetection and regression based density maps separately. To capture inevitable\nvariation in densities, it incorporates an attention module, meant to\nadaptively assess the reliability of the two types of estimations. The final\ncrowd counts are obtained with the guidance of the attention module to adopt\nsuitable estimations from the two kinds of density maps.

It is therefore important to develop\nefficient methods for constructing flux-rope configurations constrained by\nobserved magnetic data and the morphology of the pre-eruptive source region.\nFor this purpose, we have derived and implemented a compact analytical form\nthat represents the magnetic field of a thin flux rope with an axis of\narbitrary shape and circular cross-sections. This form implies that the flux\nrope carries axial current $I$ and axial flux $F$, so that the respective\nmagnetic field is the curl of the sum of axial and azimuthal vector potentials\nproportional to $I$ and $F$, respectively. We expressed the vector potentials\nin terms of modified Biot-Savart laws whose kernels are regularized at the axis\nin such a way that, when the axis is straight, these laws define a cylindrical\nforce-free flux rope with a parabolic profile for the axial current density.\nFor the cases we have studied so far, we determined the shape of the rope axis\nby following the polarity inversion line of the eruptions' source region, using\nobserved magnetograms. The height variation along the axis and other flux-rope\nparameters are estimated by means of potential field extrapolations. Using this\nheuristic approach, we were able to construct pre-eruption configurations for\nthe 2009 February 13 and 2011 October 1 CME events.

If the optimal control problems involve uncertainty, we need to use a\nfew random variables to parameterize the uncertainty. The stochastic optimal\ncontrol problems require solving coupled optimality system for a large number\nof samples in the stochastic space to quantify the statistics of the system\nresponse and explore the uncertainty quantification. Thus the computation is\nprohibitively expensive. To overcome the difficulty, model reduction is\nnecessary to significantly reduce the computation complexity. We exploit the\nadvantages from both reduced basis method and Generalized Multiscale Finite\nElement Method (GMsFEM) and develop the local-global model reduction method for\nstochastic optimal control problems with PDE constraints. This local-global\nmodel reduction can achieve much more computation efficiency than using only\nlocal model reduction approach and only global model reduction approach. We\nrecast the stochastic optimal problems in the framework of saddle-point\nproblems and analyze the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions of\nthe reduced model. In the local-global approach, most of computation steps are\nindependent of each other. This is very desirable for scientific computation.\nMoreover, the online computation for each random sample is very fast via the\nproposed model reduction method.

The goal is\nto pack (orthogonally) the given hypercubes into the minimum possible number of\nbins, in such a way that no two hypercubes in the same bin overlap.

We measure the solar radius at the\nsubterahertz frequencies of 0.212 and 0.405 THz -- i.e., the altitude where\nthese emissions are primarily generated -- and also analyse the radius\nvariation over the 11-year solar activity cycle.

Intriguing features are observed as the frequency $\\Omega$\napproaches resonance with the meson excitation energy $\\Omega_{\\rm meson}$.\nThere, the threshold minimizes and a condensate of vector mesons with\noscillating current exists even in the zero driving field limit. This state,\nwhich we call Floquet condensate of vector mesons, is expected to be\ndynamically stable realizing a non-thermal fixed point that breaks time\ntranslational and reversal symmetries. Our finding has many similarities with\nexciton BEC discussed in solid state systems, where the semiconductor is to be\nreplaced by materials hosting gapped Dirac electrons, e.g. 3D topological\ninsulators or bismuth. Vector meson Floquet condensate may also have\nimplications in the pre-thermalized dynamics in heavy ion collision\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 05:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

However, one\nrecent experiment about herbertsmithite with successful Li-doping shows\nsurprisingly the insulating state even under the heavy doped scenario, which\ncan hardly be explained by many-body physics.

We build on previous\nresearch from the field of robotic grasping to propose two new six-dimensional\nbounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible\nWrench Polytope (FWP). We define the AWP as the set of all the wrenches that a\nrobot can generate while considering its actuation limits. This considers the\nadmissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current\nconfiguration and actuation capabilities. The Contact Wrench Cone (CWC),\ninstead, includes features of the environment such as the contact normal or the\nfriction coefficient. The intersection of the AWP and of the CWC results in a\nconvex polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real\nrobot capabilities than existing simplified models, while maintaining the same\ncompact representation. We explain how to efficiently compute the\nvertex-description of the FWP that is then used to evaluate a feasibility\nfactor that we adapted from the field of robotic grasping. This allows us to\noptimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches.

Part of the\nsuccess of these methods comes from exploiting the freedom to choose the\ncontour, by appealing to Cauchy's theorem. However, the pseudospectra of\nnon-normal matrices or operators present a challenge for these methods: if the\ncontour is too close to regions where the norm of the resolvent matrix is\nlarge, then the accuracy suffers. Important applications that involve\nnon-normal matrices or operators include the Black--Scholes equation of\nfinance, and Fokker--Planck equations for stochastic models arising in biology.\nConsequently, it is crucial to choose the contour carefully.

This opens up the tantalizing possibility of\nrealizing stable string models whose low-energy limits directly resemble the\nStandard Model rather than one of its supersymmetric extensions. In this paper\nwe consider the general structure of such strings and find that they share two\nimportant phenomenological properties. The first is a so-called \"GUT-precursor\"\nstructure in which new GUT-like states appear with masses that can be many\norders of magnitude lighter than the scale of gauge coupling unification. These\nstates allow a parametrically large compactification volume, even in weakly\ncoupled heterotic strings, and in certain regions of parameter space can give\nrise to dramatic collider signatures which serve as \"smoking guns\" for this\noverall string framework. The second is a residual \"entwined-SUSY\" (or e-SUSY)\nstructure for the matter multiplets in which different multiplet components\ncarry different horizontal $U(1)$ charges. As a concrete example and existence\nproof of these features, we present a heterotic string model that contains the\nfundamental building blocks of the Standard Model such as the Standard-Model\ngauge group, complete chiral generations, and Higgs fields --- all without\nsupersymmetry. Even though massless gravitinos and gauginos are absent from the\nspectrum, we confirm that this model has an exponentially suppressed one-loop\ndilaton tadpole and displays both the GUT-precursor and e-SUSY structures. We\nalso discuss some general phenomenological properties of e-SUSY, such as\ncancellations in radiative corrections to scalar masses, the possible existence\nof a corresponding approximate moduli space, and the prevention of rapid proton\ndecay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 12:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Diverging\nlens behaviour produces deflections in the opposite sense to gravitational\nlensing, and is also of astrophysical interest. In fact, diverging lensing due\nto compact distributions of plasma has been proposed as an explanation for the\nextreme scattering events (ESEs) that produce frequency-dependent dimming of\nextra-galactic radio sources, and may also be related to the refractive\nradio-wave phenomena observed to affect the flux density of pulsars. In this\nwork we study the behaviour of two families of astrophysical diverging lenses\nin the geometric optics limit, the power-law and the exponential plasma lenses.\nGenerally, the members of these model families show distinct behaviour in terms\nof image formation and magnification, however the inclusion of a finite core\nfor certain power-law lenses can produce a caustic and critical curve\nmorphology that is similar to the well-studied Gaussian plasma lens. Both model\nfamilies can produce dual radial critical curves, a novel distinction from the\ntangential distortion usually produced by gravitational (converging) lenses.\nThe deflection angle and magnification of a plasma lens varies with the\nobservational frequency, producing wavelength-dependent magnifications that\nalter the amplitudes and the shape of the light curves. Thus, multi-wavelength\nobservations can be used to physically constrain the distribution of the\nelectron density in such lenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 12:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

In the limit of weak interactions between\nthe impurities and the BEC, we derive rigorous results for the effective\ninteraction. They show that it can be strong even for weak impurity-boson\ninteraction, if the transferred momentum/energy between the quasiparticles is\nresonant with a sound mode in the BEC. We then develop a diagrammatic scheme to\ncalculate the effective interaction for arbitrary coupling strengths, which\nrecovers the correct weak coupling results. Using this, we show that the Landau\neffective interaction in general is significantly stronger than that between\nquasiparticles in a Fermi gas, mainly because a BEC is more compressible than a\nFermi gas. The interaction is particularly large near the unitarity limit of\nthe impurity-boson scattering, or when the quasiparticle momentum is close to\nthe threshold for momentum relaxation in the BEC. Finally, we show how the\nLandau effective interaction leads to a sizeable shift of the quasiparticle\nenergy with increasing impurity concentration, which should be detectable with\npresent day experimental techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 13:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 06:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

One of the effects of twist is to modify the properties of\nthe eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions\nare characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement\nalong the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the\ndevelopment of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is\noscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced\neither by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of\nthe sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or\neither by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when\nthere is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the effect of twist is\nconsistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the\nprocess of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist\nalways delays the appearance of the shear instability but for tubes with thin\ninhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values of\ntwist. On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the effect of twist is\nmuch stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations\nof transverse kink modes and the KHI itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 14:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Due to the time-dependent solvent, the\nfrequency-dependent response function of the dipole becomes time-dependent. For\na shrinking Onsager sphere, the dipole relaxation is in general enhanced. This\nis reflected in a temporally increasing line width of the absorptive part of\nthe response. Furthermore, the effective frequency-dependent response function\nshows two peaks in the absorptive part which are symmetrically shifted around\nthe eigenfrequency. In contrast, a breathing sphere reduces damping as compared\nto the static sphere. Interestingly, we find a non-monotonous dependence of the\nrelaxation rate on the breathing rate and a resonant suppression of damping\nwhen both rates are comparable. Moreover, the line width of the absorptive part\nof the response function is strongly reduced for times when the breathing\nsphere reaches its maximal extension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 15:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 14:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Role discovery is the task of\nuncovering hidden roles. Node roles are commonly defined in terms of\nequivalence classes, where two nodes have the same role if they fall within the\nsame equivalence class. Automorphic equivalence, where two nodes are equivalent\nwhen they can swap their labels to form an isomorphic graph, captures this\ncommon notion of role. The binary concept of equivalence is too restrictive and\nnodes in real-world networks rarely belong to the same equivalence class.\nInstead, a relaxed definition in terms of similarity or distance is commonly\nused to compute the degree to which two nodes are equivalent. In this paper, we\npropose a novel distance metric called automorphic distance, which measures how\nfar two nodes are of being automorphically equivalent. We also study its\napplication to node embedding, showing how our metric can be used to generate\nvector representations of nodes preserving their roles for data visualization\nand machine learning.

The Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 is an interesting\ntarget for (sub)millimeter observations due to, both, the rich chemistry toward\nthe two main components of the binary and its complex morphology.

This paper employs the newly updated HZETRN2015 code to\nmodel the Martian atmospheric shielding effect on the accumulated dose rates\nand the change of this effect under different solar modulation and atmospheric\nconditions. The modeled results are compared with the most up-to-date (from 14\nAugust 2012 to 29 June 2016) observations of the RAD instrument on the surface\nof Mars. Both model and measurements agree reasonably well and show the\natmospheric shielding effect under weak solar modulation conditions and the\ndecline of this effect as solar modulation becomes stronger. This result is\nimportant for better risk estimations of future human explorations to Mars\nunder different heliospheric and Martian atmospheric conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 15:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Given a two-dimensional domain\nwhose boundary is a closed polygonal line with internal boundaries defined also\nby polygonal lines, it is required to generate a grid consisting only of\nquadrilaterals with the following features: (1) conformal, that is, to be a\ntessellation of the two-dimensional domain such that the intersection of any\ntwo quadrilaterals is a vertex, an edge or empty (never a portion of one edge),\n(2) structured, which means that only four quadrilaterals meet at a single node\nand the quadrilaterals that make up the grid need not to be rectangular, and\n(3) the mesh generated must be supported on the internal boundaries. The\nfundamental technique for generating such grids, is the deformation of an\ninitial Cartesian grid and the subsequent alignment with the internal\nboundaries. This is accomplished through the numerical solution of an elliptic\npartial differential equation based on finite differences. The large nonlinear\nsystem of equation arising from this formulation is solved through spectral\ngradient techniques.

We show that although they do not\nfollow a conventional (i.e. size-based) preferential attachment (PA) model,\ntheir dynamical evolution can be explained by a new variant that we introduce\nhere, which we refer to as active attraction model (AA).

The AA model captures both group-specific and\nmacroscopic observations over all size ranges -- as opposed to just the tail\nfor large groups or groups' initial growth -- suggesting that heterogeneity and\nlocality play a crucial role in the dynamics of online extremist support. We\nderive approximate expressions for the group size distributions in two simple\nsystems that involve simultaneously the mechanisms of group joining (governed\nby either PA or AA), group leaving, and account banning, and show how these\nprocesses influence the group size distributions.

The standard cure is to\nregularize by adding artificial diffusion. Besides introducing ad-hoc\nsmoothing, this has a significant negative impact on either computational cost\nor complexity and parallel scalings. We describe a new numerical algorithm for\nCR transport, with close parallels to two moment methods for radiative transfer\nunder the reduced speed of light approximation. It stably and robustly handles\nCR streaming without any artificial diffusion. It allows for both isotropic and\nfield-aligned CR streaming and diffusion, with arbitrary streaming and\ndiffusion coefficients. CR transport is handled explicitly, while source terms\nare handled implicitly. The overall time-step scales linearly with resolution\n(even when computing CR diffusion), and has a perfect parallel scaling. It is\ngiven by the standard Courant condition with respect to a constant maximum\nvelocity over the entire simulation domain. The computational cost is\ncomparable to that of solving the ideal MHD equation.

Yet\nthe physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein\nsuggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses,\nwhich drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting\nstructures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the\nreasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By\nreconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests\nthat both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The\nmodel is a modified $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that\ncontinuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and\ncan flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic\nuniverse with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing\ncompatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological\nmeasurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative\nmass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms\nhaloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are\nnot cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the\nobserved distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The\nmodel makes several testable predictions and seems to have the potential to be\nconsistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic\nmicrowave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that\nnegative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or\nalternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some\nlimit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the\nsurprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have\nbeen due to a simple sign error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 11:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

This is resolved by three kissing cap-circles of rightness being\nrealized on the shape sphere; integrating up the interiors of these caps\nreadily yields the answer to be 3/4. We now generalize this approach by viewing\nrightness as a particular value of maximal angle, and then covering the shape\nsphere with the maximal angle flow. Therein, we discover that the kissing\ncap-circles of rightness constitute a separatrix. The two qualitatively\ndifferent regimes of behaviour thus separated both moreover carry distinct\nanalytic pathologies: cusps versus excluded limit points. The equilateral\ntriangles are centres in this flow, whereas the kissing points themselves --\nbinary collision shapes -- are more interesting and elaborate critical points.\nThe other curves' formulae and associated area integrals are more complicated,\nand yet remain evaluable. As a particular example, we evaluate the probability\nthat a triangle is Fermat-acute, meaning that its Fermat point is nontrivially\nlocated; the critical maximal angle in this case is 120 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 23:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

Because of the tonotopic organization of the\ncochlea, high frequency emissions return earlier than low frequencies; however,\ndue to the random nature of coherent reflection, the instantaneous frequency\n(IF) and amplitude envelope of TEOAEs both fluctuate. Multiple reflection\ncomponents and synchronized spontaneous emissions can further make it difficult\nto extract the IF by linear transforms. In this paper, we propose to model\nTEOAEs as a sum of {\\em intrinsic mode-type functions} and analyze it by a\n{nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis} technique called concentration of\nfrequency and time (ConceFT). When tested with synthetic OAE signals {with\npossibly multiple oscillatory components}, the present method is able to\nproduce clearly visualized traces of individual components on the\ntime-frequency plane. Further, when the signal is noisy, the proposed method is\ncompared with existing linear and bilinear methods in its accuracy for\nestimating the fluctuating IF. Results suggest that ConceFT outperforms the\nbest of these methods in terms of optimal transport distance, reducing the\nerror by 10 to {21\\%} when the signal to noise ratio is 10 dB or below.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 12:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 10:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}
