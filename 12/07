At scales above the ion Larmor radius,\nthe theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic\nreduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015).

The\neffects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of\nAlfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to\nthe spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven\nwaves transition into kinetic Alfven waves.

We show that non-Maxwellian features in\nthe distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency\nof magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy\namongst the cascade channels. Thirdly, a simple model is used to show that\npressure anisotropy can cause large variations in the ion-to-electron heating\nratio due to the dissipation of Alfvenic turbulence. Our theory provides a\nfoundation for determining how pressure anisotropy affects the turbulent\nfluctuation spectra, the differential heating of particle species, and the\nratio of parallel and perpendicular phase mixing in space and astrophysical\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 16:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 04:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Experiments using unpolarized\nbeams and Rosenbluth separation to determine the form factors have found values\nof the ratio approximately consistent with unity over a wide range of $Q^2$,\nwhile polarization transfer experiments suggest that the ratio decreases as a\nfunction of $Q^2$. The most widely-accepted hypothesis to explain this\ndiscrepancy is that hard two-photon exchange (TPE) significantly contributes to\nthe elastic $ep$ cross section. Hard TPE has been neglected in previous\nanalyses of electron-proton scattering scattering experiments, in part due to\nthe fact that there exists no model independent way to calculate the\ncontribution.

By studying a collection of transcription factor binding sites of\nEscherichia coli from the RegulonDB database and of Bacillus subtilis from\nDBTBS, we reveal a funnel in the binding energy landscape around the target\nsequences.

One such technique, multidimensional diffusion MRI, has been\nrecently proposed to afford model-free decomposition of diffusion signal\nkurtosis into terms originating from either ensemble variance of isotropic\ndiffusivity or microscopic diffusion anisotropy. This ability rests on the\nassumption that diffusion can be described as a sum of multiple Gaussian\ncompartments, but this is often not strictly fulfilled. The effects of\nnongaussian diffusion on single shot isotropic diffusion sequences were first\nconsidered in detail by de Swiet and Mitra in 1996. They showed theoretically\nthat anisotropic compartments lead to anisotropic time dependence of the\ndiffusion tensors, which causes the measured isotropic diffusivity to depend on\ngradient frame orientation. Here we show how such deviations from the multiple\nGaussian compartments assumption conflates orientation dispersion with ensemble\nvariance in isotropic diffusivity. Second, we consider additional contributions\nto the apparent variance in isotropic diffusivity arising due to\nintracompartmental kurtosis. These will likewise depend on gradient frame\norientation. We illustrate the potential importance of these confounds with\nanalytical expressions, numerical simulations in simple model geometries, and\nmicroimaging experiments in fixed spinal cord using isotropic diffusion\nencoding waveforms with 7.5 ms duration and 3000 mT/m maximum amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 17:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 16:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The goal is\nto train the global pair with the corresponding ensemble opponent for improved\nperformances in terms of mode coverage. This approach aims at increasing the\nchances that learning will not stop for the global pair, preventing both to be\ntrapped in an unsatisfactory local minimum, or to face oscillations often\nobserved in practice. To guarantee the latter, the global pair never affects\nthe local ones.\n  The rules of SGAN training are thus as follows: the global generator and\ndiscriminator are trained using the local discriminators and generators,\nrespectively, whereas the local networks are trained with their fixed local\nopponent.\n  Experimental results on both toy and real-world problems demonstrate that\nthis approach outperforms standard training in terms of better mitigating mode\ncollapse, stability while converging and that it surprisingly, increases the\nconvergence speed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 18:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

We consider a recent proposal\nfor an analog condensed matter experiment to simulate the relativistic quantum\ndecay of the false vacuum. In the proposed experiment, two ultra-cold\ncondensates are coupled via a time-varying radio-frequency field. The relative\nphase of the two condensates in this system is approximately described by a\nrelativistic scalar field with a potential possessing a series of false and\ntrue vacuum local minima. If the system is set up in a false vacuum, it would\nthen decay to a true vacuum via quantum mechanical tunnelling. Should such an\nexperiment be realized, it would be possible to answer a number of open\nquestions regarding non-perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory and\nearly Universe cosmology. In this paper, we illustrate a possible obstruction:\nthe time-varying coupling that is invoked to create a false vacuum for the\nlong-wavelength modes of the condensate leads to a destabilization of shorter\nwavelength modes within the system via parametric resonance. We focus on an\nidealized setup in which the two condensates have identical properties and\nidentical background densities. Describing the system by the coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE), we use the machinery of Floquet theory to\nperform a linear stability analysis, calculating the wavenumber associated with\nthe first instability band for a variety of experimental parameters. However,\nwe demonstrate that, by tuning the frequency of the time-varying coupling, it\nmay be possible to push the first instability band outside the validity of the\nGPE, where dissipative effects are expected to damp any instabilities. This\nprovides a viable range of experimental parameters to perform analog\nexperiments of false vacuum decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We find that the high-[Mg/Fe]\nchemical sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval\nwith the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. The high-[Mg/Fe]\nstellar populations are only vertically extended for the oldest, most-metal\npoor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing vertical velocity dispersion for\nboth sequences, the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower velocity dispersion than\nthe low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age.

The applicability of the\ncanonical suite of relativistically broadened emission line models (developed\nfor black holes) to discs around neutron stars is evaluated. These models were\nfound to describe well emission lines from neutron star accretion discs unless\nthe neutron star radius is larger than the innermost stable orbit of the\naccretion disc at 6rg or the disc is viewed at high inclination, above 60deg\nwhere shadowing of the back side of the disc becomes important. Theoretical\nemissivity profiles were computed for accretion discs illuminated by hotspots\non the neutron star surfaces, bands of emission and emission by the entirety of\nthe hot, spherical star surface and in all cases, the emissivity profile of the\naccretion disc was found to be well represented by a single power law falling\noff slightly steeper than r^-3. Steepening of the emissivity index was found\nwhere the emission is close to the disc plane and the disc can appear truncated\nwhen illuminated by a hotspot at high latitude. The emissivity profile of the\naccretion disc in Serpens X-1 was measured and found to be consistent with a\nsingle unbroken power law with index q=3.5 (-0.4,+0.3), suggestive of\nillumination by the boundary layer between the disc and neutron star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Despite a\nvery short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily\ndetects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in\neach. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral\nresolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is\ndominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe\nemission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMC\ninterstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a\nweakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates\n(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these\nejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K\nvelocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM\nmaterial. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the\nHe-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the\nouter shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of\ncounts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in\nextended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very\nlow SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such\nresults are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar\ninstruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging\nobservations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi\nand will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy\nRecovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

When\nthese groups are given as a part of the input, we describe an algorithm to\nutilize this information to perform a low-cost localization. In emergency\nsituations such as fire, earthquake etc. inside a building, wireless sensor\nnetworks might be very crucial to provide critical information and help the\nrescue teams to move very quickly by decreasing their burden of exploring the\nenvironment. Thus, it is very important to develop a system that provides\ninformation quickly and without consuming too much energy. We observe that in\nthese type of environments, sensor nodes tend to form hyperplanar groups. A\nhyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than its ambient space, and\naccordingly, a hyperplanar group of sensor nodes is a group of nodes that sit\non the same hyperplane. When we consider a floor of a building, the nodes can\nbe deployed on the corridors to form collinear groups, and when we consider the\nwhole building, the sensor nodes will sit on the floors to form coplanar\ngroups.

Improving\nthe performance of communication system brings with various benefits to human\nbeings. This report covers two typical such systems: wireless sensor networks\nand cellular networks. We study the influence of mobility in these networks. In\nwireless sensor networks, we consider the usage of mobile sinks to collect\nsensory data from static nodes. For the latter case, we design data collection\nprotocols for a single mobile sink which aim at balancing the energy\nconsumption among sensor nodes to improve the network lifetime. We also design\nan algorithm for multiple mobile sinks to collect urgent sensory information\nwithin the allowed latency. Regarding the mobility in cellular networks, we\nmean the service providers are mobile. Conventional approaches usually consider\nhow to optimally deploy static base stations according to a certain metric,\nsuch as throughput. Base station densification is a solution, but it is not\ncost efficient. Introducing mobility is to let the base stations fly in the\nsky, resulting in less investment. We consider one of the key issues of using\ndrones to serve cellular users: drone deployment. We have implemented all the\nproposed algorithms by either simulations or experiments, and the results have\nconfirmed the effectiveness of these approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 23:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

Habitual control is computationally efficient but may be\ninflexible in changing environments. Conversely, deliberate planning may be\ncomputationally expensive, but flexible in dynamic environments.

The AKARI performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18,\n65, 90, 140, and 160 $\\mu$m) with 3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS,\ncovering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission.\nCombined with a better spatial resolution, we measure the total infrared\nluminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared\nluminosity density of the local Universe much more precisely than previous\nwork. In the AKARI NEP wide field, AKARI has obtained deep images in the\nmid-infrared (IR), covering 5.4 deg$^2$. However, our previous work was limited\nto the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of deep optical coverage.\nTo rectify the situation, we used the newly advent Subaru telescope's Hyper\nSuprime-Cam to obtain deep optical images over the entire 5.4 deg$^2$ of the\nAKARI NEP wide field.\n  With this deep and wide optical data, we, for the first time, can use the\nentire AKARI NEP wide data to construct restframe 8$\\mu$m, 12$\\mu$m, and total\ninfrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2.

In contrast to the popular Q-learning and\nactor-critic methods that are based on successive approximations to the\nnonlinear Bellman equation, our method makes primal-dual updates to the policy\nand value functions utilizing the fundamental linear Bellman duality. Naive\nparametrization of the primal-dual $\\pi$ learning method using deep neural\nnetworks would encounter two major challenges: (1) each update requires\ncomputing a probability distribution over the state space and is intractable;\n(2) the iterates are unstable since the parameterized Lagrangian function is no\nlonger linear. We address these challenges by proposing a relaxed Lagrangian\nformulation with a regularization penalty using the advantage function. We show\nthat the dual policy update step in our method is equivalent to the policy\ngradient update in the actor-critic method in some special case, while the\nvalue updates differ substantially. The main advantage of the primal-dual $\\pi$\nlearning method lies in that the value and policy updates are closely coupled\ntogether using the Bellman duality and therefore more informative. Experiments\non a simple cart-pole problem show that the algorithm significantly outperforms\nthe one-step temporal-difference actor-critic method, which is the most\nrelevant benchmark method to compare with.

The reliable robots need to\ngather, i.e., arrive to a configuration in which at the same time, all of them\noccupy the same point on the plane. The robots are equipped with GPS devices\nand at the beginning of the gathering process they communicate the Cartesian\ncoordinates of their respective positions to the central authority. On the\nbasis of this information, without the knowledge of which robots are faulty,\nthe central authority designs a trajectory for every robot. The central\nauthority aims to provide the trajectories which result in the shortest\npossible gathering time of the healthy robots. The efficiency of a gathering\nstrategy is measured by its competitive ratio, i.e., the maximal ratio between\nthe time required for gathering achieved by the given trajectories and the\noptimal time required for gathering in the offline case, i.e., when the faulty\nrobots are known to the central authority in advance. The role of the byzantine\nrobots, controlled by the adversary, is to act so that the gathering is delayed\nand the resulting competitive ratio is maximized.\n  The objective of our paper is to propose efficient algorithms when the\ncentral authority is aware of an upper bound on the number of byzantine robots.\nWe give optimal algorithms for collections of robots known to contain at most\none faulty robot. When the proportion of byzantine robots is known to be less\nthan one half or one third, we provide algorithms with small constant\ncompetitive ratios.

In this paper, we present a multi-task perspective, which is not\nembraced by any existing work, to jointly learn both detection and removal in\nan end-to-end fashion that aims at enjoying the mutually improved benefits from\neach other. Our framework is based on a novel STacked Conditional Generative\nAdversarial Network (ST-CGAN), which is composed of two stacked CGANs, each\nwith a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, a shadow image is fed into\nthe first generator which produces a shadow detection mask. That shadow image,\nconcatenated with its predicted mask, goes through the second generator in\norder to recover its shadow-free image consequently. In addition, the two\ncorresponding discriminators are very likely to model higher level\nrelationships and global scene characteristics for the detected shadow region\nand reconstruction via removing shadows, respectively. More importantly, for\nmulti-task learning, our design of stacked paradigm provides a novel view which\nis notably different from the commonly used one as the multi-branch version. To\nfully evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we construct the\nfirst large-scale benchmark with 1870 image triplets (shadow image, shadow mask\nimage, and shadow-free image) under 135 scenes.

As for bound\nstate, a common feature is the localization of single excitation, which means\nthe spontaneous emission of excitation into reservoir is prohibited.\nExceptionally the pseudo-bound state can always be found, for which the single\nexcitation has a finite probability emitted into reservoir. We argue that under\nlimit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ the pseudo-bound bound state characterizes an\nequilibrium between the localization in spin chain and spontaneous emission\ninto reservoir. In addition, a critical energy scale for bound states is also\nidentified, below which only one bound state exists and it also is pseudo-bound\nstate.

A striking observation\nis that the excitation can be stayed at its initial location with a probability\nmore than 0.9 when the bound state and disorder coexist.

The stability is\nstudied by dint of the variational approximation and systematic simulations.\nFor solitons in the semi-infinite gap, well-defined stability patterns are\nproduced under the action of the attractive nonlinearity, clearly exhibiting\nthe presence of resonance frequencies. The analysis is reported for several\ntime-modulation formats, including the case of in-phase modulations of both\nquasi-1D sublattices, which build the 2D square-shaped OL, and setups with\nasynchronous modulation of the sublattices. In particular, when the modulations\nof two sublattices are phase-shifted by {\\delta}={\\pi}/2, the stability map is\nnot improved, as the originally well-structured stability pattern becomes fuzzy\nand the stability at high modulation frequencies is considerably reduced. Mixed\nresults are obtained for anti-phase modulations of the sublattices\n({\\delta}={\\pi}), where extended stability regions are found for low modulation\nfrequencies, but for high frequencies the stability is weakened. The analysis\nis also performed in the case of the repulsive nonlinearity, for solitons in\nthe first finite bandgap. It is concluded that, even though stability regions\nmay be found, distinct stability boundaries for the gap solitons cannot be\nidentified clearly.

While it can\ngreatly increase the scope and benefits of the current security surveillance\nsystems, performing such a task using thermal images is a challenging problem\ncompared to face recognition task in the Visible Light Domain (VLD). This is\npartly due to the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected\ncompared to the VLD data. Unfortunately, direct application of the existing\nvery strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into the thermal\nimagery data will not produce a satisfactory performance. This is due to the\nexistence of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we\npropose a Thermal-to-Visible Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is\nable to transform thermal face images into their corresponding VLD images\nwhilst maintaining identity information which is sufficient enough for the\nexisting VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are\npresented in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an\nexplicit closed-set face recognition loss to regularize the discriminator\nnetwork training. This information will then be conveyed into the generator\nnetwork in the forms of gradient loss. In the experiment, we show that by using\nthis additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the\nTV-GAN is able to preserve more identity information when translating a thermal\nimage of a person which is not seen before by the TV-GAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 07:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

However, the\nproblems to solve are becoming larger and more complex, which translates to\nlarger CNNs, leading to longer training times that not even the adoption of\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) could keep up to. This problem is partially\nsolved by using more processing units and distributed training methods that are\noffered by several frameworks dedicated to neural network training. However,\nthese techniques do not take full advantage of the possible parallelization\noffered by CNNs and the cooperative use of heterogeneous devices with different\nprocessing capabilities, clock speeds, memory size, among others.

To bridge this gap, we propose a\nholistic approach to designing theory-based mobile health interventions built\non the existing theories and frameworks of three categories: (1) behavioral\ntheories (e.g., the Social Cognitive Theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior,\nand the Health Action Process Approach), (2) the technological models and\nframeworks (e.g., the Behavior Change Techniques, the Persuasive System Design\nand Behavior Change Support System, and the Just-in-Time Adaptive\nInterventions), and (3) the user-centered systematic approaches (e.g., the\nCeHRes Roadmap, the Wendel's Approach, and the IDEAS Model). This holistic\napproach provides researchers a lens to see the whole picture for developing\nmobile health interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 09:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

For continuous variables, available methodologies rely\nessentially on matrix masking and in particular on adding noise to the original\nvalues, using more or less refined procedures depending on the extent of\ninformation that one seeks to preserve. Almost all of these methods make use of\nthe critical assumption that the original datasets follow a normal distribution\nand/or that the noise has such a distribution. This assumption is, however,\nrestrictive in the sense that few variables follow empirically a Gaussian\npattern: the distribution of household income, for example, is positively\nskewed, and this skewness is essential information that has to be considered\nand preserved. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a simple\nmultiplicative masking method that preserves skewness of the original data\nwhile offering a sufficient level of disclosure risk control.

This assumption has never been tested, so that\nthe role of inelastic deformation on the growth dynamics of magma intrusions\nremains poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce the first analytical\nmodel of shallow sill and laccolith emplacement that accounts for\nelasto-plastic deformation of the host rock. It considers the intrusion's\noverburden as a thin elastic bending plate attached to an\nelastic-perfectly-plastic foundation. We find that, for geologically realistic\nvalues of the model parameters, the horizontal extent of the plastic zone lp is\nmuch smaller than the radius of the intrusion a.

Borrowing from several areas of other sciences, the current\ndiversity of concepts, models and tools available contributes to understanding\nand fostering individual data dissemination in a privacy-preserving way, as\nwell as unleashing new sources of information for the benefits of society at\nlarge. However, such diversity doesn't come without some difficulties.\nCurrently, the task of selecting the optimal analytical environment to conduct\nanonymization is complicated by the multitude of available choices. Based on\nrecent contributions from the literature and inspired by cryptography, this\npaper proposes the first cipher for data anonymization. The functioning of this\ncipher shows that, in fact, every anonymization method can be viewed as a\ngeneral form of rank swapping with unconstrained permutation structures. Beyond\nall the currently existing methods that it can mimic, this cipher offers a new\nway to practice data anonymization, notably by performing anonymization in an\nex ante way, instead of being engaged in several ex post evaluations and\niterations to reach the protection and information properties sought after.\nMoreover, the properties of this cipher point to some previously unknown\ngeneral insights into the task of data anonymization considered at a general\nlevel of functioning. Finally, and to make the cipher operational, this paper\nproposes the introduction of permutation menus in data anonymization, where\nrecently developed universal measures of disclosure risk and information loss\nare used ex ante for the calibration of permutation keys. To justify the\nrelevance of their uses, a theoretical characterization of these measures is\nalso proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 10:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

We find that the effect of irradiation on superconducting\nproperties is generally small as compared to the case of other iron-based\nsuperconductors. Such effect is more evident on the critical current density\nJc, while it is minor on the transition temperature Tc, on the normal state\nresistivity and on the upper critical field Hc2 up to the highest fluences\nexplored in this work. In addition, our analysis shows that when protons\nimplant in the substrate far from the superconducting film, the critical\ncurrent can be enhanced up to 50% of the pristine value at 7 T and 12 K, while\nthere is no appreciable effect on critical temperature and critical fields\ntogether with a slight decrease in resistivity.

The difficulty in solving numerically a DAE is measured by\nits differentiation index. For highly accurate simulation of dynamical systems,\nit is important to convert high-index DAEs into low-index DAEs. Most of\nexisting simulation software packages for dynamical systems are equipped with\nan index-reduction algorithm given by Mattsson and S\\\"{o}derlind.\nUnfortunately, this algorithm fails if there are numerical cancellations.\n  These numerical cancellations are often caused by accurate constants in\nstructural equations.

We focus on the often-discussed\nsituation of a dot with finite biexciton binding energy in a cavity tuned to\nthe two-photon resonance. Apart from the time-dependent concurrence, which can\nbe assigned to the two-photon density matrix at any point in time, we study\nsingle- and double-time integrated concurrences commonly used in the literature\nthat are based on different quantum state reconstruction schemes. We argue that\nthe single-time integrated concurrence can be thought of as the concurrence of\nphotons simultaneously emitted from the cavity without resolving the common\nemission time, while the more widely studied double-time integrated concurrence\nrefers to photons that are neither filtered with respect to the emission time\nof the first photon nor with respect to the delay time between the two emitted\nphotons. Analytic and numerical calculations reveal that the single-time\nintegrated concurrence indeed agrees well with the typical value of the\ntime-dependent concurrence at long times, even in the presence of phonons.\nThus, the more easily measurable single-time integrated concurrence gives\naccess to the physical information represented by the time-dependent\nconcurrence. However, the double-time integrated concurrence shows a different\nbehavior with respect to changes in the exciton fine structure splitting and\neven displays a completely different trend when the ratio between the cavity\nloss rate and the fine structure splitting is varied while keeping their\nproduct constant. This implies the non-equivalence of the physical information\ncontained in the time-dependent and single-time integrated concurrence on the\none hand and the double-time integrated concurrence on the other hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 12:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 15:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

We define the\nneuron linkage in terms of two constraints: first, all neuron activations in\nthe linkage must have the same operating point. That is to say, all of them\nshare input weights. Secondly, a set of neurons is linked if and only if there\nis at least one member of the linkage that has a non-zero gradient in regard to\nthe input of the activation function. This means that for any input in the\nactivation function, there is at least one member of the linkage that operates\nin a non-flat and non-zero area. This simple change has profound implications\nin the network learning dynamics. In this article we explore the consequences\nof this proposal and show that by using this kind of units, internal covariate\nshift is implicitly solved. As a result of this, the use of linked neurons\nallows to train arbitrarily large networks without any architectural or\nalgorithmic trick, effectively removing the need of using re-normalization\nschemes such as Batch Normalization, which leads to halving the required\ntraining time. It also solves the problem of the need for standarized input\ndata. Results show that the units using the linkage not only do effectively\nsolve the aforementioned problems, but are also a competitive alternative with\nrespect to state-of-the-art with very promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 13:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

In this work, we aim at generating\nsuch images based on a novel, two-stage reconstruction pipeline that learns a\ndisentangled representation of the aforementioned image factors and generates\nnovel person images at the same time. First, a multi-branched reconstruction\nnetwork is proposed to disentangle and encode the three factors into embedding\nfeatures, which are then combined to re-compose the input image itself. Second,\nthree corresponding mapping functions are learned in an adversarial manner in\norder to map Gaussian noise to the learned embedding feature space, for each\nfactor respectively. Using the proposed framework, we can manipulate the\nforeground, background and pose of the input image, and also sample new\nembedding features to generate such targeted manipulations, that provide more\ncontrol over the generation process.

For single particle systems with fully chaotic classical\ncounterparts, the problem has been partly solved by Berry (1985) within the\nso-called diagonal approximation of semiclassical periodic-orbit sums.\nDerivation of the full RMT spectral form factor $K(t)$ from semiclassics has\nbeen completed only much later in a tour de force by Mueller et al (2004). In\nrecent years, the questions of long-time dynamics at high energies, for which\nthe full many-body energy spectrum becomes relevant, are coming at the\nforefront even for simple many-body quantum systems, such as locally\ninteracting spin chains. Such systems display two universal types of behaviour\nwhich are termed as `many-body localized phase' and `ergodic phase'. In the\nergodic phase, the spectral fluctuations are excellently described by RMT, even\nfor very simple interactions and in the absence of any external source of\ndisorder. Here we provide the first theoretical explanation for these\nobservations. We compute $K(t)$ explicitly in the leading two orders in $t$ and\nshow its agreement with RMT for non-integrable, time-reversal invariant\nmany-body systems without classical counterparts, a generic example of which\nare Ising spin 1/2 models in a periodically kicking transverse field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 15:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 18:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 17:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

However, the number\nof illuminating events as well as their ages and durations are still unresolved\nquestions. We aim to reconstruct parts of the history of Sgr A* by studying\nthis reflection phenomenon in the molecular complex Sgr C and by determining\nthe line-of-sight positions of its main bright substructures. Using\nobservations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2000 and 2014, we\ninvestigated the variability of the reflected emission. We carried out an\nimaging and a spectral analysis. We also used a Monte Carlo model of the\nreflected spectra to constrain the line-of-sight positions of the brightest\nclumps, and hence to assign an approximate date to the associated illuminating\nevents. We show that the emission from Sgr C exhibits significant variability\nin both space and time, which confirms its reflection origin. The most likely\nilluminating source is Sgr A*. We report two distinct variability timescales,\nas one clump undergoes a sudden rise and fall in about 2005, while two others\nvary smoothly throughout the whole 2000-2014 period. By fitting the Monte Carlo\nmodel to the data, we are able to place tight constraints on the 3D positions\nof the clumps. These two independent approaches provide a consistent picture of\nthe past activity of Sgr A*, since the two slowly varying clumps are located on\nthe same wavefront, while the rapidly varying clump corresponds to a different\nwavefront, that is, to a different illuminating event. We show that Sgr A*\nexperienced at least two powerful outbursts in the past 300 years, and for the\nfirst time, we provide an estimation of their age. Extending this approach to\nother molecular complexes will allow this scenario to be tested further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 15:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

In crystals doped with\nKramers rare-earth ions, such as erbium and neodymium, efficient optical\npumping is challenging due to the relatively short population lifetimes of the\nelectronic Zeeman levels, of the order of 100 ms at around 4 K. In this article\nwe show that optical pumping of the hyperfine levels in isotopically enriched\n$^{145}$Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals is more efficient, owing to the longer\npopulation relaxation times of hyperfine levels. By optically cycling the\npopulation many times through the excited state a nuclear-spin flip can be\nforced in the ground-state hyperfine manifold, in which case the population is\ntrapped for several seconds before relaxing back to the pumped hyperfine level.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in applications we perform an\natomic frequency comb memory experiment with 33% storage efficiency in\n$^{145}$Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$, which is on a par with results obtained in\nnon-Kramers ions, e.g. europium and praseodymium, where optical pumping is\ngenerally efficient due to the quenched electronic spin.

Three different decimation\nprocedures were implemented and their consequences on the discrete correlation\nfunctions and the coarseness are reported and analyzed. A normalization for\neach of the correlation functions has been performed. When the loss of\nstatistical information has not been significant for a decimated image, its\nnormalized correlation function is forecast by the trend of the original image.\nIn contrast, when the decimated image does not represent the statistical\nevidence of the original one, the normalized correlation function diverts from\nthe reference function. Moreover, the equally weighted sum of the average of\nthe squared differences leads to a definition of an overall error. During the\nfirst stages of the gradual decimation, the error remains relatively small and\nindependent of the decimation procedure. Above a threshold defined by the\ncorrelation length of the reference function, the error becomes a function of\nthe number of decimation steps. At this stage, some statistical information is\nlost and the error becomes dependent of the decimation procedure. These results\nmay help us to restrict the amount of information that one can afford to lose\nduring a decimation process, in order to reduce the computational and memory\ncost, when one aims to diminish the time consumed by a characterization or\nreconstruction technique, yet maintaining the statistical quality of the\ndigitized sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 03:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

We calculated the\ncondensate and the mass to the order $q-1$ with the normalized $q$-expectation\nvalue under the massless free particle approximation. The following facts were\nfound. The condensate $\\Phi$ divided by $v$, $\\Phi/v$, at $q$ is smaller than\nthat at $q'$ for $q>q'$ as a function of $T_{\\mathrm{ph}}/v$ which is the\nphysical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ divided by $v$, where $T_{\\mathrm{ph}}$\nat $q=1$ coincides with $T$ and $v$ is the value of the condensate at $T=0$.\nThe mass decreases, reaches minimum, and increases after that, as\n$T_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ increases. The mass at $q>1$ is lighter than the mass at\n$q=1$ at low physical temperature and heavier than the mass at $q=1$ at high\nphysical temperature. The effects of the nonentensivity on the physical\nquantity as a function of $T_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ become strong as $|q-1|$ increases.\nThe results indicate the significance of the definition of the expectation\nvalue, the definition of the physical temperature, and the constraints for the\ndensity operator, when the terms including the volume of the system are not\nnegligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 01:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}
