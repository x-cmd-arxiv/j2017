In the considered model, the service time is minimized by\nminimizing the wireless transmission time as well as the control time that is\nneeded for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the\ntransmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the\ndrone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques,\nthe drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive,\nperturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the\ndrones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time\nfor the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones,\nthe drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so\nas to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor\ndrones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the\ndestinations of the drones and external forces (e.g., wind and gravity). In\nparticular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well\nas the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground\nusers compared to a fixed-array case in which the same number of drones form a\nfixed uniform antenna array. The results also show that, in comparison with the\nfixed-array case, the network's spectral efficiency can be improved by 32%\nwhile leveraging the drone antenna array system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 17:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 23:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

We illustrate this strategy with off-the-shelf LDPC codes. In the\nfirst stage of decoding, the receiver first recovers a linear combination of\nthe transmitted codewords using the sum-product algorithm (SPA).

We consider two essential ingredients of such a simulation: a\ngeneric extension of hydrodynamics by a_parametrically_ slow mode or modes\n(\"Hydro+\") and a description of fluctuations out of equilibrium. By combining\nthe two ingredients we are able to describe the bulk evolution and the\nfluctutations within the same framework. Critical slowing down means that\nequilibration of fluctuations could be as slow as hydrodynamic evolution and\nthus fluctuations could significantly deviate from equilibrium near the\ncritical point. We generalize hydrodynamics to partial-equilibrium conditions\nwhere the state of the system is characterized by the off-equilibrium magnitude\nof fluctuations in addition to the usual hydrodynamic variables -- conserved\ndensities. We find that the key element of the new formalism -- the extended\nentropy taking into account the off-equilibrium fluctuations -- is remarkably\nsimilar to the 2PI action in quantum field theory. We show how the new Hydro+\nformalism reproduces two major effects of critical fluctuations on the bulk\nevolution: the strong frequency dependence of the anomalously large bulk\nviscosity as well as the stiffening of the equation of state with increasing\nfrequency or wave-number. While the agreement with known results confirms its\nvalidity, the fact that Hydro+ achieves this within a local and deterministic\nframework gives it significant advantages for dynamical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Paraphrasing occur when texts are lexically or syntactically\naltered to look different, but retain their original meaning. Most plagiarism\ndetection systems (many of which are commercial based) are designed to detect\nword co-occurrences and light modifications, but are unable to detect severe\nsemantic and structural alterations such as what is seen in many academic\ndocuments. Hence many paraphrase plagiarism cases go undetected. In this paper,\nwe approached the problem of paraphrase plagiarism by proposing methods for\ndetecting the most common techniques (phenomena) used in paraphrasing texts\n(namely; lexical substitution, insertion/deletion and word and phrase\nreordering), and combined the methods into a paraphrase detection model. We\nevaluated our proposed methods and model on collections containing paraphrase\ntexts. Experimental results show significant improvement in performance when\nthe methods were combined (the proposed model) as opposed to running them\nindividually.

The scrambling of a generic\nfew-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a\n\"hydrodynamic cloud,\" and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a\nshift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields\ncorrelation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered\ncorrelation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads\nto chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting\nphenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and\nmomentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping\nphenomenon may be considered as a \"smoking gun\" for the hydrodynamic origin of\nthe chaotic mode.

While the shallow flow formulation is advantageous\nin terms of computational efficiency, it also comes at the price of losing\nvertical information such as the flow's velocity profile. This gives rise to a\nmodel error, which limits the shallow flow model's predictive power and is\noften not explicitly quantifiable.\n  We propose the use of vertical moments to overcome this problem. The shallow\nmoment approximation preserves information on the vertical flow structure while\nstill making use of the simplifying framework of depth-averaging. In this\narticle, we derive a generic shallow flow moment system of arbitrary order\nstarting from a set of balance laws, which has been reduced by scaling\narguments. The derivation is based on a fully vertically resolved reference\nmodel with the vertical coordinate mapped onto the unit interval. We specify\nthe shallow flow moment hierarchy for kinematic and Newtonian flow conditions\nand present 1D numerical results for shallow moment systems up to third order.\nFinally, we assess their performance with respect to both the standard shallow\nflow equations as well as with respect to the vertically resolved reference\nmodel.

Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary\nsynaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding\npuzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which\nsynaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired\noutput. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic\nprediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given\nthe bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal\nneurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory\npredictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory\nfeedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at\nbasal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning\ncapabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates\nthe classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this\ncortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus\ndenoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions\non the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is\nconsistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a\nbiological implementation of deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 00:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

The unique free parameter in our model,\na pivot value of $\\tau_\\alpha$, is calibrated so as to reproduce the $z=5.7$\nLy$\\alpha$ luminosity function (LF). We compare our model predictions with\nLy$\\alpha$ LFs at $z=6.6$ and $7.3$, LAE angular auto-correlation functions\n(ACFs) at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$, and LAE fractions in Lyman break galaxies at\n$5<z<7$. The Ly$\\alpha$ LFs and ACFs are reproduced by multiple models, but the\nLAE fraction turns out to be the most critical test. The dispersion of\n$\\tau_\\alpha$ and the halo mass dependence of $\\tau_\\alpha$ are essential to\nexplain all observations reasonably. Therefore, a simple model of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between halo mass and Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity with a constant\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fraction has been ruled out. Based on our best model, we\npresent a formula to estimate the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction,\n$x_{\\rm HI}$, from the observed Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density at $z\\gtrsim6$.\nWe finally obtain $x_{\\rm HI}=0.5_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$ as a volume-average at\n$z=7.3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 01:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 07:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Processor performance, when running the workload set, is\nprofiled using simulators that model the targeted processor architecture.\nHowever, simulating the entire workload set is prohibitively time-consuming,\nwhich precludes considering a large number of programs. To reduce simulation\ntime, several techniques in the literature have exploited the internal program\nrepetitiveness to extract and execute only representative code segments.\nExisting so- lutions are based on reducing cross-program computational\nredundancy or on eliminating internal-program redundancy to decrease execution\ntime. In this work, we propose an orthogonal and complementary loop- centric\nmethodology that targets loop-dominant programs by exploiting internal-program\ncharacteristics to reduce cross-program computational redundancy. The approach\nemploys a newly developed framework that extracts and analyzes core loops\nwithin workloads. The collected characteristics model memory behavior,\ncomputational complexity, and data structures of a program, and are used to\nconstruct a signature vector for each program. From these vectors,\ncross-workload similarity metrics are extracted, which are processed by a novel\nheuristic to exclude similar programs and reduce redundancy within the set.\nFinally, a reverse engineering approach that synthesizes executable\nmicro-benchmarks having the same instruction mix as the loops in the original\nworkload is introduced. A tool that automates the flow steps of the proposed\nmethodology is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed methodology to a set of workloads reduces the set size by half, while\npreserving the main characterizations of the initial workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 07:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-05"}

In this paper, we model a network platform where an\nIAP makes decisions on the peering types offered to CPs and the prices charged\nto CPs and end-users.

Our results\nshow that 1) the IAP should always offer the paid and settlement-free peering\nunder the profit-optimal and welfare-optimal schemes, respectively, 2) whether\nto simultaneously offer the other peering type is largely driven by the type of\ndata traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) regulators might want to encourage\nthe IAP to allocate more network capacity to the settlement-free peering for\nincreasing user welfare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 07:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

This two-stage procedure\nfirst performs a random partitioning to divide predictors into subsets of\nmanageable size of order $O(n^{2-\\delta})$ for variable screening, where\n$\\delta >0$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. Random partitioning is\nrepeated a few times. Next, the final estimate of variable subset is obtained\nby integrating results obtained from multiple random partitions. Simulation\nstudies show that our method works well and outperforms some renowned\ncompetitors. Real data applications are presented. Our algorithms are able to\nhandle predictors in the size of millions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 09:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 11:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

The major problem faced in such\nnetworks is the wireless backhaul link and its limited capacity. Caching most\npopular files in the memories of small cells base station (SBSs) is an\neffective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is\nchoosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this\npaper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided\ninto four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By\nmaking some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can\nbe colored. Coloring of the generated graph is NP-hard and we use an algorithm\nproposed in graph-coloring area to color it. To overcome the complexity of\nabove coloring technique, we then propose a simple graph-coloring method based\non two point processes, Matern Core-type I and II. We model our network with a\nnew weighted graph which simply can be colored and after that the files are\ncached accordingly. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through\nsimulations. Our results show that by employing out proposed method in a\ntypical considered SBSs network, the load on the macro base station can be\nreduced by around $25 \\%$, at the distribution parameter of popularity of files\nequals to $0.6$, compared to conventional policy which caches the most popular\ncontent every where.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 09:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Later on, a fruitful potential theoretic generalization was obtained by\nArsove and Leutwiler. Due to the work of Eriksson and Leutwiler, this notion\nalso turned out to be an effective tool by investigating the extreme structure\nof operator segments. This paper has multiple purposes which are interwoven,\nand are intended to be equally important. On the one hand, we identify\nquasi-units as orthogonal projections acting on an appropriate auxiliary\nHilbert space. As projections form a lattice and are extremal points of the\neffect algebra, we conclude the same properties for quasi-units. Our second aim\nis to apply these results for nonnegative sesquilinear forms. Constructing an\norder preserving bijection between operator- and form segments, we provide a\ncharacterization of being extremal in the convexity sense, and we give a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the greatest lower\nbound of two forms. Closing the paper we revisit some statements by using the\nmachinery developed by Hassi, Sebesty\\'en, and de Snoo. It will turn out that\nquasi-units are exactly the closed elements with respect to the antitone Galois\nconnection induced by parallel addition and subtraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 09:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Especially, online SDN multicast that supports IETF dynamic group\nmembership (i.e., any user can join or leave at any time) has not been\nexplored. Different from traditional shortest-path trees (SPT) and graph\ntheoretical Steiner trees (ST), which concentrate on routing one tree at any\ninstant, online SDN multicast traffic engineering is more challenging because\nit needs to support dynamic group membership and optimize a sequence of\ncorrelated trees without the knowledge of future join and leave, whereas the\nscalability of SDN due to limited TCAM is also crucial. In this paper,\ntherefore, we formulate a new optimization problem, named Online Branch-aware\nSteiner Tree (OBST), to jointly consider the bandwidth consumption, SDN\nmulticast scalability, and rerouting overhead. We prove that OBST is NP-hard\nand does not have a $|D_{max}|^{1-\\epsilon}$-competitive algorithm for any\n$\\epsilon >0$, where $|D_{max}|$ is the largest group size at any time. We\ndesign a $|D_{max}|$-competitive algorithm equipped with the notion of the\nbudget, the deposit, and Reference Tree to achieve the tightest bound.

For generic lattice models of interacting\nfermions, the best methodology at hand still scales with $\\beta N^3$ where\n$\\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $N$ is the system size. Such scaling\nbehavior has greatly hampered the accessibility of the universal infrared (IR)\nphysics of many interesting correlated electron models at (2+1)D, let alone\n(3+1)D. To reduce the computational complexity, we develop a new QMC method\nwith inhomogeneous momentum-space mesh, dubbed elective momentum ultra-size\nquantum Monte Carlo (EQMC) method. Instead of treating all fermionic\nexcitations on an equal footing as in conventional QMC methods, by converting\nthe fermion determinant into the momentum space, our method focuses on fermion\nmodes that are directly associated with low-energy (IR) physics in the vicinity\nof the so-called hot-spots, while other fermion modes irrelevant for universal\nproperties are ignored. As shown in the manuscript, for any cutoff-independent\nquantities, e.g. scaling exponents, this method can achieve the same level of\naccuracy with orders of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. We\ndemonstrate this method with a model of antiferromagnetic itinerant quantum\ncritical point, realized via coupling itinerant fermions with a frustrated\ntransverse-field Ising model on a triangle lattice. The system size of $48\n\\times 48 \\times 32$ ($L\\times L\\times\\beta$, almost 3 times of previous\ninvestigations) are comfortably accessed with EQMC.

In general, XTRG can reach low temperatures\nexponentially fast, and thus not only saves computational time but also merits\nbetter accuracy due to significantly fewer truncation steps. We work in an\n(effective) 1D setting exploiting matrix product operators (MPOs) which allows\nus to fully and uniquely implement non-Abelian and Abelian symmetries to\ngreatly enhance numerical performance. We use our XTRG machinery to explore the\nthermal properties of Heisenberg models on 1D chains and 2D square and\ntriangular lattices down to low temperatures approaching ground state\nproperties. The entanglement properties, as well as the renormalization group\nflow of entanglement spectra in MPOs, are discussed, where logarithmic\nentropies (approximately $\\ln\\beta$) are shown in both spin chains and square\nlattice models with gapless towers of states. We also reveal that XTRG can be\nemployed to accurately simulate the Heisenberg XXZ model on the square lattice\nwhich undergoes a thermal phase transition. We determine its critical\ntemperature based on thermal physical observables, as well as entanglement\nmeasures. Overall, we demonstrate that XTRG provides an elegant, versatile, and\nhighly competitive approach to explore thermal properties in both 1D and 2D\nquantum lattice models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 15:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 14:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}
