Such waves may be very weak in amplitude,\nsince the spin-down could take a long time, and a direct search may not be\nfeasible. We propose to search for the stochastic background associated with\nthe spin-down, and we relate the level of this background to the formation rate\nof spinning black holes from the merger of binary black holes, as well as the\nenergy spectrum of waves emitted by the spin-down process. We argue that\ncurrent LIGO-Virgo observations are not inconsistent with the existence of a\nspin-down process, as long as it is slow enough. On the other hand, the\nbackground may still exist as long as a moderate fraction of spin energy is\nemitted within Hubble time. This stochastic background could be one interesting\ntarget of next generation GW detector network, such as LIGO Voyager, and could\nbe extracted from total stochastic background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 16:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 05:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 14:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Associative arrays provide a\ncommon approach for the mathematics of polystores by encompassing the\nmathematics found in different databases: sets (SQL), graphs (NoSQL), and\nmatrices (NewSQL). Prior work presented the SQL relational model in terms of\nassociative arrays and identified key mathematical properties that are\npreserved within SQL. This work provides the rigorous mathematical definitions,\nlemmas, and theorems underlying these properties. Specifically, SQL Relational\nAlgebra deals primarily with relations - multisets of tuples - and operations\non and between these relations. These relations can be modeled as associative\narrays by treating tuples as non-zero rows in an array. Operations in\nrelational algebra are built as compositions of standard operations on\nassociative arrays which mirror their matrix counterparts. These constructions\nprovide insight into how relational algebra can be handled via array\noperations. As an example application, the composition of two projection\noperations is shown to also be a projection, and the projection of a union is\nshown to be equal to the union of the projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 17:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

In this work, several HSs are\nsystematically assessed via atomistic Monte Carlo simulation of folding of\nsmall proteins, by converting the HSs of interest into residue-residue contact\nenergy matrices.

They start with a few known\ndisease-associated proteins and aim to find the rest of the pathway by\nexploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the\nsuccess of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well\nunderstood. Here we study the PPI network structure of 519 disease pathways.

Typically, Ollivier\ncurvature has been investigated via random walks. We first extend the\ndefinition of Ollivier curvature to general weighted graphs and then give a\nstrikingly simple representation of Ollivier curvature using the graph\nLaplacian. Using the Laplacian as a generator of a continuous time Markov\nchain, we connect Ollivier curvature with the heat equation which is strongly\nrelated to continuous time random walks.

This is a discrete analogue to a celebrated\nRicci curvature lower bound characterization by Renesse and Sturm.

It is revealed that the lone pairs of electrons of\nTe atom participate in forming coordinate covalent bonds between neighboring\nchains. Therefore, each Te atom behaves as both electron donor to neighboring\nchains and electron acceptor from neighboring chains. This ligand-metal-like\nbonding nature in bulk Te results in the same order of bulk moduli along the\ndirections parallel and perpendicular to the chains, contrasting with the large\nanisotropy of bulk moduli in vdW crystals.

It is thus demonstrated that the normal/coordinate covalent bonds\nparallel/perpendicular to the chains in bulk Te lead to a minor anisotropy in\nstructural and transport properties, distinct from a strong anisotropy observed\nin the typical two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials such as graphite and MoS$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 03:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

It is of wide applications including\ndigital entertainment and law enforcement. Precisely depicting face\nphotos/sketches remains challenging due to the restrictions on structural\nrealism and textural consistency. While existing methods achieve compelling\nresults, they mostly yield blurred effects and great deformation over various\nfacial components, leading to the unrealistic feeling of synthesized images. To\ntackle this challenge, in this work, we propose to use the facial composition\ninformation to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Specially, we propose a\nnovel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face\nphoto-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs including a face\nphoto/sketch and the corresponding pixel-wise face labels for generating a\nsketch/photo. In addition, to focus training on hard-generated components and\ndelicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss.\nFinally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GAN) to further rectify defects and add\ncompelling details.

Sophisticated prefetchers predict next use cache line by repeating\nprogram's historical spatial and temporal memory access pattern. However, they\nare error prone and the mis-predictions lead to cache pollution and exert extra\npressure on memory subsystem. In this paper, a novel scheme of data cache\nprefetching with perceptron learning is proposed. The key idea is a two-level\nprefetching mechanism. A primary decision is made by utilizing previous\ntable-based prefetching mechanism, e.g. stride prefetching or Markov\nprefetching, and then, a neural network, perceptron is taken to detect and\ntrace program memory access patterns, to help reject those unnecessary\nprefetching decisions. The perceptron can learn from both local and global\nhistory in time and space, and can be easily implemented by hardware. This\nmechanism boost execution performance by ideally mitigating cache pollution and\neliminating redundant memory request issued by prefetcher. Detailed evaluation\nand analysis were conducted based on SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks. The simulation\nresults show that generally the proposed scheme yields a geometric mean of\n60.64%-83.84% decrease in prefetching memory requests without loss in\ninstruction per cycle(IPC)(floating between -2.22% and 2.55%) and cache hit\nrate(floating between -1.67% and 2.46%). Though it is possible that perceptron\nmay refuse useful blocks and thus cause minor raise in cache miss rate, lower\nmemory request count can decrease average memory access latency, which\ncompensate for the loss, and in the meantime, enhance overall performance in\nmulti-programmed workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 05:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The goal is to select a\nsubset of items with maximum profit and violate the capacity constraint with\nprobability at most $p$ (referred to as the overflow probability). While\nseveral approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem, most of\nthese algorithms relax the capacity constraint of the knapsack. In this paper,\nwe design efficient approximation schemes for this problem without relaxing the\ncapacity constraint.\n  (i) Our first result is in the case when item sizes are Bernoulli random\nvariables. In this case, we design a (nearly) fully polynomial time\napproximation scheme (FPTAS) which only relaxes the overflow probability.

In other words, the kurtosis of the random\nvariable is upper bounded by a constant.\n  Crucially, all of our algorithms meet the capacity constraint exactly, a\nresult which was previously known only when the item sizes were Poisson or\nGaussian random variables. Our results rely on new connections between Boolean\nfunction analysis and stochastic optimization.

However, a clear understanding of the population-level\nconsequences of co-infection is lacking. Here, we constructed a model that\nincludes three individual-level effects of co-infection: mortality, fecundity,\nand transmission. We used the model to investigate how these individual-level\nconsequences of co-infection scale up to produce population-level infection\npatterns. To parameterize this model, we conducted a four-year cohort study in\nAfrican buffalo to estimate the individual-level effects of co-infection with\ntwo bacterial pathogens, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and brucellosis, across a\nrange of demographic and environmental contexts. At the individual-level, our\nempirical results identified BTB as a risk factor for acquiring brucellosis,\nbut we found no association between brucellosis and the risk of acquiring BTB.\nBoth infections were associated with reductions in survival and neither\ninfection was associated with reductions in fecundity.

Therefore, these results provide a data-driven example of\ncompetition between co-infecting pathogens that occurs when one pathogen\nfacilitates secondary infections at the individual level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 06:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

To this end, we propose a joint infrastructure-to-vehicle\n(I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scheme based on batched sparse\n(BATS) coding to minimize the traffic overhead and reduce the total\ntransmission delay.

In order to realize this potential\nof faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple\nlevels of policies in parallel so these simpler subproblems can be solved\nsimultaneously. Yet, learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is hard\nbecause it is inherently unstable: changes in a policy at one level of the\nhierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher\nlevels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels\nof policies. In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement\nLearning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome\nthe instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple\nlevels of policies.

The ability to\nquantitatively assess this uncertainty in absence of the reference result is\nvital to the reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion\ndevices.In the present study, the Pareto-efficient combustion (PEC) framework\nis extended to adaptive LES combustion simulations of turbulent flames. The key\ncomponent of the PEC framework is the so-called manifold drift term. Its\nextension LES is proposed to make such assessment by examining the compliance\nof a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest with\nrespect to the underlying flow field representation. With the focus on\nimproving predictions of CO emissions of flamelet-based combustion models, this\nwork employs PEC to augment the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model through\nlocal sub-model assignment of the finite-rate chemistry (FRC) model. To this\nend, a series of LES-PEC calculations are performed on a piloted\npartially-premixed dimethyl ether flame (DME-D), using a combination of FPV and\nFRC models. The drift term is utilized in the PEC framework to the estimate the\nmodel related error for quantities of interest. The PEC approach is\ndemonstrated to be capable of significantly improving the prediction of CO\nemissions compared with the monolithic FPV simulation. The improved accuracy is\nachieved by enriching the FPV model with FRC in regions where the lower-order\nmodel is determined insufficient through the evaluation of drift terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 09:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The next step\nis the reconstruction of the mass composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays. One of the main problems appearing within this task is to estimate the\ndetection efficiency of the instrument, and the exposure of the observations.\nThe detection efficiency depends on properties of the primary cosmic rays, such\nas energy and arrival direction, as well as on many parameters of the\ninstrument: density of the array, efficiency of the receiving antennas,\nsignal-detection threshold, data-acquisition acceptance, and trigger\nproperties. More than that, the configuration of detector changes with time.\nDuring the measurements some parts of the detector can provide corrupted data\nor sometimes do not operate. All these features should be taken into account\nfor an estimation of the detection efficiency. For each energy and arrival\ndirection we estimate the detection probability and effective area of the\ninstrument.

In this paper, we propose a\ncorrelation constrained missing-data estimation based blind multichannel\nfrequency- domain least-mean-squares (md-bMCFLMS) algorithm to undo the effect\nof PSF on the ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data. In the first step, a\nblock-based MCFLMS (bMCFLMS) algorithm is proposed to estimate the TRFs and the\nPSF which are used in the second step to estimate the missing data. This\nmissing data is used in the md-bMCFLMS algorithm to construct a modified cost\nfunction for further improvement of the image resolution. To account for the\nnonstationarity of the PSF, unlike the blocking approach described in the\nliterature, we introduce a time-efficient blocking method in this paper. The\nblocking approach described here uses a block position independent fixed size\nmatrix and can be implemented parallely. The bMCFLMS algorithm, however, shows\nmisconvergence due to both channel noise and propagation of TRF estimation\nerror from the previous blocks. This phe- nomenon is more intense in the case\nof md-bMCFLMS algorithm because of increased estimation error. To address this\nproblem, a novel constraint based on the correlation between the measured RF\ndata and estimated TRF is proposed in this paper.

Knowing the exact shape of the UV luminosity function of\nhigh-redshift galaxies is important in order to understand the star formation\nhistory of the early universe. However, the uncertainties, especially at the\nfaint and bright ends of the LFs, are still significant.\n  Aims. In this paper, we study the UV luminosity function of redshift z = 2.5\n- 4.5 galaxies in 2.38 deg^2 of ALHAMBRA data with I <= 24. Thanks to the large\narea covered by ALHAMBRA, we particularly constrain the bright end of the\nluminosity function.

We use a novel methodology based on redshift and magnitude\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs). This methodology robustly takes into\naccount the uncertainties due to redshift and magnitude errors, shot noise and\ncosmic variance, and models the luminosity function in two dimensions (z; M_UV\n).\n  Results. We find an excess of bright ~ M*_UV galaxies as compared to the\nstudies based on broad-band photometric data.

However,\nit is a significant challenge for lock-free data structures. Automatic\ntechniques such as garbage collection are inefficient or use locks, and\nnon-automatic techniques either have high overhead, or do not work for many\ndata structures. For example, subtle problems can arise when hazard pointers,\none of the most common non-automatic techniques, are applied to many lock-free\ndata structures. Epoch based reclamation (EBR), which is by far the most\nefficient non-automatic technique, allows the number of unreclaimed objects to\ngrow without bound, because one crashed process can prevent all other processes\nfrom reclaiming memory.\n  We develop a more efficient, distributed variant of EBR that solves this\nproblem. It is based on signaling, which is provided by many operating systems,\nsuch as Linux and UNIX. Our new scheme takes $O(1)$ amortized steps per\nhigh-level operation on the data structure and $O(1)$ steps in the worst case\neach time an object is removed from the data structure. At any point, $O(mn^2)$\nobjects are waiting to be freed, where $n$ is the number of processes and $m$\nis a small constant for most data structures. Experiments show that our scheme\nhas very low overhead: on average 10\\%, and at worst 28\\%, for a balanced\nbinary search tree over many thread counts, operation mixes and contention\nlevels. Our scheme also outperforms a highly tuned implementation of hazard\npointers by an average of 75\\%.\n  Typically, memory reclamation is tightly woven into lock-free data structure\ncode. To improve modularity and facilitate the comparison of different memory\nreclamation schemes, we also introduce a highly flexible abstraction. It allows\na programmer to easily interchange schemes for reclamation, object pooling,\nallocation and deallocation with virtually no overhead, by changing a single\nline of code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 12:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

This field has been\ntraditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in\nheterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The\nmain reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is\nnot trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and\nfiltering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure.\nMoreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex\nevents, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.\n  In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event\nrecognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce\na CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that\nuses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events.\nThis makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to\ndevelop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by\ncomparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL,\nshowing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary\npredicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show\nthat if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more\nexpressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called\nUnary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of\nSO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of\nUCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations\nthat SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the\nlanguage that captures the complete class of UCEA under unary predicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 13:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

However,\nlight from stars physically associated with Cepheids may bias relative distance\nmeasurements if the changing spatial resolution along the distance ladder\nsignificantly alters the amount of associated blending. We have identified two\nregimes where this phenomenon may occur: Cepheids in wide binaries and open\nclusters.\n  We estimate stellar association bias using the photometric passbands and\nreddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes used to set up the distance scale. For wide\nbinaries, we rely on Geneva stellar evolution models in conjunction with\ndetailed statistics on intermediate-mass binary stars. For the impact of\ncluster stars, we have compiled information on the clustered Cepheid fraction\nand measured the typical cluster contribution in M31 via deep HST imaging\nprovided by the PHAT project.\n  We find that the dominant effect on the distance scale comes from Cepheids in\nclusters, despite cluster Cepheids being a relatively rare phenomenon. Wide\nbinaries have a negligible effect of 0.004% on $H_0$ for long-period Cepheids\nobserved in the near-infrared or when considering Wesenheit magnitudes.

SGLD is a standard stochastic gradient descent to which is added a\ncontrolled amount of noise, specifically scaled so that the parameter converges\nin law to the posterior distribution [WT11, TTV16]. The posterior predictive\ndistribution can be approximated by an ensemble of samples from the trajectory.\n  Choice of the variance of the noise is known to impact the practical behavior\nof SGLD: for instance, noise should be smaller for sensitive parameter\ndirections. Theoretically, it has been suggested to use the inverse Fisher\ninformation matrix of the model as the variance of the noise, since it is also\nthe variance of the Bayesian posterior [PT13, AKW12, GC11].

In this paper, we study the relation of $t_{\\rm{b}}$ and\n$t_{\\rm{jet}}$, where $t_{\\rm{b}}$ is the collision time of the later launched\nejecta with the formed external shock.

By specifying the one-dimensional integration-path as\n$z=t+if(t) (f\\in \\mathbb{R})$ and by optimizing $f(t)$ to enhance the average\nphase factor, we demonstrate that we can avoid the sign problem in a\none-variable toy model for which the complex Langevin method is found to fail.\nIn this proceedings, we propose POM and discuss how we can avoid the sign\nproblem in a toy model. We also discuss the possibility to utilize the neural\nnetwork to optimize the path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 14:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 10:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

However, recognizing similar actions remains\nchallenging since previous literature fails to capture motion and shape cues\neffectively from noisy depth data. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer\nBag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, which suppresses the noise disturbances and\njointly encodes both motion and shape cues. First, background clutter is\nremoved by a background modeling method that is designed for depth data. Then,\nmotion and shape cues are jointly used to generate robust and distinctive\nspatial-temporal interest points (STIPs): motion-based STIPs and shape-based\nSTIPs. In the first layer of our model, a multi-scale 3D local steering kernel\n(M3DLSK) descriptor is proposed to describe local appearances of cuboids around\nmotion-based STIPs. In the second layer, a spatial-temporal vector (STV)\ndescriptor is proposed to describe the spatial-temporal distributions of\nshape-based STIPs. Using the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, motion and shape\ncues are combined to form a fused action representation. Our model performs\nfavorably compared with common STIP detection and description methods.

The angular averages of the piezoelectric softening in unpoled ceramics\nare calculated for ferroelectric phases of different symmetries. The expression\nof the orientational average with the piezoelectric and dielectric constants of\nsingle crystal tetragonal BaTiO$_3$ from the literature reproduces well the\nsoftening of the Young's modulus of unpoled ceramic BaTiO$_3$, after a\ncorrection for the porosity. The agreement is good in the temperature region\nsufficiently far from the Curie temperature and from the transition to the\northorhombic phase, where the effect of fluctuations should be negligible, but\ndeviations are found outside this region, and the reason for this is discussed.\nThis validates the determination of the piezoelectric response by means of\npurely elastic measurements on unpoled samples.

On\nthe other hand, it does not require poling of the sample, and therefore is\ninsensitive to inaccuracies from incomplete poling, and can even be used with\nmaterials that cannot be poled, for example due to excessive electrical\nconductivity. While the proposed example of the Young's modulus of a ceramic\nprovides an orientational average of all the single crystal piezoelectric\nconstants, a Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy measurement of a single unpoled\nceramic sample through the ferroelectric transition can in principle measure\nall the piezoelectric constants, together with the elastic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 15:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Quite unfortunately, an inherent property of most existing\ndistributed algorithms is that throughout the course of their execution, the\nnodes get to learn not only their own output but rather learn quite a lot on\nthe inputs or outputs of many other entities. This leakage of information might\nbe a major obstacle in settings where the output (or input) of network's\nindividual is a private information. In this paper, we introduce a new\nframework for \\emph{secure distributed graph algorithms} and provide the first\n\\emph{general compiler} that takes any \"natural\" non-secure distributed\nalgorithm that runs in $r$ rounds, and turns it into a secure algorithm that\nruns in $\\widetilde{O}(r \\cdot D \\cdot poly(\\Delta))$ rounds where $\\Delta$ is\nthe maximum degree in the graph and $D$ is its diameter. The security of the\ncompiled algorithm is information-theoretic but holds only against a\nsemi-honest adversary that controls a single node in the network.\n  This compiler is made possible due to a new combinatorial structure called\n\\emph{private neighborhood trees}: a collection of $n$ trees\n$T(u_1),\\ldots,T(u_n)$, one for each vertex $u_i \\in V(G)$, such that each tree\n$T(u_i)$ spans the neighbors of $u_i$ {\\em without going through $u_i$}.\nIntuitively, each tree $T(u_i)$ allows all neighbors of $u_i$ to exchange a\n\\emph{secret} that is hidden from $u_i$, which is the basic graph\ninfrastructure of the compiler. In a $(d,c)$-private neighborhood trees each\ntree $T(u_i)$ has depth at most $d$ and each edge $e \\in G$ appears in at most\n$c$ different trees.

In the subsequent part, an event triggered rule is devised to save\ncomputational power and restrict periodic updating of the controller involved\nwhile ensuring desired closed loop performance of the system. Switching of the\nevent based controller is achieved via sliding mode control. Advantage of using\nswitched controller like sliding mode is that it retains its inherent\nrobustness as well as event triggering approach aids in saving energy\nexpenditure. Efficacy of the proposed scheme is confirmed via numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 15:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 05:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Technologies for the different\ntiers of the application have to be selected: a server-side language, a\ncombination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the client, and a database\ntechnology. Meeting the expectations of contemporary web applications requires\neven more effort from the developer: many state of the art libraries must be\nmastered and glued together. This leads to an impedance mismatch problem\nbetween the different technologies and it is up to the programmer to align them\nmanually. Multi-tier or tierless programming is a web programming paradigm that\nprovides one language for the different tiers of the web application, allowing\nthe programmer to focus on the actual program logic instead of the accidental\ncomplexity that comes from combining several technologies. While current\ntierless approaches therefore relieve the burden of having to combine different\ntechnologies into one application, the distribution of the code is explicitly\ntied into the program. Certain distribution decisions have an impact on\ncrosscutting concerns such as information security or offline availability.\nMoreover, adapting the programs such that the application complies better with\nthese concerns often leads to code tangling, rendering the program more\ndifficult to understand and maintain. We introduce an approach to multi-tier\nprogramming where the tierless code is decoupled from the tier specification.\nThe developer implements the web application in terms of slices and an external\nspecification that assigns the slices to tiers. A recommender system completes\nthe picture for those slices that do not have a fixed placement and proposes\nslice refinements as well. This recommender system tries to optimise the tier\nspecification with respect to one or more crosscutting concerns. This is in\ncontrast with current cutting edge solutions that hide distribution decisions\nfrom the programmer. In this paper we show that slices, together with a\nrecommender system, enable the developer to experiment with different\nplacements of slices, until the distribution of the code satisfies the\nprogrammer's needs. We present a search-based recommender system that maximises\nthe offline availability of a web application and a concrete implementation of\nthese concepts in the tier-splitting tool Stip.js.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 15:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

C lacks automatic checks, and programmers cannot apply defensive\nprogramming techniques because objects (e.g., arrays or structs) lack run-time\ninformation about bounds, lifetime, and types. Inquiry: Current approaches to\ntackling low-level errors include dynamic tools, such as bounds or type\ncheckers, that check for certain actions during program execution. If they\ndetect an error, they typically abort execution. Although they track run-time\ninformation as part of their runtimes, they do not expose this information to\nprogrammers. Approach: We devised an introspection interface that allows C\nprogrammers to access run-time information and to query object bounds, object\nlifetimes, object types, and information about variadic arguments. This enables\nlibrary writers to check for invalid input or program states and thus, for\nexample, to implement custom error handling that maintains system availability\nand does not terminate on benign errors. As we assume that introspection is\nused together with a dynamic tool that implements automatic checks, errors that\nare not handled in the application logic continue to cause the dynamic tool to\nabort execution. Knowledge: Using the introspection interface, we implemented a\nmore robust, source-compatible version of the C standard library that validates\nparameters to its functions. The library functions react to otherwise undefined\nbehavior; for example, they can detect lurking flaws, handle unterminated\nstrings, check format string arguments, and set errno when they detect benign\nusage errors. Grounding: Existing dynamic tools maintain run-time information\nthat can be used to implement the introspection interface, and we demonstrate\nits implementation in Safe Sulong, an interpreter and dynamic bug-finding tool\nfor C that runs on a Java Virtual Machine and can thus easily expose relevant\nrun-time information. Importance: Using introspection in user code is a novel\napproach to tackling the long-standing problem of low-level errors in C. As new\napproaches are lowering the performance overhead of run-time information\nmaintenance, the usage of dynamic runtimes for C could become more common,\nwhich could ultimately facilitate a more widespread implementation of such an\nintrospection interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 15:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

This extra term\ninvolves the moment of inertia of the neutron stars. Moment of inertia, on the\nother hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well as the\nequation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron\nstar binary (better the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing\nanalysis might lead to the estimation of the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement of the\nmoment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of\nthe moment of inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new\nconstraint on the equation of state. Pulsars in double neutron star binaries\nare the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately high\neccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal\neffects are negligible (unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf\nbinaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854.\nThe spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between the spin and the\norbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring\neffect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR\nJ0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of\nthese pulsars are small, the variation in the Lense-Thirring term is not much.\nHowever, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed rate of the\nperiastron advance, more accurate timing solutions including precise proper\nmotion and distance measurements are essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 09:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 07:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}
