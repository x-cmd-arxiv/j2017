One of the hallmarks of this relaxation process\nobserved in the measured auto correlation function is occurrence of multiple\nsteps of relaxation. The shorter time relaxation is known as the\n$\\beta$-relaxation which is believed to be due to the motion of particles in\nthe cage formed by their neighbors. One the other hand longer time relaxation,\nthe $\\alpha$-relaxation is believed to be the main relaxation process in the\nliquids. The timescales of these two relaxations processes dramatically\nseparate out with supercooling.

An analysis of the mean momentum-balance\nshows that the modeled stress term close to the wall can dominate because of\nthe bulk eddy-viscosity. Consequently, the momentum-balance equation lacks a\ndegree-of-freedom and the mean velocity conforms to an incorrect profile to\nsatisfy the momentum-balance. We show that zonal enforcement of the target mass\nflow-rate can be an effective strategy to introduce an additional degree of\nfreedom to the mean momentum-balance, which led to a significant reduction in\nthe log-layer mismatch. When the mass flow-rate is enforced zonally, the\nfiltered velocity field attains its own constant velocity-scale above the\nReynolds-averaged field, supporting the hypothesis that there exists an\nartificial boundary layer above the Reynolds-averaged region. We simulate\nturbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of 2000 and 5200 on coarse\nmeshes that would put the first point away from the wall well into the\nlogarithmic layer.

However, AHSS has not yet been employed in\ncold-formed steel construction. To assess the impact of the adoption of AHSS on\ncold-formed steel member strength a group of forty standard structural lipped\nchannel cross-sections are chosen from the Steel Framing Industry Association\nproduct list and simulated with AHSS material properties. The stress-strain\nmodels used in this study are based on AHSS in production, including dual-phase\nand martensitic steels. The simulations consider compression with work on\nbending about the major axis in progress. Three different bracing conditions\nare employed so that the impact of local, distortional, and global buckling,\nincluding interactions can be explored. Due to the higher yield stresses of\nAHSS the potential for interaction and mode switching is anticipated to be\ngreater in these members compared with conventional mild steels. The\nsimulations provide a direct means to assess the increase in strength created\nby the application of AHSS, while also allowing for future exploration of the\nincrease in buckling mode interaction, imperfection sensitivity, and strain\ndemands inherent in the larger capacities. The work is intended to be an\ninitial step in a longer-term effort to foster innovation in the application of\nnew steels in cold-formed steel construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

Aims: To measure and parametrize the non-diffusive\ncontribution to turbulent stress, known as $\\Lambda$ effect, and its quenching\nas a function of rotation and magnetic field. Methods: Simulations of\nhomogeneous, anisotropically forced turbulence in fully periodic cubes are used\nto extract the turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses. Magnetic fields are\nintroduced by imposing a uniform large-scale field on the system. Turbulent\ntransport coefficients pertaining to the $\\Lambda$ effect are obtained by\nfitting. Results: The numerical results agree qualitatively with analytic ones\nat slow rotation and low Reynolds numbers. This entails that vertical\n(horizontal) transport is downward (equatorward). The existence of a\nsignificant meridional $\\Lambda$ effect is confirmed. Large-scale vorticity\ngeneration is found at rapid rotation when the Reynolds number exceeds a\nthreshold value. The $\\Lambda$ effect is severely quenched by large-scale\nmagnetic fields due to the tendency of the Reynolds and Maxwell stresses to\ncancel each other. Rotational (magnetic) quenching of $\\Lambda$ occurs at more\nrapid rotation (at lower field strength) in simulations than in theory.\nConclusions: The current results largely confirm the earlier theoretical\nresults but they also offer new insights: the non-negligible meridional\n$\\Lambda$ effect possibly plays a role in the maintenance of meridional\ncirculation in stars and the appearance of large-scale vortices raises the\nquestion of their effect on the angular momentum transport in stars.

We find that high-order\nautoregressive $(AR)$ models produce similar or superior forecast performance\nthan $ARFIMA$ models at short horizons.

Whereas typical policy\nresponses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the\nefficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve\nresilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still\nscarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by\nmapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to\nlinks. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays\nusing link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality\nmeasures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road\nsegments.

Resilience was estimated as the\nchange in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary\nbetween cities, with increased delays due to a 5% random loss of road linkages\nranging from 9.5% in Los Angeles to 56.0% in San Francisco. The results\ndemonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under\nnormal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more\nefficient cities are more fragile.

We\ntrain an agent to automatically choose a sequence of actions for a human\nannotator to produce a bounding box in a minimal amount of time.

We explore two kinds\nof agents, one based on predicting the probability that a box will be\npositively verified, and the other based on reinforcement learning. We\ndemonstrate that (1) our agents are able to learn efficient annotation\nstrategies in several scenarios, automatically adapting to the image\ndifficulty, the desired quality of the boxes, and the detector strength; (2) in\nall scenarios the resulting annotation dialogs speed up annotation compared to\nmanual box drawing alone and box verification alone, while also outperforming\nany fixed combination of verification and drawing in most scenarios; (3) in a\nrealistic scenario where the detector is iteratively re-trained, our agents\nevolve a series of strategies that reflect the shifting trade-off between\nverification and drawing as the detector grows stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 17:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 15:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 14:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Twitter user geolocation is a difficult and active\nresearch topic with a vast literature. Most of the proposed methods follow\neither a content-based or a network-based approach. The former exploits\nuser-generated content while the latter utilizes the connection or interaction\nbetween Twitter users. In this paper, we introduce a novel method combining the\nstrength of both approaches. Concretely, we propose a multi-entry neural\nnetwork architecture named MENET leveraging the advances in deep learning and\nmultiview learning. The generalizability of MENET enables the integration of\nmultiple data representations. In the context of Twitter user geolocation, we\nrealize MENET with textual, network, and metadata features. Considering the\nnatural distribution of Twitter users across the concerned geographical area,\nwe subdivide the surface of the earth into multi-scale cells and train MENET\nwith the labels of the cells.

This heavy-flavor QCD is\nchosen as the simplest available context in which the dynamics of quark and\ngluon bound states can be studied with the required rigor using Minkowski-space\nHamiltonian operators in the Fock space, taking the advantage of asymptotic\nfreedom. The effective quarks and gluons differ from the point-like canonical\nones by having a finite size $s$. Their size plays the role of renormalization\ngroup parameter. However, instead of integrating out high-energy degrees of\nfreedom, our RGPEP procedure is based on a transformation of the front-form QCD\nHamiltonian from its canonical form with counterterms to the renormalized,\nscale-dependent operator that acts in the Fock space of effective quanta of\nquark and gluon fields, keeping all degrees of freedom intact but accounting\nfor them in a transformed form. We discuss different behavior of effective\nparticles interacting at different energy scales, corresponding to different\nsize s. Namely, we cover phenomena ranging from asymptotic freedom at highest\nenergies down to the scales at which the formation of bound states occurs. We\nbriefly present recent applications of the RGPEP to quarks and gluons in QCD,\nwhich have been developed using expansion in powers of the Fock-space\nHamiltonian running coupling. After observing that the QCD effective\nHamiltonian satisfies the requirement of producing asymptotic freedom, we\nderive the leading effective interaction between quarks in heavy-flavor QCD. An\neffective confining effect is derived as a result of assuming that the\nnon-Abelian and non-perturbative dynamics causes effective gluons to have mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 17:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

From the perspective of machine\nlearning, the task of predicting customer churn can be presented as a binary\nclassification problem. Using data on historic behavior, classification\nalgorithms are built with the purpose of accurately predicting the probability\nof a customer defecting. The predictive churn models are then commonly selected\nbased on accuracy related performance measures such as the area under the ROC\ncurve (AUC). However, these models are often not well aligned with the core\nbusiness requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail\nto take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the benefits\noriginating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim is to construct\nchurn prediction models that are profitable and preferably interpretable too.\nThe recently developed expected maximum profit measure for customer churn\n(EMPC) has been proposed in order to select the most profitable churn model. We\npresent a new classifier that integrates the EMPC metric directly into the\nmodel construction. Our technique, called ProfTree, uses an evolutionary\nalgorithm for learning profit driven decision trees.

The excitation frequency of spin waves in YIG is rather\nlow in weak external magnetic fields because of its small saturation\nmagnetization, which limits the potential of YIG films for high-frequency\napplications. Here, we demonstrate how exchange-coupling to a CoFeB film\nenables efficient excitation of high-frequency perpendicular standing spin\nwaves (PSSWs) in nanometer-thick (80 nm and 295 nm) YIG films using uniform\nmicrowave magnetic fields. In the 295-nm-thick YIG film, we measure intense\nPSSW modes up to 10th order. Strong hybridization between the PSSW modes and\nthe ferromagnetic resonance mode of CoFeB leads to characteristic anti-crossing\nbehavior in broadband spin-wave spectra. A dynamic exchange torque at the\nYIG/CoFeB interface explains the excitation of PSSWs. The localized torque\noriginates from exchange coupling between two dissimilar magnetization\nprecessions in the YIG and CoFeB layers. As a consequence, spin waves are\nemitted from the YIG/CoFeB interface and PSSWs form when their wave vector\nmatches the perpendicular confinement condition. PSSWs are not excited when the\nexchange coupling between YIG and CoFeB is suppressed by a Ta spacer layer.\nMicromagnetic simulations confirm the exchange-torque mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 20:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

The novelty is that in the absence of\nexecution fairness, the algorithm guarantees a bound on the number of times in\nwhich the system might violate safety (while existing algorithms might block\nforever due to the presence of both transient faults and crash failures).\n  Since vector clocks facilitate a number of elementary synchronization\nbuilding blocks (without requiring remote replica synchronization) in\nasynchronous systems, we believe that our analytical insights are useful for\nthe design of other systems that cannot guarantee execution fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 20:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

We consider a single binary reaction of the form A+B\n-> C+C. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed for activation energies\nranging between RT and 7.5RT and heat release of 2.5RT and 10RT. The evolution\nof up to 10,000 particles was calculated as the system undergoes a thermal\nignition at constant volume.

This effect was found to lower the ignition delay by\nup to 30%. At high temperatures, the ignition delay obtained from the standard\nequilibrium rate was found to be up to 60% longer than the molecular\ncalculations. This effect is due to the rapidity of the reactive collisions\nthat do not allow the system to equilibrate.

We find only one significant trend\nin the inactive population, namely that the cycle periods get shorter with\nincreasing rotation. This is in contrast with earlier studies, that postulate\nthe existence of trends in both of the populations. In terms of rotation to\ncycle period ratio, our data is consistent with only two activity branches such\nthat the active branch merges together with the transitional one. The retrieved\nstellar cycles are uniformly distributed over the R'HK activity index,\nindicating that the operation of stellar large-scale dynamos carries smoothly\nover the Vaughan-Preston gap. At around the solar activity index, however,\nindications of a disruption in the cyclic dynamo action are seen. Our study\nshows that stellar cycle estimates depend significantly on the model applied.\nSuch model-dependent aspects include the improper treatment of linear trends,\nwhile the assumption of strict harmonicity can result in the appearance of\ndouble cyclicities that seem more likely to be explained by the\nquasi-periodicity of the cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 08:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 06:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

We wish to investigate the effect of\nthe different levels of filtering on the instabilities and dynamics of the\natmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the\ndissipation scheme and the resolution on the spectra of LEs.\n  The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed for two different values of the\nmeridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing. The increase of\nthe gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities,\ncorresponding to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first\nLE. The convergence rate of the rate functional for the large deviation law of\nthe finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for all exponents, which can\nbe interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric\ntime-scale separation in such a model.\n  The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability is\ncorrectly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the\ncentral manifold, which is mostly associated to the ocean dynamics, is not\nfully resolved because of its associated long time scales, even at intermediate\norders.\n  This paper highlights the need to investigate the natural variability of the\natmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and decay of\nperturbations to the physical modes described using the formalism of the\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors and to consider long integrations in order to\ndisentangle the dynamical processes occurring at all time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 22:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 06:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

In this paper, we propose a novel two-step\nunderstanding method, namely Salient Relevance (SR) map, which aims to shed\nlight on how deep CNNs recognize images and learn features from areas, referred\nto as attention areas, therein. Our proposed method starts out with a\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) step which estimates a pixel-wise\nrelevance map over the input image. Following, we construct a context-aware\nsaliency map, SR map, from the LRP-generated map which predicts areas close to\nthe foci of attention instead of isolated pixels that LRP reveals. In human\nvisual system, information of regions is more important than of pixels in\nrecognition. Consequently, our proposed approach closely simulates human\nrecognition. Experimental results using the ILSVRC2012 validation dataset in\nconjunction with two well-established deep CNN models, AlexNet and VGG-16,\nclearly demonstrate that our proposed approach concisely identifies not only\nkey pixels but also attention areas that contribute to the underlying neural\nnetwork's comprehension of the given images.

These\nimprovements are mainly due to the continuous technology scaling of DRAM\n(dynamic random-access memory), which has been used as the physical substrate\nfor main memory. In stark contrast with capacity and bandwidth, DRAM latency\nhas remained almost constant, reducing by only 1.3x in the same time frame.\nTherefore, long DRAM latency continues to be a critical performance bottleneck\nin modern systems. Increasing core counts, and the emergence of increasingly\nmore data-intensive and latency-critical applications further stress the\nimportance of providing low-latency memory access.\n  In this dissertation, we identify three main problems that contribute\nsignificantly to long latency of DRAM accesses. To address these problems, we\npresent a series of new techniques. Our new techniques significantly improve\nboth system performance and energy efficiency. We also examine the critical\nrelationship between supply voltage and latency in modern DRAM chips and\ndevelop new mechanisms that exploit this voltage-latency trade-off to improve\nenergy efficiency.\n  The key conclusion of this dissertation is that augmenting DRAM architecture\nwith simple and low-cost features, and developing a better understanding of\nmanufactured DRAM chips together lead to significant memory latency reduction\nas well as energy efficiency improvement. We hope and believe that the proposed\narchitectural techniques and the detailed experimental data and observations on\nreal commodity DRAM chips presented in this dissertation will enable\ndevelopment of other new mechanisms to improve the performance, energy\nefficiency, or reliability of future memory systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 04:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

In this paper we present a\nnovel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data\nrecorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical\nstimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex\nacoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a\nmusical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the\ncorrelation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG\ndata. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct\ncorrelation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that\ncorrelation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is\nthe first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct\ncorrelation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical\nmicroscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA).\nFor this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with\nwhite noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening\ncondition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and\nMFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross\ncorrelation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation\nof {\\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also\nprovides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability\nto engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which\nengages specific domains only).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 08:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

A polymer is a macro-molecule resulting\nfrom the aggregation of several elementary sub-units called monomers. Polymers\ncan grow by addition of monomers or can be split into several polymers. The\ninitial state of the system consists mainly of monomers. We study the time\nevolution of the mass of polymers, in particular the asymptotic distribution of\nthe first instant when the fraction of monomers used in polymers is above some\npositive threshold $\\delta$. A scaling approach is used by taking the mass $N$\nas a scaling parameter. The mathematical model used in this paper includes {\\em\na nucleation property}: If $n_c$ is defined as the size of the nucleus,\npolymers with a size less than $n_c$ are quickly fragmented into smaller\npolymers, at a rate proportional to $\\Phi(N)$ for some non-decreasing and\nunbounded function $\\Phi$. For polymers of size greater than $n_c$,\nfragmentation still occurs but at bounded rates. If $T^N$ is the instant of\ncreation of the first polymer whose size is $n_c$, it is shown that, under\nappropriate conditions, the variable $T^N{/}[\\Phi(N)^{n_c{-}2}{/}N]$ converges\nin distribution, and that the first instant $L_\\delta^N$ when a fraction\n$\\delta$ of monomers is polymerized has the same order of magnitude. An\noriginal feature proved for this model is the significant variability of the\nvariable $T^N$.

Existing graph partitioning algorithms minimize partitioning latency by\nassigning individual graph edges to partitions in a streaming manner --- at the\ncost of reduced partitioning quality. However, we argue that the mere\nminimization of partitioning latency is not the optimal design choice in terms\nof minimizing total graph analysis latency, i.e., the sum of partitioning and\nprocessing latency. Instead, for complex and long-running graph processing\nalgorithms that run on very large graphs, it is beneficial to invest more time\ninto graph partitioning to reach a higher partitioning quality --- which\ndrastically reduces graph processing latency. In this paper, we propose ADWISE,\na novel window-based streaming partitioning algorithm that increases the\npartitioning quality by always choosing the best edge from a set of edges for\nassignment to a partition. In doing so, ADWISE controls the partitioning\nlatency by adapting the window size dynamically at run-time.

In particular, in a single level quantum dot singly\noccupied, the sign of the supercurrent can be reversed, giving rise to a\npi-junction. This 0-pi transition, corresponding to a singlet-doublet\ntransition, is then driven by the gate voltage or by the superconducting phase\nin the case of strong competition between the superconducting proximity effect\nand Kondo correlations. In a two-level quantum dot, such as a clean carbon\nnanotube, 0-pi transitions exist as well but, because more cotunneling\nprocesses are allowed, are not necessarily associated to a magnetic state\ntransition of the dot. In this proceeding, after a review of 0-pi transitions\nin Josephson junctions, we present measurements of current-phase relation in a\nclean carbon nanotube quantum dot, in the single and two-level regimes. In the\nsingle level regime, close to orbital degeneracy and in a regime of strong\ncompetition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity\neffect, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent transition is a\nuniversal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition\nat zero temperature. In the case where the two levels are involved, the\nnanotube Josephson current exhibits a continuous 0-pi transition, independent\nof the superconducting phase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 09:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

The adatoms are described by two tight-binding parameters: onsite\nenergy and hybridization strength. We explore a wide range of different\nmagnitudes of these parameters by employing T-matrix calculations in the single\nadatom limit and by tight-binding supercell calculations for dilute adatom\ncoverage. We calculate the density of states and the momentum relaxation rate\nand extract the resonance level and resonance width. Top position with large\nhybridization strength or, equivalently, small onsite energy, induces\nresonances close to zero energy. Bridge position, compared to top, is more\nsensitive to variation in the orbital tight-binding parameters. Resonances\nwithin the experimentally relevant energy window are found mainly for bridge\nadatoms with negative onsite energies. The effect of resonances from top and\nbridge position on the density of states and momentum relaxation rate is\ncomparable and both positions give rise to power-law decay of the resonant\nstate in graphene. Hollow position with $s$ orbital character is affected from\ndestructive interference which is seen from very narrow resonance peaks in the\ndensity of states and momentum relaxation rate. The resonant state shows no\nclear tendency to power-law decay around the impurity and its magnitude\ndecreases strongly with lowering the adatom content in the supercell\ncalculations. This is in contrast to top and bridge position. We conclude our\nstudy with a comparison to models of point-like vacancies and strong midgap\nscatterers.

Then, the computer graphics, virtual\nreality, and rule modeling technologies are utilized to synthesize large-scale,\nrealistic virtual urban traffic scenes, in which the fidelity and geography\nmatch the real world well. Furthermore, the Unity3D platform is used to render\nthe artificial scenes and generate accurate ground-truth labels, e.g.,\nsemantic/instance segmentation, object bounding box, object tracking, optical\nflow, and depth. The environmental conditions in artificial scenes can be\ncontrolled completely. As a result, we present a viable implementation pipeline\nfor constructing large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that this pipeline is able to generate\nphotorealistic virtual datasets with low modeling time and high accuracy\nlabeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 11:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

A procedure in a network is called decentralized if it uses only local\ninformation about visited nodes and its neighbors. Networks, which structure\nallows efficient performing the nearest neighbour search by a decentralised\nsearch procedure started from any node, are of particular interest especially\nfor pure distributed systems. Several algorithms that construct such networks\nhave been proposed in literature. However, the following questions arise: \"Are\nthere network models in which decentralised search can be performed faster?\";\n\"What are the optimal networks for the decentralised search?\"; \"What are their\nproperties?\".

The latter has the form of a quadratic drag in\nlarge Reynolds number swimmers and has recently been pointed out as a crucial\nelement in the thrust force balance. We validate the output of a weakly\nnonlinear solution to the fluid--structure model using thrust force\nmeasurements from an experiment with flexible plates subjected to the three\ndifferent actuation types.

We show that this balance is modified as the frequency of excitation\nchanges and the response of the elastic plate shifts between different resonant\nmodes, the pure heaving case being the most sensitive to the modal response\nwith drastic changes in the reactive/resistive contribution ratio along the\nfrequency axis.

Considering a pair of dependent random variables\n$(X,Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ denote the private and useful data, respectively,\nthe following problem is addressed: What is the maximum information that can be\nrevealed about $Y$ (measured by mutual information $I(Y;U)$, in which $U$ is\nthe revealed data), while disclosing no information about $X$ (captured by the\ncondition of statistical independence, i.e., $X\\independent U$, and henceforth,\ncalled \\textit{perfect privacy})? We analyze the supremization of\n\\textit{utility}, i.e., $I(Y;U)$ under the condition of perfect privacy for two\nscenarios: \\textit{output perturbation} and \\textit{full data observation}\nmodels, which correspond to the cases where a Markov kernel, called\n\\textit{privacy-preserving mapping}, applies to $Y$ and the pair $(X,Y)$,\nrespectively. When both $X$ and $Y$ have a finite alphabet, the linear\nalgebraic analysis involved in the solution provides some interesting results,\nsuch as upper/lower bounds on the size of the released alphabet and the maximum\nutility. Afterwards, it is shown that for the jointly Gaussian $(X,Y)$, perfect\nprivacy is not possible in the output perturbation model in contrast to the\nfull data observation model. Finally, an asymptotic analysis is provided to\nobtain the rate of released information when a sufficiently small leakage is\nallowed. In particular, in the context of output perturbation model, it is\nshown that this rate is always finite when perfect privacy is not feasible, and\ntwo lower bounds are provided for it; When perfect privacy is feasible, it is\nshown that under mild conditions, this rate becomes unbounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 15:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 12:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 11:29:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 18:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 00:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 12:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 22:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

In terms of communication theory, we might say that\nthe entropic apportionment gives each constituent as equal a voice as possible.\nIf we view representational weight as a finite resource to be distributed\namongst the represented population, the entropic measure is identical with the\nTheil index long employed in economics to measure inequality in the\ndistribution of wealth or income, or in ecology to measure the distribution of\nbiomass or reproductive fitness. Besides Congressional apportionment, the\nmethod is also directly applicable to other multi-regional or\nmulti-constituency legislatures, to party-list proportional voting systems used\nin various parliamentary elections, and similar settings, where the task is to\nallocate a discrete number of seats or other resources, and the primary goal is\none of maximal proportionality or equity. In addition, the same entropic\nfigure-of-merit can be used in parallel to compare different choices for the\ntotal number of representatives, and then subsequently to assess different\nCongressional district sizes, after seats are assigned and proposed district\nboundaries drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 20:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 20:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 19:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

In the cockpit of locusts, two\nLobula Giant Movement Detectors, i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified\nwhich respond to looming objects rigorously with high firing rates. Compared to\nLGMD1, LGMD2 matures early in the juvenile locusts with specific selectivity to\ndark moving objects against bright background in depth while not responding to\nlight objects embedded in dark background - a similar situation which ground\nvehicles and robots are facing with. However, little work has been done on\nmodeling LGMD2, let alone its potential in robotics and other vision-based\napplications.

In this article the situation is analyzed and a recursive process is\ndescribed for obtaining (at least approximate) solutions of Maxwell's equations\ninside and outside the capacitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 09:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 10:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 05:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 08:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 06:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 04:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

A\nparamount model of the non-equilibrium critical behavior is the directed bond\npercolation process that exhibits an active- to-absorbing state phase\ntransition in the vicinity of a percolation threshold. Fluctuations of the\nambient environment might affect or destroy the universality properties\ncompletely. In this work we assume that the random environment can be described\nby means of compressible velocity fluctu- ations. Using field-theoretic models\nand renormalization group methods we investigate large-scale and long-time\nbehavior. Altogether eleven universality classes are found, out of which four\nare stable in the infrared limit and thus macroscopically accessible. In\ncontrast to the model without veloc- ity fluctuations a possible candidate for\na realistic three-dimensional case, a regime with relevant short-range noise,\nis identified. Depending on the dimensionality of space and the structure of\nthe turbulent flow we calculate critical exponents of the directed percolation\nprocess. In the limit of the purely transversal velocity field random force\ncritical exponents comply with the incompressible results obtained by previous\nauthors. We have found intriguing non-universal behavior related to the mutual\neffect of compressibility and advection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 09:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}
