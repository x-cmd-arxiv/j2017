Previous studies on barotropic\nbeta-plane turbulence have shown that coherent flows emerge out of a background\nof homogeneous turbulence as a bifurcation when the turbulence intensity\nincreases and the emergence of large scale flows has been attributed to a new\ntype of collective, symmetry breaking instability of the statistical state\ndynamics of the turbulent flow. In this work we extend the analysis to\nstratified flows and investigate turbulent self-organization in a two-layer\nfluid with no imposed mean north-south thermal gradient and turbulence\nsupported by an external random stirring. We use a second order closure of the\nstatistical state dynamics (S3T) with an appropriate averaging ansatz that\nallows the identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and their\nstructural stability. The bifurcation of the statistically homogeneous\nequilibrium state to inhomogeneous equilibrium states comprising of zonal jets\nand/or large scale waves when the energy input rate of the excitation passes a\ncritical threshold is analytically studied. The theory predicts that when the\nflow transitions to a statistical state with large-scale structures, these\nstates are barotropic if the scale of excitation is larger than the deformation\nradius. Mixed barotropic-baroclinic states with jets and/or waves arise when\nthe excitation is at scales shorter than the deformation radius with the\nbaroclinic component of the flow being subdominant for low energy input rates\nand non-significant for higher energy input rates. The results of the S3T\ntheory are compared to nonlinear simulations. The theory is found to accurately\npredict both the critical transition arameters and the scales of the emergent\nstructures but underestimates their amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 16:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 11:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

However, modeling cycles\nin time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not\nlabeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from multidimensional\nmeasurements taken over time. Here, we present CyHMMs, a cyclic hidden Markov\nmodel method for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of\nmultidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle\nmodeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in\nmodeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete and\ncontinuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data;\nand they can share information across individuals to model variation both\nwithin and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths\nmore accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated data\nand 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing\nbaseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can\nmodel the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the\ncycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series\ninto groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world\nhealth-tracking datasets -- of menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity\ntracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect\nat each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several\ngroups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along\ndimensions not provided to the model.

Furthermore, for a peaked spectral density we\ndemonstrate that there is no monotonic relation between our quantifier and the\nsystem-bath coupling strength, the sharpness of the peak or the resonance\nfrequency in the bath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 17:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 09:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 10:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

We revisit the issue of the plausibility of FPT != W[1], focusing on two\naspects: the difficulty of proving the conjecture (assuming it holds), and how\nthe relation between the two classes might differ from the one between P and\nNP.\n  Regarding the first aspect, we give new evidence that separating FPT from\nW[1] would be considerably harder than doing the same for P and NP. Our main\nresult regarding the relation between FPT and W[1] states that the closure of\nW[1] under relativization with FPT-oracles is precisely the class W[P],\nimplying that either FPT is not low for W[1], or the W-Hierarchy collapses.\nThis theorem also has consequences for the A-Hierarchy (a parameterized version\nof the Polynomial Hierarchy), namely that unless W[P] is a subset of some level\nA[t], there are structural differences between the A-Hierarchy and the\nPolynomial Hierarchy. We also prove that under the unlikely assumption that\nW[P] collapses to W[1] in a specific way, the collapse of any two consecutive\nlevels of the A-Hierarchy implies the collapse of the entire hierarchy to a\nfinite level; this extends a result of Chen, Flum, and Grohe (2005).\n  Finally, we give weak (oracle-based) evidence that the inclusion of W[t] in\nA[t] is strict for t>1, and that the W-Hierarchy is proper.

To demonstrate the latter point, we compare the\ndistributions for the temporal intervals estimated through conventional\nhistograms with those through the estimator which properly takes account of\ncensoring and sampling bias.

In {\\sc\neagle} galaxies resembling the Milky Way, $\\sim 40$ percent of carbon-enhanced\nmetal poor (CEMP) stars are SoRs. Conversely, $\\sim 10$ percent of all SoRs are\nCEMP stars. This fraction increases to $\\gtrsim 50$ percent for SoRs of\nmetallicity [Fe/H]$<-4$, and at such low metallicities, most of the CEMP stars\nare of CEMP-no subtype that are lacking neutron capture elements. Although\nthese numbers may well depend on the details of the physical models implemented\nin EAGLE, the trends we describe are robust as they result from the strong\nfeedback from star formation in early galaxies, itself a key ingredient of most\ncurrent models of galaxy formation. We further find that most SoRs today reside\nin halos with mass $M_h\\gtrapprox 10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$, and 50 percent of them\nare in the halo of their central galaxy (distance $>10$ kpc), mainly because\nthey were accreted onto their current host rather than formed in-situ. To a\ngood approximation, the SoRs are CEMP-no stars that reside in the stellar halos\nof massive galaxies, with nearly half of them contributing to the intracluster\nlight in groups and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 19:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 09:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Despite many experimental and\ntheoretical investigations, its structure remains uncertain. Apart from the\nfact that it is unbound, other properties including the spin and parity of its\nground state and the very existence of additional low-lying resonances are\nstill a matter of debate. In this work we study the properties of $^9$He by\nanalyzing the $n+^8$He continuum in the context of the ab initio no-core shell\nmodel with continuum (NCSMC) formalism with chiral interactions as the only\ninput. The NCSMC is a state-of-the-art approach for the ab initio description\nof light nuclei. With its capability to predict properties of bound states,\nresonances, and scattering states in a unified framework, the method is\nparticularly well suited for the study of unbound nuclei such as $^9$He. Our\nanalysis produces an unbound $^9$He nucleus. Two resonant states are found at\nthe energies of ${\\sim}1$ and ${\\sim}3.5$ MeV, respectively, above the $n+^8$He\nbreakup threshold. The first state has a spin-parity assignment of $J^{\\pi} =\n{1/2}^-$ and can be associated with the ground state of $^9$He, while the\nsecond, broader state has a spin-parity of ${3/2}^-$. No resonance is found in\nthe ${1/2}^+$ channel, only a very weak attraction. We find that the $^9$He\nground-state resonance has a negative parity and thus breaks the\nparity-inversion mechanism found in the $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li nuclei of the\nsame $N=7$ isotonic chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 19:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

It is generally difficult to identify\nthis parameter without strong, untestable assumptions. It has been shown that\nidentifiability assumptions become much weaker under a crossover design in\nwhich subjects not receiving treatment are later given treatment. Under the\nassumption that the post-treatment biomarker observed in these crossover\nsubjects is the same as would have been observed had they received treatment at\nthe start of the study, one can identify the treatment effect with only mild\nadditional assumptions. This remains true if the endpoint is absorbent, i.e. an\nendpoint such as death or HIV infection such that the post-crossover treatment\nbiomarker is not meaningful if the endpoint has already occurred. In this work,\nwe review identifiability results for a parameter of the distribution of the\ndata observed under a crossover design with the principally stratified\ntreatment effect of interest.

The underlying assumption is that the contact area\ndistributions are the same as under adhesiveless conditions (for an\nappropriately increased normal load), so that in general the stress intensity\nfactors will not be exactly equal at all contact edges. The solution is simply\nthat the indentation is D=D1-Sqrt(2w A'/P\") where w is surface energy, D1 is\nthe adhesiveless indentation, A' is the first derivative of contact area and P\"\nthe second derivative of the load with respect to indentation.

Our simulation studies show that the proposed\nglobal monitoring statistics perform well across a broad range of settings, and\ncompare favorably with existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 21:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

The base flow, generated using two-dimensional\nnumerical simulations, is characterized by the Reynolds number and the\nRichardson number defined based on the initial one-dimensional velocity and\nbuoyancy profiles. The local stability equations are then solved on closed\nstreamlines in the vortical base flow, which is assumed quasi-steady. For the\nunstratified case, the elliptic instability at the vortex core dominates at\nearly times, before being taken over by the hyperbolic instability at the\nvortex edge. For the stratified case, the early time instabilities comprise a\ndominant elliptic instability at the core and a hyperbolic instability strongly\ninfluenced by stratification at the vortex edge. At intermediate times, the\nlocal approach shows a new branch of instability (convective branch) that\nemerges at the vortex core and subsequently moves towards the vortex edge. A\nfew more convective instability branches appear at the vortex core and move\naway, before coalescing to form the most unstable region inside the vortex\nperiphery at large times. The dominant instability characteristics from the\nlocal approach are shown to be in good qualitative agreement with results from\nglobal instability studies for both homogeneous and stratified cases.\nCompartmentalized analyses are then used to elucidate the role of shear and\nstratification on the identified instabilities. The role of buoyancy is shown\nto be critical after the primary KH instability saturates, with the dominant\nconvective instability shown to occur in regions with the strongest statically\nunstable layering. We conclude by highlighting the potentially insightful role\nthat the local approach may offer in understanding the secondary instabilities\nin other flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 22:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 07:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Straining a film by growing on a lattice-mismatched substrate has\nbeen a conventional approach to enhance the ORR activity. However, due to the\nlimited choice of electrolyte substrates to alter the degree of strain, a\nsystematic study in various materials has been a challenge. Here, we explore\nthe strain modulation of the ORR kinetics by growing epitaxial\nLa0.6Sr0.4CoO3-{\\delta} (LSCO) films on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates\nwith the film thickness below and above the critical thickness for strain\nrelaxation. Two orders of magnitude higher ORR kinetics is achieved in an\nultra-thin film with ~0.8% tensile strain as compared to unstrained films.\nTime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling confirms that\nthe Sr surface segregation is not responsible for the enhanced ORR in strained\nfilms. We attribute this enhancement of ORR kinetics to the increase in oxygen\nvacancy concentration in the tensile-strained LSCO film owing to the reduced\nactivation barrier for oxygen surface exchange kinetics. Density functional\ntheory calculations reveal an upshift of the oxygen 2p-band center relative to\nthe Fermi level by tensile strain, indicating the origin of the enhanced ORR\nkinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 22:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

This suggests that the relaxation time\napproximation may be too crude to obtain a reliable form of $\\zeta/\\tau_R$ for\ngases obeying Bose-Einstein statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 05:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 23:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work has studied adversarial\nattacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify\nthe content of the unknown file without execution. However, since the majority\nof malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on\nstatic analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this\nlimitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by\nemulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning\nin a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after\nunpacking or decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of\ncrafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on\nsparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in\nimages. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive\nmechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and\nensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense.\nExperiments show that with these three defensive strategies, the number of\nsuccessfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to a standard\nbaseline system without any defenses. In particular, the ensemble defense is\nthe most resilient to adversarial attacks. Importantly, none of the defenses\nsignificantly reduce the classification accuracy for detecting malware.\nFinally, we demonstrate that while adding additional hidden layers to neural\nmodels does not significantly improve the malware classification accuracy, it\ndoes significantly increase the classifier's robustness to adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 08:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

Despite the breakthroughs achieved by using CNN models, there are\nstill some problems remaining unsolved, such as how to recover high frequency\ndetails of high resolution images.

Although the high resolution images constructed by\nthese models have high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), they often tend to be\nblurry and lack high-frequency details, especially at a large scaling factor.\nIn this paper, we build a super resolution perceptual generative adversarial\nnetwork (SRPGAN) framework for SISR tasks.

The charge of each component\nof VNABI is assumed to satisfy the Dirac quantization condition. %%%%% Each\ncolor component of the non-Abelian electric field $E^a$ is squeezed by the\ncorresponding color component of the solenoidal current $J^a_{\\mu}$. Then only\nthe color singlets alone can survive as a physical state and non-Abelian color\nconfinement is realized.\n  Numerical studies are done in the framework of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory.\nWe adopt an Abelian-like definition of monopole following DeGrand-Toussaint as\na lattice version of VNABI. To reduce severe lattice artifacts, we introduce\nvarious techniques of smoothing the thermalized vacuum such as the maximal\ncenter gauge (MCG) fixing. We measure the density\n$\\rho(a(\\beta),n)=\\sqrt{(k_n^1)^2+(k_n^2)^2+(k_n^3)^2}/(4\\sqrt{4}Vb^3)$, where\n$k_n^a$ is an $n$ blocked monopole in the color direction $a$ and $b=na(\\beta)$\nis the blocked lattice spacing. Beautiful scaling behaviors are seen when we\nplot $\\rho(a(\\beta),n)$ versus $b=na(\\beta)$. A single universal curve\n$\\rho(b)$ is found from $n=1\\sim 12$, which suggests that $\\rho(a(\\beta),n)$ is\na function of $b=na(\\beta)$ alone. The universal curve seems independent of a\ngauge fixing procedure used to smooth the lattice vacuum when the scaling is\nobtained. The scaling shows that the lattice definition of VNABI has the\ncontinuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 11:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 00:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

We find that, as compared to random and shuffled initial\nconditions, the hierarchical ultrametric-like organization of empirical\ncultural states significantly increases the predictability of the final social\ncontent by largely confining cultural convergence within the lower levels of\nthe hierarchy. Moreover, predictability correlates with the compatibility of\nshort-term social coordination and long-term cultural diversity, a property\nthat has been recently found to be strong and robust in empirical data. We also\nintroduce a null model generating initial conditions that retain the\nultrametric representation of real data. Using this ultrametric model,\npredictability is highly enhanced with respect to the random and shuffled\ncases, confirming the usefulness of the empirical hierarchical organization of\nculture for forecasting the outcome of social influence models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 13:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

As the\nstars age, this power law decreases in slope until it becomes nearly flat at\n~100 Myr, at which point the hierarchical structure has disappeared. The fact\nthat the TPCF remains nearly a power law during this time implies that the\ndispersal mechanism is somewhat independent of scale. This rules out dispersal\nby random stellar motions at either the local gas turbulent speed or a constant\nspeed, because in both cases the hierarchy would disappear at small scales\nfirst, causing the TPCF to bend over. Destruction by shear has the right\nproperty as the shear rate in a galaxy is independent of scale for kpc-size\nregions, but shear converts the hierarchy into an azimuthal stream which still\nhas a power-law TPCF. What does explain the observation is the overlapping of\nseveral independent hierarchies from successive generations of star formation\nin the same region.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end image\ncompression framework based on convolutional neural network to resolve the\nproblem of non-differentiability of the quantization function in the standard\ncodec. First, the feature description neural network is used to get a valid\ndescription in the low-dimension space with respect to the ground-truth image\nso that the amount of image data is greatly reduced for storage or\ntransmission. After image's valid description, standard image codec such as\nJPEG is leveraged to further compress image, which leads to image's great\ndistortion and compression artifacts, especially blocking artifacts, detail\nmissing, blurring, and ringing artifacts. Then, we use a post-processing neural\nnetwork to remove these artifacts. Due to the challenge of directly learning a\nnon-linear function for a standard codec based on convolutional neural network,\nwe propose to learn a virtual codec neural network to approximate the\nprojection from the valid description image to the post-processed compressed\nimage, so that the gradient could be efficiently back-propagated from the\npost-processing neural network to the feature description neural network during\ntraining. Meanwhile, an advanced learning algorithm is proposed to train our\ndeep neural networks for compression.

Previous analyses found similar results for designer\nand Hu-Sawicki $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity models using the Effective Field Theory\n(EFT) approach (Raveri et al. 2014, Hu et al. 2016), therefore this hints for\nthe fact that generic $f(\\mathcal{R})$ models with $w\\neq-1$ can be tightly\nconstrained by current cosmological data, complementary to solar system tests\n(Brax et al. 2008, Faulkner et al. 2007). When compared to a $w$CDM fluid with\nthe same sound speed, we find that the equation of state for $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nmodels is better constrained to be close to -1 by about an order of magnitude,\ndue to the strong dependence of the perturbations on $w$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 15:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 19:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

A plane progressive wave field with an arbitrary angle of\nincidence propagating in an inviscid fluid is assumed. Initially, an effective\nfield incident on the particle (including the principal incident field, the\nreflected wave-field from the boundary and the scattered field from the image\nobject) is defined. Subsequently, the incident effective field is utilized in\nconjunction with the scattered one from the object, to obtain closed-form\nexpansions for the longitudinal and transversal force components, in addition\nto the axial torque component, based on the scattering in the far-field. The\nobtained solutions involve the angle of incidence, the modal coefficients of\nthe scatterer and its image, and the particle-wall distance.
