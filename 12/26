Since the proposal of\nfully convolutional neural network (FCNN), it has been widely used in semantic\nsegmentation because of its high accuracy of pixel-wise classification as well\nas high precision of localization. In this paper, we apply several famous FCNN\nto brain tumor segmentation, making comparisons and adjusting network\narchitectures to achieve better performance measured by metrics such as\nprecision, recall, mean of intersection of union (mIoU) and dice score\ncoefficient (DSC). The adjustments to the classic FCNN include adding more\nconnections between convolutional layers, enlarging decoders after up sample\nlayers and changing the way shallower layers' information is reused. Besides\nthe structure modification, we also propose a new classifier with a\nhierarchical dice loss. Inspired by the containing relationship between\nclasses, the loss function converts multiple classification to multiple binary\nclassification in order to counteract the negative effect caused by imbalance\ndata set.

For the last few years, substantial progress has been\nmade on the approximate single source shortest paths problem, culminating in an\nalgorithm of Becker et al. [DISC'17] which deterministically computes\n$(1+o(1))$-approximate shortest paths in $\\tilde O(D+\\sqrt n)$ time, where $D$\nis the hop-diameter of the graph. Up to logarithmic factors, this time\ncomplexity is optimal, matching the lower bound of Elkin [STOC'04].\n  The question of exact shortest paths however saw no algorithmic progress for\ndecades, until the recent breakthrough of Elkin [STOC'17], which established a\nsublinear-time algorithm for exact single source shortest paths on undirected\ngraphs. Shortly after, Huang et al.

This\nalgorithm provides also a qualitative improvement, because it works for the\nmore challenging case of directed graphs (i.e., graphs where the two directions\nof an edge can have different weights), constituting the first sublinear-time\nalgorithm for directed graphs.

Recent academic work has demonstrated that malicious\nusers who can query such models are able to infer sensitive information about\nrecords within the training data.

As a result, if a model is trained\nwithout differential privacy guarantee, little is known or can be said about\nthe privacy risk of releasing it. In this work, we investigate and analyze\nmembership attacks to understand why and how they succeed. Based on this\nunderstanding, we propose Differential Training Privacy (DTP), an empirical\nmetric to estimate the privacy risk of publishing a classier when methods such\nas differential privacy cannot be applied. DTP is a measure of a classier with\nrespect to its training dataset, and we show that calculating DTP is efficient\nin many practical cases.

Among the\nspiral-triggering mechanisms proposed, only one establishes a causal link\nbetween shadows and spirals so far. In fact, provided the presence of shadows\nin the disc, the combined effect of temperature gradient and differential disc\nrotation, creates strong azimuthal pressure gradients. After several thousand\nyears, grand-design spirals develop in the gas phase. Previous works have only\nconsidered static shadows caused by an inclined inner disc. However, in some\ncases, the inner regions of circumbinary discs can break and precess. Thus, it\nis more realistic to consider moving shadow patterns in the disc. In this\nconfiguration, the intersection between the inner and the outer discs defines\nthe line of nodes at which the shadows are cast. Here, we consider moving\nshadows and study the resulting circumbinary disc structure. We find that only\nstatic and prograde shadows trigger spirals, in contrast to retrograde ones.\nInterestingly, if a region of the disc corotates with the shadow, a planet-like\nsignature develops at the co-rotation position. The resulting spirals resemble\nthose caused by a planet embedded in the disc, with similar pitch angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 01:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Most existing techniques for drones involve\nsending a video data streams back to a ground station with a high-end desktop\ncomputer or server. These methods share one major drawback: data transmission\nis subjected to considerable delay and possible corruption. Onboard computation\ncan not only overcome the data corruption problem but also increase the range\nof motion. Unfortunately, due to limited weight-bearing capacity, equipping\ndrones with computing hardware of high processing capability is not feasible.\nTherefore, developing a motion detection system with real-time performance and\nhigh accuracy for drones with limited computing power is highly desirable. In\nthis paper, we propose a visual-inertial drone system for real-time motion\ndetection, namely REDBEE, that helps overcome challenges in shooting scenes\nwith strong parallax and dynamic background. REDBEE, which can run on the\nstate-of-the-art commercial low-power application processor (e.g. Snapdragon\nFlight board used for our prototype drone), achieves real-time performance with\nhigh detection accuracy. The REDBEE system overcomes obstacles in shooting\nscenes with strong parallax through an inertial-aided dual-plane homography\nestimation; it solves the issues in shooting scenes with dynamic background by\ndistinguishing the moving targets through a probabilistic model based on\nspatial, temporal, and entropy consistency. The experiments are presented which\ndemonstrate that our system obtains greater accuracy when detecting moving\ntargets in outdoor environments than the state-of-the-art real-time onboard\ndetection systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 02:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

While the usual coherence\nmeasures are defined on a single system and cannot capture the nonlocal\ncorrelation between subsystems, in order to deal with the distribution of\ncoherence it is crucial to quantify the coherence in bipartite systems\nproperly. Here, we introduce incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures on\nbipartite systems, which can characterize the correlations between systems.\nAccording to the IQ coherence measures on bipartite systems, we find the\ndistribution of coherence of formation and assistance in bipartite systems: the\ntotal coherence of formation is lower bounded by the sum of coherence of\nformation in each subsystem and the entanglement of formation between the\nsubsystems, while the total coherence of assistance is upper bounded by the sum\nof coherence of assistance in each subsystem and the entanglement of assistance\nbetween subsystems. Besides, we also obtain the tradeoff relation between the\ncoherence cost and entanglement cost, distillable coherence and distillable\nentanglement in bipartite systems. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced\nhere truly capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems and reveal the\ndistribution of coherence in bipartite systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 03:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

With extensive studies on physical properties in last decades and\nincreasing industrial needs of novel products, it is necessary to comb the\nknown knowledge of quartz crystal material for novel orientations and better\nproducts as agendas in the industry. With known material properties like\nelastic, piezoelectric, dielectric, and thermal constants, we can establish the\nrelationships between vibrations and bias fields such as temperature to ensure\na resonator immunizing from excessive response to changes causing significant\ndegradation of resonator properties and performances. Since the theoretical\nframework of wave propagation in piezoelectric solids is known, we need to use\nthe existing data and results for the validation of current orientations in\nactual products. The agreement will give us needed confidence of the theory and\nanalytical procedures. Through rotations, we calculated physical properties as\nfunctions of angles and bias fields, enabling the calculation of resonator\nproperties for the identification of optimal cuts.

Many models in insurance mathematics can be\nformulated in terms of the general concept of piecewise deterministic Markov\nprocesses. In this context, one is interested in computing certain quantities\nof interest such as the probability of ruin of an insurance company, or the\ninsurance company's value, defined as the expected discounted future dividend\npayments until the time of ruin. Instead of explicitly solving the\nintegro-(partial) differential equation related to the quantity of interest\nconsidered (an approach which can only be used in few special cases), we adapt\nthe problem in a manner that allows us to apply deterministic numerical\nintegration algorithms such as quasi-Monte Carlo rules; this is in contrast to\napplying random integration algorithms such as Monte Carlo. To this end, we\nreformulate a general cost functional as a fixed point of a particular integral\noperator, which allows for iterative approximation of the functional.\nFurthermore, we introduce a smoothing technique which is applied to the\nintegrands involved, in order to use error bounds for deterministic cubature\nrules. On the analytical side, we prove a convergence result for our PDMP\napproximation, which is of independent interest as it justifies phase-type\napproximations on the process level. We illustrate the smoothing technique for\na risk-theoretic example, and provide a comparative study of deterministic and\nMonte Carlo integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 07:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 14:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This value is comparable\nto the previous value (-0.029) in the MHD simulations when magnetic\nreconnection happened and the observed normalized magnetic helicity (-0.036)\nfrom the eruption of newly emerging active regions. We found that only 8\\% of\nthe accumulated magnetic helicity is dissipated after it is injected through\nthe bottom boundary. This is in accordance with the Woltjer conjecture. Only\n2\\% of magnetic helicity injected from the bottom boundary escapes through the\ncorona. This is consistent with the observation of magnetic clouds, which could\ntake away magnetic helicity into the interplanetary space, in the case\nconsidered here, several halo CMEs and two X-class solar flares origin from\nthis active region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 09:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The 2D resonator is a\nfreestanding van der Waals heterostructure (may consist of hexagonal boron\nnitride, graphene, or other 2D materials) that hosts a quantum emitter. The\nmechanical vibration (phonon) of the 2D resonator interacts with optical\nphotons by shifting the optical transition frequency of the single-photon\nemitter with strain or the Stark effect. The mechanical vibration couples to\nmicrowave photons by shifting the resonant frequency of a LC circuit that\nincludes the membrane. Thanks to the small mass of the 2D resonator, both the\nsingle-photon optomechanical coupling strength and the electromechanical\ncoupling strength can reach strong coupling regimes.

Using a color-to-kinematics replacement\nrule proposed earlier by one of the authors, these solutions map onto radiation\nin a theory of interacting particles coupled to massless fields that include\nthe graviton, a scalar (dilaton) $\\phi$ and the Kalb-Ramond axion field\n$B_{\\mu\\nu}$. Consistency of the double copy imposes constraints on the\nparameters of the theory on both the gauge and gravity sides of the\ncorrespondence. In particular, the color charges carry a chromomagnetic\ninteraction which, in $d=4$, corresponds to a gyromagnetic ratio equal to\nDirac's value $g=2$.

The component characteristics of the He I D3 Stokes I\nprofiles are measured by the fitting system approximating them with a double\nGaussian. This model yields an He I D3 component peak intensity ratio of\n$5.5\\pm0.4$, which differs from the value of 8 expected in the optically thin\nlimit. Most of the measured Doppler velocities lie in the interval $\\pm5$ km/s,\nwith a standard deviation of $\\pm1.7$ km/s around the peak value of 0.4 km/s.\nThe wide distribution of the full-width at half maximum has two maxima at 0.25\nA and 0.30 A for the He I D3 blue component and two maxima at 0.22 A and 0.31 A\nfor the red component.

To solve this problem, we invoke a two-temperature multi-Gaussian\nmodel, consisting of two double-Gaussians, which provides a better\nrepresentation of He I D3 that is free of the wing intensity deficit. This\nmodel suggests temperatures of 11.5 kK and 91 kK, respectively, for the cool\nand the hot component of the target prominence. The cool and hot components of\na typical He I D3 profile have component peak intensity ratios of 6.6 and 8,\nimplying a prominence geometrical width of 17 Mm and an optical thickness of\n0.3 for the cool component, while the optical thickness of the hot component is\nnegligible.

This will be done by analyzing Vaidya space-time in such a massive\ntheory of gravity. As gravitational collapse is a time dependent system, we\nwill analyze it using the Vaidya space-time in massive gravity. The Vainshtein\nand dRGT mechanisms are used to obtain a ghost free massive gravity, and\nconstruct such time dependent solutions. Singularities formed, their nature and\nstrength will be studied in detail. We will also study the thermodynamical\naspects of such a geometry by calculating the important thermodynamical\nquantities for such a system, and analyzing the thermodynamical behavior of\nsuch quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 23:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 22:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional pseudospin,\nlabelling layer degrees of freedom, and the different energy bands. For\nL\\'evy-Leblond fermions an interpretation is given in terms of massless\nfermions in an effective 4D spacetime, and in this case the pseudospin is\nrelated to four dimensional chirality.
