In this formulation, each agent is influenced by\nonly a subset of the entries of a global parameter vector or model, and is\nsubject to convex constraints that are only known locally. Problems of this\ntype arise in several applications, most notably in disease propagation models,\nminimum-cost flow problems, distributed control formulations, and distributed\npower system monitoring. This work focuses on stochastic settings, where a\nstochastic risk function is associated with each agent and the objective is to\nseek the minimizer of the aggregate sum of all risks subject to a set of\nconstraints. Agents are not aware of the statistical distribution of the data\nand, therefore, can only rely on stochastic approximations in their learning\nstrategies. We derive an effective distributed learning strategy that is able\nto track drifts in the underlying parameter model. A detailed performance and\nstability analysis is carried out showing that the resulting coupled diffusion\nstrategy converges at a linear rate to an $O(\\mu)-$neighborhood of the true\npenalized optimizer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 18:29:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 22:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

Reaping the benefits of D2D-enabled\nnetworks is contingent upon choosing the optimal content dissemination policy\nsubject to resource and user distribution constraints. In this paper, a novel\nD2D network analysis framework is proposed to study the impacts of frequently\noccurring subgraphs, known as motifs, on D2D network performance and to\ndetermine an effective content dissemination strategy. In the proposed\nframework, the distribution of devices in the D2D network is modeled as a\nThomas cluster process (TCP), and two graph structures, the star and chain\nmotifs, are studied in the communication graph. Based on the properties of the\nTCP, closed-form analytical expressions for the statistical significance, the\noutage probability, as well as the average throughput per device, are derived.\nSimulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and show the\ninfluence of different system topologies on the occurrence of motifs and the\nD2D system throughput. More importantly, the results highlight that, as the\nstatistical significance of motifs increases, the system throughput will\ninitially increase, and, then, decrease. Hence, network operators can obtain\nstatistical significance regions for chain and star motifs that map to the\noptimal content dissemination performance. Furthermore, using the obtained\nregions and the analytical expressions for statistical significance, network\noperators can effectively identify which clusters of devices can be leveraged\nfor D2D communications while determining the number of serving devices in each\nidentified cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 18:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 20:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 23:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

The scaling laws\nreflect the twist of the leading Fock state for each hadron and hence the\nleading operator that creates the composite state from the vacuum. Thus, the\nconstituent counting scaling laws can be used to identify the twist of exotic\nhadronic candidates such as tetraquarks and pentaquarks. Effective field\ntheories must consistently implement the scaling rules in order to be\nconsistent with the fundamental theory. Here we examine how one can apply\nconstituent counting rules for the exclusive production of one or two neutral\nvector mesons $V^0$ in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation, processes in which the $V^0$ can\ncouple via intermediate photons. In case of a (narrow) real $V^0$, the photon\nvirtuality is fixed to a precise value $s_1 = m_{V^0}^2$, in effect treating\nthe $V^0$ as a single fundamental particle. Each real $V^0$ thus contributes to\nthe constituent counting rules with $N_{V_0} = 1$. In effect, the leading\noperator underlying the $V^0$ has twist 1. Thus, in the specific physical case\nof single or double on-shell $V^0$ production via intermediate photons, the\npredicted scaling from counting rules coincides with Vector Meson Dominance\n(VMD), an effective theory that treats $V^0$ as an elementary field. However,\nthe VMD prediction fails in the general case where the $V^0$ is not coupled\nthrough an elementary photon field, and then the leading-twist interpolating\noperator has twist $N_{V_0} = 2$. Analogous effects appear in $pp$ scattering\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 23:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

In this paper, by\ninterpreting an image patch as a signal on a weighted graph, we first argue\nthat a skeleton image---a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target\nbut smooths out the details---can be used to accurately estimate the blur\nkernel and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution.

Finally with the\ncomputed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms can be\napplied to restore the target image.

However, designing a consistent numerical algorithm, especially\nusing the high-order characteristic flux-split based finite-difference method\n(CFS-FDM) is still an open question. In this study, a systematical analysis of\nprevious algorithms of the consistent implementing the high-order CFS-FDM for\nsuch flows is performed, and the reasons of special treatments in these\nalgorithms are revealed.

To tackle this challenge, we adapt the\nconcept of `bioindicators', borrowed from ecology, to the urban context. The\nobjective is to use an `indicator group' of people to assess the quality of a\ncomplex environment and its changes over time. Specifically, we analyze 92\nmillion geolocated Twitter records across five US cities, allowing us to derive\nsocio-economic user profiles based on individual movement patterns. As a\nproof-of-concept, we define users with a `high-income-profile' as an indicator\ngroup and show that their visitation patterns are a suitable indicator for\nexpected future rent increases in different neighborhoods. The concept of\nindicator groups highlights the potential of closely monitoring only a specific\nsubset of the population, rather than the population as a whole. If the\nindicator group is defined appropriately for the phenomenon of interest, this\napproach can yield early predictions while simultaneously reducing the amount\nof data that needs to be collected and analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 13:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Our first example is related to the need of three nucleon contact\ninteraction terms suggested by chiral perturbation theory. The relationship of\nthe two low-energy effective coupling parameters for the relevant three nucleon\ncontact interaction terms $c_D$ and $c_E$ that reproduce the binding energy of\n$^3$H and $^3$He has been emphasized and the physically relevant parameter\nregion has been illustrated using the binding energy of $^4$He. Further\njustification of A-body interaction terms is outlined based on the\nOkubo-Lee-Suzuki effective interaction method used in solving the nuclear\nmany-body problem within a finite model space. The third example we use is an\nexactly solvable A-body extended pairing interaction applied to heavy nuclei\nwith a long isotopic chains, in particular using $^{132}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb as\nclosed core system illustrates a remarkable relationship between the extended\npairing strength $G(A)$ and the size of the valence space $\\dim(A)$ for the\nmembers of these two isotope chain: $G(A)=\\alpha\\dim(A)^{-\\beta}$ with\n$\\alpha=259.436$ for Sn and $\\alpha=366.77$ for Pb while the parameter $\\beta$\nis practically 1. These three cases present evidence for the need of better\nunderstanding of the three-nucleon (NNN), four-nucleon (NNNN), and A-body\ninteractions in nuclei either derived from ChPT or from a phenomenological\nconsiderations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 18:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 22:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Inspired by practices of\ncross-issue movement building, we have developed a general model of multi-issue\nopinion dynamics where agreement on one issue can promote greater inclusivity\nin discussing other issues, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of exclusivist\ninteraction, where individuals engage only if they agree sufficiently on every\nissue considered. Our model shows that as more issues come into play, consensus\nand solidarity can only be maintained if inclusivity towards differing\npositions is increased. We further investigate whether greater inclusivity and\ncompromise across issues lead people towards or away from normative truth,\nthereby addressing concerns about the non-ideal nature of political consensus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 19:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

We propose that the capacity of the enzymes\nSUV39H1/2 to rebind to a minor fraction of their products, either directly or\nvia HP1, contributes to the solidity of this mark through (i) a positive\nfeedback involved in its establishment by the mutual enforcement of H3K9me3 and\nSUV39H1/2 and then (ii) a negative feedback sufficient to strongly stabilize\nH3K9me3 heterochromatin in post-mitotic cells by generating local enzyme\nconcentrations capable of counteracting transient bursts of demethylation. This\nmodel does not require direct molecular interactions with adjacent nucleosomes\nand is favoured by a series of additional mechanisms including (i) the\nprotection of chromatin-bound SUV39H1/2 from the turnovers of soluble proteins,\nwhich can explain the uncoupling between the cellular contents in SUV39H1 mRNA\nand protein; (ii) the cooperative dependence on the local density of the\nH3K9me3 of HP1-dependent heterochomatin condensation and, dispensably (iii)\nrestricted enzyme exchanges with chromocenters confining the reactive bursts of\nSUV39H1/2 in heterochromatin.
