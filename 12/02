This can lead to observable charge separation along the\ndirection of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic\neffect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the\ncharge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$) is the intrinsic\nparticle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal\nelliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field\ndirection and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the\n$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two\nstudies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au\ncollisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry\nfluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting\na background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au\ncollisions where the multiplicity and $v_{2}$ scaled correlator is similar.

Signal at low $m_{inv}$, extracted from a\ntwo-component model assuming smooth mass dependence, is consistent with zero\nwithin uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 16:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

The peculiar\ndynamics of such a wake are first characterized through the trajectories of the\npressure barycenter over the rear part of the model as well as the\nrecirculation barycenter in the wake.

It was shown recently that the time-fluctuations of the pressure\nbarycenter could be characterized as a weak chaotic system with a well-defined\nattractor. We show that the dynamics of the bimodal wake can then be forced\ninto a stable asymmetric or symmetric state in open loop control, using\ntangential continuous or pulsed blowing in three different regions along the\nupper edge of the rear part of the model. Finally, a simple closed-loop\nopposition control, based on real-time identification of the wake barycenter in\nthe PIV fields, is used to force the chaotic dynamics of the wake into a\nregular oscillatory motion at a well-controlled frequency. Depending on the\nactuation parameters, the wake dynamics can also be switched from bimodal to a\nnew multimodal behavior. We show that this new mode also exhibits a peculiar\ndynamics with an up-down instead of left-right chaotic oscillations.\nInterestingly, the recirculation area (size of the recirculation bubble) is\nmuch more reduced for the closed-loop experiments when the jets are pulsed\nrather than continuous.

We show that this is\nnot the case, i.e., that there exists an infinite family of closed 3-manifolds\nnot admitting triangulations of bounded pathwidth or treewidth (the latter\nimplies the former, but we present two separate proofs).\n  We derive these results from work of Agol, of Scharlemann and Thompson, and\nof Scharlemann, Schultens and Saito by exhibiting explicit connections between\nthe topology of a 3-manifold M on the one hand and width-type parameters of the\ndual graphs of triangulations of M on the other hand, answering a question that\nhad been raised repeatedly by researchers in computational 3-manifold topology.\nIn particular, we show that if a closed, orientable, irreducible, non-Haken\n3-manifold M has a triangulation of treewidth (resp. pathwidth) k then the\nHeegaard genus of M is at most 18(k+1) (resp. 4(3k+1)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 18:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 16:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 09:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 22:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

The\nhighest accuracy of color correction is obtained with learning-based color\nconstancy methods, but they require a significant amount of calibrated training\nimages with known ground-truth illumination. Such calibration is time\nconsuming, preferably done for each sensor individually, and therefore a major\nbottleneck in acquiring high color constancy accuracy. Statistics-based methods\ndo not require calibrated training images, but they are less accurate. In this\npaper an unsupervised learning-based method is proposed that learns its\nparameter values after approximating the unknown ground-truth illumination of\nthe training images, thus avoiding calibration. In terms of accuracy the\nproposed method outperforms all statistics-based and many learning-based\nmethods. An extension of the method is also proposed, which learns the needed\nparameters from non-calibrated images taken with one sensor and which can then\nbe successfully applied to images taken with another sensor.

The number density of such objects, and\nprospects for their detection as they penetrate through the Solar System, were\nspeculated about for decades, recently rising high hopes with the Pan-STARRS\nand LSST surveys.

A critical value of Cauchy number\n($Ca$) exists at which the total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid\nupright plate is minimum at a given Reynolds number.

This\ndiscrepancy could be explained by a DM $\\rightarrow a \\rightarrow \\gamma$\ndecay, where the DM particles decay to axion-like particles (ALPs), which then\nconvert to photons in a magnetic field. The 3.55 keV line from a decay to ALPs\ntherefore has very different morphology from a direct decay to photons, as it\nwould only appear in environments with substantial magnetic fields between the\nsource and us.

This paper reports the\ndevelopment of an open-source software framework, termed PorePy, which is aimed\nat simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs,\nas well as deformation of the reservoir due to shearing along fracture and\nfault planes. Starting from a description of fractures as polygons embedded in\na 3D domain, PorePy provides semi-automatic gridding to construct a\ndiscrete-fracture-matrix model, which forms the basis for subsequent\nsimulations. PorePy allows for flow and transport in all lower-dimensional\nobjects, including planes (2D) representing fractures, and lines (1D) and\npoints (0D), representing fracture intersections. Interaction between processes\nin neighboring domains of different dimension is implemented as a sequence of\ncouplings of objects one dimension apart. This readily allows for handling of\ncomplex fracture geometries compared to capabilities of existing software. In\naddition to flow and transport, PorePy provides models for rock mechanics,\nporo-elasticity and coupling with fracture deformation models.

The\nmechanisms that transport non-thermal energy to and deposit it in the\nchromosphere are still not understood. Aims. We aim to investigate the\natmospheric structure and heating of the solar chromosphere in an emerging flux\nregion. Methods. We use observations taken with the CHROMIS and CRISP\ninstruments on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in the Ca II K, Ca II 854.2 nm,\nH$\\alpha$, and Fe I 630.1 nm and 630.2 nm lines. We analyse the various line\nprofiles and in addition perform multi-line, multi-species, non-Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions to estimate the spatial and\ntemporal variation of the chromospheric structure. Results. We investigate\nwhich spectral features of Ca II K contribute to the frequency-integrated Ca II\nK brightness, which we use as a tracer of chromospheric radiative losses. The\nmajority of the radiative losses are not associated with localized high-Ca II\nK-brightness events, but instead with a more gentle, spatially extended, and\npersistent heating. The frequency-integrated Ca II K brightness correlates\nstrongly with the total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, while\nthe Ca II K profile shapes indicate that the bulk of the radiative losses occur\nin the lower chromosphere.\n  Non-LTE inversions indicate a transition from heating concentrated around\nphotospheric magnetic elements below $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-3$ to a more\nspace-filling and time-persistent heating above $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-4$. The\ninferred gas temperature at $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-3.8$ correlates strongly with\nthe total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, suggesting that that\nthe heating rate correlates with the strength of the horizontal magnetic field\nin the low chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 19:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The primary\ningredient in these analyses is the population-averaged sensitive volume.\nTypically, sensitive volume, of a given search to a given simulated source\npopulation, is estimated by drawing signals from the population model and\nadding them to the detector data as injections. Subsequently injections, which\nare simulated gravitational waveforms, are searched for by the search pipelines\nand their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is determined. Sensitive volume is\nestimated, by using Monte-Carlo (MC) integration, from the total number of\ninjections added to the data, the number of injections that cross a chosen\nthreshold on SNR and the astrophysical volume in which the injections are\nplaced. So far, only fixed population models have been used in the estimation\nof the merger rates. However, as the scope of population analysis broaden in\nterms of the methodologies and source properties considered, due to an increase\nin the number of observed GW signals, the procedure will need to be repeated\nmultiple times at a large computational cost. In this letter we address the\nproblem by performing a weighted MC integration. We show how a single set of\ngeneric injections can be weighted to estimate the sensitive volume for\nmultiple population models; thereby greatly reducing the computational cost.\nThe weights in this MC integral are the ratios of the output probabilities,\ndetermined by the population model and standard cosmology, and the injection\nprobability, determined by the distribution function of the generic injections.\nUnlike analytical/semi-analytical methods, which usually estimate sensitive\nvolume using single detector sensitivity, the method is accurate within\nstatistical errors, comes at no added cost and requires minimal computational\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 20:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 15:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

We compute from first principles the\nelectron-phonon scattering and the phonon-limited hole mobility of naphthalene\ncrystal in the framework of ab initio band theory.

Conventional ERLs are based on an\nelectron beam circulating through the same set of rf cavity cells. This leads\nto an accumulation of high-order modes inside the cavity cells, resulting in\nthe development of a beam breakup (BBU) instability, unless the beam current is\nkept below the BBU start current. This limits the maximum current which can be\ntransported through the ERL and hence the intensity of the photon beam\ngenerated. It has recently been proposed that splitting the accelerating and\ndecelerating stages, tuning them separately and coupling them via a resonance\ncoupler can increase the BBU start current. The paper presents the first\nexperimental rf studies of a dual axis 7-cell asymmetric cavity and confirms\nthe properties predicted by the theoretical model.

We address our argument through\nmathematical proofs and computational methods. It is found that for the\nstandard two-process serial models, positive dependence between the total\ncompletion times does not hold if no specific distributional forms are imposed\nto the processing times. By contrast, for the standard two-process parallel\nmodels the total completion times are independent. According to different\nnature of process dependence, one can distinguish a standard two process serial\nmodel from a standard two-process parallel model. We also find that in standard\ntwo-process parallel models the monotonicity of survival function of the\nintercompletion time of stage 2 conditional on the completion of stage 1\ndepends on the monotonicity of the hazard function of processing time. We also\nfind that the survival of intercompletion time(s) from stage 1 to stage 2 is\nincreasing when the ratio of hazard function meets certain criterion.

Thus, a common approach is to first\nplan in the low-dimensional space induced by the robot's feet---a task referred\nto as footstep planning. This low-dimensional plan is then used to guide the\nfull motion of the robot. One approach that has proven successful in footstep\nplanning is using search-based planners such as A* and its many variants. To do\nso, these search-based planners have to be endowed with effective heuristics to\nefficiently guide them through the search space. However, designing effective\nheuristics is a time-consuming task that requires the user to have good domain\nknowledge. Thus, our goal is to be able to effectively plan the footstep\nmotions taken by a humanoid robot while obviating the burden on the user to\ncarefully design local-minima free heuristics. To this end, we propose to use\nuser-defined homotopy classes in the workspace that are intuitive to define.\nThese homotopy classes are used to automatically generate heuristic functions\nthat efficiently guide the footstep planner. Additionally, we present an\nextension to homotopy classes such that they are applicable to complex\nmulti-level environments. We compare our approach for footstep planning with a\nstandard approach that uses a heuristic common to footstep planning. In simple\nscenarios, the performance of both algorithms is comparable. However, in more\ncomplex scenarios our approach allows for a speedup in planning of several\norders of magnitude when compared to the standard approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 01:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 06:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Because hashing codes learning is NP-hard, many methods resort to\nsome form of relaxation technique. But the performance of these methods can\neasily deteriorate due to the relaxation. Luckily, many supervised hashing\nformulations can be viewed as energy functions, hence solving hashing codes is\nequivalent to learning marginals in the corresponding conditional random field\n(CRF). By minimizing the KL divergence between a fully factorized distribution\nand the Gibbs distribution of this CRF, a set of consistency equations can be\nobtained, but updating them in parallel may not yield a local optimum since the\nvariational lower bound is not guaranteed to increase.

Random Walk with Restart (RWR) is a popular measure to estimate the\nsimilarity between nodes and has been exploited in numerous applications. Many\nreal-world graphs are dynamic with frequent insertion/deletion of edges; thus,\ntracking RWR scores on dynamic graphs in an efficient way has aroused much\ninterest among data mining researchers. Recently, dynamic RWR models based on\nthe propagation of scores across a given graph have been proposed, and have\nsucceeded in outperforming previous other approaches to compute RWR\ndynamically. However, those models fail to guarantee exactness and convergence\ntime for updating RWR in a generalized form. In this paper, we propose OSP, a\nfast and accurate algorithm for computing dynamic RWR with insertion/deletion\nof nodes/edges in a directed/undirected graph. When the graph is updated, OSP\nfirst calculates offset scores around the modified edges, propagates the offset\nscores across the updated graph, and then merges them with the current RWR\nscores to get updated RWR scores. We prove the exactness of OSP and introduce\nOSP-T, a version of OSP which regulates a trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputation time by using error tolerance {\\epsilon}. Given restart probability\nc, OSP-T guarantees to return RWR scores with O ({\\epsilon} /c ) error in O\n(log ({\\epsilon}/2)/log(1-c)) iterations. Through extensive experiments, we\nshow that OSP tracks RWR exactly up to 4605x faster than existing static RWR\nmethod on dynamic graphs, and OSP-T requires up to 15x less time with 730x\nlower L1 norm error and 3.3x lower rank error than other state-of-the-art\ndynamic RWR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 12:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The\nframework is a two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module. The\ntwo streams encode appearance and motion cues in a video sequence respectively,\nwhile the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time, exploiting\nthe temporal consistency. The motion stream is a convolutional neural network\ntrained on synthetic videos to segment independently moving objects in the\noptical flow field. The module to build a 'visual memory' in video, i.e., a\njoint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional\nrecurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences.\n  For every pixel in a frame of a test video, our approach assigns an object or\nbackground label based on the learned spatio-temporal features as well as the\n'visual memory' specific to the video.

This\nimprovement, which has a physical meaning, is necessary in some cases to obtain\na good fit of the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 21:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}
