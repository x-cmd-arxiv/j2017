We use the quaternionic spinor\nformalism which is in one-to-one correspondence with the usual spinor language.\nNo unphysical degrees of freedom are admitted, in contrast to the majority of\nliterature on quaternions. In this paper we first build a Dirac Lagrangian in\nthe quaternionic form, derive the Dirac equation and take the non-relativistic\nlimit to find the Schr\\\"odinger's equation. We show that the quaternionic\nformalism is a natural choice to start with, while in the transition to the\nnon-interacting non-relativistic limit the quaternionic description effectively\nreduces to the regular complex wavefunction language. We provide an easy to use\ngrammar for switching between the ordinary spinor language and the description\nin terms of quaternions. As an illustration of the broader range of the\nformalism, we also derive the Maxwell's equation from the quaternionic\nLagrangian of Quantum Electrodynamics. In order to derive the equations of\nmotion, we develop the variational calculus appropriate for this formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 17:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 15:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

It is natural for a learning\nagent to associate image patterns with the magnitude of their displacement over\ntime: as the agent moves, faraway mountains don't move much; nearby trees move\na lot. This natural relationship between the appearance of objects and their\nmotion is a rich source of information about the world. In this work, we start\nby training a deep network, using fully automatic supervision, to predict\nrelative scene depth from single images. The relative depth training images are\nautomatically derived from simple videos of cars moving through a scene, using\nrecent motion segmentation techniques, and no human-provided labels. This proxy\ntask of predicting relative depth from a single image induces features in the\nnetwork that result in large improvements in a set of downstream tasks\nincluding semantic segmentation, joint road segmentation and car detection, and\nmonocular (absolute) depth estimation, over a network trained from scratch. The\nimprovement on the semantic segmentation task is greater than those produced by\nany other automatically supervised methods. Moreover, for monocular depth\nestimation, our unsupervised pre-training method even outperforms supervised\npre-training with ImageNet. In addition, we demonstrate benefits from learning\nto predict (unsupervised) relative depth in the specific videos associated with\nvarious downstream tasks. We adapt to the specific scenes in those tasks in an\nunsupervised manner to improve performance. In summary, for semantic\nsegmentation, we present state-of-the-art results among methods that do not use\nsupervised pre-training, and we even exceed the performance of supervised\nImageNet pre-trained models for monocular depth estimation, achieving results\nthat are comparable with state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 15:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Relative to the shortest wavelength band, UVW2, the lags of\nthe other UV and optical bands are mostly in agreement with the predictions of\nreprocessing of high energy emission from an accretion disc. The U-band lag is,\nhowever, far larger than expected, almost certainly because of reprocessed\nBalmer continuum emission from the more distant broad line region gas. The UVW2\nband is well correlated with the X-rays but lags by ~6x more than expected if\nthe UVW2 results from reprocessing of X-rays on the accretion disc. However, if\nthe lightcurves are filtered to remove variations on timescales >5d, the lag\napproaches the expectation from disc reprocessing.

A reanalysis of the\nlonger-exposure, sub-surface CDMS-I results (published in 2002) improves the\nprevious cross section reach by two orders of magnitude, for masses up to\n$10^{15} \\,\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.

Secondly, we drive an\nalgorithm which is optimized to reduce memory and computation requirements.\nFinally, we present evaluation of our Alt-Min approach using IKEA 3D data and\ndemonstrate significant improvement in recovery error and convergence speed\ncompared to prior tensor-based compressed sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 18:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 15:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

First, a new centralized coded caching\nscheme is developed that utilizes maximum distance separable (MDS) coding,\njointly optimizes cache placement and delivery phase, and enables decomposing\nthe combination network into a set virtual multicast sub-networks. It is shown\nthat if the sum of the memory of an end user and its connected relay nodes is\nsufficient to store the database, then the server can disengage in the delivery\nphase and all the end users' requests can be satisfied by the caches in the\nnetwork. Lower bounds on the normalized delivery load using genie-aided cut-set\narguments are presented along with second hop optimality. Next recognizing the\ninformation security concerns of coded caching, this new model is studied under\nthree different secrecy settings: 1) secure delivery where we require an\nexternal entity must not gain any information about the database files by\nobserving the transmitted signals over the network links, 2) secure caching,\nwhere we impose the constraint that end users must not be able to obtain any\ninformation about files that they did not request, and 3) both secure delivery\nand secure caching, simultaneously.

We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code\nPhantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31\nalong a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures\nresembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating\nplanar structure formed around M31 from the transferred material. It had a size\nsimilar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the\nsimulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the\ntidal features observed around M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the\nMW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A\ncloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the\nactual MW satellite system.

We generalize this concept to a system of extended objects, such as\nstrings and membranes, arguing that such a system can also exhibit localization\nin the presence of sufficiently strong disorder (randomness) in the\nHamiltonian. We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string. The eigenstates of the system can then be\nconstructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string locator expansion.' We\npropose a type of out-of-time-order string correlator as a diagnostic of such a\nstring localized phase.

They are therefore crucial for galaxy formation,\nbut their driving mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent studies have\ndemonstrated that cosmic rays (CRs) can drive outflows if active CR transport\nis taken into account. Using hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies\nwith virial masses between $10^{10}$ and $10^{13}\\mathrm{~M_\\odot}$, we study\nhow the properties of CR-driven winds depend on halo mass. CRs are treated in a\ntwo-fluid approximation and their transport is modelled through isotropic or\nanisotropic diffusion. We find that CRs are only able to drive mass-loaded\nwinds beyond the virial radius in haloes with masses below\n$10^{12}\\mathrm{~M_\\odot}$. For our lowest examined halo mass, the wind is\nroughly spherical and has velocities of $\\sim20\\mathrm{~km\\;s^{-1}}$. With\nincreasing halo mass, the wind becomes biconical and can reach ten times higher\nvelocities. The mass loading factor drops rapidly with virial mass, a\ndependence that approximately follows a power-law with a slope between $-1$ and\n$-2$. This scaling is slightly steeper than observational inferences, and also\nsteeper than commonly used prescriptions for wind feedback in cosmological\nsimulations. The slope is quite robust to variations of the CR injection\nefficiency or the CR diffusion coefficient. In contrast to the mass loading,\nthe energy loading shows no significant dependence on halo mass. While these\nscalings are close to successful heuristic models of wind feedback, the\nCR-driven winds in our present models are not yet powerful enough to fully\naccount for the required feedback strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

In particular, the mathematical assumption of independent\nerrors in quantum logic operations is at odds with realistic environments where\nerror-sources may exhibit strong temporal correlations. We present experiments\nenabling the identification of error correlations between operations in quantum\ncircuits, using only projective measurements at the end of the circuit. Using a\nsingle trapped ion qubit and engineered noise with tunable temporal\ncorrelations, we identify a clear signature of error correlations between\nsequential gates in randomly composed quantum circuits, and extract\nquantitative measures linked to the underlying noise correlation length. By\nreplacing all gates in these circuits with \"virtual\" dynamically corrected\ngates (DCGs), we demonstrate that even in the presence of strongly correlated\nnoise the signatures of error correlations between sequential gates appear\nsimilar to standard gates exposed to uncorrelated noise. A theoretical model\napplied to our experiments reveals that common DCGs suppress the correlated\nerror component by over $270\\times$ with $95\\%$ confidence. Using\nblock-correlated noise, we explore the scaling of the effective error\ncorrelation length at the virtual level, and show that DCGs exhibit error\ncorrelations indistinguishable from those arising from uncorrelated noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

We study the long-time numerical energy conservation not\nonly for symmetric integrators but also for symplectic integrators.

To prove the result for symmetric integrators, a relationship\nbetween symmetric ERKN integrators and trigonometric integrators is established\nby using Strang splitting and based on this connection, the long-time\nconservation is derived.

One of the key novelties of our formulation is a\nhierarchal optimization routine which alternately operates in the space of\nangular accelerations and linear velocities. That is, the optimization has a\ntwo layer structure wherein angular accelerations are optimized keeping the\nlinear velocities fixed and vice versa. If the vehicle/obstacles are modeled as\ncircles than the velocity optimization layer can be shown to have the\ncomputationally efficient difference of convex structure commonly observed for\nlinear systems. This leads to a less conservative approximation as compared to\nthat obtained by approximating each polygon individually through its\ncircumscribing circle. On the other hand, it leads to optimization problem with\nless number of constraints as compared to that obtained when approximating\npolygons as multiple overlapping circles.

This memory technology is considered to have the performance like that\nof DRAM and persistence like that of disks. Thus, it would also provide\nsignificant performance benefits for big data applications by allowing\nin-memory processing of large data with the lowest latency to persistence.\nLeveraging the performance benefits of this memory-centric computing technology\nthrough traditional memory programming is not trivial and the challenges\naggravate for parallel/concurrent applications. To this end, several\nprogramming abstractions have been proposed like NVthreads, Mnemosyne and\nintel's NVML. However, deciding upon a programming abstraction which is easier\nto program and at the same time ensures the consistency and balances various\nsoftware and architectural trade-offs is openly debatable and active area of\nresearch for NVM community.\n  We study the NVthreads, Mnemosyne and NVML libraries by building a concurrent\nand persistent set and open addressed hash-table data structure application. In\nthis process, we explore and report various tradeoffs and hidden costs involved\nin building concurrent applications for persistence in terms of achieving\nefficiency, consistency and ease of programming with these NVM programming\nabstractions. Eventually, we evaluate the performance of the set and hash-table\ndata structure applications.

For example, systematic variation of the exchange\ncoupling strength can be used to create systems that behave as if they are\ncomprised of virtually independent segments that exhibit \"local\" Curie\ntemperatures. Such localization of thermodynamic behavior leads to boundaries\nbetween strongly and weakly magnetized regions that can be controllably moved\nwithin the material with temperature. The utility of this interesting\nfunctionality is largely dependent on the inherent spatial resolution of\nmagnetic properties - specifically the distance over which the exchange\nstrength and corresponding properties behave locally. To test the degree to\nwhich this type of localization can be realized in materials, we have\nfabricated epitaxial films of Co[1-x]Ru[x] alloy featuring a nanometer scale\ntriangular wave-like concentration depth profile. Continuous nanoscale\nmodulation of the local Curie temperature was observed using polarized neutron\nreflectometry. These results are consistent with mean-field simulations of spin\nsystems that encompass the possibility of delocalized exchange coupling, and\nshow that composition grading can be used to localize magnetic properties in\nfilms down to the nanometer level.

This definition captures the underlying group\nstructure for the hypotheses belonging to a group more effectively than the\nstandard two-class mixture model. Two new Lfdr based methods, possessing\nmeaningful optimalities, are produced in their oracle forms. One, designed to\ncontrol false discoveries across the entire collection of hypotheses, is\nproposed as a powerful alternative to simply pooling all the hypotheses into a\nsingle group and using commonly used Lfdr based method under the standard\nsingle-group two-class mixture model. The other is proposed as an Lfdr analog\nof the method of Benjamini and Bogomolov (2014) for selective inference. It\ncontrols Lfdr based measure of false discoveries associated with selecting\ngroups concurrently with controlling the average of within-group false\ndiscovery proportions across the selected groups.

Recent experiments showing an\nunexpected linear-in-field, $B$, magnetoresistivity have deepened the puzzle.\nWe propose a simple model of itinerant electrons, interacting via random\ncouplings with electrons localized on a lattice of quantum 'dots' or 'islands'.\nThis model is solvable in a large-$N$ limit, and can reproduce observed\nbehavior. The key feature of our model is that the electrons in each quantum\ndot are described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing electrons without\nquasiparticle excitations. For a particular choice of the interaction between\nthe itinerant and localized electrons, this model realizes a controlled\ndescription of a diffusive marginal-Fermi liquid (MFL) without momentum\nconservation, which has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity and a $T \\ln T$ specific\nheat as $T\\rightarrow 0$. By tuning the strength of this interaction relative\nto the bandwidth of the itinerant electrons, we can additionally obtain a\nfinite-$T$ crossover to a fully incoherent regime that also has a linear-in-$T$\nresistivity. We show that the MFL regime has conductivities which scale as a\nfunction of $B/T$; however, its magnetoresistance saturates at large $B$. We\nthen consider a macroscopically disordered sample with domains of MFLs with\nvarying densities of electrons.

However,\nthe tension with $H_0$ obtained from the Planck satellite for a spatially-flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology suggests that systematic errors may have been\nunderestimated. The most critical one probably comes from the degeneracy\nexisting between lens models that was first formalized by the well-known\nmass-sheet transformation (MST). In this paper, we assess to what extent the\nsource position transformation (SPT), a more general invariance transformation\nwhich contains the MST as a special case, may affect the time delays predicted\nby a model. To this aim we use pySPT, a new open-source python package fully\ndedicated to the SPT that we present in a companion paper. For axisymmetric\nlenses, we find that the time delay ratios between a model and its SPT-modified\ncounterpart simply scale like the corresponding source position ratios, $\\Delta\n\\hat{t}/ \\Delta t \\approx \\hat{\\beta}/\\beta$, regardless of the mass profile\nand the isotropic SPT. Similar behavior (almost) holds for non-axisymmetric\nlenses in the double image regime and for opposite image pairs in the quadruple\nimage regime. In the latter regime, we also confirm that the time delay ratios\nare not conserved. In addition to the MST effects, the SPT-modified time delays\ndeviate in general no more than a few percent for particular image pairs,\nsuggesting that its impact on time-delay cosmography seems not be as crucial as\ninitially suspected. We also reflected upon the relevance of the SPT validity\ncriterion and present arguments suggesting that it should be reconsidered. Even\nthough a new validity criterion would affect the time delays in a different\nway, we expect from numerical simulations that our conclusions will remain\nunchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 22:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

The polarization level of PAH emission\nfeatures, for the different phases of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is\ndiscussed. We find that negatively charged smallest PAHs in the reflection\nnebula can be excited to slightly suprathermal rotation due to enhanced ion\ncollisional excitation, which enhances the degree of PAH alignment and the\npolarization level of PAH emission.

Efficient online\nmonitoring tools which can correctly identify any abnormal data stream for such\ndata are highly sought after. However, most of the existing monitoring\nprocedures directly apply the false discover rate (FDR) controlling procedure\nto the data at each time point, and the FDR at each time point (the point-wise\nFDR) is either specified by users or determined by the in-control (IC) average\nrun length (ARL). If the point-wise FDR is specified by users, the resulting\nprocedure lacks control of the global FDR and keeps users in the dark in terms\nof the IC-ARL. If the point-wise FDR is determined by the IC-ARL, the resulting\nprocedure does not give users the flexibility to choose the number of false\nalarms (Type-I errors) they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data\nstreams, which often makes the procedure too conservative. To address those\nlimitations, we propose a two-stage monitoring procedure that can control both\nthe IC-ARL and Type-I errors at the levels specified by users.

The DMD method is an ideal spatiotemporal\nmatrix decomposition that correlates spatial features of computational or\nexperimental data to periodic temporal behavior. DMD can be modified into a\nmultiresolution analysis to separate complex dynamics into a hierarchy of\nmultiresolution timescale components, where each level of the hierarchy divides\ndynamics into distinct background (slow) and foreground (fast) timescales. The\nmultiresolution DMD is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in\nan equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into\nlow-rank spatial modes and their temporal Fourier dynamics. Moreover, these\nmultiresolution DMD modes can be used to determined sparse sampling locations\nwhich are nearly optimal for dynamic regime classification and full state\nreconstruction. Specifically, optimized sensors are efficiently chosen using QR\ncolumn pivots of the DMD library, thus avoiding an NP-hard selection process.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method on several examples, including global\nsea-surface temperature data, and show that only a small number of sensors are\nneeded for accurate global reconstructions and classification of El Ni\\~no\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 03:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

This, in\nturn, has motivated researchers to come up with various classification schemes\nfor these measures. One popular approach to classify the objective measures is\nto assess the set of mathematical properties they satisfy in order to help\npractitioners select the right measure for a given problem. In this research,\nwe discuss the insufficiency of the existing properties in literature to\ncapture certain behaviors of interestingness measures. This motivates us to\npresent a novel approach to analyze and classify measures. We refer to this as\na rate of change analysis (RCA). In this analysis a measure is described by how\nit varies if there is a unit change in the frequency count\n$(f_{11},f_{10},f_{01},f_{00})$, for different pre-existing states of the\nfrequency counts. More formally, we look at the first partial derivative of the\nmeasure with respect to the various frequency count variables. We then use this\nanalysis to define two new properties, Unit-Null Asymptotic Invariance (UNAI)\nand Unit-Null Zero Rate (UNZR). UNAI looks at the asymptotic effect of adding\nfrequency patterns, while UNZR looks at the initial effect of adding frequency\npatterns when they do not pre-exist in the dataset. We present a comprehensive\nanalysis of 50 interestingness measures and classify them in accordance with\nthe two properties. We also present empirical studies, involving both synthetic\nand real-world datasets, which are used to cluster various measures according\nto the rule ranking patterns of the measures.

By combining the observed astrometry from the\nimaging data with 27 years of radial velocities, we use orbital fitting to\nconstrain its orbital and physical parameters, as well as update those of the\nplanet HD4113Ab, discovered by previous radial velocity measurements.

Nodes should never run empty, and to prevent this we may\nschedule nodes for replenishment every day. The natural feature that makes this\nproblem interesting is that we may schedule a replenishment (well) before a\nnode becomes empty, but then the next replenishment will be due earlier also.\nThis added workload needs to be balanced against the cost of routing vehicles\nto do the replenishments. In this paper, we focus on the aspect of minimizing\nrouting costs. However, the framework of recurring tasks, in which the next job\nof a task must be done within a fixed amount of time after the previous one is\nmuch more general and gives an adequate model for many practical situations.\n  Note that our problem has an infinite time horizon.

With the aid of DNS local quantities like the surfactant\ndistribution on the bubble surface can be accessed for a better understanding\nof the physical phenomena occurring close to the interface. The core part of\nthe physical model consists in the description of the surfactant transport in\nthe bulk and on the deformable interface.

A\nsubgrid-scale (SGS) model is employed in the cases where a fully resolved DNS\nfor the species transport is not feasible due to high mesh resolution\nrequirements and, therefore, high computational costs. After an exhaustive\nvalidation of the latest numerical developments, the DNS of single rising\nbubbles in contaminated solutions is compared to experimental results. The full\nvelocity transients of the rising bubbles, especially the contaminated ones,\nare correctly reproduced by the DNS.

This anomalous\ndiffusion is archetypal for living cells, where cytoplasm is known to be\nviscoelastic and a spatial disorder also naturally emerges. We obtain some\nfirst important insights into it within a model one-dimensional study. Two\nbasic types of potential correlations are studied: short-range exponentially\ndecaying and algebraically slow decaying with an infinite correlation length,\nboth for a moderate (several $k_BT$, in the units of thermal energy), and\nstrong (5-10 $k_BT$) disorder. For a moderate disorder, it is shown that on the\nensemble level viscoelastic subdiffusion can easily overcome the medium's\ndisorder. Asymptotically, it is not distinguishable from the disorder-free\nsubdiffusion. However, a strong scatter in single-trajectory averages is\nnevertheless seen even for a moderate disorder. It features a weak ergodicity\nbreaking, which occurs on a very long yet transient time scale. Furthermore,\nfor a strong disorder, a very long transient regime of logarithmic, Sinai-type\ndiffusion emerges. It can last longer and be faster in the absolute terms for\nweakly decaying correlations as compare with the short-range correlations.\nResidence time distributions in a finite spatial domain are of a generalized\nlog-normal type and are reminiscent also of a stretched exponential\ndistribution.

Simulated BMDDs\nobtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under\ndifferent assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with\nexperimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an\nabrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a\npile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally.\nWith a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium\ncapacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover\nBMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a\ndistinctive asymmetric peak shape.

In this\npaper, we present a novel feature-augmented random forest (FARF) for image\nsuper-resolution, where the conventional gradient-based features are augmented\nwith gradient magnitudes and different feature recipes are formulated on\ndifferent stages in an RF. The advantages of our method are that, firstly, the\ndictionary-learning-based features are enhanced by adding gradient magnitudes,\nbased on the observation that the non-linear gradient magnitude are with highly\ndiscriminative property. Secondly, generalized locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)\nis used to replace principal component analysis (PCA) for feature\ndimensionality reduction and original high-dimensional features are employed,\ninstead of the compressed ones, for the leaf-nodes' regressors, since\nregressors can benefit from higher dimensional features. This\noriginal-compressed coupled feature sets scheme unifies the unsupervised LSH\nevaluation on both image super-resolution and content-based image retrieval\n(CBIR). Finally, we present a generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR)\nmodel for the leaf-nodes' regressors. Experiment results on several public\nbenchmark datasets show that our FARF method can achieve an average gain of\nabout 0.3 dB, compared to traditional RF-based methods.

We connect two\nperformance measures that are well studied, but appear to be unrelated. The\nfirst measure is concerned with energy metrics, namely the $\\Hcal_2$--norm of a\nnetwork, which arises in control theory applications. The second measure is\nconcerned with the notion of \"tail risk\" which arises in economic and financial\nnetworks. We study the question of why such performance measures may\ndeteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network. We first\nfocus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability\nGramian of the underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks\nexhibit the most graceful energy growth rates as network size grows. This rate\nis quantified completely by the proximity of spectral radius to unity or\ndistance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization\nof energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We\ndemonstrate that, for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed\nnetwork can grow at an exponentially faster rate. We provide general methods\nfor manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular, we prove that\ncertain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase\nenergy (in an order sense). Secondly, we focus on tail risk in economic and\nfinancial networks. In contrast to $\\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing\nthe expectation of energy in the network, tail risk focuses on tail probability\nbehavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially\nwe show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian.

The implications\nof the time-derivative term for the assumption of local stationarity (or local\nequilibrium) which underpins the derivation of the Kolmogorov `4/5' law for the\nthird-order structure function were studied. It was concluded that neglect of\nthe time-derivative cannot be justified by reason of restriction to certain\nscales (the inertial range) nor to large Reynolds numbers. In principle,\ntherefore, the hypothesis cannot be correct, although it may be a good\napproximation. It follows, at least in principle, that the quantitative aspects\nof the hypothesis of local stationarity could be tested by a comparison of the\nasymptotic dimensionless dissipation rate for free decay with that for the\nstationary case. But in practice this is complicated by the absence of an\nagreed evolution time for making the measurements during the decay.

Should the assumption of local\nstationarity lead to significant error, then the `4/5' law needs to be\ncorrected.

This stresses the necessity for a theoretical framework\ndedicated to the mutual relationship between the structure and dynamics in\ncomplex networks, as the two sides of the same coin. Here we propose a rigorous\nframework based on the network response over time (i.e., Green function) to\nstudy interactions between nodes across time.

In the spectrum of chaotic systems, the localized and random states\ninteract with one another and modifies the spectral statistics.

However, in real-life applications the number of clusters\nor communities (say, $K$) is generally unknown a-priori. Consequently, the\nmajority of the existing methods either choose $K$ heuristically or they repeat\nthe clustering method with different choices of $K$ and accept the best\nclustering result. The first option, more often, yields suboptimal result,\nwhile the second option is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose\nan incremental method for constructing the eigenspectrum of the graph Laplacian\nmatrix. This method leverages the eigenstructure of graph Laplacian matrix to\nobtain the $K$-th smallest eigenpair of the Laplacian matrix given a collection\nof all previously computed $K-1$ smallest eigenpairs. Our proposed method\nadapts the Laplacian matrix such that the batch eigenvalue decomposition\nproblem transforms into an efficient sequential leading eigenpair computation\nproblem. As a practical application, we consider user-guided spectral\nclustering. Specifically, we demonstrate that users can utilize the proposed\nincremental method for effective eigenpair computation and for determining the\ndesired number of clusters based on multiple clustering metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}
