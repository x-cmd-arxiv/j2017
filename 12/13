We\npropose a novel approach to minimizing the spread of an invasive species given\na limited intervention budget. We first model invasive species propagation\nusing Hawkes processes, and then derive closed-form expressions for\ncharacterizing the effect of an intervention action on the invasion process. We\nuse this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming\nformulation, and compare the optimal plan against several\necologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an\nempirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the\nfinal rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions at the end of a\ngiven time horizon. Our results show that the optimized intervention achieves\nnearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely\neradicating the species, with a 20% cost saving. Additionally, we design a\nheuristic intervention strategy based on a combination of the density and life\nstage of the invasive individuals, and find that it comes surprisingly close to\nthe optimized strategy, suggesting that this could serve as a good rule of\nthumb in invasive species management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 16:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Using PSF subtraction\ntechniques, we decompose the images into host galaxy and AGN components at\nrest-frame ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The ultraviolet is sensitive to\nyoung stars, while the optical probes stellar mass. In the ultraviolet we image\nat the BAL absorption trough wavelengths so as to decrease the contrast between\nthe quasar and host galaxy emission.

We show that predictions of high-level micro-expressions can\nbe used as features for deception prediction. Surprisingly, IDT (Improved Dense\nTrajectory) features which have been widely used for action recognition, are\nalso very good at predicting deception in videos. We fuse the score of\nclassifiers trained on IDT features and high-level micro-expressions to improve\nperformance.

Operationally, this entails uplifting the standard Schwinger-Keldysh\ntwo-copy formalism into superspace by appending BRST ghost degrees of freedom.\nThese statements were previously argued at the level of the correlation\nfunctions. We provide herein a complementary perspective by working out the\nHilbert space structure explicitly. Our analysis clarifies two crucial issues\nnot evident in earlier works: firstly, certain background ghost insertions\nnecessary to reproduce the correct Schwinger-Keldysh correlators arise\nnaturally. Secondly, the Schwinger-Keldysh difference operators are\nsystematically dressed by the ghost bilinears, which turn out to be necessary\nto give rise to a consistent operator algebra. We also elaborate on the\nstructure of the final state (which is BRST closed) and the future boundary\ncondition of the ghost fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

It reveals that the optimal (non-zero) overlaps between the\nattackers post-interactions states must be equal and numerically same as the\ndifference between the fidelity and the disturbance at the receiving end. That\namount turns out to be same as the reduction (factor) in Bell violation when\nestimated for the equivalent entanglement-based protocol. Further, a series of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions unveil the structure of the optimal states\nwhich therefore are the only and all possible optimal interactions. We show\nthat these optimal states are same as the outputs of an optimal phase-covariant\ncloner. We also demonstrate various methods to derive optimal unitary\nevolutions that an eavesdropper is interested to know in order to mount an\noptimal attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 19:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 21:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 23:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 12:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

However, because gaseous\nabsorptions are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are\nrelatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals\n(called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once\ngas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows\ndepends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off.\nWe know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same\ncut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 {\\mu}m. This discrepancy is\ngenerally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off\ndescription for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and\nsurface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a\ngood knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better\nunderstand what causes the difference between the 2 {\\mu}m window and the other\nwindows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in\noccultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard\nCassini, around the 2 {\\mu}m window.

In\none example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small\nloops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting\nphase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code. However, the phase is\nsensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different lattices without\ncurvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different\nphases of matter, which are separated by phase transitions. Unintuitively\nhowever, according to a previous definition of phase [Chen, Gu, Wen 2010], even\njust a rotated or rescaled cubic lattice results in different phases of matter,\nwhich motivates us to propose a new and coarser definition of phase for gapped\nground states and fracton order. The new equivalence relation between ground\nstates is given by the composition of a local unitary transformation and a\nquasi-isometry (which can rotate and rescale the lattice); equivalently, ground\nstates are in the same phase if they can be adiabatically connected by varying\nboth the Hamiltonian and the positions of the degrees of freedom (via a\nquasi-isometry). In light of the importance of geometry, we further propose\nthat fracton orders should be regarded as a geometric order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 16:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

More formally, every point in $P$ is within\ndistance $\\epsilon$ from the convex hull of $S$. Such a subset $S$ is called an\n$\\epsilon$-hull. Computing an $\\epsilon$-hull is an important problem in\ncomputational geometry, machine learning, and approximation algorithms.\n  In many real world applications, the set $P$ is too large to fit in memory.\nWe consider the streaming model where the algorithm receives the points of $P$\nsequentially and strives to use a minimal amount of memory. Existing streaming\nalgorithms for computing an $\\epsilon$-hull require $O(\\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$\nspace, which is optimal for a worst-case input. However, this ignores the\nstructure of the data.

It is however the bottleneck\nof microstructural MRI. Beyond the complexity of diffusion, the current\ndevelopment is hindered by the fact that biophysical models heavily rely on\ndiffusion-specific properties of diverse cellular compartments that are still\nunknown and must be measured in vivo. Obtaining such parameters by\nstraightforward fitting is hindered by the degenerated landscape of the\nlikelihood functions, in particular, the signal obtained for multiple diffusion\ndirections and moderate diffusion weighting strength is not enough to estimate\nthese parameters: different parameter constellations explain the signal equally\nwell. The aim of this study is to measure the central parameter of white matter\nmodels, namely the intra-axonal water diffusivity in the normal human brain.\nProper estimation of this parameter is complicated due to (i) the presence of\nboth intra- and extra-axonal water compartments and (ii) the orientation\ndispersion of axons. Our measurement involves an efficient suppression of\nextra-axonal space and all cellular processes oriented outside a narrow cone\naround the principal fiber direction. This is achieved using a planar water\nmobility filter -- a strong diffusion weighting that suppresses signal from all\nmolecules that are mobile in the plane transverse to the fiber bundle.\nFollowing the planar filter, the diffusivity in the remaining compartment is\nmeasured using linear and isotropic weighting. We find the specifically\naveraged intra-axonal diffusivity $D_0 = 2.25\\pm 0.03{\\,\\rm \\mu m^2/ms}$ for\nthe timing of the applied gradients.

The L2-space geometry\nprovides the best decorrelation property in principle. The proposed learning\nparadigm is significantly different from the conventional kernel-based learning\nparadigm in two senses: (i) the whole space is not a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace and (ii) the minimum mean squared error estimator gives the best\napproximation of the desired nonlinear function in the dictionary subspace.

But these labels often come from noisy crowdsourcing\nplatforms, like Amazon Mechanical Turk. Practitioners typically collect\nmultiple labels per example and aggregate the results to mitigate noise (the\nclassic crowdsourcing problem). Given a fixed annotation budget and unlimited\nunlabeled data, redundant annotation comes at the expense of fewer labeled\nexamples. This raises two fundamental questions: (1) How can we best learn from\nnoisy workers? (2) How should we allocate our labeling budget to maximize the\nperformance of a classifier? We propose a new algorithm for jointly modeling\nlabels and worker quality from noisy crowd-sourced data. The alternating\nminimization proceeds in rounds, estimating worker quality from disagreement\nwith the current model and then updating the model by optimizing a loss\nfunction that accounts for the current estimate of worker quality. Unlike\nprevious approaches, even with only one annotation per example, our algorithm\ncan estimate worker quality. We establish a generalization error bound for\nmodels learned with our algorithm and establish theoretically that it's better\nto label many examples once (vs less multiply) when worker quality is above a\nthreshold.

We construct a risk-adjusted Markov Decision Process for a\ndiscrete-time version of the classical Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, where\nthe option price is an optimal Q-function, while the optimal hedge is a second\nargument of this optimal Q-function, so that both the price and hedge are parts\nof the same formula. Pricing is done by learning to dynamically optimize\nrisk-adjusted returns for an option replicating portfolio, as in the Markowitz\nportfolio theory. Using Q-Learning and related methods, once created in a\nparametric setting, the model is able to go model-free and learn to price and\nhedge an option directly from data, and without an explicit model of the world.\nThis suggests that RL may provide efficient data-driven and model-free methods\nfor optimal pricing and hedging of options, once we depart from the academic\ncontinuous-time limit, and vice versa, option pricing methods developed in\nMathematical Finance may be viewed as special cases of model-based\nReinforcement Learning.

Besides, our\nunderstanding on the nature of atmospheric micro-scale turbulence, which is\nconsidered to play a significant role (along with the non-LTE line\nintensification) for the cause of this effect, is still insufficient. Towards\nclarifying these problems, we carried out an extensive non-LTE spectrum-fitting\nanalysis of O I 7771--5 lines for unbiased sample of 75 evolved A-, F,- and\nG-type stars over wide luminosity classes (from subgiants through supergiants)\nincluding rapid rotators, from which the total equivalent width (W_77) was\nderived and the microturbulence (xi) was determined by two different (profile-\nand abundance-based) methods for each star.

In case of using W_77 for empirical M_V evaluation by\nsuch simple formulas, it is recommended to confine only to supergiants of -5 >\nM_V > -10. Regarding the microturbulence significantly controlling W_77, it\nroughly shows an increasing tendency with a decrease in surface gravity.\nHowever, the trend is not monotonic but rather intricate (e.g., hump,\nstagnation, or discontinuously large increase) depending on the stellar type\nand evolutionary stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 05:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Existing work on deep hashing assumes that the\ndatabase in the target domain is identically distributed with the training set\nin the source domain. This paper relaxes this assumption to a transfer\nretrieval setting, which allows the database and the training set to come from\ndifferent but relevant domains. However, the transfer retrieval setting will\nintroduce two technical difficulties: first, the hash model trained on the\nsource domain cannot work well on the target domain due to the large\ndistribution gap; second, the domain gap makes it difficult to concentrate the\ndatabase points to be within a small Hamming ball.

This paper presents Transfer Adversarial Hashing\n(TAH), a new hybrid deep architecture that incorporates a pairwise\n$t$-distribution cross-entropy loss to learn concentrated hash codes and an\nadversarial network to align the data distributions between the source and\ntarget domains. TAH can generate compact transfer hash codes for efficient\nimage retrieval on both source and target domains.

Molecular graphs of carbon and Ising models are also\nconsidered. The purpose served by exploring several problems in this paper is\nto propose a single general methodology for studying signed networks and to\ndemonstrate its relevance to applications. We point out several mistakes in the\nsigned networks literature caused by inaccurate computation, implementation\nerrors or inappropriate measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 07:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 06:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 19:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Based on the\nobservations of SGRBs, we could derive the merger rates of these compact\nbinaries, and study the stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) or the co-detection\nrates of GWs associate with SGRBs (GW-SGRBs). But before that, the most\nimportant thing is to derive the GW spectrum from a single GW source. Usually,\nGW spectrum from a circular orbit binary is assumed. However, observations of\nthe large spatial offsets of SGRBs from their host galaxies imply that SGRB\nprogenitors may be formed by the dynamical processes, and will merge with\nresidual eccentricities. The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW\nspectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results\nshow that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are\ngreatly suppressed at low frequencies. Especially, SGWBs from binaries with\nhigh residual eccentricities will hard to be detected (above the detection\nfrequency of $\\sim100~\\rm Hz$).

It is a challenging generative task due to large variations of face\nappearance. This paper studies generative face completion under structured\nocclusions. We treat the face completion and corruption as disentangling and\nfusing processes of clean faces and occlusions, and propose a jointly\ndisentangling and fusing Generative Adversarial Network (DF-GAN). First, three\ndomains are constructed, corresponding to the distributions of occluded faces,\nclean faces and structured occlusions. The disentangling and fusing processes\nare formulated as the transformations between the three domains. Then the\ndisentangling and fusing networks are built to learn the transformations from\nunpaired data, where the encoder-decoder structure is adopted and allows DF-GAN\nto simulate structure occlusions by modifying the latent representations.\nFinally, the disentangling and fusing processes are unified into a dual\nlearning framework along with an adversarial strategy. The proposed method is\nevaluated on Meshface verification problem. Experimental results on four\nMeshface databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for the\nface completion under structured occlusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 08:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

The classical brachistochrone for a non-dissipative\nparticle is governed by maximization of the particle's kinetic energy resulting\nin a cycloid. We consider a variant where the particle is replaced by a bottle\nfilled with a viscous fluid and attempt to identify the shape of a curve\nconnecting two points along which the bottle would move in the shortest time.\nWe derive the system of integro-differential equations governing system\ndynamics for a given shape of the curve. Using these equations, we pose the\nbrachistochrone problem invoking optimal control formalism and show that (in\ngeneral) the curve deviates from a cycloid. This is due to the fact that\nincreasing the rate of change of bottle kinetic energy is accompanied by\nincreased viscous dissipation. We show that the bottle motion is governed by a\nbalance between the desire to minimize travel time and the need to reach the\nend point in the face of increased dissipation. The trade-off between these two\nphysical forces plays a vital role in determining the brachistochrone of a\nfluid-filled cylinder. We show that in the two limits of either vanishing or\nhigh viscosity, the brachistochrone for this problem reduces to a cycloid. An\nintermediate viscosity range is identified where the fluid brachistochrone is\nnon-cycloidal.

In\nfact, pseudotensor mesons belong to a so-called heterochiral multiplet, for\nwhich a quadratic mixing term between nonstrange and strange isoscalar members\narises. On the contrary, for so-called homochiral multiplets, such as the\nground-state (axial-)vector and tensor mesons, this mixing is not possible,\nhence one can easily understand why the isoscalar members of these multiplets\nare almost purely nonstrange and strange, respectively. Moreover, the axial\nanomaly can be also coupled to baryons (within the mirror assignment), and thus\nit helps to explain the large decay width $ N^{\\ast }(1535)\\rightarrow N\\eta$\nand to clarify which baryons are chiral partners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 08:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

The point made by GMB was that\nparticle-particle (pairing) excitations, which are responsible for\nsuperfluidity to occur below Tc, and particle-hole excitations, which give rise\nto screening also in a normal system, get effectively disentangled from each\nother in the BCS limit, thus yielding a reduction by a factor 2.2 of the value\nof Tc obtained when neglecting screening effects. Subsequent work on this\ntopic, aimed at extending the original GMB argument away from the BCS limit\nwith diagrammatic methods, has kept this disentangling between pairing and\nscreening throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, without realising that the\nconditions for it to be valid are soon violated away from the BCS limit. Here,\nwe reconsider this problem from a more general perspective and argue that\npairing and screening are intrinsically entangled with each other along the\nwhole BCS-BEC crossover but for the BCS limit considered by GMB. We perform a\ndetailed numerical calculation of the GMB diagrammatic contribution extended to\nthe whole BCS-BEC crossover, where the full wave-vector and frequency\ndependence occurring in the repeated in-medium two-particle scattering is duly\ntaken into account.

The\nalgebra of these symmetries is worked out. For the concrete case of minimal\nsurfaces in $AdS_5$, we discuss the deformation of the four-cusp solution,\nwhich provides the dual description of the four-gluon scattering amplitude.\nThis marks the first step toward transferring the master symmetry to scattering\namplitudes. Moreover, we compute the master and Yangian symmetry variations of\ngeneric, smooth boundary curves. The discussion clarifies why previous attempts\nto transfer the deformations of minimal surfaces in $AdS_3$ to weak coupling\nwere unsuccessful. We discuss several attempts to transfer the Yangian symmetry\nto weak or arbitrary coupling, but ultimately conclude that a Yangian symmetry\nof the Maldacena-Wilson loop seems not to be present. This is different for the\nnatural supersymmetric generalizations of the Maldacena--Wilson loop, Wilson\nloops in superspace. Their one-loop expectation value is known to be Yangian\ninvariant.

The\nconnectivity-based helicity flux density method was recently developed for\nstudying the 2D and 3D transfer of magnetic helicity in ARs. The method takes\ninto account the 3D nature of magnetic helicity by explicitly using knowledge\nof the magnetic field connectivity, which allows it to faithfully track the\nphotospheric flux of magnetic helicity. Because the magnetic field is not\nmeasured in the solar corona, modeled 3D solutions obtained from force-free\nmagnetic field extrapolations must be used to derive the magnetic connectivity.\nDifferent extrapolation methods can lead to markedly different 3D magnetic\nfield connectivities, thus questioning the reliability of the\nconnectivity-based approach in observational applications.

This can provide design\ninformation about a structure's stiffness and robustness against buckling in\nterms of energy and force landscapes. Developments in this area are relatively\nnew but have proceeded rapidly with encouraging progress. Recent experimental\ntests on uniformly compressed spherical shells, and axially loaded cylinders,\nshow excellent agreement with theoretical solutions. The probing technique\ncould be a valuable experimental procedure for testing prototype structures,\nbut before it can be used a range of potential problems must be examined and\nsolved.

First, a limit point in the probe\ndisplacement (associated with a cusp instability and fold) can result in\ndynamic buckling as probing progresses, as demonstrated in the buckling of a\nspherical shell under volume control. Second, various types of bifurcations\nwhich can occur on the probing path which result in the probing response\nbecoming unstable are also discussed. To overcome these problems, we outline\nthe extra controls over the entire structure that may be needed to stabilize\nthe response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

However, they require a huge amount of computations and\nmodel parameters, which are not suitable for mobile and embedded devices.\nTherefore, MobileNet was proposed, which can reduce the number of parameters\nand computational cost dramatically. The main idea of MobileNet is to use a\ndepthwise separable convolution. Two hyper-parameters, a width multiplier and a\nresolution multiplier are used to the trade-off between the accuracy and the\nlatency. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to improve the MobileNet.\nInstead of using the resolution multiplier, we use a depth multiplier and\ncombine with either Fractional Max Pooling or the max pooling. Experimental\nresults on CIFAR database show that the proposed architecture can reduce the\namount of computational cost and increase the accuracy simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 04:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The flare reconnection flux is\nstrongly correlated with the peak of the GOES 1-8 \\AA\\ soft X-ray flux (c=0.92,\nin log-log space), both for confined and eruptive flares. Confined flares of a\ncertain GOES class exhibit smaller ribbon areas but larger magnetic flux\ndensities in the flare ribbons (by a factor of 2). In the largest events, up to\n$\\approx$50\\%\\ of the magnetic flux of the active region (AR) causing the flare\nis involved in the flare magnetic reconnection.

Under various loading rates, contact\nangle hysteresis for three different liquids was measured by examination of\nadvancing and receding angles in liquid bridges, and the capillary forces were\nrecorded. It is found that, for a given liquid, the hysteretic phenomenon of\nthe contact angle is more pronounced at higher loading rates. By unifying the\nbehaviour of the three liquids, power-law correlations were proposed to\ndescribe the relationship between the dynamic contact angle and the capillary\nnumber for advancing and receding cases. It is found that the exponents of\nobtained power-law correlations differ from those derived through earlier\nmethods (e.g., capillary rise), due to the different kinematics of the\ntriple-line. The various hysteretic loops of capillary force in liquid bridges\nunder varied cyclic loading rates were also observed, which can be captured\nquantitatively by the prediction of our developed model incorporating the\ndynamic contact angle hysteresis. These results illustrate the importance of\nvarying triple-line geometries during dynamic wetting and dewetting processes,\nand warrant an improved modelling approach for higher level phenomena involving\nthese processes, e.g., multiphase flow in porous media and liquid transfer\nbetween surfaces with moving contact lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 11:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states.

This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful.

IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as\nevidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide\naccess to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct\nquantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit\nquantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions\nof these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5,\nrespectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the\ndesired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has\nto be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied\n- a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently\nconduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which\naddresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a\nrealization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at\nthe same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum\ngates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured\nfor similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK.\nExperimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms\nIBM's own mapping solution.

The computational cost is furthermore\nreduced by employing an adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases,\nallowing for different local upsampling factors.

This result contrasts with previous studies, which had assumed that the\ndark atoms would result in dark disks.

The number of identified complex organic molecules (COMs) in inter-\nand circumstellar gas-phase environments is steadily increasing.

Accurate spectroscopic laboratory data of frozen COMs,\nembedded in ice matrices containing ingredients related to their formation\nscheme, are still largely lacking.\n  Aims. This work provides infrared reference spectra of acetaldehyde\n(CH$_3$CHO), ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$)\nrecorded in a variety of ice environments and for astronomically relevant\ntemperatures, as needed to guide or interpret astronomical observations,\nspecifically for upcoming James Webb Space Telescope observations.\n  Methods. Fourier transform transmission spectroscopy (500-4000 cm$^{-1}$ /\n20-2.5 $\\mu$m, 1.0 cm$^{-1}$ resolution) was used to investigate solid\nacetaldehyde, ethanol and dimethyl ether, pure or mixed with water, CO,\nmethanol, or CO:methanol. These species were deposited on a cryogenically\ncooled infrared transmissive window at 15~K. A heating ramp was applied, during\nwhich IR spectra were recorded until all ice constituents were thermally\ndesorbed.\n  Results.

The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the\neffects are proxied (but not necessarily consistently estimated) by predictive\nand causal machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into\nestimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in\nconjunction with penalized methods, neural networks, random forests, boosted\ntrees, and ensemble methods, both predictive and causal.

Just like\nradio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of\nstrong electric field in a magnetosphere of a neutron star is associated with\nclose passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source\nFRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of\norbiting of the body is about 200 days. Thermal radiation from the surface of\nthe star (temperature is of the order of $ 10^8 \\, K $) causes evaporation and\nionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around\nthe magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity $ u \\simeq 10^7 \\, cm /\ns $, and creates electric potential $ \\psi_0 \\simeq 10^{11} \\, V $ in the polar\nregion of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated\ntoward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of $ \\simeq 10 ^ 5 $. Thermal photons\nmoving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma\nphotons with energies of $ \\simeq 10^5 \\, m_e c^2 $. These gamma quanta produce\nelectron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity,\nthe number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about $ 10^5 $. The\nelectron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere,\naccumulates in a narrow layer at a bottom of a potential well formed on one\nside by a blocking potential $ \\psi_0 $, and on the other side by pressure of\nthermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer\nincreases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for\nthermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under\nthe layer is accumulated during time $ \\simeq 500 \\, s $, then the plasma layer\nis ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed\nby the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 14:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

It is proposed that the low Tsallis-temperature is due\nto incomplete implementation of Tsallis algebra though exponential and\nlogarithmic functions to the high-energy particle-production. Substituting\nTsallis algebra into grand-canonical partition-function of the hadron resonance\ngas model seems not assuring full incorporation of nonextensivity or\ncorrelations in that model. The statistics describing the phase-space volume,\nthe number of states and the possible changes in the elementary cells should be\nrather modified due to interacting correlated subsystems, of which the\nphase-space is consisting. Alternatively, two asymptotic properties, each is\nassociated with a scaling function, are utilized to classify a generalized\nentropy for such a system with large ensemble (produced particles) and strong\ncorrelations. Both scaling exponents define equivalence classes for all\ninteracting and noninteracting systems and unambiguously characterize any\nstatistical system in its thermodynamic limit.

The Eu 3d core level spectrum\nconfirms the robust Eu2+ valence state against the transition metal\nsubstitution with a small contribution from Eu3+. The estimated Eu mean-valence\nis around 2.1 in these compounds as confirmed by multiplet calculations. In\ncontrast, the Ge 2p spectrum shifts to higher binding energy upon changing the\ntransition metal from 3d to 4d to 5d elements, hinting of a change in the Ge-T\nbonding strength. The valence bands of the different compounds are found to be\nwell reproduced by ab initio band structure calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 15:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Hedin, Physics Essays 25, 2 (2012)], a simple model of a nucleon-nucleon\n(NN) central potential is derived which quantitatively reproduces the radial\nprofile of other models, without adjusting any free parameters. It is\npostulated that a higher-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator confining\npotential localizes particles into 3d space, but allows for an evanescent\npenetration of the particles into two higher spatial dimensions. Producing an\neffect identical with the relativistic quantum phenomenon of zitterbewegung,\nthe higher-dimensional oscillations of amplitude h/(2{\\pi}mc) can be\nalternatively viewed as a localized curvature of 3d space back and forth into\nthe higher dimensions. The overall spatial curvature is proportional to the\nparticle`s extra dimensional ground state wave function in the higher\ndimensional harmonic confining potential well. Minimizing the overlapping\ncurvature (proportional to the energy) of two particles in proximity to each\nother, subject to the constraint that for the two particles to occupy the same\nspatial location one of them must be excited into the first excited state of\nthe harmonic potential well, gives the desired NN potential. Specifying only\nthe nucleon masses, the resulting potential well and repulsive core reproduces\nthe radial profile of several published NN central potential models. In\naddition, the predicted height of the repulsive core, when used to estimate the\nmaximum neutron star mass, matches well with the best estimates from\nrelativistic theory incorporating standard nuclear matter equations of state.\nNucleon spin, Coulomb interactions, and internal nucleon structure are not\nconsidered in the theory as presented in this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 16:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

In this paper, we focus\nupon one such paradox, namely Bell's spaceship paradox, examining the relative\nmotion of two uniformly accelerating spaceships. We consider the view from\neither spaceship, with the exchange of photons between the two. This recovers\nthe well known result that the leading spaceship loses sight of the trailing\nspaceship as it is redshifted and disappears behind what is known as the\n`Rindler horizon'. An immediate impact of this is that if either spaceship\ntries to measure the separation through `radar ranging', bouncing photons off\none another, they would both eventually fail to receive any of the photon\n`pings' that they emit. We find that the view from this trailing spaceship is,\nhowever, starkly different, initially, seeing the leading spaceship with an\nincreasing blueshift, followed by a decreasing blueshift. We conclude that,\nwhile the leading spaceship loses sight of the trailing spaceship, for the\ntrailing spaceship the view of the separation between the two spaceships, and\nthe apparent angular size of the leading spaceship, approach asymptotic values.\nIntriguingly, for particular parametrization of the journey of the two\nspaceships, these asymptotic values are identical to those properties seen\nbefore the spaceships began accelerating, and the view from the trailing\nspaceship becomes identical to when the two spaceships were initially at rest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

We report here the demonstration of NEMS-MS with arrays of 20\nindividually addressed nanomechanical resonators where the number of\ninputs-outputs for the whole array is the same as that of a single resonator.\nWhile all resonators within an array are interconnected via two metal levels,\neach resonator is designed with a distinct resonance frequency which becomes\nits individual address. In order to perform single-particle Mass Spectrometry,\nthe resonance frequencies of the two first modes of each NEMS within an array\nare monitored simultaneously. Using such an array, mass spectra of metallic\naggregates in the MDa range are acquired with more than one order of magnitude\nimprovement in analysis time due to the increase in capture cross section\ncompared to individual resonators. A 20 NEMS array is probed in 150ms with the\nsame mass limit of detection as a single resonator. Spectra acquired with a\nconventional Time- of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer in the same system show\nexcellent agreement. As individual information for each resonator within the\narray is retained, the array becomes a particle imager, each resonator acting\nas a pixel.

Besides, conventional diagnostics are\nlimited in their capability to detect such pathologies at an early stage. This\ngenerates demand for automatic recommender systems that could effectively\nmonitor and predict pathogenic behaviors in the body. To this end, we propose\nhuman gait analysis for predicting two important physiological parameters\nassociated with different diseases, body mass index and age. Predicting age and\nbody mass index by actively profiling the gait samples, could be further used\nfor providing suitable healthcare recommendations. Existing strategies for\npredicting age and body mass index, however, necessitate stringent experimental\nsettings for achieving appropriate performance. For instance, precisely\nrecorded speech signals were recently used for predicting body mass indices of\ndifferent subjects. Similarly, age groups were predicted by recording gait\nsamples from on-body and wearable sensors. Such specialized methods limit\nactive and convenient profiling of human age and body mass indices. We address\nthese issues, by introducing smartphone sensors as a means for recording gait\nsignals. Using on-board accelerometer and gyroscope helps in developing\neasy-to-use and accessible systems for predicting body mass index and age.

The standard calculation that predicts\nthe Hubble parameter has to be way smaller than the Planck energy is shown to\nbe fallacious: it applies the conservation of the perturbative curvature R to a\nsingle inflaton fluctuation when it should be applied to the energy density\ncontrast of an aggregate. The quantum inflaton fluctuations varphi are with\nrespect to the classical value phi_0 of the inflaton field phi=phi_0+varphi.\nFluctuations varphi that have grown to the size of the horizon, or a pair of\nvirtual particles that are separated by a distance the length of the horizon,\nare forced to become real and take energy from the potential V(phi_0). The\nslowing down of inflation is due to the eventual domination of the continuously\nbeing created radiation over the decreasing inflaton potential V(phi_0). It is\nnot necessary at all for the potential V(phi_0) to go to zero. Since there is\nno need for reheating the inflaton field phi does not couple to matter (except\ngravitationally). After inflation, the fluctuations varphi quickly cool down\nand can be described as dark matter. Now the inverse process begins to occur.\nInflaton fluctuations varphi that exited the horizon during inflation begin\nreentering it after inflation's end. Then they are again causally connected and\nhave a probability of undergoing the inverse of the quantum process they\nunderwent before and give their energy back to the potential V(phi_0).

SRS's of practical interest are\nexpressly intended for efficiently computing such flows by resolving only the\nmost important features of the coherent structures and modelling the remainder\nas stochastic field. The success of SRS methods depends upon three important\nfactors: i) ability to identify key flow mechanisms responsible for the\ngeneration of coherent structures; ii) determine the optimum range of\nresolution required to adequately capture key elements of coherent structures;\nand iii) ensure that the modelled part is comprised nearly exclusively of\nfully-developed stochastic turbulence.
