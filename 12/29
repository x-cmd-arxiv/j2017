In General Relativity (GR), horizons\nhave several defining properties. First, there exists a static spherically\nsymmetric solution to vacuum Einstein equations which possesses a horizon\ndefined as a null-surface on which the time-like Killing vector becomes null.\nSecond, in GR, a co-dimension two sphere of minimal area is necessarily a\nhorizon. On a quantum level, the classical gravitational action is supplemented\nby the quantum effective action obtained by integrating out the quantum fields\npropagating on a classical background. In this note we consider the case when\nthe quantum fields are conformal and perform a certain non-perturbative\nanalysis of the semiclassical equations obtained by varying the complete\ngravitational action. We show that, for these equations, both of the above\naspects do not hold. More precisely, we prove that i) a static spherically\nsymmetric metric that would describe a horizon with a finite Hawking\ntemperature is, generically, {\\it not} a solution; ii) a minimal $2$-sphere is\n{\\it not} a horizon but a tiny throat of a wormhole. We find certain bounds on\nthe norm of the Killing vector at the throat and show that it is, while\nnon-zero, an exponentially small function of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH)\nentropy of the classical black hole. We also find that the possible temperature\nof the semiclassical geometry is exponentially small for large black holes.\nThese findings suggest that a black hole in the classical theory can be viewed\nas a certain (singular) limit of the semiclassical wormhole geometry.

The new domain\ndecomposition method is motivated by the so-called automated multi-level\nsubstructuring (short AMLS) method. The AMLS method is a domain decomposition\nmethod for the solution of elliptic PDE eigenvalue problems which has been\nshown to be very efficient especially when a large number of eigenpairs is\nsought. In general the AMLS method is only applicable to these kind of\ncontinuous eigenvalue problems where the corresponding discretisation leads to\nan algebraic eigenvalue problem of the form $Kx=\\lambda Mx$ where $K,M \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$ are symmetric sparse matrices. However, the\ndiscretisation of an integral equation eigenvalue problem leads to a discrete\nproblem where the matrix $K$ is typically dense, since a non-local integral\noperator is involved in the equation. In the new method, which is introduced in\nthis paper, the domain decomposition technique of classical AMLS is generalised\nto eigenvalue problems $Kx=\\lambda Mx$ where $K,M$ are symmetric and possibly\ndense, and which is therefor applicable for the solution of integral equation\neigenvalue problems. To make out of this an efficient eigensolver, the new\ndomain decomposition method is combined with a recursive approach and with the\nconcept of hierarchical matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 17:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Concave penalized least squares estimation (PLSE) takes\nadvantage of signal strength to reduce this bias, leading to sharper error\nbounds in prediction, coefficient estimation and variable selection. For\nprediction and estimation, the bias of the Lasso can be also reduced by taking\na smaller penalty level than what selection consistency requires, but such\nsmaller penalty level depends on the sparsity of the true coefficient vector.\nThe sorted L1 penalized estimation (Slope) was proposed for adaptation to such\nsmaller penalty levels. However, the advantages of concave PLSE and Slope do\nnot subsume each other. We propose sorted concave penalized estimation to\ncombine the advantages of concave and sorted penalizations. We prove that\nsorted concave penalties adaptively choose the smaller penalty level and at the\nsame time benefits from signal strength, especially when a significant\nproportion of signals are stronger than the corresponding adaptively selected\npenalty levels. A local convex approximation, which extends the local linear\nand quadratic approximations to sorted concave penalties, is developed to\nfacilitate the computation of sorted concave PLSE and proven to possess desired\nprediction and estimation error bounds. We carry out a unified treatment of\npenalty functions in a general optimization setting, including the penalty\nlevels and concavity of the above mentioned sorted penalties and mixed\npenalties motivated by Bayesian considerations. Our analysis of prediction and\nestimation errors requires the restricted eigenvalue condition on the design,\nnot beyond, and provides selection consistency under a required minimum signal\nstrength condition in addition. Thus, our results also sharpens existing\nresults on concave PLSE by removing the upper sparse eigenvalue component of\nthe sparse Riesz condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 17:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

In this work we initiate the study of the\nfollowing question: given $n$ agents, each with its own initial opinion that\nreflects its core value on a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the\nstructure of a social network that minimizes {\\em polarization} and {\\em\ndisagreement} simultaneously?\n  This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system\nprefer a link suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in\norder to keep disagreement low, or between two users with different opinions in\norder to expose each to the other's viewpoint of the world, and decrease\noverall levels of polarization? Our contributions include a mathematical\nformalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact,\ntime-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a network with\n$O(n/\\epsilon^2)$ edges that is a $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimum.\nFor a fixed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function\nover the agents' innate opinions in polynomial time.\n  We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and\nreal-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand\nthe trade-off between of disagreement and polarization.

The spectral width of the real conductivity reveals the current\ndissipation rate in the lattice, and the integrated spectral weight is related\nto thermodynamic properties of the system through a sum rule. The global\nconductivity decreases with increased band-averaged effective mass, which at\nhigh temperatures approaches a T-linear regime. Relaxation of current is\nobserved to require a finite lattice depth, which breaks Galilean invariance\nand enables damping through collisions between fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 18:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 03:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 00:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

This makes it possible for long-term bonds\nto be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20-lender rule,\ntaxable at 20% final tax. However, long-term debt instruments cannot\nrealistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of\n20 or more lenders. First, long-term debt instruments cannot simultaneously\nreplicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are\nintegral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes are\nan integral part of the maturity transformation process (i.e. short-term\nborrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries,\nwhich means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by\nhaving short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates\nthe function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where\nsaid instruments originated and are generally used.

Leveraging\nthe random feature approximation and its recent orthogonality-promoting\nvariant, the present contribution develops a scalable multi-kernel learning\nscheme (termed Raker) to obtain the sought nonlinear learning function `on the\nfly,' first for static environments. To further boost performance in dynamic\nenvironments, an adaptive multi-kernel learning scheme (termed AdaRaker) is\ndeveloped. AdaRaker accounts not only for data-driven learning of kernel\ncombination, but also for the unknown dynamics. Performance is analyzed in\nterms of both static and dynamic regrets. AdaRaker is uniquely capable of\ntracking nonlinear learning functions in environments with unknown dynamics,\nand with with analytic performance guarantees.

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum. We argue that our model is consistent with the newly\nreported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst galaxies, since\nboth LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation\nactivity. LL GRBs have also been suggested as the dominant origin of IceCube\nneutrinos in the PeV range, and the LL GRB origin of UHECRs can be critically\ntested by near-future multimessenger observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 18:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 07:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

In our leading example, we model CATE by interacting the base\ntreatment variable with explanatory variables. The first step of our procedure\nis orthogonalization, where we partial out the controls and unit effects from\nthe outcome and the base treatment and take the cross-fitted residuals. This\nstep uses a novel generic cross-fitting method we design for weakly dependent\ntime series and panel data. This method \"leaves out the neighbors\" when fitting\nnuisance components, and we theoretically power it by using Strassen's\ncoupling. As a result, we can rely on any modern machine learning method in the\nfirst step, provided it learns the residuals well enough. Second, we construct\nan orthogonal (or residual) learner of CATE -- the Lasso CATE -- that regresses\nthe outcome residual on the vector of interactions of the residualized\ntreatment with explanatory variables. If the complexity of CATE function is\nsimpler than that of the first-stage regression, the orthogonal learner\nconverges faster than the single-stage regression-based learner. Third, we\nperform simultaneous inference on parameters of the CATE function using\ndebiasing. We also can use ordinary least squares in the last two steps when\nCATE is low-dimensional. In heterogeneous panel data settings, we model the\nunobserved unit heterogeneity as a weakly sparse deviation from Mundlak\n(1978)'s model of correlated unit effects as a linear function of\ntime-invariant covariates and make use of L1-penalization to estimate these\nmodels.

However, it\nis also known that the non-attractor inflation by itself is incomplete and\nshould be followed by a phase of slow-roll attractor. Moreover, there is a\ntransition process between these two phases. In the past literature, this\ntransition was approximated as instant and the evolution of non-Gaussianity in\nthis phase was not fully studied. In this paper, we follow the detailed\nevolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the\nslow-roll attractor phase, considering different types of transition. We find\nthat the transition process has important effect on the size of the local\nnon-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities\nat the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature\nperturbations keep evolving during the transition - such as in the case of\nsmooth transition or some sharp transition scenarios - the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nlocal non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase can be completely\nerased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains\nviolated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes\nfreeze immediately right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original\nnon-attractor result can be recovered.

Recently developed\nmethods that construct a predictor that is inherently robust to the\ndifficulties of learning under covariate shift are restricted to minimizing\nlogloss and can be too conservative when faced with high-dimensional learning\ntasks.

However, the origins of such dislocations\nand their dissociation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we\nsystematically investigate these mechanisms using dispersion-inclusive density\nfunctional theory, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. We find\nthat <c + a> dislocations form more readily on the pyramidal I plane than on\nthe pyramidal II plane in Mg. The addition of Y atoms in Mg facilitates the\ndissociation of <c + a> dislocations on pyramidal II, leading to the easier\nformation of the pyramidal II than pyramidal I in Mg-Y alloy. Importantly, in\npyramidal II slip plane, a flat potential-energy surface (PES) exists around\nthe position of stable stacking fault energy (SFE), which allows cooperative\nmovement of atoms within the slip plane. Alloying Mg with Y atoms increases the\nrange of the PES, and ultimately promotes different sliding pathways in the\nMg-Y alloy.

Feedback from critical\ncare clinicians who use automated event detection software in clinical\napplications has been overwhelmingly emphatic that a low false alarm rate,\ntypically measured in units of the number of errors per 24 hours, is the single\nmost important criterion for user acceptance. Though using a single metric is\nnot often as insightful as examining performance over a range of operating\nconditions, there is a need for a single scalar figure of merit. In this paper,\nwe discuss the deficiencies of existing metrics for a seizure detection task\nand propose several new metrics that offer a more balanced view of performance.\nWe demonstrate these metrics on a seizure detection task based on the TUH EEG\nCorpus. We show that two promising metrics are a measure based on a concept\nborrowed from the spoken term detection literature, Actual Term-Weighted Value\n(ATWV), and a new metric, Time-Aligned Event Scoring (TAES), that accounts for\nthe temporal alignment of the hypothesis to the reference annotation. We also\ndemonstrate that state of the art technology based on deep learning, though\nimpressive in its performance, still needs significant improvement before it\nmeets very strict user acceptance criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 03:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 17:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

The Babcock--Leighton type dynamos, which\nare successful in explaining many features of the solar cycle remarkably well,\nare not expected to operate during grand minima due to the lack of a sufficient\nnumber of sunspots. In this Letter, we explore the question of how the Sun\ncould recover from grand minima through the Babcock--Leighton dynamo.

Ideas from compressed sensing may be employed to exploit\nthis sparsity in order to reduce computational costs. A class of greedy\ncompressed sensing algorithms use least squares minimization to approximate PC\ncoefficients. This least squares problem lends itself to the theory of optimal\ndesign of experiments (ODE). Our work focuses on selecting an experimental\ndesign that improves the accuracy of sparse PC approximations for a fixed\ncomputational budget. We propose DSP, a novel sequential design, greedy\nalgorithm for sparse PC approximation. The algorithm sequentially augments an\nexperimental design according to a set of the basis polynomials deemed\nimportant by the magnitude of their coefficients, at each iteration. Our\nalgorithm incorporates topics from ODE to estimate the PC coefficients. A\nvariety of numerical simulations are performed on three physical models and\nmanufactured sparse PC expansions to provide a comparative study between our\nproposed algorithm and other non-adaptive methods. Further, we examine the\nimportance of sampling by comparing different strategies in terms of their\nability to generate a candidate pool from which an optimal experimental design\nis chosen. It is demonstrated that the most accurate PC coefficient\napproximations, with the least variability, are produced with our\ndesign-adaptive greedy algorithm and the use of a studied importance sampling\nstrategy. We provide theoretical and numerical results which show that using an\noptimal sampling strategy for the candidate pool is key, both in terms of\naccuracy in the approximation, but also in terms of constructing an optimal\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 07:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

For\nefficient energy transfer and information relaying, a novel two-phase protocol\nis proposed, in which the relay operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve\nsimultaneous wireless power and information transmission. Compared with those\nexisting protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: 1) it\nfully exploits the available hardware resource (antenna element) of relay and\ncan offer higher secrecy rate; 2) it enables self-energy recycling (S-ER) at\nrelay, in which the loopback interference (LI) generated by FD operation is\nharvested and reused for information relaying. To maximize the worst-case\nsecrecy rate (WCSR) through jointly designing the source and relay beamformers\ncoupled with the power allocation ratio, an optimization problem is formulated.\nThis formulated problem is proved to be non-convex and the challenge to solve\nit is how to concurrently solve out the beamformers and the power allocation\nratio. To cope with this difficulty, an alternative approach is proposed by\nconverting the original problem into three subproblems. By solving these\nsubproblems iteratively, the closed form solutions of robust beamformers and\npower allocation ratio for the original problem are achieved. Simulations are\ndone and results reveal that the proposed S-ER based secure transmission scheme\noutperforms the traditional time-switching based relaying (TSR) scheme at a\nmaximum WCSR gain of 80%.Results also demonstrate that the WCSR performance of\nthe scheme reusing idle antennas for information reception is much better than\nthat of schemes exploiting only one receive antenna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 08:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

When SOC is included, the line nodes are prohibited by the\nglide-plane symmetry, and a small gap (~5 meV) appears, which leads YH3 to be a\nstrong topological insulator with Z2 indices (1,000).

The most \"disturbing\" case\nin this regard is HESS J1825-137, which extends to distances\n$r\\approx70\\rm\\,pc$ from the central pulsar PSR J1826-1334. If the gamma-ray\nemission is indeed produced inside the PWN, but not by electrons that escaped\nthe nebula and diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of such\nan anomalously extended plerion could be realized, in a diluted environment\nwith the hydrogen number density $n_{ism}\\le10^{-2}\\rm\\,cm^{-3}$. In this\npaper, we explore an alternative scenario assuming that the pulsar responsible\nfor the formation of the nebula initially had a very short rotation period. In\nthis case, the sizes of both the PWN and the surrounding supernova remnant\ndepend on the initial pulsar period, the braking index, and the ISM density. To\ncheck the feasibility of this scenario, we study the parameter space that would\nreproduce the size of HESS J1825-137. We show that this demand can be achieved\nif the braking index is small, $n\\leq2$ and the pulsar birth period is short,\n$P_{\\rm b}\\simeq1\\rm\\,ms$. This scenario can reproduce the wind termination\nposition, which is expected at $R_{ts}\\simeq0.03\\rm\\,pc$, only in a dense\nenvironment with $n_{ism}\\geq\\rm1\\,cm^{-3}$. The requirement of the dense\nsurrounding gas is supported by the presence of molecular clouds found in the\nsource vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 09:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 03:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Two types of\nbehavior are observed, depending on the value of the critical number $R$, which\nis a function of the grain inertia, the magnetic susceptibility of the material\nand of the strength of rotation braking. If $R\\leq10$, the grain ends up in a\nstatic state and perfectly aligned with the magnetic field, after a few braking\ntimes. If not, it goes on precessing and nutating about the field vector for a\nmuch longer time. Usual parameters are such that the first situation can hardly\nbe observed. Fortunately, in the second and more likely situation, there\nremains a persistent partial alignment which is far from negligible, although\nit decreases as the field decreases and as $R$ increases. The solution of the\ncomplete equations of motion of grains in a field helps understanding the\ndetails of this behavior. One particular case of an ellipsoidal forsterite\nsilicate grain is studied in detail and shown to polarize light in agreement\nwith astronomical measurements of absolute polarization in the infrared.\nPhonons are shown to contribute to the progressive flattening of extinction and\npolarization towards long wavelengths.

During the interaction, strong\nshocks are expected to form that can accelerate non-thermal particles to high\nenergies. Such winds have been suggested to be responsible for a large fraction\nof the observed extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) in the GeV-TeV range\nand the diffuse neutrino background in the PeV range, via the decay of neutral\nand charged pions generated in inelastic $pp$ collisions between protons\naccelerated by the forward shock and the ambient gas. However, previous studies\ndid not properly account for processes such as adiabatic losses that may reduce\nthe gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes significantly. We evaluate the production of\ngamma-rays and neutrinos by AGN-driven winds in some detail by modeling their\nhydrodynamic and thermal evolution, including the effects of their\ntwo-temperature structure. We find that they can only account for less than\n$\\sim 30$% of the EGB flux, as otherwise the model would violate the\nindependent upper limit derived from the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray\nbackground. If the neutrino spectral index is steep with $\\Gamma\\gtrsim 2.2$, a\nsevere tension with the isotropic gamma-ray background would arise as long as\nthe winds contribute more than $20$% of the IceCube neutrino flux in the\n$10-100$TeV range.

As an\nexample, we apply this argument in $f(R)$-theories of gravity and derive a\ngeneral formula for the rate in any $f(R)$-theory with constant curvature.\nFinally, we consider well known $f(R)$-models and using this formula we put\nconstraints in their free parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 10:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 15:29:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 20:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

One of the most common methods for detecting CLP requires\nonline machine translators (such as Google or Microsoft translate) which are\nnot always available, and given that plagiarism detection typically involves\nlarge document comparison, the amount of translations required would overwhelm\nan online machine translator, especially when detecting plagiarism over the\nweb. In addition, when translated texts are replaced with their synonyms, using\nonline machine translators to detect CLP would result in poor performance. This\npaper addresses the problem of cross-lingual plagiarism detection (CLPD) by\nproposing a model that uses simulated word embeddings to reproduce the\npredictions of an online machine translator (Google translate) when detecting\nCLP. The simulated embeddings comprise of translated words in different\nlanguages mapped in a common space, and replicated to increase the prediction\nprobability of retrieving the translations of a word (and their synonyms) from\nthe model. Unlike most existing models, the proposed model does not require\nparallel corpora, and accommodates multiple languages (multi-lingual). We\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting CLP in\nstandard datasets that contain CLP cases, and evaluated its performance against\na state-of-the-art baseline that relies on online machine translator (T+MA\nmodel). Evaluation results revealed that the proposed model is not only\neffective in detecting CLP, it outperformed the baseline.

We have modeled the system using a discrete-time\niterative equation known as the Ikeda Map. In the linear regime, evolution of\noptical power in the system shows power saturation behavior below the PT\nthreshold and exponential blow-up above the PT threshold. We found that in the\nunbroken PT regime, optical power saturation occurs owing to the existence of\nstable stationary states, which lies on the surface of 4-dimensional\nhypersphere.

We study the problem of quantifying the interestingness of\nsubpopulations in a Mapper, which appear as long paths, flares, or loops.\nFirst, we create a weighted directed graph G using the 1-skeleton of the\nMapper. We use the average values at the vertices of a target function to\ndirect edges (from low to high). The difference between the average values at\nvertices (high-low) is set as the edge's weight. Covariation of the remaining h\nfunctions (independent variables) is captured by a h-bit binary signature\nassigned to the edge. An interesting path in G is a directed path whose edges\nall have the same signature. We define the interestingness score of such a path\nas a sum of its edge weights multiplied by a nonlinear function of their ranks\nin the path.\n  Second, we study three optimization problems on this graph G. In the problem\nMax-IP, we seek an interesting path in G with the maximum interestingness\nscore. We show that Max-IP is NP-complete. For the special case when G is a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), we show that Max-IP can be solved in polynomial\ntime - in O(mnd_i) where d_i is the maximum indegree of a vertex in G.\n  In the more general problem IP, the goal is to find a collection of\nedge-disjoint interesting paths such that the overall sum of their\ninterestingness scores is maximized. We also study a variant of IP termed k-IP,\nwhere the goal is to identify a collection of edge-disjoint interesting paths\neach with k edges, and their total interestingness score is maximized.

Such a\nrepresentation is not scalable when the set of possible values are unbounded\n(e.g., date, time or location) or dynamic (e.g., movies or usernames).\nFurthermore, training of such models requires labeled data, where each user\nturn is annotated with the dialogue state, which makes building models for new\ndomains challenging.

We\nshow that an unambiguous conclusion about the existence of an axial zone of\navoidance and its parameters cannot be reached based on the maximization of the\nformal cone of avoidance due to the discreteness of the GC system. The\nambiguity allows the construction of the representation of voids in the GC\nsystem by a set of largest-radius meridional cylindrical voids to be overcome.\nAs a result of our study, we have managed to identify northern and southern\naxial zones of avoidance with similar characteristics. The combined zone of\navoidance is traceable at $|Z| \\gtrsim 1$ kpc and is similar in shape to a\ndouble cone whose axis crosses the region of greatest GC number density.

When the particle diffuse away from\nthe surface the surface can grow, blocking the particle from going back.\nElementary calculations of the model reproduce established results for the\ncritical velocity $v_c$ for particle engulfment: $v_c\\sim 1/r$ for large\nparticles and $v_c\\sim$ Const for small particles, $r$ being the particle's\nradius. Using our model we calculate the dragging distance of the particle by\ntreating the pushing as a sequence of growing steps by the surface, each\nenabled by the particle's diffusion away. Eventually the particle is engulfed\nby ice growing around it when a rare event of long diffusion time away from the\nsurface occurs. By calculating numerically the statistics of the diffusion\ntimes from the surface and therefore the probability for a such a rare event we\ncalculate the total dragging time and distance $L$ of the particle by the ice\nfront to be $L\\sim\\exp[1/(vr)]$ where $v$ is the freezing velocity. This\nrelation for $L$ is confirmed by ours and others experiments. The distance $L$\nprovides a length scale for pattern formation during phase transition in\ncolloidal suspensions, such as ice lenses and lamellae structures by freeze\ncasting. Data from the literature for ice lenses thickness and lamellae spacing\nduring freeze casting agree with our prediction for the relation of the\ndistance $L$. These results lead us to conjecture that lamellae formation is\ndominated by their lateral growth which pushes and concentrates the particles\nbetween them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime\ndecompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by\n$$ D(N) \\leq C^* \\Theta(N), \\quad \\Theta(N):= \\frac{N}{\\log^2\nN}\\prod_{\\substack{p|N p>2}} \\left( 1 +\n\\frac{1}{p-2}\\right)\\prod_{p>2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) $$ where $C^*$\ndenotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed\nthat $C^* \\leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's\nconstant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab\nfunction $\\omega(u)$, \\begin{align*} \\omega(u)=1/u, & \\quad (1\\leq u\\leq 2), (u\n\\omega(u))'=\\omega(u-1), & \\quad (u\\geq 2). \\end{align*} based on work done by\nCheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\\omega(u)$ as\na Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so\n$\\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the\nTaylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds.\n  Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required\nintegrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above\ndifferential equation to obtain $\\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result.\nAlthough the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on\nand refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The\nimprovements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This\nprovides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals\ncomputed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant\nwould be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant\nlikely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 03:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}
