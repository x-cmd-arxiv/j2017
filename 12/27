Capturing the common semantic characteristics between the visual\nmodality and the class semantic modality (e.g., attributes or word vector) is a\nkey to the success of ZSL. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder\napproach, namely Latent Space Encoding (LSE), to connect the semantic relations\nof different modalities. Instead of requiring a projection function to transfer\ninformation across different modalities like most previous work, LSE per- forms\nthe interactions of different modalities via a feature aware latent space,\nwhich is learned in an implicit way. Specifically, different modalities are\nmodeled separately but optimized jointly. For each modality, an encoder-decoder\nframework is performed to learn a feature aware latent space via jointly\nmaximizing the recoverability of the original space from the latent space and\nthe predictability of the latent space from the original space. To relate\ndifferent modalities together, their features referring to the same concept are\nenforced to share the same latent codings. In this way, the common semantic\ncharacteristics of different modalities are generalized with the latent\nrepresentations. Another property of the proposed approach is that it is easily\nextended to more modalities. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark\ndatasets (AwA, CUB, aPY, and ImageNet) clearly demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed approach on several ZSL tasks, including traditional ZSL,\ngeneralized ZSL, and zero-shot retrieval (ZSR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

Concomitant with intensionality is\nthe phenomenon of intensional recursion, which refers to the ability of a\nprogram to have access to its own code. In computability theory, intensional\nrecursion is enabled by Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem. This thesis is\nconcerned with the crafting of a logical toolkit through which these phenomena\ncan be studied.

Intelligence Measure of Learning-based Cognitive Radios","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.NI cs.LG","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Cognitive radio (CR) is considered as a key enabling technology for dynamic\nspectrum access to improve spectrum efficiency. Although the CR concept was\ninvented with the core idea of realizing cognition, the research on measuring\nCR cognitive capabilities and intelligence is largely open. Deriving the\nintelligence measure of CR not only can lead to the development of new CR\ntechnologies, but also makes it possible to better configure the networks by\nintegrating CRs with different cognitive capabilities. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we propose a data-driven methodology to quantitatively measure the\nintelligence factors of the CR with learning capabilities. The basic idea of\nour methodology is to run various tests on the CR in different spectrum\nenvironments under different settings and obtain various performance data on\ndifferent metrics. Then we apply factor analysis on the performance data to\nidentify and quantize the intelligence factors and cognitive capabilities of\nthe CR. More specifically, we present a case study consisting of 144 different\ntypes of CRs. The CRs are different in terms of learning-based dynamic spectrum\naccess strategies, number of sensors, sensing accuracy, processing speed, and\nalgorithmic complexity. Five intelligence factors are identified for the CRs\nthrough our data analysis.We show that these factors comply well with the\nnature of the tested CRs, which validates the proposed intelligence measure\nmethodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 17:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 20:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

QPI maps, which result from scattering of Bloch\nstates off impurities, record the interference of incoming and scattered waves\nas a function of energy and tip's position. Although both the impurity and the\ntip generically break spatial symmetries, we find that the QPI maps provide\nuniversal information on these symmetries. The symmetries impose constraints on\nthe relation between various momentum components of the Bloch functions. These\nrelations result in selection rules on certain momentum transfers in QPI maps.\nWe find that universal information is encoded in the absence of QPI signal, or\nin the relative intensity of its replications. We show examples for\none-dimensional chains and an effective model of the layered compound $\\rm\nZrSiS$. We discuss the implications of our theory in the analysis of observed\nQPI of the Weyl semimetal $\\rm TaAs$.

It is shown analytically that the\nparametric instability leads to an inverse cascade of Alfv\\'en wave quanta, and\nseveral exact solutions to the wave kinetic equations are presented. The main\nresults of the paper concern the parametric decay of Alfv\\'en waves that\ninitially satisfy $e^+ \\gg e^-$, where $e^+$ and $e^-$ are the frequency\n($\\,f$) spectra of Alfv\\'en waves propagating in opposite directions along the\nmagnetic field lines. If $e^+$ initially has a peak frequency $f_0$ (at which\n$f e^+$ is maximized) and an \"infrared\" scaling $f^p$ at smaller $f$ with $-1 <\np < 1$, then $e^+$ acquires an $f^{-1}$ scaling throughout a range of\nfrequencies that spreads out in both directions from $f_0$. At the same time,\n$e^-$ acquires an $f^{-2}$ scaling within this same frequency range. If the\nplasma parameters and infrared $e^+$ spectrum are chosen to match conditions in\nthe fast solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.3 astronomical units (AU),\nthen the nonlinear evolution of the parametric instability leads to an $e^+$\nspectrum that matches fast-wind measurements from the Helios spacecraft at 0.3\nAU, including the observed $f^{-1}$ scaling at $f \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{-4}\n\\mbox{ Hz}$.

Since a maximum energy budget\n($\\sim2\\times10^{52}$ erg) exists for magnetars but not for a black hole, this\nprovides a good clue to identify the type of GRB central engine.

We present a new theory that applies\nto the entire, finite, simulation volume, so that no cutoff issues arise at\nall. The theory gives the direct correlation function for closed systems, while\nsmoothness of the direct correlation function in reciprocal space allows\ncalculating canonical KB integrals via a well-posed extrapolation to the\norigin.

The theory was\ndeveloped to provide a simple physical picture of the relationship between the\nsolution's spatial dielectric function, ion screening, and the chemical\npotential.

A large class of data repair algorithms\nrely on data-quality rules and integrity constraints to detect and repair the\ndata. A well-studied class of integrity constraints is Functional Dependencies\n(FDs, for short) that specify dependencies among attributes in a relation. In\nthis paper, we address three major challenges in data repairing: (1) Accuracy:\nMost existing techniques strive to produce repairs that minimize changes to the\ndata. However, this process may produce incorrect combinations of attribute\nvalues (or patterns). In this work, we formalize the interaction of FD-induced\npatterns and select repairs that result in preserving frequent patterns found\nin the original data. This has the potential to yield a better repair quality\nboth in terms of precision and recall. (2) Interpretability of repairs: Current\ndata repair algorithms produce repairs in the form of data updates that are not\nnecessarily understandable. This makes it hard to debug repair decisions and\ntrace the chain of steps that produced them. To this end, we define a new\nformalism to declaratively express repairs that are easy for users to reason\nabout. (3) Scalability: We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute repairs\nthat outperforms state-of-the-art FD repairing algorithms by orders of\nmagnitude in repair time. Our experiments using both real-world and synthetic\ndata demonstrate that our new repair approach consistently outperforms existing\ntechniques both in terms of repair quality and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 22:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Thus any methods which\nattempt to do so must somehow account for these complexities, and no single\nmodel to date is completely capable of addressing all challenges. This work\ncontributes to the state of research in image geolocation inferencing by\nintroducing a novel global meshing strategy, outlining a variety of training\nprocedures to overcome the considerable data limitations when training these\nmodels, and demonstrating how incorporating additional information can be used\nto improve the overall performance of a geolocation inference model. In this\nwork, it is shown that Delaunay triangles are an effective type of mesh for\ngeolocation in relatively low volume scenarios when compared to results from\nstate of the art models which use quad trees and an order of magnitude more\ntraining data. In addition, the time of posting, learned user albuming, and\nother meta data are easily incorporated to improve geolocation by up to 11% for\ncountry-level (750 km) locality accuracy to 3% for city-level (25 km)\nlocalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 23:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

The fitness gain, which\nsatisfies fluctuation relations (FRs), is attributed to the selection of\norganisms in a population that obtain a better sensing signal by chance. A new\nquantity, similar to the coarse-grained entropy production in information\nthermodynamics, is introduced to quantify the total fitness gain from\nindividual sensing, which also satisfies FRs. Using this quantity, the\noptimizing fitness gain from individual sensing is shown to be related to\nfidelity allocations for individual environmental histories.

However, the minimax theory has\nstill been largely unknown, as opposed to the well established minimax results\nover the corresponding bandable covariance matrices. In this paper, we focus on\ntwo commonly used types of parameter spaces, and develop the optimal rates of\nconvergence under both the operator norm and the Frobenius norm. A striking\nphenomenon is found: two types of parameter spaces are fundamentally different\nunder the operator norm but enjoy the same rate optimality under the Frobenius\nnorm, which is in sharp contrast to the equivalence of corresponding two types\nof bandable covariance matrices under both norms. This fundamental difference\nis established by carefully constructing the corresponding minimax lower\nbounds. Two new estimation procedures are developed: for the operator norm, our\noptimal procedure is based on a novel local cropping estimator targeting on all\nprinciple submatrices of the precision matrix while for the Frobenius norm, our\noptimal procedure relies on a delicate regression-based thresholding rule.\nLepski's method is considered to achieve optimal adaptation.

In model\nchecking, state spaces, i.e., large directed graphs, are explored to verify\nwhether models satisfy desirable properties. GPUexplore is a GPU-based model\nchecker that uses a hash table to efficiently keep track of already explored\nstates. As a large number of states is discovered and stored during such an\nexploration, the hash table should be able to quickly handle many inserts and\nqueries concurrently. In this paper, we experimentally compare two different\nhash tables optimised for the GPU, one being the GPUexplore hash table, and the\nother using Cuckoo hashing. We compare the performance of both hash tables\nusing random and non-random data obtained from model checking experiments, to\nanalyse the applicability of the two hash tables for state space exploration.\nWe conclude that Cuckoo hashing is three times faster than GPUexplore hashing\nfor random data, and that Cuckoo hashing is five to nine times faster for\nnon-random data. This suggests great potential to further speed up GPUexplore\nin the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 05:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

When there is no confinement\ninduced ordering, we recover the similarity solution for the evolution of the\nelastic membrane, which exhibits an infinite sequence of oscillations. However,\nwhen the confinement induced viscosity is comparable to the bulk viscosity, the\nnumerical solutions of the full system reveal the conditions under which the\noscillations and similarity solutions vanish. Implications of our results for\ngeneral thermomechanical dynamics, frost heave observations and cryogenic cell\npreservation are discussed. Finally, through its influence on the viscosity,\nthe confinement effect implicitly introduces a new universal length scale into\nthe volume flux. Thus, there are a host of thin film problems, from droplet\nbreakup to wetting/dewetting dynamics, whose properties (similarity solutions,\nregularization, and compact support) will change under the action of the\nconfinement effect. Therefore, our study suggests revisiting the mathematical\nstructure and experimental implications of a wide range of problems within the\nframework of the confinement effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 07:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 18:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 07:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 16:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Our similarity function incorporates weighted\ncontributions of contextual, string, and phonetic similarity, and the nearest\nneighbor matching involves a minimum similarity threshold. These four\nparameters are tuned efficiently using grid search. We evaluate the performance\nof our approach on two benchmark datasets.

It is not a trivial task to understand\ntheir impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid\nincrease in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant\nnew data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time\nthrough web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,\npotentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,\nsleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This\nis a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare\ndecision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new\nopportunity to overcome this barrier.\n  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major\nfraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning\ntechnique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account\nthe co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity\npatterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the\nperformance of disorder-specific supervised learning models.

To solve this problem and its\nassociated issues, we propose an approach based on a non-stationary (aka\nrestless) extension of Thompson Sampling, a well-known strategy for Multi-Armed\nBandits problems. The collection is first soft-clustered into a finite set of\ncomponents and a posterior distribution of getting a relevant object inside\neach cluster is updated after receiving the user feedback about the proposed\ninstances. The \"next instance\" selection strategy is a mixed, two-level\ndecision process, where both the soft clusters and their instances are\nconsidered.

The process\nof lifting such structures to their Lie algebroid version makes them less\nsingular, as their singular behavior is incorporated in the anchor of the Lie\nalgebroid. We develop a framework for this using the concept of a divisor,\nwhich encodes the singularities, and show when structures exhibiting such\nsingularities can be lifted to a Lie algebroid built out of the divisor. Once\none has successfully lifted the structure, it becomes possible to study it\nusing more powerful techniques. In the case of Poisson structures one can turn\nto employing symplectic techniques. These lead for example to normal form\nresults for the underlying Poisson structures around their singular loci. In\nthis thesis we further adapt the methods of Gompf and Thurston for constructing\nsymplectic structures out of fibration-like maps to their Lie algebroid\ncounterparts.

In particular, the modes of the full conditionals of the parameters\nof the densities in the mixture are computed and these are plugged-in to the\nfull conditional of the auxiliary variables to draw samples.

Several frameworks, have been proposed to\nsimplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore,\nto reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, the cross-compiler\nmobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the\napplication's code written in intermediate (aka non native) language to native\ncode for each desired platform. However, to our best knowledge, there is no\nmuch research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those\nframeworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile\napplications. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to present two\ndatasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile\napplications using Xamarin. Secondly, to show their usefulness, we present a\nreplication study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin\ndevelopment. We created the two datasets by mining two Q&A sites: Xamarin Forum\nand Stack Overflow. Then, for discovering the main topics of the questions from\nboth datasets, we replicated a study that applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). Finally, we compared the discovered topics with those topics about\ngeneral mobile development reported by a previous study. Our datasets have\n85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow.\nBetween the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of\nthem are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the\ndesign pattern \"MVVM\". Both datasets with Xamarin-related Q&A can be used by\nthe research community for understanding the main concerns about developing\ncross-platform mobile applications using Xamarin.

The CO is\none of the most important molecules to trace the molecular gas in the\ninterstellar medium, and the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio is usually used to\nestimate molecular masses and densities of regions with moderate to high\ndensities. Nowadays this kind of isotopes ratios are in general indirectly\nderived from elemental abundances ratios. We present the first 13CO/C18O\nabundance ratio study performed from CO isotopes observations towards a large\nsample of Galactic sources of different nature at different locations. To study\nthe 13CO/C18O abundance ratio it was used 12CO J=3-2 data obtained form the CO\nHigh-Resolution Survey, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 data from the 13CO/C18O (J=3-2)\nHeterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey, and some complementary data extracted\nfrom the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope database. It was analyzed a sample of\n198 sources composed by young stellar objects (YSOs), HII and diffuse HII\nregions as catalogued in the Red MSX Source Survey in 27.5 < l < 46.5 and |b| <\n0.5. Most of the analyzed sources are located in the galactocentric distance\nrange 4.0-6.5 kpc. We found that YSOs have, in average, smaller 13CO/C18O\nabundance ratios than HII and diffuse HII regions. Taking into account that the\ngas associated with YSOs should be less affected by the radiation than in the\ncase of the others sources, selective far-UV photodissociation of C18O is\nconfirmed. The 13CO/C18O abundance ratios obtained in this work are\nsystematically lower than the predicted from the known elemental abundance\nrelations. These results would be useful in future studies of molecular gas\nrelated to YSOs and HII regions based on the observation of these isotopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 13:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

It is essential to constrain a\npotential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the\nmass-observable scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster\nstatistics. In this paper, we present the first thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(tSZ) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the NIKA2 SZ large program that\naims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and\nthe tSZ-mass scaling relation. We have observed the galaxy cluster PSZ2\nG144.83+25.11 at redshift $z=0.58$ with the NIKA2 camera, a dual-band (150 and\n260 GHz) instrument operated at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. We identify a\nthermal pressure excess in the south-west region of PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 and a\nhigh redshift sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium\n(ICM) morphology of the cluster. The NIKA2 data are used jointly with tSZ data\nacquired by the MUSTANG, Bolocam and $Planck$ experiments in order to\nnon-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure\ndistribution from the cluster core ($\\rm{R} \\sim 0.02 \\rm{R_{500}}$) to its\noutskirts ($\\rm{R} \\sim 3 \\rm{R_{500}} $). We investigate the impact of the\nover-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and on the\nconstraints on the integrated Compton parameter $\\rm{Y_{500}}$. A hydrostatic\nmass analysis is also performed by combining the tSZ-constrained pressure\nprofile with the deprojected electronic density profile from XMM-$Newton$. This\nallows us to conclude that the estimates of $\\rm{Y_{500}}$ and $\\rm{M_{500}}$\nobtained from the analysis with and without masking the disturbed ICM region\ndiffer by 65 and 79% respectively.

It has been a\nlong debate whether Turing Machines can simulate the consciousness mind\nbehaviors in the materialistic universe. Three different hypotheses come out of\nsuch debate, in short:(A) Can; (B) Cannot; (C) Super-Turing machines can.\nBecause Turing Machines or other kinds of theoretical computing models are\nabstract objects while behaviors are real observables, this debate involves at\nleast three distinct fields of science and technology: physics, computer\nengineering, and experimental neuroscience. However, the languages used in\nthese different fields are highly heterogeneous and not easily interpretable\nfor each other, making it very difficult to reach partial agreements regarding\nthis debate, Therefore, the main goal of this manuscript is to establish a\nproper language that can translate among those different fields. First, I\npropose a theoretical model for analyzing how theoretical computing machines\nwould physically run in physical time. This model, termed as the xInf, is at\nfirst place Turing-complete in theory, and depending on the properties of\nphysical time, it can be either Turing-equivalent or Super-Turing in the\nphysical universe. The xInf Model is demonstrated to be a suitable universal\nlanguage to translate among physics, computer engineering, and neuroscience.\nFinally, I propose a conjecture that there exists a Minimal Complete Set of\nrules in the xInf Model that enables the construction of a physical machine\nusing inorganic materials that can pass the Turing Test in physical time. I\ncannot demonstrate whether such a conjecture to be testified or falsified on\npaper using finite-order logic, my only solution is physical time itself, i.e.\nan evolutionary competition will eventually tell the conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 23:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}
