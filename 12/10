Here, we propose a simple generalized theoretical model for\nestablishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals\nand investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of\n\"winning\" depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants,\nand the winner has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the\nloser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first\nparameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents\nthe degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for\nthe higher-status individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status\ndistributions reach either a continuous unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian\nend state with one high-status individual and all other individuals having\nstatus approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived\nintermediary distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable\nsociety. As we show, our model allows us to make predictions consistent with\nanimal interaction data and their evolution over a number of years. Moreover,\nby implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions to\nsufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions\nacquire high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class.\nUsing household income as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we\nfind agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts to\nthe characteristic high-status \"tail\". We discuss how the model provides a\nconceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the\nfactors which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 16:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

It has been suggested\nthat the strength of the low-ionization lines, R_2, N_2, and S_2 may be\nincreased (relative to Balmer lines) in (some) spaxel spectra of the MaNGA\nsurvey due to a contribution of the radiation of the diffuse ionized gas.\nConsequently, the abundances derived from the spaxel spectra through\nstrong-line methods may suffer from large errors. We examined this expectation\nby comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated\nthrough different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby\ngalaxies, for fibre spectra from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA\nsurvey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased significantly in the fibre\nand spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and can be as\nlarge as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a\nfactor of 1.3. This suggests that Kaufmann et al.'s demarcation line between\nAGNs and HII regions in the BPT diagram is a useful criterion to reject spectra\nwith significantly distorted strengths of the N_2 and R_2 lines. We find that\nthe three-dimensional R calibration, which uses the N_2 and R_2 lines, produces\nreliable abundances in the MaNGA galaxies. The one-dimensional N2 calibration\nproduces either reliable or wrong abundances depending on whether excitation\nand N/O abundance ratio in the target region (spaxel) are close to or differ\nfrom those parameters in the calibrating points located close to the\ncalibration relation.

The amount of localized charge carriers (spins) is\nfound to be correlated with the content of adsorbed centres responsible for the\nformation of potential barriers and, in turn, for the localization effects.\nPhysical and chemical states of graphene edges, especially at a uniaxial strain\nalong one of them, play a crucial role in electrical transport phenomena in\ngraphene-based materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 19:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

Therefore, very\ncoarse high-order discretizations accurately resolve the piecewise smooth\nsolution throughout the domain, provided the discontinuity is tracked. Central\nto the proposed discontinuity-tracking framework is a discrete PDE-constrained\noptimization formulation that simultaneously aligns the computational mesh with\ndiscontinuities in the solution and solves the discretized conservation law on\nthis mesh. The optimization objective is taken as a combination of the the\ndeviation of the finite-dimensional solution from its element-wise average and\na mesh distortion metric to simultaneously penalize Gibbs' phenomena and\ndistorted meshes. We advocate a gradient-based, full space solver where the\nmesh and conservation law solution converge to their optimal values\nsimultaneously and therefore never require the solution of the discrete\nconservation law on a non-aligned mesh. The merit of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated on a number of one- and two-dimensional model problems including\n2D supersonic flow around a bluff body. We demonstrate optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$ convergence rates in the $L^1$ norm for up to polynomial\norder $p=6$ and show that accurate solutions can be obtained on extremely\ncoarse meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 22:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Recently, methods based\non deep (and convolutional) feedforward networks (CNNs) became popular for pose\nregression. However, these CNN-based methods are still less accurate than\ngeometry based methods despite being fast and memory efficient. In this work we\ndesign a deep neural network architecture based on sparse feature descriptors\nto estimate the absolute pose of an image.

Variants of CNN's have proven to be very\nsuccessful in classification tasks across different domains. However, there are\ntwo big drawbacks to CNN's: their failure to take into account of important\nspatial hierarchies between features, and their lack of rotational invariance.\nAs long as certain key features of an object are present in the test data,\nCNN's classify the test data as the object, disregarding features' relative\nspatial orientation to each other. This causes false positives. The lack of\nrotational invariance in CNN's would cause the network to incorrectly assign\nthe object another label, causing false negatives. To address this concern,\nHinton et al. propose a novel type of neural network using the concept of\ncapsules in a recent paper. With the use of dynamic routing and reconstruction\nregularization, the capsule network model would be both rotation invariant and\nspatially aware. The capsule network has shown its potential by achieving a\nstate-of-the-art result of 0.25% test error on MNIST without data augmentation\nsuch as rotation and scaling, better than the previous baseline of 0.39%.

On the\nother hand, ambient backscatter technology that passively reflects existing RF\nsignal sources in the air to communicate has the potential to facilitate an\nimplementation with ultra-low power consumption. In this paper, we introduce a\nhybrid D2D communication paradigm by integrating ambient backscattering with\nwireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are\nself-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However,\nsince the radio signals for energy harvesting and for backscattering come from\nthe ambient, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications depends largely\non environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission\nload of ambient energy sources. Therefore, we design two mode selection\nprotocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation\nto the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the\nimpacts of the considered environment factors on the hybrid D2D communication\nperformance. Together with extensive simulations, our analysis shows that the\ncommunication performance benefits from larger repulsion, transmission load and\ndensity of ambient energy sources.

The radio/optical emission modulates with the WD's spin and\nshow the double peak structure in the light curves. In this paper, we discuss a\npossible scenario for the radiation mechanism of AR~Scorpii. The magnetic\ninteraction on the surface of the companion star produces an outflow from the\ncompanion star, the heating of the companion star surface, and the acceleration\nof electrons to a relativistic energy. The accelerated electrons, whose typical\nLorentz factor is $\\sim 50-100$, from the companion star move along the\nmagnetic field lines toward the WD surface. The electrons injected with the\npitch angle of $\\sin\\theta_{p,0}>0.05$ are subject to the magnetic mirror\neffect and are trapped in the closed magnetic field line region.We find that\nthe emission from the first magnetic mirror points mainly contributes to the\nobserved pulsed emission and the formation of the double-peak structure in the\nlight curve. For the inclined rotator, the pulse peak in the calculated light\ncurve shifts the position in the spin phase, and a Fourier analysis exhibits a\nbeat frequency feature, which are consistent with the optical/UV observations.\nThe pulse profile also evolves with the orbital phase owing to the effect of\nthe viewing geometry.

Only a\nhandful of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae have been observed in X-rays, and until\nrecently GW Lib was the only binary of this type with complete coverage of an\nX-ray light curve throughout a superoutburst. We collected extensive X-ray data\nof a second such system to understand the extent to which the unexpected\nproperties of GW Lib are common to the WZ Sge class. We analysed the X-ray\nlight curve and compared it with the behaviour of superhumps which were\ndetected in the optical light curve. We also performed spectral analysis of the\ndata. The results were compared with the properties of GW Lib, for which new\nX-ray observations were also obtained. SSS122222 was variable and around five\ntimes brighter in 0.3-10 keV X-rays during the superoutburst than in\nquiescence, mainly because of a significant strengthening of a high-energy\ncomponent of the X-ray spectrum. The post-outburst decline of the X-ray flux\nlasted at least 500 d. The data show no evidence of the expected optically\nthick boundary layer in the system during the outburst. SSS122222 also\nexhibited a sudden X-ray flux change in the middle of the superoutburst, which\noccurred exactly at the time of the superhump stage transition. A similar X-ray\nbehaviour was also detected in GW Lib. This result demonstrates a relationship\nbetween the outer disc and the white dwarf boundary layer for the first time,\nand suggests that models for accretion discs in high mass ratio accreting\nbinaries are currently incomplete. The very long decline to X-ray quiescence is\nalso in strong contrast to the expectation of low viscosity in the disc after\noutburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 12:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

However, the limited endurance of UAVs greatly hinders the practical\nimplementation of UAV-enabled communications. To overcome this issue, this\npaper proposes a novel scheme for UAV-enabled communications by utilizing the\npromising technique of proactive caching at the users. Specifically, we focus\non content-centric communication systems, where a UAV is dispatched to serve a\ngroup of ground nodes (GNs) with random and asynchronous requests for files\ndrawn from a given set. With the proposed scheme, at the beginning of each\noperation period, the UAV pro-actively transmits the files to a subset of\nselected GNs that cooperatively cache all the files in the set. As a result,\nwhen requested, a file can be retrieved by each GN either directly from its\nlocal cache or from its nearest neighbor that has cached the file via\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications. It is revealed that there exists a\nfundamental trade-off between the file caching cost, which is the total time\nrequired for the UAV to transmit the files to their designated caching GNs, and\nthe file retrieval cost, which is the average time required for serving one\nfile request. To characterize this trade-off, we formulate an optimization\nproblem to minimize the weighted sum of the two costs, via jointly designing\nthe file caching policy, the UAV trajectory and communication scheduling. As\nthe formulated problem is NP-hard in general, we propose efficient algorithms\nto find high-quality approximate solutions for it. Numerical results are\nprovided to corroborate our study and show the great potential of proactive\ncaching for overcoming the limited endurance issue in UAV-enabled\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 14:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 04:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

The performance of massive MIMO is then\nanalyzed based on the throughput of cell-edge users.

The bottleneck of serving small numbers of users\nby a large number of transmit antennas is unblocked by a new time-fraction-wise\nbeamforming technique, which focuses signal transmission in fractions of a time\nslot. Accordingly, massive MIMO can deliver better quality-of-experience (QoE)\nin assuring QoS for much larger numbers of users.

ESPH retains crucial chemical information during the topological\nabstraction of geometric complexity and provides a representation of small\nmolecules that cannot be obtained by any other method.

Explicit solvent molecular dynamics\nsimulations of a macromolecule are slow as the number of solvent atoms\nconsidered typically increases by order of magnitude. Implicit methods model\nthe solvent via continuous corrections to the force field based on estimates of\nthe solvent exposed surface areas of individual atoms, gaining speed at the\nexpense of accuracy. However, Laguerre cells of exterior atoms tend to be\noverly large or unbounded. Our method, the Laguerre-Intersection method, caps\ncells in a physically accurate manner by considering the intersection of the\nspace-filling diagram with the Laguerre tessellation. This method optimizes an\nadjustable parameter, the weight, to ensure the areas and volumes of capped\ncells exposed to solvent are as close as possible, on average, to those\ncomputed from equilibrated explicit solvent simulations. The contact planes are\nradical planes, meaning that as the solvent weight is varied, cells remain\nconstant. We test the consistency of our model using a high-quality trajectory\nof HIV-protease, a dimer with flexible loops and open-close transitions.

Accurate theoretical prediction of aqueous\nsolubility and partition coefficient plays an important role in drug design and\ndiscovery. The prediction accuracy depends crucially on molecular descriptors\nwhich are typically derived from theoretical understanding of the chemistry and\nphysics of small molecules. The present work introduces an algebraic topology\nbased method, called element specific persistent homology (ESPH), as a new\nrepresentation of small molecules that is entirely different from conventional\nchemical and/or physical representations. ESPH describes molecular properties\nin terms of multiscale and multicomponent topological invariants. Such\ntopological representation is systematical, comprehensive, and scalable with\nrespect to molecular size and composition variations. However, it cannot be\nliterally translated into a physical interpretation. Fortunately, it is readily\nsuitable for machine learning methods, rendering topological learning\nalgorithms. Due to the inherent correlation between solubility and partition\ncoefficient, a uniform ESPH representation is developed for both properties,\nwhich facilitates multi-task deep neural networks for their simultaneous\npredictions. This strategy leads to more accurate prediction of relatively\nsmall data sets. A total of six data sets is considered in the present work to\nvalidate the proposed topological and multi-task deep learning approaches. It\nis demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve some of the most accurate\npredictions of aqueous solubility and partition coefficient.
