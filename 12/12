This suggests an analogy of the Green-Schwarz mechanism of\nanomaly cancellation, at field theory level, which results in one or more\nStueckelberg pseudoscalars. In the case of a single Stueckelberg pseudoscalar\n$b$, vacuum misalignments at phase transitions in the early Universe at the GUT\nscale provide a small mass - due to instanton suppression of the periodic\npotential - for a component of $b$, denoted as $\\chi$ and termed the\n\"axi-Higgs\", which is a physical axion-like particle. The coupling of the\naxi-Higgs to the gauge sector via Wess-Zumino terms is suppressed by the Planck\nmass, which guarantees its decoupling, while its angle of misalignment is\nrelated to $M_{GUT}$.

First, it is shown\nthat, in low collisionality plasmas, the kinetic contribution of the electrons\nto the radial electric field can make it negative but small, bringing the\nplasma close to impurity temperature screening (i.e., to a situation in which\nthe ion temperature gradient is the main drive of impurity transport and causes\noutward flux); in plasmas of very low collisionality, such as those of the\nLarge Helical Device displaying impurity hole, screening may actually occur.\nSecond, the component of the electric field that is tangent to the flux surface\n(in other words, the variation of the electrostatic potential on the flux\nsurface), although smaller than the radial component, has recently been\nsuggested to be an additional relevant drive for radial impurity transport.\nHere, it is explained that, especially when the radial electric field is small,\nthe tangential magnetic drift has to be kept in order to correctly compute the\ntangential electric field, that can be larger than previously expected.

However, there is not a consensus on the\nvortex definition in fluid dynamics. Lack of mathematical definition has caused\nconsiderable confusions in visualizing and understanding the coherent vortical\nstructures in turbulence. According to previous study, it is realized that\nvortex is not the vorticity tube and vorticity should be decomposed into a\nrotational part which is the vortex vector and a non-rotational part which is\nthe shear. In this paper, several new concepts such as fluid rotation of local\npoint, the direction of fluid rotation axis and the strength of fluid rotation\nare proposed by investigating the kinematics of fluid element in the 2D and 3D\nflows. A definition of a new vector quantity called vortex vector is proposed\nto describe the local fluid rotation. The direction of the vortex vector is\ndefined as the direction of local fluid rotation axis. The velocity components\nin the plane orthogonal to the vortex vector have zero derivatives along the\nvortex vector direction. The magnitude of the vortex vector is defined as the\nrotational part of vorticity in the direction of the vortex vector, which is\nthe twice of the minimum angular velocity of fluid around the point among all\nazimuth in the plane perpendicular to vortex vector. According to the\ndefinition of the vortex vector, vortex is defined as a connected flow region\nwhere the magnitude of the vortex vector at each point is larger than zero. The\nnew definition for the vortex vector and vortex follows three principles: 1.\nLocal in quantity, 2. Galilean invariant, 3. Unique.

Protocol 1 requires a file\nsize that is exponential in the number of files in the system, while Protocol 2\nrequires a file size that is independent of the number of files and is hence\nsimpler.

The ability of\nusing synthetic images for training a Deep Network is extremely valuable as it\nis easy to create a virtually infinite training set made of such images, while\ncapturing and annotating real images can be very cumbersome. However, synthetic\nimages do not resemble real images exactly, and using them for training can\nresult in suboptimal performance. It was recently shown that for exemplar-based\napproaches, it is possible to learn a mapping from the exemplar representations\nof real images to the exemplar representations of synthetic images. In this\npaper, we show that this approach is more general, and that a network can also\nbe applied after the mapping to infer a 3D pose: At run time, given a real\nimage of the target object, we first compute the features for the image, map\nthem to the feature space of synthetic images, and finally use the resulting\nfeatures as input to another network which predicts the 3D pose. Since this\nnetwork can be trained very effectively by using synthetic images, it performs\nvery well in practice, and inference is faster and more accurate than with an\nexemplar-based approach. We demonstrate our approach on the LINEMOD dataset for\n3D object pose estimation from color images, and the NYU dataset for 3D hand\npose estimation from depth maps.

The difference between the games are\nthe collision constraints and the payoff. In the first game collision avoidance\nis only considered by the follower, and each player maximizes their own\nprogress towards the finish line. We show that, thanks to the sequential\nstructure of this game, equilibria can be computed through an efficient\nsequential maximization approach.

Together with a theoretical framework of the\nenergy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics\nof the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding\nbarrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the folding rates of two\nprotein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a\n64-residue alpha/beta chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue\nbeta-barrel alpha-spectrin src-Homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing\nthe protein folding kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence\nof HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein\nfolding appears to have a crossover behavior about the folding temperature.\nMeaning that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the\nenhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an\nunfolded configuration results in lowered folding rate; conversely, at a\ntemperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding by the\nbackflow of solvent toward the native folded state. Additionally, the extent of\nacceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2,\nwhere its folding nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels\nthe formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway in a complex free\nenergy landscape, thus accelerating folding.

The theoretically suggested vortex ice distribution, lacking long\nrange order, is observed at half matching field (H_{1}/2). Moreover, the vortex\nice state formed by the pinned vortices is still preserved at 2H_{1}/3. This\nunexpected result is attributed to the introduction of interstitial vortices at\nthese magnetic field values. Although the interstitial vortices increase the\nnumber of possible vortex configurations, it is clearly shown that the vortex\nice state observed at 2H_{1}/3 is less prone to defects than at $H_{1}/2$.

However, the\nenabling CMOS technology scaling has been facing significant challenges of\ndevice uncertainties, such as process, voltage, and temperature variations. To\nensure system reliability, worst-case corner assumptions are usually made in\neach design level. However, the over-pessimistic worst-case margin leads to\nunnecessary power waste and performance loss as high as 2.2x. Since\noptimizations are traditionally confined to each specific level, those safe\nmargins can hardly be properly exploited.\n  To tackle the challenge, it is therefore advised in this Ph.D. thesis to\nperform a cross-layer optimization for digital signal processing circuits and\nsystems, to achieve a global balance of power consumption and output quality.\n  To conclude, the traditional over-pessimistic worst-case approach leads to\nhuge power waste. In contrast, the adaptive voltage scaling approach saves\npower (25% for the CORDIC application) by providing a just-needed supply\nvoltage. The power saving is maximized (46% for CORDIC) when a more aggressive\nvoltage over-scaling scheme is applied. These sparsely occurred circuit errors\nproduced by aggressive voltage over-scaling are mitigated by higher level error\nresilient designs. For functions like FFT and CORDIC, smart error mitigation\nschemes were proposed to enhance reliability (soft-errors and timing-errors,\nrespectively). Applications like Massive MIMO systems are robust against lower\nlevel errors, thanks to the intrinsically redundant antennas. This property\nmakes it applicable to embrace digital hardware that trades quality for power\nsavings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

We consider the light\ndeflection of a point-like lens and impose that the two Schwarzschild-like\nmetrics with and without the lens are identical at infinite distances from the\nlens. The energy conservation law implies that the parameter $\\gamma$ in the\nlinear term of the metric has to vanish, otherwise the two metrics are\nphysically inaccessible from each other. This linear term is responsible to\nmimic the role of dark matter in disk galaxies and gravitational lensing\nsystems.

We also illustrate why the\nresults of previous investigations of gravitational lensing in CG largely\ndisagree. These discrepancies derive from the erroneous use of the deflection\nangle definition adopted in General Relativity, where the vacuum solution is\nasymptotically flat, unlike CG. In addition, the lens mass is identified with\nvarious combinations of the metric parameters. However, these identifications\nare arbitrary, because the mass is not a conformally invariant quantity, unlike\nthe conserved charge associated to the energy conservation law. Based on this\nconservation law and by removing the fine-tuning condition on $\\gamma$, i.e. by\nsetting $\\gamma=0$, the energy difference between the metric with the\npoint-like lens and the metric without it defines a conformally invariant\nquantity that can in principle be used for (1) a proper derivation of light\ndeflection in CG, and (2) the identification of the lens mass with a function\nof the parameters $\\beta$ and $k$ of the Schwarzschild-like metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 19:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 12:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 14:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Segmentation of brain\nimagery into brain tissue and CSF (before and after surgery, i.e. pre-op vs.\npostop) plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of\npre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well\nresearched. However, segmenting post-operative (post-op) computational\ntomographic (CT)-scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and\nsubdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity and feature\nbased segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as\nsubdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity\nvaries with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats\nsegmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e. a training\nset of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. Methods: Our\ncontributions include: 1.) a dictionary learning framework that learns class\n(segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples\nfrom the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other\nclasses, 2.) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint, and\n3.) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op\nhydrocephalic CT images. Results: Experiments performed on infant CT brain\nimages acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success\nof our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a\ngraceful degradation against number of training samples, enhancing its\ndeployment potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 19:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

However, they suffer from the high level\nof complexity imposed by the high-dimensional convolutions in convolutional\nlayers. Within scenarios with limited hardware resources and tight power and\nlatency constraints, the high computational complexity of CNNs makes them\ndifficult to be exploited. Hardware solutions have striven to reduce the power\nconsumption using low-power techniques, and to limit the processing time by\nincreasing the number of processing elements (PEs). While most of ASIC designs\nclaim a peak performance of a few hundred giga operations per seconds, their\naverage performance is substantially lower when applied to state-of-the-art\nCNNs such as AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet, leading to low resource utilization.\nTheir performance efficiency is limited to less than 55% on average, which\nleads to unnecessarily high processing latency and silicon area. In this paper,\nwe propose a dataflow which enables to perform both the fully-connected and\nconvolutional computations for any filter/layer size using the same PEs.

The two important factors impacting the\nperformance of transfer learning models are: (a) the size of the target\ndataset, and (b) the similarity in distribution between source and target\ndomains. Thus far, there has been little investigation into just how important\nthese factors are. In this paper, we investigate the impact of target dataset\nsize and source/target domain similarity on model performance through a series\nof experiments. We find that more data is always beneficial, and model\nperformance improves linearly with the log of data size, until we are out of\ndata. As source/target domains differ, more data is required and fine tuning\nwill render better performance than feature extraction. When source/target\ndomains are similar and data size is small, fine tuning and feature extraction\nrenders equivalent performance. Our hope is that by beginning this quantitative\ninvestigation on the effect of data volume and domain similarity in transfer\nlearning we might inspire others to explore the significance of data in\ndeveloping more accurate statistical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 20:30:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 18:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 19:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 19:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

The origin\nof this phenomenon is largely attributed to the interference of the incident\nlaser wave and surface electromagnetic wave that creates a periodic absorption\npattern. Although, commonly, LIPSS are produced by repetitive irradiation of\nthe same area by multiple laser pulses in the regime of surface melting and\nresolidification, recent reports demonstrate the formation of LIPSS in the\nsingle pulse irradiation regime at laser fluences well above the ablation\nthreshold. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale molecular dynamics\nsimulation aimed at providing insights into the mechanisms of single pulse\nablative LIPSS formation. The simulation performed for a Cr target reveals an\ninterplay of material removal and redistribution in the course of spatially\nmodulated ablation, leading to the transient formation of an elongated liquid\nwall extending up to ~600 nm above the surface of the target at the locations\nof the minima of the laser energy deposition. The upper part of the liquid wall\ndisintegrates into droplets while the base of the wall solidifies on the\ntimescale of ~2 ns, producing a ~100 nm-long frozen surface feature extending\nabove the level of the initial surface of the target. The properties of the\nsurface region of the target are modified by the presence of high densities of\ndislocations and vacancies generated due to the rapid and highly nonequilibrium\nnature of the melting and resolidification processes. The insights into the\nLIPSS formation mechanisms may help in designing approaches for increasing the\nprocessing speed and improving the quality of the laser-patterned periodic\nsurface structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 20:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Their impact on supermassive\nblack hole growth and star formation is profound. The detailed study of dense\nmolecular gas in galaxies provides an important test of the validity of the\nrelation between star formation rate and HCN luminosity on different galactic\nscales. We use observations of HCN, HCO+1-0 and CO3-2 to study the dense gas\nproperties in the Medusa merger. We calculate the brightness temperature ratios\nand use them in conjunction with a non-LTE radiative line transfer model. The\nHCN and HCO+1-0, and CO3-2 emission do not occupy the same structures as the\nless dense gas associated with the lower-J CO emission. The only emission from\ndense gas is detected in a 200pc region within the \"Eye of the Medusa\". No HCN\nor HCO+ is detected for the extended starburst. The CO3-2/2-1 brightness\ntemperature ratio inside \"the Eye\" is ~2.5 - the highest ratio found so far.\nThe line ratios reveal an extreme, fragmented molecular cloud population inside\n\"the Eye\" with large temperatures (>300K) and high gas densities (>10^4 cm^-3).\n\"The Eye\" is found at an interface between a large-scale minor axis inflow and\nthe Medusa central region. The extreme conditions inside \"the Eye\" may be the\nresult of the radiative and mechanical feedback from a deeply embedded, young,\nmassive super star cluster, formed due to the gas pile-up at the intersection.\nAlternatively, shocks from the inflowing gas may be strong enough to shock and\nfragment the gas. For both scenarios, however, it appears that the HCN and HCO+\ndense gas tracers are not probing star formation, but instead a post-starburst\nand/or shocked ISM that is too hot and fragmented to form new stars. Thus,\ncaution is advised in linking the detection of emission from dense gas tracers\nto evidence of ongoing or imminent star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 21:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 08:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

This is a\nfundamental problem that has undergone a tremendous amount of work. It is known\nto be NP-hard, even when the obstacles are very simple geometric shapes (e.g.,\nunit-length line segments). The problem can be generalized into the following\ngraph problem: Given a planar graph $G$ whose vertices are colored by color\nsets, two designated vertices $s, t \\in V(G)$, and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is there\nan $s$-$t$ path in $G$ that uses at most $k$ colors? If each obstacle is\nconnected, the resulting graph satisfies the color-connectivity property,\nnamely that each color induces a connected subgraph.\n  We study the complexity and design algorithms for the above graph problem\nwith an eye on its geometric applications. We prove that without the\ncolor-connectivity property, the problem is W[SAT]-hard parameterized by $k$. A\ncorollary of this result is that, unless W[2] $=$ FPT, the problem cannot be\napproximated in FPT time to within a factor that is a function of $k$. By\ndescribing a generic plane embedding of the graph instances, we show that our\nhardness results translate to the geometric instances of the problem.\n  We then focus on graphs satisfying the color-connectivity property.

We employ these results to design an FPT\nalgorithm for the problem parameterized by both $k$ and the treewidth of the\ngraph, and extend this result to obtain an FPT algorithm for the\nparameterization by both $k$ and the length of the path.

Our Solar System's Titan\nis a prototypical hazy planet, whose atmosphere may be representative of a\nlarge number of planets in our Galaxy. As a step towards characterizing such\nworlds, we present simulations of exoplanets that resemble Titan, but orbit\nthree different stellar hosts: G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We use general\ncirculation and photochemistry models to explore the circulation and chemistry\nof these Titan-like planets under varying stellar spectra, in all cases\nassuming a Titan-like insolation. Due to the strong absorption of visible light\nby atmospheric haze, the redder radiation accompanying later stellar types\nproduces more isothermal stratospheres, stronger meridional temperature\ngradients at mbar pressures, and deeper and stronger zonal winds. In all cases,\nthe planets' atmospheres are strongly superrotating, but meridional circulation\ncells are weaker aloft under redder starlight. The photochemistry of\nhydrocarbon and nitrile species varies with stellar spectra, with variations in\nthe FUV/NUV flux ratio playing an important role. Our results tentatively\nsuggest that column haze production rates could be similar under all three\nhosts, implying that planets around many different stars could have similar\ncharacteristics to Titan's atmosphere. Lastly, we present theoretical emission\nspectra. Overall, our study indicates that, despite important and subtle\ndifferences, the circulation and chemistry of Titan-like exoplanets are\nrelatively insensitive to differences in host star.

The local magnetic field of the magnetic\nSTM tip serves to precisely tune the superposition states of a pair of spins.\nThe precise control of the spin-spin interactions and ability to probe the\nstates of the coupled-spin network by addressing individual spins will enable\nexploration of quantum many-body systems based on networks of spin-1/2 atoms on\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Despite\nremarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, one of their\nmajor shortcomings is the fact that in practice, they tend to produce samples\nwith little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon,\nknown as mode collapse, has been the main focus of several recent advances in\nGANs. Yet there is little understanding of why mode collapse happens and why\nexisting approaches are able to mitigate mode collapse. We propose a principled\napproach to handling mode collapse, which we call packing. The main idea is to\nmodify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the\nsame class, either real or artificially generated. We borrow analysis tools\nfrom binary hypothesis testing---in particular the seminal result of Blackwell\n[Bla53]---to prove a fundamental connection between packing and mode collapse.\nWe show that packing naturally penalizes generators with mode collapse, thereby\nfavoring generator distributions with less mode collapse during the training\nprocess. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing\nprovides significant improvements in practice as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 22:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 04:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

This motivates treating medians on the same footing as sides\nin triangle geometry and the resulting Shape Theory. In this paper, we\nconsequently reformulate inequalities for the medians in terms of shape\nquantities, and proceed to find inequalities on the mass-weighted Jacobi\ncoordinates. This work moreover identifies the $4/3$ -- powers of which occur\nfrequently in the theory of medians -- as the ratio of Jacobi masses.\n  One of the Hopf coordinates is tetra-area. Another is anisoscelesness, which\nparametrizes whether triangles are left-or-right leaning as bounded by\nisoscelesness itself. The third is ellipticity, which parametrizes\ntallness-or-flatness of triangles as bounded by regular triangles. Whereas\ntetra-area is clearly cluster choice invariant, Jacobi coordinates,\nanisoscelesness and ellipticity are cluster choice dependent but can be\n`democratized' by averaging over all clusters. Democratized ellipticity\nmoreover trivializes, due to ellipticity being the difference of base-side and\nmedian second moments, whose averages are equal to each other. Thus we\nintroduce a distinct `linear ellipticity' quantifier of tallness-or-flatness of\ntriangles whose democratization is nontrivial, and find inequalities bounding\nthis. Some of this paper's inequalities are shape-independent bounds, whereas\nothers' bounds depend on the isoperimetric ratio and arithmetic-to-geometric\nside mean ratio shape variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 01:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The plateau component is usually\ninterpreted as the dipole emission from a supra-massive magnetar, and the sharp\ndecay may imply the collapse of the magnetar to a black hole (BH). Fall-back\naccretion onto the new-born BH could produce long-lasting activities via the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) process. The magnetic flux accumulated near the BH would\nbe confined by the accretion disks for a period of time. As the accretion rate\ndecreases, the magnetic flux is strong enough to obstruct gas infall, leading\nto a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Within this scenario, we show that the\nBZ process could produce two types of typical X-ray light curves: type I\nexhibits a long-lasting plateau, followed by a power-law decay with slopes\nranging from 5/3 to 40/9; type II shows roughly a single power-law decay with\nslope of 5/3. The former requires low magnetic filed strength, while the latter\ncorresponds to relatively high values. We search for such signatures of the\nnew-born BH from a sample of short GRBs with an internal plateau, and find two\ncandidates: GRB 101219A and GRB 160821B, corresponding to type II and type I\nlight curve, respectively.

We\npropose an approach that hallucinates the unobserved future motion implied by a\nsingle snapshot to help static-image action recognition. The key idea is to\nlearn a prior over short-term dynamics from thousands of unlabeled videos,\ninfer the anticipated optical flow on novel static images, and then train\ndiscriminative models that exploit both streams of information. Our main\ncontributions are twofold. First, we devise an encoder-decoder convolutional\nneural network and a novel optical flow encoding that can translate a static\nimage into an accurate flow map.

Since PCA-based methods assume that the\nmonitored process is linear, nonlinear PCA models, such as autoencoder models\nand kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), has been proposed and applied\nto nonlinear process monitoring. However, KPCA-based methods need to perform\neigen-decomposition (ED) on the kernel Gram matrix whose dimensions depend on\nthe number of training data. Moreover, prefixed kernel parameters cannot be\nmost effective for different faults which may need different parameters to\nmaximize their respective detection performances. Autoencoder models lack the\nconsideration of orthogonal constraints which is crucial for PCA-based\nalgorithms. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear\nmethod, called neural component analysis (NCA), which intends to train a\nfeedforward neural work with orthogonal constraints such as those used in PCA.\nNCA can adaptively learn its parameters through backpropagation and the\ndimensionality of the nonlinear features has no relationship with the number of\ntraining samples.

To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts\nhave been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage.

We propose a novel approach to\nlearning the joint distribution between the data and a latent code which uses\nan adversarially learned iterative procedure to gradually refine the joint\ndistribution, $p(x, z)$, to better match with the data distribution on each\nstep. GibbsNet is the best of both worlds both in theory and in practice.\nAchieving the speed and simplicity of a directed latent variable model, it is\nguaranteed (assuming the adversarial game reaches the virtual training criteria\nglobal minimum) to produce samples from $p(x, z)$ with only a few sampling\niterations. Achieving the expressiveness and flexibility of an undirected\nlatent variable model, GibbsNet does away with the need for an explicit $p(z)$\nand has the ability to do attribute prediction, class-conditional generation,\nand joint image-attribute modeling in a single model which is not trained for\nany of these specific tasks.

For instance, the fact\nthat two people share a meal describes a relationship independent of the meal's\ningredients. Multiple such relationships give rise to relations and their\nlattices. Lattices have topology. That topology informs the ways in which\ninformation may be observed, hidden, inferred, and dissembled.\n  Dowker's Theorem establishes a homotopy equivalence between two simplicial\ncomplexes derived from a relation. From a privacy perspective, one complex\ndescribes individuals with common attributes, the other describes attributes\nshared by individuals. The homotopy equivalence produces a lattice. An element\nin the lattice consists of two components, one being a set of individuals, the\nother being a set of attributes. The lattice operations join and meet each\namount to set intersection in one component and set union followed by a\npotentially privacy-puncturing inference in the other component.\n  Privacy loss appears as simplicial collapse of free faces. Such collapse is\nlocal, but the property of fully preserving both attribute and association\nprivacy requires a global condition: a particular kind of spherical hole. By\nlooking at the link of an identifiable individual in its encompassing Dowker\ncomplex, one can characterize that individual's attribute privacy via another\nsphere condition. Even when long-term attribute privacy is impossible, homology\nprovides lower bounds on how an individual may defer identification, when that\nindividual has control over how to reveal attributes. Intuitively, the idea is\nto first reveal information that could otherwise be inferred. This last result\nhighlights privacy as a dynamic process. Privacy loss may be cast as gradient\nflow. Harmonic flow for privacy preservation may be fertile ground for future\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 04:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

We first provide a general model including an\narbitrary number of jammers, and show that its capacity region is equivalent to\nthat of a simplified model in which the received jamming signal at each decoder\nis independent. Next, existing outer and inner bounds for two-user Gaussian\ninterference channel are generalized for this simplified jamming model. We show\nthat for certain problem parameters, precisely the same bounds hold, but with\nthe noise variance increased by the received power of the jammer at each\nreceiver. Thus, the jammers can do no better than to transmit Gaussian noise.\nFor these problem parameters, this allows us to recover the half-bit theorem.\nIn weak and strong interference regime, our inner bound matches the\ncorresponding Han-Kobayashi bound with increased noise variance by the received\npower of the jammer, and even in strong interference we achieve the exact\ncapacity. Furthermore, we determine the symmetric degrees of freedom where the\nsignal-to-noise, interference-to-noise and jammer-to-noise ratios are all tend\nto infinity. Moreover, we show that, if the jammer has greater received power\nthan the legitimate user, symmetrizability makes the capacity zero. The proof\nof the outer bound is straightforward, while the inner bound generalizes the\nHan-Kobayashi rate splitting scheme. As a novel aspect, the inner bound takes\nadvantage of the common message acting as common randomness for the private\nmessage; hence, the jammer cannot symmetrize only the private codeword without\nbeing detected. This complication requires an extra condition on the signal\npower, so that in general our inner bound is not identical to the Han-Kobayashi\nbound. We also prove a new variation of the packing lemma that applies for\nmultiple Gaussian codebooks in an adversarial setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

In this paper, we address the problem of the\nformulation of nested complex of parameters by regarding the feature map as a\ntransport map. Even when a feature map has different dimensions between input\nand output, we can regard it as a transportation map by considering that both\nthe input and output spaces are embedded in a common high-dimensional space.

A practical limitation of these\ntechniques is that they overload the user with too many patterns. Local Process\nModel (LPM) mining is an alternative approach coming from the field of process\nmining. While in traditional sequential pattern mining, a pattern describes one\nsubsequence, an LPM captures a set of subsequences. Also, while traditional\nsequential patterns only match subsequences that are observed in the sequence\ndatabase, an LPM may capture subsequences that are not explicitly observed, but\nthat are related to observed subsequences. In other words, LPMs generalize the\nbehavior observed in the sequence database. These properties make it possible\nfor a set of LPMs to cover the behavior of a much larger set of sequential\npatterns. Yet, existing LPM mining techniques still suffer from the pattern\nexplosion problem because they produce sets of redundant LPMs. In this paper,\nwe propose several heuristics to mine a set of non-redundant LPMs either from a\nset of redundant LPMs or from a set of sequential patterns. We empirically\ncompare the proposed heuristics between them and against existing (local)\nprocess mining techniques in terms of coverage, redundancy, and complexity of\nthe produced sets of LPMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 06:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

Under such networking paradigm, most existing works\nfocus on designing sophisticated controller-synchronization strategies to\nimprove joint controller-decision-making for inter-domain routing. However,\nthere is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how the performance of\ndistributed SDN is related to network attributes, thus impossible to justify\nthe necessity of complicated strategies. In this regard, we analyze and\nquantify the performance enhancement of distributed SDN architectures,\ninfluenced by intra-/inter-domain synchronization levels and network structural\nproperties. Based on a generic weighted network model, we establish analytical\nmethods for performance estimation under four synchronization scenarios with\nincreasing synchronization cost. Moreover, two of these synchronization\nscenarios correspond to extreme cases, i.e., minimum/maximum synchronization,\nwhich are, therefore, capable of bounding the performance of distributed SDN\nwith any given synchronization levels. Our theoretical results reveal how\nnetwork performance is related to synchronization levels and inter-domain\nconnections, the accuracy of which are confirmed by simulations based on both\nreal and synthetic networks.

Aims: The goal is to estimate the direction and amount of\nshift in the semimajor axis of the resonance location due to the disk gravity\nas a function of the gas density and mass of the planets. The stability of the\nresonance lock when the disk dissipates is also tested. Methods: The orbital\nevolution of a large number of systems is numerically integrated within a\nthree-body problem in which the disk potential is computed as a series of\nexpansion. This is a good approximation, at least over a limited amount of\ntime. Results: Two different resonances are studied: the 2:1 and the 3:2. In\nboth cases the shift is inwards, even if by a different amount, when the\nplanets are massive and carve a gap in the disk. For super--Earths, the shift\nis instead outwards. Different disk densities, Sigma, are considered and the\nresonance shift depends almost linearly on Sigma. The gas dissipation leads to\ndestabilization of a significant number of resonant systems, in particular if\nit is fast. Conclusions: The presence of a massive circumstellar disk may\nsignificantly affect the resonant behavior of a pair of planets by shifting the\nresonant location and by decreasing the size of the stability region. The disk\ndissipation may explain some systems found close to a resonance but not locked\nin it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 08:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

This has led to question the very existence of\nferroelectricity for very small particles. However there are also reports in\nthe literature of ultra-high values of permittivity when specific processes or\ndoping are performed, for instance in the BT-family, or in the CaCu3Ti4O12-\nfamily and interpretations using (IBLC) have been proposed. We have considered\nthese effects in the framework of a core-shell model of ceramics. The ultrahigh\nvalues mentioned above could be reproduced by considering that the core (be it\ndielectric or ferroelectric) have non-zero conductivity. In particular a huge\nbackground of permittivity and a Maxwell Wagner relaxation were obtained in\nagreement with the experimental situation. Different types of inhomogeneity\n(grain size distribution, mixing of conductive and non-conductive phases,\nporosity) have also been considered and their effects are discussed.

To do sequential inference, we then either have to\nevaluate the second posterior at only these locations and reweight the samples\naccordingly, or we can estimate a functional description of the posterior\nprobability distribution from the samples and use that as prior for the second\ninference. Here, we investigated to what extent we can obtain an accurate joint\nposterior from two datasets if the inference is done sequentially rather than\njointly, under the condition that each inference step is done using Monte Carlo\nsampling. To test this, we evaluated the accuracy of kernel density estimates,\nGaussian mixtures, vine copulas and Gaussian processes in approximating\nposterior distributions, and then tested whether these approximations can be\nused in sequential inference.

The present\nwork aims to explore the adequacy of different gap-type (unscreened electric\nfield) models to account for the observed characteristics. Based on a\nphenomenological description of the gap potential, we estimate the maximum\nextractable gap power $L_{gap}$ for different magnetospheric set-ups, and study\nits dependence on the accretion state of the source. $L_{gap}$ is found to be\nin general proportional to the Blandford-Znajek jet power $L_{BZ}$ and a\nsensitive function of gap size $h$, i.e. $L_{gap} \\sim L_{BZ} (h/r_g)^{\\beta}$,\nwhere the power index $\\beta \\geq 1$ is dependent on the respective gap-setup.\nThe transparency of the black hole vicinity to VHE photons generally requires a\nradiatively inefficient accretion environment and thereby imposes constraints\non possible accretion rates, and correspondingly on $L_{BZ}$. Similarly, rapid\nvariability, if observed, may allow to constrain the gap size $h\\sim c \\Delta\nt$. Combining these constraints, we provide a general classification to assess\nthe likelihood that the VHE gamma-ray emission observed from an AGN can be\nattributed to a magnetospheric origin. When applied to prominent candidate\nsources these considerations suggest that the variable (day-scale) VHE activity\nseen in the radio galaxy M87 could be compatible with a magnetospheric origin,\nwhile such an origin appears less likely for the (minute-scale) VHE activity in\nIC310.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Causal patterns refer to the signal patterns within\ninteractions of two elements having multiple types of mutually causal\nrelationships, rather than a mixture of simultaneous correlations or the\nabsence of presence of a causal relationship between the elements. In\nmultivariate statistics, partial canonical correlation analysis (PCCA)\nevaluates the correlation between two multivariates after subtracting the\neffect of the third multivariate. PCCA can calculate the Granger Causal- ity\nIndex (which tests whether a time-series can be predicted from an- other\ntime-series), but is not applicable to data containing multiple partial\ncanonical correlations.

A central question for such\nnetworks is that of identifiability, which essentially asks under what\ncircumstances can we reliably identify the phylogenetic network that gave rise\nto the observed data? Recently, identifiability results have appeared for\nnetworks relative to a model of sequence evolution that generalizes the\nstandard Markov models used for phylogenetic trees. However, these results are\nquite limited in terms of the complexity of the networks that are considered.\nIn this paper, by introducing an alternative probabilistic model for evolution\nalong a network that is based on some ground-breaking work by Thatte for\npedigrees, we are able to obtain an identifiability result for a much larger\nclass of phylogenetic networks (essentially the class of so-called tree-child\nnetworks). To prove our main theorem, we derive some new results for\nidentifying tree-child networks combinatorially, and then adapt some techniques\ndeveloped by Thatte for pedigrees to show that our combinatorial results imply\nidentifiability in the probabilistic setting.

The observation of different\nvariability timescales of the reflected emission in the Sgr A molecular complex\ncan be well explained if the X-ray emission of at least two distinct and\nrelatively short events (i.e. about 10 years or less) is currently propagating\nthrough the region. The number of such events or the presence of a\nlong-duration illumination are open questions.\n  Variability of the reflected emission all over of the central 300 pc, in\nparticular in the 6.4 keV Fe Ka line, can bring strong constraints. To do so we\nperformed a deep scan of the inner 300 pc with XMM-Newton in 2012. Together\nwith all the archive data taken over the course of the mission, and in\nparticular a similar albeit more shallow scan performed in 2000-2001, this\nallows for a detailed study of variability of the 6.4 keV line emission in the\nregion, which we present here.\n  We show that the overall 6.4 keV emission does not strongly vary on average,\nbut variations are very pronounced on smaller scales. In particular, most\nregions showing bright reflection emission in 2000-2001 significantly decrease\nby 2012. We discuss those regions and present newly illuminated features. The\nabsence of bright steady emission argues against the presence of an echo from\nan event of multi-centennial duration and most, if not all, of the emission can\nlikely be explained by a limited number of relatively short (i.e. up to 10\nyears) events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Here we\nemphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model\ndecision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world\nblack-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are\neasier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple\ndefences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this\ncategory were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce\nthe Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large\nadversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while\nstaying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no\nhyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive\nwith the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like\nImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com.\nThe Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in\ngeneral open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and\nraise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems.\nAn implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox at\nhttps://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

This opens up a broad avenue\nof applying this classification approach to audio, images, and text sequences.\nOur algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical\nguarantees. In the process we solve an open combinatorial problem, which was\nposed as a major hindrance to the scalability of existing solutions. We give\nanalytical bounds on quality and runtime of our algorithm and report its\nempirical performance on real world biological and music sequences datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 12:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

In order to\naccount for the cache capacity limitations at the Edge Nodes (ENs),\ntransmission generally involves both fronthaul transfer from a cloud processor\nwith access to the content library to the ENs, as well as wireless delivery\nfrom the ENs to the users. In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from\nan information-theoretic viewpoint by making the following practically relevant\nassumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded fractional\ncaching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of\ncontents; and 4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on\nthe wireless channel. Assuming offline proactive caching and focusing on a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) latency metric, the optimal information-theoretic\nperformance is investigated under both serial and pipelined fronthaul-edge\ntransmission modes. The analysis characterizes the minimum high-SNR latency in\nterms of Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) for worst-case users' demands.

Instead of forming a pointy tip on the frozen deionized water droplet,\nwe found that the top of a frozen nanofluid droplet exhibits a flat plateau\nshape and such plateau becomes larger with increasing nanoparticle\nconcentration. We ascribe this characteristic shape change to an outward\nMarangoni flow which moves liquid from the droplet interior to its vertexes,\nthus engendering the volume redistribution and shape changes.

Period analysis of the RVs of the\nthree components yields orbital periods $P_{\\rm orb} = 1.5806(1)$~d for the Aa\nand Ab components, and 6.67(2)~d for the B component, a PGa star. Period\nanalysis of the longitudinal magnetic field \\bz~and H$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidths, which should both be sensitive to the rotational period $P_{\\rm rot}$\nof the magnetic Aa component, both yield $\\sim$1.58~d. Since $P_{\\rm orb} =\nP_{\\rm rot}$ Aa and Ab must be tidally locked. Consistent with this, the orbit\nis circularized, and the rotational and orbital inclinations are identical\nwithin uncertainty, as are the semi-major axis and the Kepler corotation\nradius. The star's H$\\alpha$ emission morphology differs markedly from both\ntheoretical and observational expectations in that there is only one, rather\nthan two, emission peaks. We propose that this unusual morphology may be a\nconsequence of modification of the gravitocentrifugal potential by the presence\nof the close stellar companion. We also obtain upper limits on the magnetic\ndipole strength $B_{\\rm d}$ for the Ab and B components, respectively finding\n$B_{\\rm d} < 2.6$~kG and $<0.7$~kG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Without ground-truth mapping, prior literature proposes\nvarious cost functions in hope of measuring the quality of mappings. However,\nthere is generally a lacking of rationale behind the cost functions, whose\nminimizer also remains algorithmically unknown. We jointly tackle above\nconcerns under a more practical social network model parameterized by\noverlapping communities, which, neglected by prior art, can serve as side\ninformation for de-anonymization. Regarding the unavailability of ground-truth\nmapping to adversaries, by virtue of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), our\nfirst contribution is a well-justified cost function minimizing the expected\nnumber of mismatched users over all possible true mappings. While proving the\nNP-hardness of minimizing MMSE, we validly transform it into the weighted-edge\nmatching problem (WEMP), which, as disclosed theoretically, resolves the\ntension between optimality and complexity: (i) WEMP asymptotically returns a\nnegligible mapping error in large network size under mild conditions\nfacilitated by higher overlapping strength; (ii) WEMP can be algorithmically\ncharacterized via the convex-concave based de-anonymization algorithm (CBDA),\nperfectly finding the optimum of WEMP. Extensive experiments further confirm\nthe effectiveness of CBDA under overlapping communities, in terms of averagely\n90% re-identified users in the rare true cross-domain co-author networks when\ncommunities overlap densely, and roughly 70% enhanced re-identification ratio\ncompared to non-overlapping cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Some families bifurcate\nglobally from a bald BH ($e.g.$ the Kerr BH), whereas others bifurcate only\nlocally from a bald BH ($e.g.$ the $D=5$ Myers-Perry BH). It would be desirable\nto understand how generically synchronisation allows hairy BHs to bifurcate\nfrom bald ones.

When dealing with functional covariates,\nmeasurement error has thus far been modelled as additive white noise over the\nobservation grid. Such a setting implicitly assumes that the error arises\npurely at the discrete sampling stage, otherwise the model can only be viewed\nin a weak (stochastic differential equation) sense, white noise not being a\nsecond-order process. Departing from this simple distributional setting can\nhave serious consequences for inference, similar to the multivariate case, and\ncurrent methodology will break down.

In the symmetry\nbroken regimes our flow equations are able to renormalize around a changing\nFermi surface geometry. We find a coexistence of d-wave superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetism at intermediate momentum scales k. However, there is a\nmutual tendency of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism to repel each other\nat even smaller scales k, which leads to the eradication of the coexistence\nphase in the limit of macroscopic scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The conversion is achieved through coupling of magnons to guided\noptical modes of the film. The total microwave to optical photon conversion\nefficiency is found to be larger than in a similar process employing a YIG\nsphere by at least 4 orders of magnitude. By creating an optical resonator of a\nlarge length from the film (such that the traveling magnon decays before\nforming a standing wave over the resonator length) one will be able to further\nincrease the efficiency by several orders of magnitude, potentially reaching a\nvalue similar to achieved with opto-mechanical resonators.

Scaling arguments based on the\nprocesses observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to\nthe `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from\nwhich it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds\nnumbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir\nsurface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'\nclose to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball\nand fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it\ncontinues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself\ndepends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We\nconsider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface\ntension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a\nvisco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid\nmoving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off\nmechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a\ndifferent length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball\nwhen submersed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Instead, HATS-52 is more dense and has a\nshorter orbital period. It also receives an intensive radiation from its parent\nstar and, consequently, presents a high equilibrium temperature.

The\nintrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and\nthe set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each\nreceptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor\nfunction derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted\nin a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position,\norientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor\nfunctions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the\norientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the\n2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the\nreducible representation of the $\\text{SE}(2)=\\mathbb{R}^2\\times S^1$ group.

The linear theory of chemotaxis pioneered by de Gennes allows for\ncalculation of the drift velocity in small gradients for bacteria with basic\nmotility patterns.

Such quantum effects become\nmore relevant as the applied stress is increased, mainly for properties related\nto out-of-plane atomic vibrations. The relevance of quantum dynamics in the\nout-of-plane motion depends on the system size, and is enhanced by tensile\nstress. For applied tensile stresses, we analyze the contribution of the\nelastic energy to the internal energy of graphene. Results of PIMD simulations\nare compared with calculations based on a harmonic approximation for the\nvibrational modes of the graphene lattice. This approximation describes rather\nwell the structural properties of graphene, provided that the frequencies of ZA\n(flexural) acoustic modes in the transverse direction include a\npressure-dependent correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Previous research, although achieves promising\nresults, neglects one distinctive characteristic of social data, i.e.,\nsequentiality. For example, the popularity of online content is generated over\ntime with sequential post streams of social media. To investigate the\nsequential prediction of popularity, we propose a novel prediction framework\ncalled Deep Temporal Context Networks (DTCN) by incorporating both temporal\ncontext and temporal attention into account. Our DTCN contains three main\ncomponents, from embedding, learning to predicting. With a joint embedding\nnetwork, we obtain a unified deep representation of multi-modal user-post data\nin a common embedding space. Then, based on the embedded data sequence over\ntime, temporal context learning attempts to recurrently learn two adaptive\ntemporal contexts for sequential popularity. Finally, a novel temporal\nattention is designed to predict new popularity (the popularity of a new\nuser-post pair) with temporal coherence across multiple time-scales.\nExperiments on our released image dataset with about 600K Flickr photos\ndemonstrate that DTCN outperforms state-of-the-art deep prediction algorithms,\nwith an average of 21.51% relative performance improvement in the popularity\nprediction (Spearman Ranking Correlation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

In this\nsetting, the baryonic and dark matter components of the Universe couple to\nmetrics which are constructed as functions of these two gravitational metrics.\nThe scalar field, contrary to dark energy models, does not have a potential\nwhose role is to mimic a late-time cosmological constant. The late-time\nacceleration of the expansion of the Universe can be easily obtained at the\nbackground level in these models by appropriately choosing the coupling\nfunctions appearing in the decomposition of the vierbeins for the baryonic and\ndark matter metrics. We explicitly show how the concordance model can be\nretrieved with negligible scalar kinetic energy. This requires the scalar\ncoupling functions to show variations of order unity during the accelerated\nexpansion era. This leads in turn to deviations of order unity for the\neffective Newton constants and a fifth force that is of the same order as\nNewtonian gravity, with peculiar features. The baryonic and dark matter\nself-gravities are amplified although the gravitational force between baryons\nand dark matter is reduced and even becomes repulsive at low redshift. This\nslows down the growth of baryonic density perturbations on cosmological scales,\nwhile dark matter perturbations are enhanced. In our local environment, the\nupper bound on the time evolution of Newton's constant requires an efficient\nscreening mechanism that both damps the fifth force on small scales and\ndecouples the local value of Newton constant from its cosmological value.

This sensitivity in the localization behavior of PEV is\naccompanied by a pair of almost degenerate eigenvalues. This observation opens\nan avenue to gain a deeper insight into the origin of PEV localization of\nnetworks. Furthermore, analysis of multilayer networks constructed using\nreal-world social and biological data show that the localization properties of\nthese real-world multilayer networks are in good agreement with the simulation\nresults for the model multilayer network. The study is relevant to applications\nthat require understanding propagation of perturbation in multilayer networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 06:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Most\nimportantly no sharp transitions are introduced by truncating the roughness,\nwhen a smooth transition is often desired when adding rough layers together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 16:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

This\nis influenced by temporal variations of public attentions or user activities.\nFor example, popularity patterns of street snap on Flickr are observed to\ndepict distinctive fashion styles at specific time scales, such as season-based\nperiodic fluctuations for Trench Coat or one-off peak in days for Evening\nDress. However, this fact is often overlooked by existing research of\npopularity modeling. We present the first study to incorporate multiple\ntime-scale dynamics into predicting online popularity. We propose a novel\ncomputational framework in the paper, named Multi-scale Temporalization, for\nestimating popularity based on multi-scale decomposition and structural\nreconstruction in a tensor space of user, post, and time by joint low-rank\nconstraints. By considering the noise caused by context inconsistency, we\ndesign a data rearrangement step based on context aggregation as preprocessing\nto enhance contextual relevance of neighboring data in the tensor space. As a\nresult, our approach can leverage multiple levels of temporal characteristics\nand reduce the noise of data decomposition to improve modeling effectiveness.\nWe evaluate our approach on two large-scale Flickr image datasets with over 1.8\nmillion photos in total, for the task of popularity prediction. The results\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art popularity\nprediction techniques, with a relative improvement of 10.9%-47.5% in terms of\nprediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}
