Two\nvehicular networking technologies are envisioned to jointly support the full\nrange of ITS services : DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) for direct\nvehicle to vehicle/Road Side Units (RSU) communications and cellular\ntechnologies. To the best of our knowledge, approaches from the literature\nusually divide ITS services on each of these networks according to their\nrequirements and one single network is in charge of supporting the each\nservice.

From a scheduling perspective, eMBB resource allocations occur at\nslot boundaries, whereas to reduce latency URLLC traffic is pre-emptively\noverlapped at the minislot timescale, resulting in selective\nsuperposition/puncturing of eMBB allocations. This approach enables minimal\nURLLC latency at a potential rate loss to eMBB traffic.\n  We study joint eMBB and URLLC schedulers for such systems, with the dual\nobjectives of maximizing utility for eMBB traffic while immediately satisfying\nURLLC demands. For a linear rate loss model (loss to eMBB is linear in the\namount of URLLC superposition/puncturing), we derive an optimal joint\nscheduler. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results show that our dual\nobjectives can be met by an iterative gradient scheduler for eMBB traffic that\nanticipates the expected loss from URLLC traffic, along with an URLLC demand\nscheduler that is oblivious to eMBB channel states, utility functions and\nallocation decisions of the eMBB scheduler. Next we consider a more general\nclass of (convex/threshold) loss models and study optimal online joint\neMBB/URLLC schedulers within the broad class of channel state dependent but\nminislot-homogeneous policies. A key observation is that unlike the linear rate\nloss model, for the convex and threshold rate loss models, optimal eMBB and\nURLLC scheduling decisions do not de-couple and joint optimization is necessary\nto satisfy the dual objectives. We validate the characteristics and benefits of\nour schedulers via simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 22:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa.

The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a\nsuperposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative\nimportance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably\ncombine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,\nare expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an\nincreasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

The experiments show that the noisy RJMCMC algorithm can be much more\nefficient than other exact methods, provided that an estimator with controlled\nMonte Carlo variance is used, a fact which is in agreement with the theoretical\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 22:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

A one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian model of this quantum\nmachine is formulated and analyzed within a lattice Green's function formalism\non the Keldysh contour. The pump observables, as e.g. the pumped particles per\ncycle, are studied as a function of the pumping frequency, the width of the\npumping potential, the particles mean free path and system temperature. The\nproposed analysis applies to arbitrary peristaltic potentials acting on\nfermionic quantum fluids confined to one dimension. These confinement\nconditions can be realized in nanostructured systems or, in a more controllable\nway, in cold atoms experiments. In view of the validation of the theoretical\nresults, we describe the outcomes of the model considering a fermionic cold\natoms system as a paradigmatic example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 18:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

The terms in the Hamiltonian for flavor propagation induced\nby the DE-neutrino coupling do not depend on the neutrino energy, while the\nordinary components decrease as $\\Delta m^2/E_{\\nu}$. Therefore, the DE-induced\neffects are absent at lower neutrino energies, but become significant at higher\nenergies, allowing to be searched for by neutrino observatories. We explore the\nimpact of the DE-neutrino coupling on the oscillation probability and the\nflavor transition in the three-flavor framework, and investigate the\nCP-violating and apparent Lorentz violating effects. We find that DE-induced\neffects become observable for $E_{\\nu}m_{\\text{eff}} \\sim 10^{-20}~\n\\text{GeV}^2$, where $m_{\\rm eff}$ is the effective mass parameter in the\nDE-induced oscillation probability, and CP is violated over a wide energy\nrange. We also show that current and future experiments have the sensitivity to\ndetect anomalous effects induced by a DE-neutrino coupling and probe the new\nmixing parameters. The DE-induced effects on neutrino oscillation can be\ndistinguished from other new physics possibilities with similar effects,\nthrough the detection of the directional dependence of the interaction, which\nis specific to this interaction with DE. However, current experiments will not\nyet be able to measure the small changes of $\\sim 0.03\\%$ in the flavor\ncomposition due to this directional effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

A 2-by-2 model linear Navier-Stokes (LNS) operator\nillustrates how non-normality from mean shear distributes perturbation energy\nin different velocity components of the forcing and response modes. The inverse\nof their inner product, which is unity for a purely normal mechanism, is\nproposed as a measure to quantify non-normality. In flows where there is\ndownstream spatial dependence of the base/mean, mean flow advection separates\nthe spatial support of forcing and response modes which impacts the inner\nproduct. Success of mean stability analysis depends on the normality of\namplification. If the amplification is normal, the resolvent operator written\nin its dyadic representation reveals that the adjoint and forward stability\nmodes are proportional to the forcing and response resolvent modes. If the\namplification is non-normal, then resolvent analysis is required to understand\nthe origin of observed flow structures. Eigenspectra and pseudospectra are used\nto characterize these phenomena. Two test cases are studied: low Reynolds\nnumber cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow. The first deals mainly with\nnormal mechanisms and quantification of non-normality using the inverse inner\nproduct of the leading forcing and response modes agrees well with the product\nof the resolvent norm and distance between the imaginary axis and least stable\neigenvalue. In turbulent channel flow, structures result from both normal and\nnon-normal mechanisms. Mean shear is exploited most efficiently by stationary\ndisturbances while bounds on the pseudospectra illustrate how non-normality is\nresponsible for the most amplified disturbances at spatial wavenumbers and\ntemporal frequencies corresponding to well-known turbulent structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 23:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

We show that, up to a logarithmic factor, the\nminimax rate of estimation in squared Euclidean norm is between $(s^2\\wedge n)\n+sp$ and $(s^2\\wedge np)+sp$. The estimator that attains the upper bound being\ncomputationally demanding, we investigate suitable versions of group\nthresholding estimators that are efficiently computable even when the dimension\nand the sample size are very large. An interesting new phenomenon revealed by\nthis investigation is that the group thresholding leads to a substantial\nimprovement in the rate as compared to the element-wise thresholding. Thus, the\nrate of the group thresholding is $s^2\\sqrt{p}+sp$, while the element-wise\nthresholding has an error of order $s^2p+sp$.

For example, deep\nlearning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to\naccess many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of\ndeep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to\nperform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this\nwork, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the\nattacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication\nsystem, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor.\nSpecifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the\nvictim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a\ntarget label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor\npoisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies.\nDifferent from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply\nunder a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model\nand the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to\ninject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard\nto notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation\nto demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning\nsamples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90%. We are also the\nfirst work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically\nimplementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work\ndemonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning\nsystem, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and\nproposing defense strategies against them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 04:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

The inspection of soft vibrational modes can help\npredict the locations of these rearrangements, while the strain that they\nactually redistribute mediates collective effects. Here, we study soft modes\nand strain redistribution in a two-dimensional continuous mesoscopic model\nbased on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for perfect solids, supplemented with a\nplastic disorder potential that accounts for shear softening and\nrearrangements. Regardless of the disorder strength, our numerical simulations\nshow soft modes that are always sharply peaked at the softest point of the\nmaterial (unlike what happens for the depinning of an elastic interface).\nContrary to widespread views, the deformation halo around this peak does not\nalways have a quadrupolar (Eshelby-like) shape. Instead, for finite and\nnarrowly-distributed disorder, it looks like a fracture, with a strain field\nthat concentrates along some easy directions. These findings are rationalised\nwith analytical calculations in the case where the plastic disorder is confined\nto a point-like `impurity'. In this case, we unveil a continuous family of\nelastic propagators, which are identical for the soft modes and for the\nequilibrium configurations. This family interpolates between the standard\nquadrupolar propagator and the fracture-like one as the anisotropy of the\nelastic medium is increased. Therefore, we expect to see a fracture-like\npropagator when extended regions on the brink of failure have already softened\nalong the shear direction and thus rendered the material anisotropic, but not\nfailed yet.

The\nkey step in the method requires a solution by radicals of a system of\nmultivariate polynomials.

In practice,\nhowever, reduction by QSSA always succeeds. To provide some explanation for\nthis phenomenon, we prove that solvability is guaranteed for a class of common\nchemical reaction networks. In the course of establishing this result, we\nexamine the question of when it is possible to ensure that there are finitely\nmany (quasi) steady states.

The flow encounters energy loss by means of radiative processes\nacted on the electrons and at the same time, flow heats up as a consequence of\nviscous heating effective on ions. We assumed that the flow is exposed with the\nstochastic magnetic fields which leads to Synchrotron emission of electrons and\nthese emissions are further strengthen by Compton scattering. We obtain the\ntwo-temperature global accretion solutions in terms of dissipation parameters,\nnamely, viscosity ($\\alpha$) and accretion rate (${\\dot m}$), and find for the\nfirst time in the literature that such solutions may contain standing shock\nwaves. Solutions of this kind are multi-transonic in nature as they\nsimultaneously pass through both inner critical point ($x_{\\rm in}$) and outer\ncritical point ($x_{\\rm out}$) before crossing the black hole horizon. We\ncalculate the properties of shock induced global accretion solutions in terms\nof the flow parameters. We further show that two-temperature shocked accretion\nflow is not a discrete solution, instead such solution exists for wide range of\nflow parameters. We identify the effective domain of the parameter space for\nstanding shock and observe that parameter space shrinks as the dissipation is\nincreased. Since the post-shock region is hotter due to the effect of shock\ncompression, it naturally emits hard X-rays and therefore, the two-temperature\nshocked accretion solution has the potential to explain the spectral properties\nof the black hole sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 04:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

These\nsystems offer themselves as a versatile platform for performing Hamiltonian\nsimulations with light, as well as for experimentally realizing nontrivial\nout-of-equilibrium phase transitions. In addition, polaritons exhibit a\nsizeable mutual interaction strength that opens up a whole range of\npossibilities in the context of quantum state generation. While squeezed light\nemission from polaritons has been reported previously, the granular nature of\npolaritons has not been observed to date. The latter capability is particularly\nattractive for realizing strongly correlated many-body quantum states of light\non scalable arrays of coupled cavities. Here we demonstrate that by optically\nconfining polaritons to a very small effective mode volume, one can reach the\nweak blockade regime, in which the nonlinearity turns strong enough to become\nsignificant at the few particle level, and thus produce a non-negligible\nantibunching in the emitted photons statistics. Our results act as a door\nopener for accessing the newly emerging field of quantum polaritonics, and as a\nproof of principle that optically confined exciton-polaritons can be considered\nas a realistic, new strategy to generate single photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 06:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

To this end, disorder was introduced\ninto the system in a controlled way by exposing the single crystals to x-ray\nirradiation. The crystals were then fine-tuned across the Mott transition by\nthe application of continuously controllable He-gas pressure at low\ntemperatures. Measurements of the thermal expansion and resistance show that\nthe first-order character of the Mott transition prevails for low irradiation\ndoses achieved by irradiation times up to 100 h. For these crystals with a\nmoderate degree of disorder, we find a first-order transition line which ends\nin a second-order critical endpoint, akin to the pristine crystals.

This result is consistent\nwith the theoretically-predicted formation of a soft Coulomb gap in the\npresence of strong correlations and small disorder. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate, similar to the observation for the pristine sample, that the Mott\ntransition after 50 h of irradiation is accompanied by sizable lattice effects,\nthe critical behavior of which can be well described by mean-field theory. Our\nresults demonstrate that the character of the Mott transition remains\nessentially unchanged at a low disorder level. However, after an irradiation\ntime of 150 h, no clear signatures of a discontinuous metal-insulator\ntransition could be revealed anymore.

Then based on the DOA\nestimation result using QNC-MUSIC, the polarization estimation of non-circular\nsignal is acquired by using the closed-form expression of the polarization\nestimation in DR-MUSIC. In addition, the computational complexity analysis\nshows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation\nalgorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC and DRMUSIC have much lower computational\ncomplexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic\nCramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization\nparameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical\nexamples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve\nthe parameter estimation performance when the large-scale/massive MIMO systems\nare employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

There, the\nreturn probability of a system to the ground state reveals singularities in\ntime which are dubbed dynamical quantum phase transitions.

Recent\nobservational projects have provided new observational constraints on the\ncentral region of rotating black holes in AGN, suggesting that there is an\ninner- or spine-jet surrounded by a disk wind. This relativistic spine-jet is\nlikely to be composed of electron - positron pairs extracting energy from the\nblack hole. In this article we present an extension and generalization to\nrelativistic jets in Kerr metric of the meridional self similar mechanism. We\naim at modeling the inner spine-jet of AGN as the relativistic light outflow\nemerging from a spherical corona surrounding a Kerr black hole. The model is\nbuilt by expanding the metric and the forces with colatitude to first order in\nthe magnetic flux function. Conversely to previous models, effects of the light\ncylinder are not neglected. Solutions with high Lorentz factor are obtained and\nprovide spine-jet models up to the polar axis. As in previous publications, we\ncalculate the magnetic collimation efficiency parameter, which measures the\nvariation of the available energy across the field lines. This collimation\nefficiency is an integral of the model, generalizing to Kerr metric the\nclassical magnetic rotator efficiency criterion. We study the variation of the\nmagnetic efficiency and acceleration with the spin of the black hole and show\ntheir high sensitivity to this integral. These new solutions model collimated\nor radial, relativistic or ultra-relativistic outflows. We discuss the\nrelevance of our solutions to model the M87 spine-jet.

Here we argue, however, that stochastic density fluctuations due to\nturbulence do not enhance gravitational instability and disc fragmentation in\nthe long cooling time limit appropriate for planet forming discs. These\nfluctuations evolve adiabatically and dissipate away by decompression faster\nthan they could collapse. We investigate these issues numerically in 2D via\nshearing box simulations with driven turbulence and also in 3D with a model of\ninstantaneously applied turbulent velocity kicks. In the former setting\nturbulent driving leads to additional disc heating that tends to make discs\nmore, rather than less, stable to gravitational instability. In the latter\nsetting, the formation of high density regions due to convergent velocity kicks\nis found to be quickly followed by decompression, as expected. We therefore\nconclude that driven turbulence does not promote disc fragmentation in\nprotoplanetary discs and instead tends to make the discs more stable. We also\nargue that sustaining supersonic turbulence is very difficult in discs that\ncool slowly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 10:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

We propose a new\napproach to cluster relevant points in the multi-dimensional traffic space\ntaking into account similarities in optimal routing and not only in traffic\nvalues. Moreover, to provide more flexibility to the online decisions on when\napplying a reconfiguration, we allow some overlap between clusters that can\nguarantee a good-quality routing regardless of the transition instant.\n  We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art approaches in realistic\nnetwork scenarios.

In our experiment we measure the lifetime of\nneutrons trapped by Earth's gravity in an open-topped vessel. Two\nconfigurations of the trap geometry are used to change the mean frequency of\nUCN collisions with the surfaces - this is achieved by plunging an additional\nsurface into the trap without breaking the vacuum. The trap walls are coated\nwith a hydrogen-less fluorine-containing polymer to reduce losses of UCN. The\nstability of this coating to multiple thermal cycles between 80 K and 300 K was\ntested. At 80 K, the probability of UCN loss due to collisions with the trap\nwalls is just 1.5% of the probability of beta-decay. The free neutron lifetime\nis determined by extrapolation to an infinitely large trap with zero collision\nfrequency. The result of these measurements is 881.5 +/- 0.7_stat +/- 0.6_syst\ns which is consistent with the conventional value of 880.2 +/- 1.0 s presented\nby the Particle Data Group.

Heparin Red, a\ncommercial mix-and-read fluorescence assay, has recently emerged as a tool in\nclinical drug development and pharmacokinetic analysis for the quantification\nof sulfated polysaccharides in human plasma. The present study describes the\napplication of Heparin Red to the detection of heparin, a highly sulfated\npolysaccharide, and fucoidan, a less sulfated polysaccharide, in spiked mouse\nand rat plasmas. While the standard assay protocol for human plasma matrix gave\nless satisfactory results, a modified protocol was developed that provides\nwithin a detection range 0 to 10 micrograms per mL better limits of\nquantification, 1.1 to 2.3 micrograms per mL for heparin, and 1.7 to 3.4\nmicrograms per mL for fucoidan. The required plasma sample volume of only 20\nmicroliters is advantegous in particular when blood samples need to be\ncollected from mice. Our results suggest that Heparin Red is a promising tool\nfor the preclinical evaluation of sulfated polysaccharides with varying\nsulfation degrees in mouse and rat models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 14:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

In this work, we calculated and compared the effect of process\nvariations and NBTI aging over the years on the actual WNM of various CMOS and\nFinFET based flip-flop cells. The massive transistor-level Monte Carlo\nsimulations produced both nominal (i.e. mean) values and associated standard\ndeviations of the WNM of the chosen flip-flops.
