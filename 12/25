Opinion mining, also known as sentiment\nanalysis, has received a lot of attention in recent times, as it provides a\nnumber of tools to analyse the public opinion on a number of different topics.\nComparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining that deals with\nidentifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form\n(e.g.~\"paper X is better than the Y\"). Comparative opinion mining plays a very\nimportant role when ones tries to evaluate something, as it provides a\nreference point for the comparison. This paper provides a review of the area of\ncomparative opinion mining. It is the first review that cover specifically this\ntopic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining. This\nsurvey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles. One from\nperspective of techniques and the other from perspective of comparative opinion\nelements. It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as dataset that were\nused by the past researchers that can be useful to the future researchers in\nthe field of comparative opinion mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 16:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

This is a transportation problem,\nwhere distinct commodities are transported simultaneously along a network. The\ncost of the transportation depends on the network used to move the masses, as\nit is common in models studied in branched transportation. The main novelty is\nthat in our model the cost per unit length of the network does not depend only\non the total flow, but on the actual quantity of each commodity. This allows to\ntake into account different interactions between the transported goods. We\npropose an Eulerian formulation of the discrete problem, describing the flow of\neach commodity through every point of the network. We provide minimal\nassumptions on the cost, under which existence of solutions can be proved.\nMoreover, we prove that, under mild additional assumptions, the problem can be\nrephrased as a mass minimization problem in a class of rectifiable currents\nwith coefficients in a group, allowing to introduce a notion of calibration.\nThe latter result is new even in the well studied framework of the\n\"single-material\" branched transportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 16:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 17:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

However, model updating as a mathematical operation is inherently\nexact, hence updating imprecise models requires the user's judgment in choosing\namong competing updating rules. These rules often lead to incompatible\ninferences, and can exhibit unsettling phenomena like dilation, contraction and\nsure loss, which cannot occur with the Bayes rule and precise probabilities. We\nrevisit a number of famous \"paradoxes\", including the three prisoners/Monty\nHall problem, revealing that a logical fallacy arises from a set of marginally\nplausible yet jointly incommensurable assumptions when updating the underlying\nimprecise model. We establish an equivalence between Simpson's paradox and an\nimplicit adoption of a pair of aggregation rules that induce sure loss. We also\nexplore behavioral discrepancies between the generalized Bayes rule, Dempster's\nrule and the Geometric rule as alternative posterior updating rules for Choquet\ncapacities of order 2. We show that both the generalized Bayes rule and\nGeometric rule are incapable of updating without prior information regardless\nof how strong the information in our data is, and that Dempster's rule and the\nGeometric rule can mathematically contradict each other with respect to\ndilation and contraction.

We analyze\nequilibria for specific control strategies, as well as compute the basic\nreproductive number, R0, of individual coffee trees, conditions for local and\nglobal stability under specific conditions, parameter estimation of key\nparameters, as well as sensitivity analysis, and numerical experiments under\nlocal and global control strategies for key scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 19:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 01:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Classical feedforward neural networks, such\nas those with tanh activations, exhibit exponential behavior on the average\nwhen propagating inputs forward or gradients backward. The exponential forward\ndynamics causes rapid collapsing of the input space geometry, while the\nexponential backward dynamics causes drastic vanishing or exploding gradients.\nWe show, in contrast, that by adding skip connections, the network will,\ndepending on the nonlinearity, adopt subexponential forward and backward\ndynamics, and in many cases in fact polynomial. The exponents of these\npolynomials are obtained through analytic methods and proved and verified\nempirically to be correct.

This raises a number of challenging issues, none more\ncompelling and urgent than finding an answer to the question \"How to manage\nthis new organizational form?\" We consider these issues in a particularly\nchallenging domain of human endeavor -- warfare. Command and Control (C2) is\nthe term applied to management or governance of military organizations and\nendeavors. We consider how human and other intelligent entities can best\ncontribute to ensuring that the decision makers, whether human or machine, have\nthe information they require and make good use of this information to\naccomplish C2 functions. Commanders or managers of mixed human-thing\norganizations will face several challenges that the discussion above has\nhighlighted. Things are challenged in a number of areas and will need humans to\nprovide these capabilities. These include their ability to explain, build\ntrust, bond, understand personal agendas, emotions, politics, and negotiate.\nThings and people both to some extent have difficulty anticipating and coping\nwith the unusual and unexpected and to think of out-of-the-box solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 00:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Obtaining an adaptive estimator of this\nfunctional component is an important practical problem in econometrics where\nexact distributions of random errors and the parametric component are mostly\nunknown and cannot safely assumed to be normal. An estimator of the functional\ncomponent that is adaptive in the mean squared sense over the wide range of\nmultivariate Besov classes and robust to a wide choice of distributions of the\nlinear component and random errors is constructed. It is also shown that the\nsame estimator is locally adaptive over the same range of Besov classes and\nrobust over large collections of distributions of the linear component and\nrandom errors as well. At any fixed point, this estimator also attains a local\nadaptive minimax rate. The procedure needed to obtain such an estimator turns\nout to depend on the choice of the right shrinkage approach in the wavelet\ndomain. We show that one possible approach is to use the multivariate version\nof the classical BlockJS method. The multivariate version of BlockJS is\ndeveloped in the manuscript and is shown to represent an independent interest.\nFinally, the Besov space scale over which the proposed estimator is locally\nadaptive is shown to depend on the dimensionality of the domain of the\nfunctional component; the higher the dimension, the larger the smoothness\nindicator of Besov spaces must be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 00:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The weights are\ntypically computed by a distance-based kernel function and they strongly depend\non the distances between examples. In this paper, we first review the latest\ndevelopments of sparse metric learning and kernel regression.

The\nsparse kernel regression model is established by enforcing a mixed $(2,1)$-norm\nregularization over the metric matrix.

Most of the existing metrics depend on the meta-path\nor meta-structure specified by users in advance. These metrics are thus\nsensitive to the pre-specified meta-path or meta-structure. In this paper, a\nnovel similarity measure in heterogeneous information networks, called\nRecurrent Meta-Structure-based Similarity (RMSS), is proposed. The recurrent\nmeta-structure as a schematic structure in heterogeneous information networks\nprovides a unified framework to integrate all of the meta-paths and\nmeta-structures. Therefore, RMSS is robust to the meta-paths and\nmeta-structures. We devise an approach to automatically constructing the\nrecurrent meta-structure. In order to formalize the semantics, the recurrent\nmeta-structure is decomposed into several recurrent meta-paths and recurrent\nmeta-trees, and we then define the commuting matrices of the recurrent\nmeta-paths and meta-trees. All of the commuting matrices of the recurrent\nmeta-paths and meta-trees are combined according to different weights. Note\nthat the weights can be determined by two kinds of weighting strategies: local\nweighting strategy and global weighting strategy. As a result, RMSS is defined\nby virtue of the final commuting matrix. Experimental evaluations show that the\nexisting metrics are sensitive to different meta-paths or meta-structures and\nthat the proposed RMSS outperforms the existing metrics in terms of ranking and\nclustering tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 05:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 03:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

For this class\nof symbols, pre-learned programs become inoperative so these syntactical\nprograms cannot be the source of experienced qualia. Second, we model the\ndysfunctional human response to a radically changed environment as being the\nnatural response of any learning machine facing novel inputs from well outside\nits previous training set. In this situation, learning machines are unable to\nextract information from their input and will typically enter a dynamical state\ncharacterized by null outputs and a lack of response.

This study uses support vector\nmachine, random forest, and sparse multinomial regression (SMR) approaches. All\nthese ML methods with data for 20 elements and 5 isotopic ratios allowed the\nsuccessful geochemical discrimination between igneous rocks formed in eight\ndifferent tectonic settings with a discriminant ratio better than 83% for all\nsettings barring oceanic plateaus and back-arc basins.

We also present the most representative basalt\ncomposition for each tectonic setting. The new data provide reference points\nfor future geochemical discussions.

However, the success of them implicitly funds on the assumption that\nthe information of domains are fully transferrable. If the assumption is not\nsatisfied, the effect of negative transfer may degrade domain adaptation. In\nthis paper, a better learning network has been proposed by considering three\ntasks - domain adaptation, disentangled representation, and style transfer\nsimultaneously. Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common\nparts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable\nfeatures, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer.\nConversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual\ndomain. Based on this, the new concept of feature exchange across domains,\nwhich can not only enhance the transferability of common features but also be\nuseful for image style transfer, is introduced. These designs allow us to\nintroduce five types of training objectives to realize the three challenging\ntasks at the same time. The experimental results show that our architecture can\nbe adaptive well to full transfer learning and partial transfer learning upon a\nwell-learned disentangled representation. Besides, the trained network also\ndemonstrates high potential to generate style-transferred images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 07:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 13:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 08:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 12:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

The period\ndistribution of EAs suggests that the period limit of tidal locking for the\nclose binaries is about 6 days. It is found that the metallicity of EAs is\nhigher than that of EWs indicating that EAs are generally younger than EWs and\nthey are the progenitors of EWs. The metallicities of long-period EWs (0.4 < P\n< 1 days) are the same as those of EAs with the same periods, while their\nvalues of Log (g) are usually smaller than those of EAs. These support the\nevolutionary process that EAs evolve into long-period EWs through the\ncombination of angular momentum loss (AML) via magnetic braking and case A mass\ntransfer. For short-period EWs, their metallicities are lower than those of\nEAs, while their gravitational accelerations are higher. These reveal that they\nmay be formed from cool short-period EAs through AML via magnetic braking with\nlittle mass transfer. For some EWs with high metallicities, they may be\ncontaminated by material from the evolution of unseen neutron stars and black\nholes or they have third bodies that may help them to form rapidly through a\nshort timescale of pre-contact evolution.

A curved channel with transition segment is used to\nguide a fresh laser pulse into a subsequent straight channel, while allowing\nthe electrons to propagate in a straight channel. This scheme benefits from a\nshorter coupling distance and continuous guiding of the electrons in plasma,\nwhile suppressing transverse beam dispersion. With moderate laser parameters,\nparticle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that the electron beam from a previous\nstage can be efficiently injected into a subsequent stage for further\nacceleration, while maintaining high capture efficiency, stability, and beam\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 07:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Here an ordered\ngraph F is an ordered Ramsey graph of a pair (H,H') of ordered graphs if for\nany coloring of the edges of F in colors red and blue there is either a copy of\nH with all edges colored red or a copy of H' with all edges colored blue. Such\nan ordered Ramsey graph is minimal if neither of its proper subgraphs is an\nordered Ramsey graph of (H,H'). If H=H' then H itself is called Ramsey finite.\n  We show that a connected ordered graph is Ramsey finite if and only if it is\na star with center being the first or the last vertex in the linear order. In\ngeneral we prove that each Ramsey finite (not necessarily connected) ordered\ngraph H has a pseudoforest as a Ramsey graph and therefore is a star forest\nwith strong restrictions on the positions of the centers of the stars. In the\nasymmetric case we show that (H,H') is Ramsey finite whenever H is a so-called\nmonotone matching. Among several further results we show that there are Ramsey\nfinite pairs of ordered stars and ordered caterpillars of arbitrary size and\ndiameter.

Motivated by these relations we\ncharacterize all pairs of ordered graphs that have a forest as an ordered\nRamsey graph and all pairs of connected ordered graphs that have a pseudoforest\nas a Ramsey graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 07:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

This limitation greatly restricts the usage of this\ntechnique in dynamic measurement. In this manuscript, we present a motionless\nand fast measurement technique for obtaining the spectral diffraction\nefficiencies of a plane grating, effectively eliminating the aforementioned two\nkinds of mechanical movement.

They couple to nuclear\nspins embedded in the host materials through the hyperfine interaction, and are\ntherefore subject to elastic spin-flip backscattering on the nuclear spins. We\ninvestigate the nuclear-spin-induced edge resistance due to such backscattering\nby performing a renormalization-group analysis. Remarkably, the effect of this\nbackscattering mechanism is stronger in a helical edge than in nonhelical\nchannels, which are believed to be present in the trivial regime of InAs/GaSb\nquantum wells. In a system with sufficiently long edges, the disordered nuclear\nspins lead to an edge resistance which grows exponentially upon lowering the\ntemperature. On the other hand, electrons from the edge states mediate an\nanisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida nuclear spin-spin interaction, which\ninduces a spiral nuclear spin order below the transition temperature. We\ndiscuss the features of the spiral order, as well as its experimental\nsignatures. In the ordered phase, we identify two backscattering mechanisms,\ndue to charge impurities and magnons. The backscattering on charge impurities\nis allowed by the internally generated magnetic field, and leads to an\nAnderson-type localization of the edge states. The magnon-mediated\nbackscattering results in a power-law resistance, which is suppressed at zero\ntemperature. Overall, we find that in a sufficiently long edge the nuclear\nspins, whether ordered or not, suppress the edge conductance to zero as the\ntemperature approaches zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 08:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 02:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

This paper does a lot of\nresearch on network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows.\nFirstly, we propose the concepts of single-link and multi-link models of\ntraffic flow forecasting. Secondly, we construct four prediction models by\ncombining the two models with single-task learning and multi-task learning. The\ncombination of the multi-link model and multi-task learning not only improves\nthe experimental efficiency but also the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new\nmulti-link single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural\nnetwork (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving\nproblems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a\nsparse graphical model making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. In\naddition, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm\nin Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are\nfew applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, we apply\nGPR to traffic flow forecasting and show its potential. Through sufficient\nexperiments, we compare all of the proposed approaches and make an overall\nassessment at last.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 03:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages\nthe labeled samples from the source domain to annotate the target domain which\nhas few or none labels. Existing approaches typically consider learning a\nglobal domain shift while ignoring the intra-affinity between classes, which\nwill hinder the performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel and general cross-domain learning framework that can exploit the\nintra-affinity of classes to perform intra-class knowledge transfer. The\nproposed framework, referred to as Stratified Transfer Learning (STL), can\ndramatically improve the classification accuracy for cross-domain activity\nrecognition. Specifically, STL first obtains pseudo labels for the target\ndomain via majority voting technique. Then, it performs intra-class knowledge\ntransfer iteratively to transform both domains into the same subspaces.\nFinally, the labels of target domain are obtained via the second annotation. To\nevaluate the performance of STL, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three\nlarge public activity recognition datasets~(i.e. OPPORTUNITY, PAMAP2, and UCI\nDSADS), which demonstrates that STL significantly outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods w.r.t. classification accuracy (improvement of 7.68%).\nFurthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of STL across different\ndegrees of similarities and activity levels between domains. And we also\ndiscuss the potential of STL in other pervasive computing applications to\nprovide empirical experience for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 06:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

This is achieved by burning\nthe fossil fuel using oxygen as oxidizer with no nitrogen, thereby rendering\nthe exhaust gases very rich in carbon dioxide (after condensing water vapor by\ncooling), which facilitates its capture for environmental or commercial\npurposes. Despite the worldwide interest in oxy-fuel carbon capture, its\nprogress is at risk given the large energy needed to separate oxygen from air\nin order to provide the oxidizer, thereby hindering further progress of this\nconcept toward large-scale applications. This paper focuses on alleviating this\ndrawback of oxy-fuel combustion by making it more attractive through combining\nit with another concept, namely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators. The\nend product is a power plant operating on a combined cycle composed of a\ntopping MHD ultra-high-temperature cycle with direct electricity extraction\nfrom plasma, followed by a bottoming steam cycle with conventional\nturbo-generators. Different design aspects and simplified technical analysis\nfor the MHD generator are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 13:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
