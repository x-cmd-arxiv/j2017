Although there have\nbeen numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form\nof cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost\nof each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various\nnetwork deployments and dynamic channel conditions.\n  We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by\nrecognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated\nbut also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both\nchannel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering\nsignal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original\ninterference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the\nvictim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering\nsignal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the\ntransmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is\nshown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence\nenhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 16:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Our strategy is put to work for\nfamilies of gravitational actions which depend on functions of the Ricci\nscalar, the Ricci tensor, and products thereof. Combining functional\nrenormalisation with high order polynomial approximations and full numerical\nintegration we derive the renormalisation group flow for all couplings and\nanalyse their fixed points, scaling exponents, and the fixed point effective\naction as a function of the background Ricci curvature. The theory is\ncharacterised by three relevant couplings. Higher-dimensional couplings show\nnear-Gaussian scaling with increasing canonical mass dimension. We find that\nRicci tensor invariants stabilise the UV fixed point and lead to a rapid\nconvergence of polynomial approximations. We apply our results to models for\ncosmology and establish that the gravitational fixed point admits inflationary\nsolutions. We also compare findings with those from $f(R)$-type theories in the\nsame approximation and pin-point the key new effects due to Ricci tensor\ninteractions.

To study the characteristics of these interesting objects based on\nthe microlensing method, measurement of the microlens parallax is required to\ndetermine the properties of the lens. Of the various methods to measure\nmicrolens parallax, the most robust way is to make simultaneous ground- and\nspace-based observations, i.e., by measuring the space-based microlens\nparallax. However, space-based campaigns usually require \"expensive\" resources.\nGould & Yee (2012) proposed an idea called the \"cheap space-based microlens\nparallax\" that can measure the lens-parallax using only $2$ or $3$ space-based\nobservations of high-magnification events. This cost-effective observation\nstrategy to measure microlens parallaxes could be used by space-borne\ntelescopes to build a complete sample for studying isolated objects. This would\nenable a direct measurement of the mass function including both extremely\nlow-mass objects and high-mass stellar remnants. However, to adopt this idea\nrequires a test to check how it would work in actual situations. Thus, we\npresent the first practical test of the idea using the high-magnification\nmicrolensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1045, for which a subset of Spitzer\nobservations fortuitously duplicate the prescription of Gould & Yee (2012).\nFrom the test, we confirm that the measurement of the lens-parallax adopting\nthis idea has sufficient accuracy to determine the physical properties of the\nisolated lens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 18:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 00:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In this note, we show that the\ndynamics associated to gradient descent minimization of nonlinear networks is\ntopologically equivalent, near the asymptotically stable minima of the\nempirical error, to linear gradient system in a quadratic potential with a\ndegenerate (for square loss) or almost degenerate (for logistic or crossentropy\nloss) Hessian. The proposition depends on the qualitative theory of dynamical\nsystems and is supported by numerical results. Our main propositions extend to\ndeep nonlinear networks two properties of gradient descent for linear networks,\nthat have been recently established (1) to be key to their generalization\nproperties: 1. Gradient descent enforces a form of implicit regularization\ncontrolled by the number of iterations, and asymptotically converges to the\nminimum norm solution for appropriate initial conditions of gradient descent.\nThis implies that there is usually an optimum early stopping that avoids\noverfitting of the loss. This property, valid for the square loss and many\nother loss functions, is relevant especially for regression. 2. For\nclassification, the asymptotic convergence to the minimum norm solution implies\nconvergence to the maximum margin solution which guarantees good classification\nerror for \"low noise\" datasets. This property holds for loss functions such as\nthe logistic and cross-entropy loss independently of the initial conditions.\nThe robustness to overparametrization has suggestive implications for the\nrobustness of the architecture of deep convolutional networks with respect to\nthe curse of dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 18:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Bars are global\ndisk instabilities that evolve by transferring angular momentum from the inner\nto outer disks and to the dark matter halo. It is well known that a massive\nspherical component such as halo in a disk galaxy can make it bar stable. In\nthis study we explore the effect of another spherical component, the bulge, on\nbar formation in disk galaxies. In our models we vary both the bulge mass and\nconcentration. We have used two sets of models, one that has a dense bulge and\nhigh surface density disk. The second model has a less concentrated bulge and a\nlighter disk. In both models we vary the bulge to disk mass fraction from 0 to\n0.7. Simulations of both the models show that there is an upper cutoff in bulge\nto disk mass ratio M b /M d above which bars cannot form; the cutoff is smaller\nfor denser bulges( M b /M d = 0.2) compared to less denser ones (M b /M d =\n0.5). We define a new criteria for bar formation in terms of bulge to disk\nradial force ratio (F b /F d ) at the disk scale lengths above which bars\ncannot form. We find that if F b /F d > 0.35, a disk is stable and a bar cannot\nform. Our results indicate that early type disk galaxies can still form strong\nbars in spite of having massive bulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 19:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

In this paper, a real-time\nand registration-free framework for dynamic shape instantiation, generalizable\nto multiple anatomical applications, is proposed to instantiate high-resolution\n3D shapes of an organ from a single 2D image intra-operatively. Firstly, an\napproximate optimal scan plane was determined by analyzing the pre-operative 3D\nstatistical shape model (SSM) of the anatomy with sparse principal component\nanalysis (SPCA) and considering practical constraints . Secondly, kernel\npartial least squares regression (KPLSR) was used to learn the relationship\nbetween the pre-operative 3D SSM and a synchronized 2D SSM constructed from 2D\nimages obtained at the approximate optimal scan plane. Finally, the derived\nrelationship was applied to the new intra-operative 2D image obtained at the\nsame scan plane to predict the high-resolution 3D shape intra-operatively. A\nmajor feature of the proposed framework is that no extra registration between\nthe pre-operative 3D SSM and the synchronized 2D SSM is required.

Can anything be learned from the\nunstable modes in reduced-order models? Several examples illustrate how such\ninstability can helpfully signal transient growth in the original system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 04:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Orchestrated\nin multiple phases, the attack uses a massively distributed botnet to generate\nlow-rate benign traffic aiming to congest selected network links, so-called\ntarget links. The adoption of benign traffic, while simultaneously targeting\nmultiple network links, makes the detection of the Crossfire attack a serious\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for early detection of\nCrossfire attack, i.e., detection in the warm-up period of the attack. We\npropose to monitor traffic at the potential decoy servers and discuss the\nadvantages comparing with other monitoring approaches. Since the low-rate\nattack traffic is very difficult to distinguish from the background traffic, we\ninvestigate several deep learning methods to mine the spatiotemporal features\nfor attack detection.

This process of 'fetal programming' is mediated by the effects of\nthe prenatal experience on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)\naxis and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The HPA axis is a dynamic system\nregulating homeostasis, especially the stress response, and is highly sensitive\nto adverse early life experiences. We review the evidence for the effects of PS\non fetal programming of the HPA axis and the ANS. We derive a multi-scale\nmulti-species approach to devising preclinical and clinical studies to identify\nearly non-invasively available pre- and postnatal biomarkers of these\nprogramming effects. Such approach would identify adverse postnatal brain\ndevelopmental trajectories, a prerequisite for designing therapeutic\ninterventions. The multiple scales include the biomarkers reflecting changes in\nthe brain epigenome, metabolome, microbiome and the ANS activity gauged via an\narray of advanced non-invasively obtainable properties of fetal heart rate\nfluctuations. The proposed framework has the potential to reveal mechanistic\nlinks between maternal stress during pregnancy and changes across these\nphysiological scales. Such biomarkers may hence be useful as early and\nnon-invasive predictors of neurodevelopmental trajectories influenced by the\nPS. We conclude that studies into PS effects must be conducted on multiple\nscales derived from concerted observations in multiple animal models and human\ncohorts performed in an interactive and iterative manner and deploying machine\nlearning for data synthesis, identification and validation of the best\nnon-invasive biomarkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 09:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

Each iteration of VAPP generates a nonlinear\napproximation to the primal problem of an augmented Lagrangian method. The\napproximation incorporates both linearization and a variable distance-like\nfunction, and then the iterations of VAPP provide one decomposition property\nfor NCCP. Motivated by recent applications in big data analysis, there has been\nan explosive growth in interest in the convergence rate analysis of parallel\ncomputing algorithms for large scale optimization problem.

We also demonstrate that our proposal is within the reach of\nthe current technologies and, thus, it could uncover a decent realization of\nquantum gravitational phenomena thorough a simple table-top experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 12:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

To demonstrate the power of investigative capabilities of the $WG_M$\nmethod, in terms of flare and CME eruptions, we studied two typical ARs,\nnamely, AR 12158 and AR 12192. The choice of ARs represent canonical cases. AR\n12158 produced an X1.6 flare with fast \"halo\" CME ($v_{linear}$=1267 $km\ns^{-1}$) while in AR 12192 there occurred a range of powerful X-class\neruptions, i.e. X1.1, X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class energetic flares,\ninterestingly, none with an accompanying CME. The value itself and temporal\nvariation of $WG_{M}$ is found to possess potentially important diagnostic\ninformation about the intensity of the expected flare class. Furthermore, we\nhave also estimated the flare onset time from the relationship of duration of\nconverging and diverging motions of the area-weighted barycenters of two\nsubgroups of opposite magnetic polarities. This test turns out not only to\nprovide information about the intensity of the expected flare-class and the\nflare onset time but may also indicate whether a flare will occur with/without\nfast CME.\n  We have also found that, in the case when the negative polarity barycenter\nhas moved around and the positive one \"remained\" at the same coordinates\npreceding eruption, the flare occurred with fast \"halo\" CME.\n  Otherwise, when both the negative and the positive polarity barycenters have\nmoved around, the AR produced flares without CME. If these properties found for\nthe movement of the barycenters are generic pre-cursors of CME eruption (or\nlack of it), identifying them may serve as an excellent pre-condition for\nrefining the forecast of the lift-off of CMEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 13:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

This model is known to exhibit an\ninsulator-metal transition upon increasing the hopping amplitude. Without\nexternal magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling leads to a simple renormalization\nof the hopping amplitude. However, when the degeneracy of the on-site energies\nis lifted by an external magnetic field, the interplay of Zeeman splitting and\nspin-orbit coupling has a strong effect on the localization length. We studied\nthis interplay numerically by calculating the energy dependence of the Lyapunov\nexponent in the insulating regime. Numerical results can be unambiguously\ninterpreted in the language of the phase-space trajectories. As a first step,\nwe have explained the plateau in the energy dependence of the localization\nlength in the original Aubry-Andre model. Our main finding is that a very weak\nspin-orbit coupling leads to delocalization of states with energies smaller\nthan the Zeeman shift. The origin of the effect is the spin-orbit-induced\nopening of new transport channels.

Using a simple model three-linked sphere swimmer,\nwe show that the swimming trajectories near a no-slip wall reveal various\nscenarios of motion depending on the initial orientation and the distance\nseparating the swimmer from the wall. We find that the swimmer can either be\ntrapped by the wall, completely escape, or perform an oscillatory gliding\nmotion at a constant mean height above the wall. Using a far-field\napproximation, we find that, at leading order, the wall-induced correction has\na source-dipolar or quadrupolar flow structure where the translational and\nangular velocities of the swimmer decay as inverse third and fourth powers with\ndistance from the wall, respectively. The resulting equations of motion for the\ntrajectories and the relevant order parameters fully characterize the\ntransition between the states and allow for an accurate description of the\nswimming behavior near a wall. We demonstrate that the transition between the\ntrapping and oscillatory gliding states is first order discontinuous, whereas\nthe transition between the trapping and escaping states is continuous,\ncharacterized by non-trivial scaling exponents of the order parameters. In\norder to model the circular motion of flagellated bacteria near solid\ninterfaces, we further assume that the spheres can undergo rotational motion\naround the swimming axis. We show that the general three-dimensional motion can\nbe mapped onto a quasi-two-dimensional representational model by an appropriate\nredefinition of the order parameters governing the transition between the\nswimming states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2017 19:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 21:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The shock wave is expected to possess enough strength to ignite\nthe nuclear matter thereby converting it to quark matter. The conversion of\nnuclear to quark matter is assumed to take place at the shock discontinuity.\nThe density and pressure discontinuity is studied both spatially and temporally\nas it starts near the center of the star and moves towards the surface.\nPolytropic equations of state which mimics real original nuclear matter and\nquark matter equations of state are used to study such dynamical phase\ntransition. Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically\nsymmetric star we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable\ndensity discontinuity near the center. We find that as the shock wave\npropagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the shock\nvelocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light. Such fast shock\nvelocity indicates rapid phase transition in neutron star taking place on a\ntimescale of some tens of microseconds. Such a result is quite an interesting\none, and it differs from previous calculations that the phase transition in\nneutron stars takes at least some tens of milliseconds. Rapid phase transition\ncan have significant observational significance because such fast phase\ntransition would imply quite strong gravitational wave signals but very short\nlived. Such short-lived gravitational wave signals would be accompanied with\nshort-lived gamma-ray bursts and neutrino signals originating from the neutrino\nand gamma-ray generation from the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 07:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}
