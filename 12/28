A polynomial model is used to characterize the\nnonlinear LNAs and to derive the second-order statistics and spatial\ncorrelation of the distortion. We show that, with spatial matched filtering\n(maximum-ratio combining) at the receiver, some distortion terms combine\ncoherently, and that the SINR of the symbol estimates therefore is limited by\nthe linearity of the LNAs. Furthermore, it is studied how the power from a\nblocker in the adjacent frequency band leaks into the main band and creates\ndistortion. The distortion term that scales cubically with the power received\nfrom the blocker has a spatial correlation that can be filtered out by spatial\nprocessing and only the coherent term that scales quadratically with the power\nremains.

There are many techniques designed for protection such as firewall and\nintrusion detection systems (IDS). IDS is a set of software and/or hardware\ntechniques used to detect hacker's activities in computer systems. Two types of\nanomalies are used in IDS to detect intrusive activities different from normal\nuser behavior.

Most ontologies can be seen as directed acyclic graphs, where nodes\nrepresent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts.\nGiven an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent\nsubgraph; that is, a subgraph such that if an object is annotated by a\nparticular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that\ngeneralize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large\nspace of possible consistent subgraphs; however, until now we have not been\naware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a\ngiven ontology.

In this paper, we study\n$\\alpha$-attractor models with dynamical dark energy, including the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ as a free parameter. Predominantly, the models\nwith $\\Lambda > 0$ converge to the asymptotic regime with the equation of state\n$w=-1$. However, there are some models with $w\\neq -1$, which are compatible\nwith the current observations. In the simplest models with $\\Lambda = 0$, one\nhas the tensor to scalar ratio $r=\\frac{12\\alpha}{N^2}$ and the asymptotic\nequation of state $w=-1+\\frac{2}{9\\alpha}$ (which in general differs from its\npresent value). For example, in the seven disk M-theory related model with\n$\\alpha = 7/3$ one finds $r \\sim 10^{-2}$ and the asymptotic equation of state\nis $w \\sim -0.9$.

Inspired by lowness notions from computability theory,\nAllender introduced the concept of \"low for speed\" oracles. An oracle A is low\nfor speed if relativizing to A has essentially no effect on computational\ncomplexity, meaning that if a decidable language can be decided in time $f(n)$\nwith access to oracle A, then it can be decided in time poly(f(n)) without any\noracle. The existence of non-computable such A's was later proven by Bayer and\nSlaman, who even constructed a computably enumerable one, and exhibited a\nnumber of properties of these oracles as well as interesting connections with\ncomputability theory. In this paper, we pursue this line of research, answering\nthe questions left by Bayer and Slaman and give further evidence that the\nstructure of the class of low for speed oracles is a very rich one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 23:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Traditionally, in such missions, robots\npassively gather data along prescribed paths, while inference, path planning,\nand other high level decision making is largely performed by a supervisory\nscience team. However, communication constraints hinder these processes, and\nhence the rate of scientific progress. This paper presents an active perception\napproach that aims to reduce robots' reliance on human supervision and improve\nscience productivity by encoding scientists' domain knowledge and decision\nmaking process on-board. We use Bayesian networks to compactly model critical\naspects of scientific knowledge while remaining robust to observation and\nmodeling uncertainty.

Even though\nthe main interaction processes are identified, more and more precise\nobservations provide an opportunity to study more subtle effects and pose a\nchallenge to the propagation models. GALPROP is a sophisticated CR propagation\ncode that is being developed for about 20 years. It provides a unified\nframework for interpretations of data from many different types of experiments.\nIt is used for a description of direct CR measurements and associated\ninterstellar emissions (radio to gamma rays), thereby providing important\ninformation about CR injection and propagation in the interstellar medium. By\naccounting for all relevant observables at a time, the GALPROP code brings\ntogether theoretical predictions, interpretation of the most recent\nobservations, and helps to reveal the signatures of new phenomena. In this\npaper we review latest applications of GALPROP and address ongoing and near\nfuture improvements. We are discussing effects of different propagation models,\nand of the transition from cylindrically symmetrical models to a proper 3D\ndescription of the components of the interstellar medium and the source\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 05:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The aim of this work is to investigate\nthe structure and kinematics of the CS disc of the B[e] SG LHA 120-S 35. We\nused high-resolution optical spectra obtained in different years to model the\nforbidden emission lines and determine the kinematical properties of their\nline-forming regions, assuming Keplerian rotation. We also used low-resolution\nnear-infrared (IR) spectra to explore the variability of molecular emission.\nLHA 120-S 35 displays spectral variability in both optical and IR regions. The\nP-Cygni line profiles of H I, as well as those of Fe II and O I, suggest the\npresence of a strong bipolar clumped wind. We distinguish density enhancements\nin the P-Cygni absorption component of the first Balmer lines, which show\nvariations in both velocity and strength. The P-Cygni profile emission\ncomponent is double-peaked, indicating the presence of a rotating CS disc. We\nalso observe line-profile variations in the permitted and forbidden features of\nFe II and O I. In the IR, we detect variations in the intensity of the H I\nemission lines as well as in the emission of the CO band-heads. Moreover, we\nfind that the profiles of each [Ca II] and [O I] emission lines contain\ncontributions from spatially different (complete or partial) rings.

We suggest that LHA 120-S 35 has passed through the\nred-supergiant (RSG) phase and evolves back bluewards in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. The formation of the complex CS structure could be\nthe result of the wind-wind interactions of the post-RSG wind with the\npreviously ejected material from the RSG.

Different from the\nwell-known nodal-point and nodal-line semimetals, in these materials, the\nconduction and valence bands cross on closed nodal surfaces in the Brillouin\nzone. We propose different classes of nodal surfaces, both in the absence and\nin the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the absence of SOC, a class of\nnodal surfaces can be protected by spacetime inversion symmetry and sublattice\nsymmetry and characterized by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, while another class of\nnodal surfaces are guaranteed by a combination of nonsymmorphic two-fold\nscrew-rotational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. We show that the\ninclusion of SOC will destroy the former class of nodal surfaces but may\npreserve the latter provided that the inversion symmetry is broken.

In order to reduce security vulnerabilities, public cloud providers\noffer firewall functionalities. When properly configured, a firewall protects\ncloud networks from cyber-attacks. However, proper firewall configuration\nrequires intimate knowledge of the protected system, high expertise and\non-going maintenance.\n  As a result, many organizations do not use firewalls effectively, leaving\ntheir cloud resources vulnerable. In this paper, we present a novel supervised\nlearning method, and prototype, which compute recommendations for firewall\nrules. Recommendations are based on sampled network traffic meta-data (NetFlow)\ncollected from a public cloud provider. Labels are extracted from firewall\nconfigurations deemed to be authored by experts. NetFlow is collected from\nnetwork routers, avoiding expensive collection from cloud VMs, as well as\nrelieving privacy concerns.\n  The proposed method captures network routines and dependencies between\nresources and firewall configuration. The method predicts IPs to be allowed by\nthe firewall. A grouping algorithm is subsequently used to generate a\nmanageable number of IP ranges. Each range is a parameter for a firewall rule.\n  We present results of experiments on real data, showing ROC AUC of 0.92,\ncompared to 0.58 for an unsupervised baseline.

One well recognized common\nsmell of spreadsheet formulae is nest-IF expressions, which have low\nreadability and high cognitive cost for users, and are error-prone during reuse\nor maintenance. However, end users usually lack essential programming language\nknowledge and skills to tackle or even realize the problem. The previous\nresearch work has made very initial attempts in this aspect, while no effective\nand automated approach is currently available.\n  This paper firstly proposes an AST-based automated approach to systematically\nrefactoring nest-IF formulae. The general idea is two-fold. First, we detect\nand remove logic redundancy on the AST. Second, we identify higher-level\nsemantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax\nusing concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted\nagainst a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT\ncompany for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27\nmillion nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell\nof over 99\\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced\nnesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey\ninvolving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer\nthe refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach\nis necessary and helpful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 09:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Software\ntransaction memory systems (STMs) addresses this issues and provide better\nconcurrency in which programmer need not have to worry about consistency\nissues. Another advantage of STMs is that they facilitate compositionality of\nconcurrent programs with great ease. Different concurrent operations that need\nto be composed to form a single atomic unit is achieved by encapsulating them\nin a single transaction. In this paper, we introduce a new STM system as\nmulti-version object based STM (MVOSTM) which is the combination of both of\nthese ideas for harnessing greater concurrency in STMs. As the name suggests\nMVOSTM, works on a higher level and maintains multiple versions corresponding\nto each key. We have developed MVOSTM with the unlimited number of versions\ncorresponding to each key. In addition to that, we have developed garbage\ncollection for MVOSTM (MVOSTM-GC) to delete unwanted versions corresponding to\nthe keys to reduce traversal overhead. MVOSTM provides greater concurrency\nwhile reducing the number of aborts and it ensures compositionality by making\nthe transactions atomic.

Our results are valid also for all the evolutionary\nscenarios invoking rotation as the driving mechanism of the accretion process\nas well as the evolution up to the explosion. We find that the observational\nproperties depend mainly on the mass of the exploding object, even if the\nangular momentum evolution after the end of the mass accretion phase and before\nthe onset of C-burning plays a non-negligible role. Just before the explosion\nthe magnitude M_V ranges between 9 and 11 mag, while the colour (F225W-F555W)\nis about -1.64 mag. The photometric properties remain constant for a few\ndecades before the explosion. During the last few months the luminosity\ndecreases very rapidly. The corresponding decline in the optical bands varies\nfrom few hundredths up to one magnitude, the exact value depending on both the\nWD total mass and the braking efficiency at the end of the mass transfer. This\nfeature is related to the exponentially increasing energy production which\ndrives the formation of a convective core rapidly extending over a large part\nof the exploding object. Also a drop in the angular velocity occurs. We find\nthat observations in the soft X band (0.5 -2 keV) may be used to check if the\nSNe Ia progenitors evolution up to explosion is driven by rotation and, hence,\nto discriminate among different progenitor scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 10:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Previous studies have shown that\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is statistically compatible with the\nobserved solar wind heating as it expands in the heliosphere. However, in order\nto understand which processes contribute to the plasma heating, it is necessary\nto have a local description of the energy flux across scales. To this aim, it\nis customary to use indicators such as the magnetic field partial variance of\nincrements (PVI), which is associated with the local, relative, scale-dependent\nmagnetic energy. A more complete evaluation of the energy transfer should also\ninclude other terms, related to velocity and cross-helicity. This is achieved\nhere by introducing a proxy for the local, scale dependent turbulent energy\ntransfer rate epsilon_Dt(t), based on the third-order moment scaling law for\nMHD turbulence. Data from Helios 2 are used to determine the statistical\nproperties of such a proxy in comparison with the magnetic and velocity fields\nPVI, and the correlation with local solar wind heating is computed. PVI and\nepsilon_Dt(t) are generally well correlated, however epsilon_Dt(t) is a very\nsensitive proxy that can exhibit large amplitude values, both positive and\nnegative, even for low amplitude peaks in the PVI. Furthermore, epsilon_Dt(t)\nis very well correlated with local increases of temperature when large\namplitude bursts of energy transfer are localized, thus suggesting an important\nrole played by this proxy in the study of plasma energy dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 11:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

We propose\na four-component pipeline, which obtains as input a training corpus of\ndomain-specific documents, along with a set of declarative sentences from the\nsame domain, and generates as output a set of factoid questions that refer to\nthe source sentences but are slightly different from them, so that a\nquestion-answering system or a person can be asked a question that requires a\ndeeper understanding and knowledge than a simple word-matching. Contrary to\nexisting domain-specific AQG systems that utilize the template-based approach\nto question generation, we propose to transform each source sentence into a set\nof questions by applying a series of domain-independent rules (a\nsyntactic-based approach).

Our analysis relies heavily on the\ndual-frame formalism, which allows us to work in the Lagrangian frame, where\ncomputation is relatively easy, before transforming to the desired Eulerian\nform. This general strategy allows for the construction of compact expressions\nfor the characteristic variables in a highly economical manner. General\nrelativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD), ideal magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and\nresistive magnetohydrodynamics (RGRMHD) are considered in turn. In the first\ncase we obtain a simplified form of earlier expressions. In the second we show\nthat the flux-balance law formulation used in typical numerical applications is\nonly weakly hyperbolic and thus does not have a well-posed initial value\nproblem. Newtonian ideal MHD is found to suffer from the same problem when\nwritten in flux-balance law form. An alternative formulation, closely related\nto that of Anile and Pennisi, is instead shown to be strongly hyperbolic. In\nthe final case we find that the standard forms of RGRMHD, relying upon a\nparticular choice of `generalized Ohm's law', are only weakly hyperbolic. The\nlatter problem may be rectified by adjusting the choice of Ohm's law, but we do\nnot do so here.

For the analysis, the spectra are reduced to scores on two factors,\none derived externally from a linear discriminant analysis using spectra taken\nmanually from known normal and metastatic tissue, and one derived from the node\nunder investigation to capture variability orthogonal to the external factor.\nThen a three-group mixture model (normal, metastatic, non-nodal background)\nusing multivariate t distributions is fitted to the scores, with external data\nbeing used to specify informative prior distributions for the parameters of the\nthree distributions.

The recurrent\nconvolutional approach is not applied very much, other than in a few DCNN\narchitectures. On the other hand, Inception-v4 and Residual networks have\npromptly become popular among computer the vision community. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new DCNN model called the Inception Recurrent Residual\nConvolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN), which utilizes the power of the\nRecurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), the Inception network, and the\nResidual network. This approach improves the recognition accuracy of the\nInception-residual network with same number of network parameters. In addition,\nthis proposed architecture generalizes the Inception network, the RCNN, and the\nResidual network with significantly improved training accuracy. We have\nempirically evaluated the performance of the IRRCNN model on different\nbenchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet-200, and CU3D-100.

Mode cooperation is manifested as the\ngeneration of the modes in an allowed band with a high threshold instead of\nmodes localized near the band gap with a low threshold. Suppression of lasing\nof the modes at the edge of the band gap results in widening of the radiation\npattern above the generation threshold.

Therefore,\nrobots re- quire a latching mechanism which can help to reconfigure itself\nwithout sacrificing the payload capability. This paper presents a latching\nmechanism based on the flexible screw attaching principle. In which, actuators\nare used to move the robot links and joints while connecting them with a\nmotorized-screw and dis- connecting them by unfastening the screw. The brackets\nused in our mechanism configuration helps to hold maximum force up to 5000N.\nThe LaMMos - Latching Mechanism based on Motorized- screw has been applied to\nthe DeWaLoP - Developing Water Loss Prevention in-pipe robot.

And it helps to recover the legs positions\nto original status once the robot is inside the pipe. Also, LaMMos add\nstiffness to the robot legs by dynamically integrate them to the structure.\nAdditionally, we present an application of the LaMMos mechanism to exoskeleton\nsuits, for easing the mo- tors from the joints when carrying heavy weights for\nlong periods of time.

It was originally used for the analysis of elastodynamic plane waves\nin laterally invariant media. It has been extended by various authors for\nlaterally varying media. Other authors derived a similar formalism for other\nwave phenomena. This paper starts with a unified formulation of the\nmatrix-vector wave equation for 3D inhomogeneous, dissipative media. The wave\nvector, source vector and operator matrix are specified in the appendices for\nacoustic, quantum mechanical, electromagnetic, elastodynamic,\nporoelastodynamic, piezoelectric and seismoelectric waves. It is shown that the\noperator matrix obeys unified symmetry relations for all these wave phenomena.\nNext, unified matrix-vector reciprocity theorems of the convolution and\ncorrelation type are derived, utilising the symmetry properties of the operator\nmatrix. These theorems formulate mathematical relations between two wave states\nin the same spatial domain. A unified wave field representation is obtained by\nreplacing one of the states in the convolution-type reciprocity theorem by a\nGreen's state. By replacing both states in the correlation-type reciprocity\ntheorem by Green's states, a unified representation of the homogeneous Green's\nmatrix is obtained. Applications of the unified reciprocity theorems and\nrepresentations for forward and inverse wave problems are briefly indicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 17:26:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}
