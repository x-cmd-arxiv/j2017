Yet, this\ndoes not naturally enforce intra-class similarity nor inter-class margin of the\nlearned deep representations. To simultaneously achieve these two goals,\ndifferent solutions have been proposed in the literature, such as the pairwise\nor triplet losses. However, such solutions carry the extra task of selecting\npairs or triplets, and the extra computational burden of computing and learning\nfor many combinations of them. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play loss\nterm for deep networks that explicitly reduces intra-class variance and\nenforces inter-class margin simultaneously, in a simple and elegant geometric\nmanner. For each class, the deep features are collapsed into a learned linear\nsubspace, or union of them, and inter-class subspaces are pushed to be as\northogonal as possible. Our proposed Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OL\\'E) does\nnot require carefully crafting pairs or triplets of samples for training, and\nworks standalone as a classification loss, being the first reported deep metric\nlearning framework of its kind. Because of the improved margin between features\nof different classes, the resulting deep networks generalize better, are more\ndiscriminative, and more robust. We demonstrate improved classification\nperformance in general object recognition, plugging the proposed loss term into\nexisting off-the-shelf architectures. In particular, we show the advantage of\nthe proposed loss in the small data/model scenario, and we significantly\nadvance the state-of-the-art on the Stanford STL-10 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 16:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Recently,\nhowever, deep learning based-approaches have gained significant popularity due\nto its ability to solve general inversion problems. In this work, we propose a\nunique, novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture which\nreconstructs high quality cardiac MR images from highly undersampled k-space\ndata by jointly exploiting the dependencies of the temporal sequences as well\nas the iterative nature of the traditional optimisation algorithms. In\nparticular, the proposed architecture embeds the structure of the traditional\niterative algorithms, efficiently modelling the recurrence of the iterative\nreconstruction stages by using recurrent hidden connections over such\niterations. In addition, spatiotemporal dependencies are simultaneously learnt\nby exploiting bidirectional recurrent hidden connections across time sequences.\nThe proposed algorithm is able to learn both the temporal dependency and the\niterative reconstruction process effectively with only a very small number of\nparameters, while outperforming current MR reconstruction methods in terms of\ncomputational complexity, reconstruction accuracy and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 16:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 17:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 21:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

Agents are uniformly selected to initiate an alliance and\nto invite collaboration partners. These decide about acceptance based on an\nindividual threshold that is compared with the utility expected from joining\nthe current alliance. The benefit of alliances results from the fitness of the\nagents involved. Fitness is obtained from an empirical distribution of agent's\nactivities. The cost of an alliance reflects its coordination effort. Two free\nparameters $a_{c}$ and $a_{l}$ scale the costs and the individual threshold. If\ninitiators receive $R$ rejections of invitations, the alliance formation stops\nand another initiator is selected. The three free parameters $(a_{c},a_{l},R)$\nare calibrated against a large scale data set of about 15,000 firms engaging in\nabout 15,000 R\\&D alliances over 26 years. For the validation of the model we\ncompare the empirical size distribution with the theoretical one, using\nconfidence bands, to find a very good agreement. As an asset of our agent-based\nmodel, we provide an analytical solution that allows to reduce the simulation\neffort considerably. The analytical solution applies to general forms of the\nutility of alliances. Hence, the model can be extended to other cases of\nalliance formation.

On the other side,\nPerry, Wein, and Bandeira (2017) proved that there exists a $\\beta_p'<\\beta_p$\nsuch that any statistical hypothesis test can not distinguish these two\ntensors, in the sense that their total variation distance asymptotically\nvanishes, when the signa-to-noise ratio is less than $\\beta_p'$. In this work,\nwe show that $\\beta_p$ is indeed the critical threshold that strictly separates\nthe distinguishability and indistinguishability between the two tensors under\nthe total variation distance. Our approach is based on a subtle analysis of the\nhigh temperature behavior of the pure $p$-spin model with Ising spin, arising\ninitially from the field of spin glasses. In particular, we identify the\nsignal-to-noise criticality $\\beta_p$ as the critical temperature,\ndistinguishing the high and low temperature behavior, of the Ising pure\n$p$-spin mean-field spin glass model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 17:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Social networks exhibit a high\ndegree of transitivity, which explains the successes of common neighbor-based\nmethods for link prediction. In this paper, we examine mechanisms behind link\nformation from the perspective of an ego node. We introduce the notion of\npersonalized degree for each neighbor node of the ego, which is the number of\nother neighbors a particular neighbor is connected to. From empirical analyses\non four on-line social network datasets, we find that neighbors with higher\npersonalized degree are more likely to lead to new link formations when they\nserve as common neighbors with other nodes, both in undirected and directed\nsettings. This is complementary to the finding of Adamic and Adar that neighbor\nnodes with higher (global) degree are less likely to lead to new link\nformations. Furthermore, on directed networks, we find that personalized\nout-degree has a stronger effect on link formation than personalized in-degree,\nwhereas global in-degree has a stronger effect than global out-degree. We\nvalidate our empirical findings through several link recommendation experiments\nand observe that incorporating both personalized and global degree into link\nrecommendation greatly improves accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 18:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 18:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

While widely debated in sports, gambling,\nand financial markets over the past several decades, little is known if hot\nstreaks apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on\nlifecycle of creativity, we collected large-scale career histories of\nindividual artists, movie directors and scientists, tracing the artworks,\nmovies, and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all\nthree domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal\nregularity, each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works\noccurring in sequence.

The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's sequence of\nworks, is temporally localized, and is unassociated with any detectable change\nin productivity.

In addition to the transit features created by\nthe planets, the flux also includes the reflected light component of each\nplanet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically\nreferred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no\nadditional noise. As well as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as\nspots, can create a modulation in the data, which may be very difficult to\ndistinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed by\nthe stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the\nlimitations imposed by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short\nduration of the observations planned in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As\ninitial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized by just one\norbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar\nactivity pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an\ninstrumental noise level, which we have chosen to be at the same level as\npredicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover the\nreflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a\nGaussian process.We estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is\nnecessary to obtain a reliable detection of the planetary albedo. This result\nis independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation of the\nGaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve\ntime-span is shorter than the stellar rotation. Finally, in presence of typical\nCHEOPS gaps in the simulations, we confirm that it is still possible to obtain\na reliable albedo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 18:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

This assumption of the fundamentality of objective reality is often seen\nas a major prerequisite of any kind of scientific reasoning. However, here I\nargue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in\nsome contexts. Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around\nphysics that can arguably be addressed in a substantially more consistent and\nrigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person perspective\nis ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These\nare questions like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future\nexperiences if she is told that she will be simulated on a computer? How should\nwe think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and what can we learn from the\nfact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal\npreexisting properties? Why are there simple computable laws of physics in the\nfirst place? This note summarizes a longer companion paper which constructs a\nmathematically rigorous theory along those lines, suggesting a simple and\nunified framework (rooted in algorithmic information theory) to address\nquestions like those above. It is not meant as a \"theory of everything\" (in\nfact, it predicts its own limitations), but it shows how a notion of objective\nexternal world, looking very much like our own, can provably emerge from a\nstarting point in which the first-person perspective is primary, without\napriori assumptions on the existence of \"laws\" or a \"physical world\".

Known database systems and algorithms are no longer capable of\neffectively handling such large data sets. MapReduce is a novel programming\nparadigm for processing distributable problems over large-scale data using a\ncomputer cluster.\n  In this work we explore the MapReduce paradigm from three different angles.\nWe begin by examining a well-known problem in the field of data mining: mining\nclosed frequent itemsets over a large dataset. By harnessing the power of\nMapReduce, we present a novel algorithm for mining closed frequent itemsets\nthat outperforms existing algorithms.\n  Next, we explore one of the fundamental implications of \"Big Data\": The data\nis not known with complete certainty. A probabilistic database is a relational\ndatabase with the addendum that each tuple is associated with a probability of\nits existence. A natural development of MapReduce is of a distributed\nrelational database management system, where relational calculus has been\nreduced to a combination of map and reduce function. We take this development a\nstep further by proposing a query optimizer over distributed, probabilistic\ndatabase.\n  Finally, we analyze the best known implementation of MapReduce called Hadoop,\naiming to overcome one of its major drawbacks: it does not directly support the\nexplicit specification of the data repeatedly processed throughout different\njobs.Many data-mining algorithms, such as clustering and association-rules\nrequire iterative computation: the same data are processed again and again\nuntil the computation converges or a stopping condition is satisfied.

Two aftershocks were detected in routine processing at the IDC.\nThree aftershocks were detected by a prototype waveform cross correlation\nprocedure with explosions as master events, and one aftershock was found with\nthe aftershocks as master event. Two seismic arrays USRK and KSRS of the IMS\nand two non-IMS 3-C stations SEHB (South Korea) and MDJ (China) were used. With\nincreasing frequency, all stations demonstrate approximately the same level of\ndeviation between the Pg/Lg spectral amplitude ratios belonging to the DPRK\nexplosions and their aftershocks. For a single station, simple statistical\nestimates show that the probability of any of six aftershocks not to be a\nsample from the explosion population is larger than 99.996% at the KSRS and\neven larger at USRK. The probability of any of the DPRK explosion to be a\nrepresentative of the aftershock population is extremely small as defined by\nthe distance of 20 and more standard deviations to the mean explosion Pg/Lg\nvalue. For network discrimination, we use the Mahalanobis distance combining\nthe Pg/Lg estimates at three stations: USRK, KSRS and MDJ. At frequencies above\n4 Hz, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance, D2, between the populations of\nexplosions and aftershocks is larger than 100. In the frequency band between 6\nand 12 Hz at USRK, the aftershocks distance from the average explosion\nD2>21,000.

Furthermore, as argued below, several\nother conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point\nto limitations of our current perspective and motivate the exploration of an\nalternative: to start with the first-person (the observer) rather than the\nthird-person perspective (the world). In this work, I propose a rigorous\napproach of this kind on the basis of algorithmic information theory. It is\nbased on a single postulate: that universal induction determines the chances of\nwhat any observer sees next. That is, instead of a world or physical laws, it\nis the local state of the observer alone that determines those probabilities.\nSurprisingly, despite its solipsistic foundation, I show that the resulting\ntheory recovers many features of our established physical worldview: it\npredicts that it appears to observers as if there was an external world that\nevolves according to simple, computable, probabilistic laws. In contrast to the\nstandard view, objective reality is not assumed on this approach but rather\nprovably emerges as an asymptotic statistical phenomenon.

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is\ndirectly sensitive to the line-of-sight integrated ICM pressure, and is thus\nparticularly adapted to study ICM sub-structures. We apply\nstructure-enhancement filtering algorithms to high resolution tSZ observations\nof distant clusters, in order to search for pressure discontinuities,\ncompressions, as well as secondary peaks in the ICM. The same filters are\napplied to synthetic tSZ images extracted from RHAPSODY-G hydrodynamic\nsimulations, in order to better interpret the extracted features. We also study\nthe noise propagation trough the filters and quantify the impact of systematic\neffects, point source residuals being identified as the dominant potential\ncontaminant. In 3 of our 6 NIKA clusters we identify features at high S/N that\nshow clear evidence for merger events. In MACSJ0717 (z=0.55), three strong\npressure gradients are observed on the E, SE and W sectors, and two main peaks\nin the pressure distribution are identified. We observe a lack of tSZ compact\nstructure in the cool-core cluster PSZ1G045.85 (z=0.61), and a tSZ gradient\nridge dominates in the SE. In the highest z cluster, CLJ1227 (z=0.89), we\ndetect a ~45\" (360 kpc) long ridge pressure gradient associated with a\nsecondary pressure peak in the W region.

The present survey, given its large area, continuity, extensive\nmultiwavelength coverage, and large-scale structure information, is ideal for\nthis kind of study. Here, we focus on the XXL-South (XXL-S) field. Our main aim\nis to study the environment of the various types of X-ray selected AGN and\ninvestigate its possible role in AGN triggering and evolution. We studied the\nlarge-scale (>1 Mpc) environment up to redshift z=1 using the nearest neighbour\ndistance method to compare various pairs of AGN types. We also investigated the\nsmall-scale environment (<0.4 Mpc) by calculating the local overdensities of\noptical galaxies. In addition, we built a catalogue of AGN concentrations with\ntwo or more members using the hierarchical clustering method and we correlated\nthem with the X-ray galaxy clusters detected in the XXL survey. It is found\nthat radio detected X-ray sources are more obscured than non-radio ones, though\nnot all radio sources are obscured AGN. We did not find any significant\ndifferences in the large-scale clustering between luminous and faint X-ray AGN,\nor between obscured and unobscured ones, or between radio and non-radio\nsources. At local scales (<0.4 Mpc), AGN typically reside in overdense regions,\ncompared to non-AGN; however, no differences were found between the various\ntypes of AGN. A majority of AGN concentrations with two or more members are\nfound in the neighbourhood of X-ray galaxy clusters within <25-45 Mpc. Our\nresults suggest that X-ray AGN are typically located in supercluster filaments,\nbut they are also found in over- and underdense regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 19:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2018 16:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

It is well-known that the computational cost of MIMO detection based\non QR decomposition is directly proportional to the number of non-zero entries\ninvolved in back-substitution and slicing operations in the triangularized\nchannel matrix, which can be too high for low-latency applications involving\nlarge MIMO dimensions. By systematically puncturing the channel to have a\nspecific structure, it is demonstrated that the detection process can be\naccelerated by employing standard schemes such as chase detection, list\ndetection, nulling-and-cancellation detection, and sub-space detection on the\ntransformed matrix. The performance of these schemes is characterized and\nanalyzed mathematically, and bounds on the achievable diversity gain and\nprobability of bit error are derived. Surprisingly, it is shown that puncturing\ndoes not negatively impact the receive diversity gain in hard-output detectors.\nThe analysis is extended to soft-output detection when computing per-layer bit\nlog-likelihood ratios; it is shown that significant performance gains are\nattainable by ordering the layer of interest to be at the root when puncturing\nthe channel. Simulations of coded and uncoded scenarios certify that the\nproposed schemes scale up efficiently both in the number of antennas and\nconstellation size, as well as in the presence of correlated channels. In\nparticular, soft-output per-layer sub-space detection is shown to achieve a\n2.5dB SNR gain at $10^{-4}$ bit error rate in $256$-QAM $16\\!\\times\\!16$ MIMO,\nwhile saving $77\\%$ of nulling-and-cancellation computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 19:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

The situation gets\neven worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning),\nwhich suffers from higher latency, lower throughput, and intermittent poor\nconnections. In this paper, we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in\ndistributed SGD is redundant, and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to\ngreatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during\ncompression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction, local gradient\nclipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. We have applied Deep\nGradient Compression to image classification, speech recognition, and language\nmodeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and\nLibrispeech Corpus. On these scenarios, Deep Gradient Compression achieves a\ngradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy, cutting\nthe gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35MB, and for DeepSpeech from\n488MB to 0.74MB. Deep gradient compression enables large-scale distributed\ntraining on inexpensive commodity 1Gbps Ethernet and facilitates distributed\ntraining on mobile.

Due to the exponential complexity involved in modeling the\ncontext associated with multiple image regions, existing work oversimplifies\nthis task to pairwise region modeling by multiple instance learning. In this\npaper, we propose a variational Bayesian method, called Variational Context, to\nsolve the problem of complex context modeling in referring expression\ngrounding. Our model exploits the reciprocal relation between the referent and\ncontext, i.e., either of them influences the estimation of the posterior\ndistribution of the other, and thereby the search space of context can be\ngreatly reduced, resulting in better localization of referent. We develop a\nnovel cue-specific language-vision embedding network that learns this\nreciprocity model end-to-end.

However, multiphoton\ndistinguishability at the detectors can play an important role from an\nexperimental point of view [4]. This raises a fundamental question: How is the\nphase sensitivity affected when the photons are completely distinguishable at\nthe detectors and therefore do not interfere? In other words, which role does\nmultiphoton interference play in these schemes? Here, we show that for small\nphase values the phase sensitivity achievable in the proposed schemes with\nindistinguishable photons is enhanced only by a constant factor with respect to\nthe case of completely distinguishable photons at the detectors. Interestingly,\nthis enhancement arises from the interference of only a polynomial number (in\nn) of the total n! multiphoton path amplitudes in the n-port interferometer.\nThese results are independent of the number n of single photons and of the\nphase weight factors employed at each interferometer channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 20:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

Our main\ncontribution is to present the first deep learning-based system that estimates\naccurate poses for partly occluded objects from RGB-D and RGB input.

The first step localizes all known objects in the image\nusing an instance segmentation network, and hence eliminates surrounding\nclutter and occluders. The second step densely maps pixels to 3D object surface\npositions, so called object coordinates, using an encoder-decoder network, and\nhence eliminates object appearance.

Specifically, SP-AEN prevents the semantic loss by\nintroducing an independent visual-to-semantic space embedder which disentangles\nthe semantic space into two subspaces for the two arguably conflicting\nobjectives: classification and reconstruction. Through adversarial learning of\nthe two subspaces, SP-AEN can transfer the semantics from the reconstructive\nsubspace to the discriminative one, accomplishing the improved zero-shot\nrecognition of unseen classes. Comparing with prior works, SP-AEN can not only\nimprove classification but also generate photo-realistic images, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of semantic preservation.

Effective approaches for\nsuch problems however require the ability to recognize the plans of agents from\nvideo information. Although traditional plan recognition algorithms depend on\naccess to sophisticated planning domain models, one recent promising direction\ninvolves learning approximated (or shallow) domain models directly from the\nobserved activity sequences DUP. One limitation is that such approaches expect\nobserved action sequences as inputs. In many cases involving vision/sensing\nfrom raw data, there is considerable uncertainty about the specific action at\nany given time point. The most we can expect in such cases is probabilistic\ninformation about the action at that point. The input will then be sequences of\nsuch observed action distributions.

Such an interface works like\na bridge between the low-level perception module, and the high-level plan\nrecognition module. We propose two approaches. The first involves resampling\nthe distribution sequences to single action sequences, from which we could\nlearn an action affinity model based on learned action (word) embeddings for\nplan recognition.

Our phase-field free-energy functional\nincludes the surface energy, solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy,\nand electrostatic interaction energy that is described by the Coulomb-field\napproximation, all coupled together self-consistently through a phase field. By\nintroducing a new phase-field term in the description of the solute-solvent van\nder Waals and electrostatic interactions, we can keep the phase-field values\ncloser to those describing the solute and solvent regions, respectively, making\nit more accurate in the free-energy estimate. We first prove that our\nphase-field functionals $\\Gamma$-converge to the corresponding sharp-interface\nlimit.

Namely we extend Kostant's Whittaker description of Z to\nthe action of a commutative quantum groupoid Wh, the bi-Whittaker Hamiltonian\nreduction of $D_G$, which also integrates all quantum Hamiltonian systems\ncoming from the action of Z. These actions come from a braided tensor functor,\nthe quantum Ng\\^o map, from the W-category (modules for Wh) to\nadjoint-equivariant D-modules on G, giving a categorical family of G-invariant\ncommuting operators on any strong G-category. This action also leads to a\nnotion of Langlands parameters for categorical representations of G, refined\ncentral character for character sheaves, and a new symmetry of homology of\ncharacter varieties.\n  We derive our construction as the Langlands dual form of a simple symmetry\nprinciple for groupoids. Namely the symmetric monoidal category of equivariant\nsheaves (modules for the groupoid algebra) acts centrally on the corresponding\nconvolution category. In particular modules for the nil-Hecke algebra for any\nKac-Moody group act centrally on the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke category. We\ndeduce both the Ng\\^o action and its quantization from the case of the\nLanglands dual equivariant affine Grassmannian using the renormalized Geometric\nSatake theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 23:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

The gyrokinetic model is posed in a four-dimensional\nphase space, upon which a grid is imposed when discretized. To mitigate the\ncomputational cost associated with high-dimensional grids, we employ a\nhigh-order discretization to reduce the grid size needed to achieve a given\nlevel of accuracy relative to lower-order methods. Strong anisotropy induced by\nthe magnetic field motivates the use of mapped coordinate grids aligned with\nmagnetic flux surfaces.

As the rank norm penalty in an LRMR is\nNP-hard to compute, the nuclear norm (or the trace norm for a positive\nsemidefinite (PSD) matrix) has been often employed as a convex relaxation of\nthe rank norm. However, solving a nuclear norm convex problem may lead to a\nsuboptimal solution of the original rank norm problem. In this paper, we\npropose to apply a family of nonconvex penalties on the singular values of the\ncovariance matrix as the sparsity metrics to approximate the rank norm. In\nparticular, we formulate a nonconvex minimization problem and solve it by using\na locally convergent iterative reweighted strategy in order to enhance the\nsparsity and resolution.

Due to the huge number of products available online, it is\ninfeasible to enumerate and test the compatibility and functionality of every\nproduct. In this paper, we address two closely related problems: product\ncompatibility analysis and function satisfiability analysis, where the second\nproblem is a generalization of the first problem (e.g., whether a product works\nwith another product can be considered as a special function). We first\nidentify a novel question and answering corpus that is up-to-date regarding\nproduct compatibility and functionality information. To allow automatic\ndiscovery product compatibility and functionality, we then propose a deep\nlearning model called Dual Attention Network (DAN). Given a QA pair for a\nto-be-purchased product, DAN learns to 1) discover complementary products (or\nfunctions), and 2) accurately predict the actual compatibility (or\nsatisfiability) of the discovered products (or functions). The challenges\naddressed by the model include the briefness of QAs, linguistic patterns\nindicating compatibility, and the appropriate fusion of questions and answers.\nWe conduct experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively show that the\nidentified products and functions have both high coverage and accuracy,\ncompared with a wide spectrum of baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 03:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

We propose an ADC bit allocation (BA) algorithm that solves a minimum\nmean squared quantization error problem under a power constraint. Unlike\nexisting BA methods that only consider an ADC power constraint, the proposed\nalgorithm regards total receiver power constraint for a hybrid analog-digital\nbeamforming architecture. The major challenge is the non-linearities in the\nminimization problem. To address this issue, we first convert the problem into\na convex optimization problem through real number relaxation and substitution\nof ADC resolution switching power with constant average switching power. Then,\nwe derive a closed-form solution by fixing the number of activated radio\nfrequency (RF) chains M. Leveraging the solution, the binary search finds the\noptimal M and its corresponding optimal solution. We also provide an off-line\ntraining and modeling approach to estimate the average switching power.\nSimulation results validate the spectral and energy efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm. In particular, existing state-of-the-art digital beamformers can be\nused in the system in conjunction with the BA algorithm as it makes the\nquantization error negligible in the low-resolution regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 03:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

Many\ncandidates have been proposed, such as supernovae and low mass X-ray binaries.\nHowever, these models are difficult to reconcile with the distribution of\npositrons, which are highly concentrated in the Galactic bulge, and therefore\nrequire specific propagation of the positrons through the interstellar medium.\nAlternative sources include dark matter decay, or the supermassive black hole,\nboth of which would have a naturally high bulge-to-disc ratio.\n  The chief difficulty in reconciling models with the observations is the\nintrinsically poor angular resolution of gamma-ray observations, which cannot\nresolve point sources. Essentially all of the positrons annihilate via the\nformation of positronium. This gives rise to the possibility of observing\nrecombination lines of positronium emitted before the atom annihilates. These\nemission lines would be in the UV and the NIR, giving an increase in angular\nresolution of a factor of 10^4 compared to gamma ray observations, and allowing\nthe discrimination between point sources and truly diffuse emission.\n  Analogously to the formation of positronium, it is possible to form atoms of\ntrue muonium and true tauonium. Since muons and tauons are intrinsically\nunstable, the formation of such leptonium atoms will be localised to their\nplaces of origin. Thus observations of true muonium or true tauonium can\nprovide another way to distinguish between truly diffuse sources such as dark\nmatter decay, and an unresolved distribution of point sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 03:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This mainly arises\nfrom that the representation of pixel-level image usually lacks of high-level\nsemantic information as in its matched sentence. In this work, we propose a\nsemantic-enhanced image and sentence matching model, which can improve the\nimage representation by learning semantic concepts and then organizing them in\na correct semantic order. Given an image, we first use a multi-regional\nmulti-label CNN to predict its semantic concepts, including objects,\nproperties, actions, etc. Then, considering that different orders of semantic\nconcepts lead to diverse semantic meanings, we use a context-gated sentence\ngeneration scheme for semantic order learning. It simultaneously uses the image\nglobal context containing concept relations as reference and the groundtruth\nsemantic order in the matched sentence as supervision. After obtaining the\nimproved image representation, we learn the sentence representation with a\nconventional LSTM, and then jointly perform image and sentence matching and\nsentence generation for model learning.

Supercritical BH accretion is relatively easy, since BH can\nswallow excess radiation energy, so that radiation flux can be inward in its\nvicinity. This mechanism can never work for NS which has a solid surface. In\nfact, we find that the radiation force is always outward. Instead, we found\nsignificant reduction in the mass accretion rate due to strong\nradiation-pressure driven outflow. The radiation flux $F_\\mathrm{rad}$ is\nself-regulated such that the radiation force balances with the sum of gravity\nand centrifugal forces. Even when the radiation energy density much exceeds\nthat expected from the Eddington luminosity $E_\\mathrm{rad} \\simeq\nF_\\mathrm{rad}\\tau/c> 10^2 L_\\mathrm{Edd}/(4\\pi r^2 c)$, the radiation flux is\nalways kept below the certain value which makes it possible not to blow all the\ngas away from the disk.

However, when the model is CPU-intensive and\nhigh-dimensional, the computational cost of MCMC simulation will be\nprohibitive. In this situation, a CPU-efficient while less accurate\nlow-fidelity model (e.g., a numerical model with a coarser discretization, or a\ndata-driven surrogate) is usually adopted. Nowadays, multi-fidelity simulation\nmethods that can take advantage of both the efficiency of the low-fidelity\nmodel and the accuracy of the high-fidelity model are gaining popularity. In\nthe MCMC simulation, as the posterior distribution of the unknown model\nparameters is the region of interest, it is wise to distribute most of the\ncomputational budget (i.e., the high-fidelity model evaluations) therein. Based\non this idea, in this paper we propose an adaptive multi-fidelity MCMC\nalgorithm for efficient inverse modeling of hydrologic systems. In this method,\nwe evaluate the high-fidelity model mainly in the posterior region through\niteratively running MCMC based on a Gaussian process (GP) system that is\nadaptively constructed with multi-fidelity simulation. The error of the GP\nsystem is rigorously considered in the MCMC simulation and gradually reduced to\na negligible level in the posterior region.

The\ncalculated kinetic isotope effects are explained in terms of difference in\nactivation and delocalization. All rate constants are calculated at the\nUCCSD(T)-F12/cc-VTZ-F12 level of theory. Finally, we show that the energetics\nof the reaction is only affected to a small extent by the presence of H$_2$O or\nH$_2$S molecular clusters that simulate an ice surface, calculated at the\nMPWB1K/def2-TZVP level of theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 09:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

The mechanisms producing their unpredictable\nvariability are debated and include injection, acceleration and cooling of\nparticles, with possible intervention of shock waves or turbulence.

Both theoretical and practical aspects are considered with three main\nresults reported. The first one is about a Dynamic Programming algorithm which\nsolves the F3Cmax problem in O*(3^n) time and space. The algorithm is easily\ngeneralized to other flowshop problems and single machine scheduling problems.\nThe second contribution is about a search tree method called Branch & Merge\nwhich solves the 1||SumTi problem with the time complexity converging to\nO*(2^n) and in polynomial space. Our third contribution aims to improve the\npractical efficiency of exact search tree algorithms solving scheduling\nproblems. First we realized that a better way to implement the idea of Branch &\nMerge is to use a technique called Memorization. By the finding of a new\nalgorithmic paradox and the implementation of a memory cleaning strategy, the\nmethod succeeded to solve instances with 300 more jobs with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for the 1||SumTi problem. Then the treatment is\nextended to another three problems 1|ri|SumCi, 1|dtilde|SumwiCi and F2||SumCi.\nThe results of the four problems all together show the power of the\nMemorization paradigm when applied on sequencing problems.

This design of encoder yields relatively uniform\ncomposition on source sentence, despite the gating mechanism employed in\nencoding RNN. On the other hand, we often hope the decoder to take pieces of\nsource sentence at varying levels suiting its own linguistic structure: for\nexample, we may want to take the entity name in its raw form while taking an\nidiom as a perfectly composed unit. Motivated by this demand, we propose\nMulti-channel Encoder (MCE), which enhances encoding components with different\nlevels of composition. More specifically, in addition to the hidden state of\nencoding RNN, MCE takes 1) the original word embedding for raw encoding with no\ncomposition, and 2) a particular design of external memory in Neural Turing\nMachine (NTM) for more complex composition, while all three encoding strategies\nare properly blended during decoding.

Finding such a reference state was recently shown to be a linear\nassignment problem, and therefore exactly solvable. However, this is\ncomputationally extremely expensive, so there has been much interest in\ndeveloping heuristic methods for computing MAPE in practice. Comparisons of the\naccuracy of such approximate algorithms have so far been limited to a small\nnumber of test cases; this work provides an assessment of the algorithms'\nperformance across a wide range of atmospheric soundings, in two different\nlocations. We determine that the divide-and-conquer algorithm is the best\nsuited to practical application, but suffers from the previously overlooked\nshortcoming that it can produce a reference state with higher potential energy\nthan the actual state, resulting in a negative value of MAPE. Additionally, we\nshow that it is possible to construct an algorithm exploiting a theoretical\nexpression linking MAPE to Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)\npreviously derived by Kerry Emanuel. This approach has a similar accuracy to\nexisting approximate sorting algorithms, whilst providing greater insight into\nthe physical source of MAPE. In light of these results, we discuss how to make\nprogress towards constructing a satisfactory moist APE theory for the\natmosphere.

The same problem has been\nstudied extensively in cylinders where the precessing flow is characterized by\nthree key parameters: the Ekman number $E$, the Poincar$\\acute{\\mathrm e}$\nnumber $Po$ and the radius-height aspect ratio $\\Gamma$. While in an annulus,\nthere is another parameter, the inner-radius-height aspect ratio $\\Upsilon$,\nwhich also plays an important role in controlling the structure and evolution\nof the flow. By decomposing the nonlinear solution into a set of inertial\nmodes, we demonstrate the properties of both weakly and moderately precessing\nflows. It is found that, when the precessional force is weak, the flow is\nstable with a constant amplitude of kinetic energy. As the precessional force\nincreases, our simulation suggests that the nonlinear interaction between the\nboundary effects and the inertial modes can trigger more turbulence,\nintroducing a transitional regime of rich dynamics to disordered flow. The\ninertial mode $\\bm u_{111}$, followed by $\\bm u_{113}$ or $\\bm u_{112}$, always\ndominates the precessing flow when $0.001\\leq Po\\leq 0.05$, ranging from weak\nto moderate precession. Moreover, the precessing flow in an annulus shows more\nstability than in a cylinder which is likely to be caused by the effect of the\ninner boundary that restricts the growth of resonant and non-resonant inertial\nmodes. Furthermore, the mechanism of triadic resonance is not found in the\ntransitional regime from the laminar to disordered flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 11:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This\nallows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity\nprovides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the\nspatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of\nremoved fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be\nconsidered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of\nimportance of visual elements for human observers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 11:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

An arrangement is\ncircularizable if there is a combinatorially equivalent arrangement of circles.\n  In this paper we present the results of the first thorough study of\ncircularizability.

The central bank can purchase\nand sell the foreign currency, and each intervention on the exchange market\nleads to a proportional cost whose instantaneous marginal value depends on the\ncurrent level of the exchange rate. The central bank aims at minimizing the\ntotal expected costs of interventions on the exchange market, plus a total\nexpected holding cost. We formulate this problem as an infinite time-horizon\nstochastic control problem with controls that have paths which are locally of\nbounded variation. The exchange rate evolves as a general linearly controlled\none-dimensional diffusion, and the two nondecreasing processes giving the\nminimal decomposition of a bounded-variation control model the cumulative\namount of foreign currency that has been purchased and sold by the central\nbank. We provide a complete solution to this problem by finding the explicit\nexpression of the value function and a complete characterization of the optimal\ncontrol. At each instant of time, the optimally controlled exchange rate is\nkept within a band whose size is endogenously determined as part of the\nsolution to the problem. We also study the expected exit time from the band,\nand the sensitivity of the width of the band with respect to the model's\nparameters in the case when the exchange rate evolves (in absence of any\nintervention) as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and the marginal costs of\ncontrols are constant. The techniques employed in the paper are those of the\ntheory of singular stochastic control and of one-dimensional diffusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 12:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

The\ndetection manners are evolving from axis-aligned rectangle to rotated rectangle\nand further to quadrangle. However, current datasets contain very little curve\ntext, which can be widely observed in scene images such as signboard, product\nname and so on. To raise the concerns of reading curve text in the wild, in\nthis paper, we construct a curve text dataset named CTW1500, which includes\nover 10k text annotations in 1,500 images (1000 for training and 500 for\ntesting). Based on this dataset, we pioneering propose a polygon based curve\ntext detector (CTD) which can directly detect curve text without empirical\ncombination. Moreover, by seamlessly integrating the recurrent transverse and\nlongitudinal offset connection (TLOC), the proposed method can be end-to-end\ntrainable to learn the inherent connection among the position offsets. This\nallows the CTD to explore context information instead of predicting points\nindependently, resulting in more smooth and accurate detection. We also propose\ntwo simple but effective post-processing methods named non-polygon suppress\n(NPS) and polygonal non-maximum suppression (PNMS) to further improve the\ndetection accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed approach in this paper is\ndesigned in an universal manner, which can also be trained with rectangular or\nquadrilateral bounding boxes without extra efforts. Experimental results on\nCTW-1500 demonstrate our method with only a light backbone can outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods with a large margin. By evaluating only in the curve\nor non-curve subset, the CTD + TLOC can still achieve the best results.

It has recently been pointed out that large individual\nactive regions with atypical properties can have a significant impact on the\nlong term behaviour of solar activity. We investigate this possibility in more\ndetail using a recently developed 2$\\times$2D dynamo model of the solar\nmagnetic cycle. We find that even a single \"rogue\" bipolar magnetic region\n(BMR) in the simulations can have a major effect on the further development of\nsolar activity cycles, boosting or suppressing the amplitude of subsequent\ncycles. In extreme cases an individual BMR can completely halt the dynamo,\ntriggering a grand minimum. Rogue BMRs also have the potential to induce\nsignificant hemispheric asymmetries in the solar cycle. To study the effect of\nrogue BMRs in a more systematic manner, a series of dynamo simulations were\nconducted, in which a large test BMR was manually introduced in the model at\nvarious phases of cycles of different amplitudes. BMRs emerging in the rising\nphase of a cycle can modify the amplitude of the ongoing cycle while BMRs\nemerging in later phases will only impact subsequent cycles. In this model, the\nstrongest impact on the subsequent cycle occurs when the rogue BMR emerges\naround cycle maximum at low latitudes but the BMR does not need to be strictly\ncross-equatorial. Active regions emerging as far as $20^{\\circ}$ from the\nequator can still have a significant impact. We demonstrate that the combined\neffect of the magnetic flux, tilt angle and polarity separation of the BMR on\nthe dynamo is via their contribution to the dipole moment, $\\delta\nD_{\\mathrm{BMR}}$. Our results indicate that prediction of the amplitude,\nstarting epoch and duration of a cycle requires an accurate accounting of a\nbroad range of active regions emerging in the previous cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 13:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

Here we utilize the\nTaylor-Couette (TC) geometry, i.e. the flow between two concentric,\nindependently rotating cylinders, to study the effect of air cavities in this\nclosed setup, which is well-accessible for drag measurements and optical flow\nvisualizations. We show that stable air cavities can be formed, and that the\ncavity size increases with Reynolds number and void fraction. The streamwise\ncavity length strongly depends on the axial position due to buoyancy forces\nacting on the air. Strong secondary flows, which are introduced by a\ncounter-rotating outer cylinder, clearly decrease the stability of the\ncavities, as air is captured in the Taylor rolls rather than in the cavity.\nSurprisingly, we observed that local air injection is not necessary to sustain\nthe air cavities; as long as air is present in the system it is found to be\ncaptured in the cavity. We show that the drag is decreased significantly as\ncompared to the case without air, but with the geometric modifications imposed\non the TC system by the cavitators. As the void fraction increases, the drag of\nthe system is decreased. However, the cavitators itself significantly increase\nthe drag due to their hydrodynamic resistance (pressure drag): In fact, a net\ndrag increase is found when compared to the standard smooth-wall TC case.\nTherefore, one must first overcome the added drag created by the cavitators\nbefore one obtains a net drag reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 15:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 10:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

An alternative to new elementary particles\npostulates DM as made of macroscopic compact halo objects (MACHO) such as black\nholes formed in the very early universe. Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

These results are robust against\ncosmological parameters, outlier rejection, correlated noise and selection\nbias. PBHs and other MACHOs are therefore ruled out as the dominant form of DM\nfor objects associated to LIGO gravitational wave detections.

However, as the size of datasets and the depth of\nneural network architectures continue to grow, it is imperative to design\nhigh-performance and energy-efficient computing hardware for training CNNs. In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of designing specialized CPU-GPU based\nheterogeneous manycore systems for energy-efficient training of CNNs. It has\nalready been shown that the typical on-chip communication infrastructures\nemployed in conventional CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms are\nunable to handle both CPU and GPU communication requirements efficiently. To\naddress this issue, we first analyze the on-chip traffic patterns that arise\nfrom the computational processes associated with training two deep CNN\narchitectures, namely, LeNet and CDBNet, to perform image classification. By\nleveraging this knowledge, we design a hybrid Network-on-Chip (NoC)\narchitecture, which consists of both wireline and wireless links, to improve\nthe performance of CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms running the\nabove-mentioned CNN training workloads. The proposed NoC achieves 1.8x\nreduction in network latency and improves the network throughput by a factor of\n2.2 for training CNNs, when compared to a highly-optimized wireline mesh NoC.\nFor the considered CNN workloads, these network-level improvements translate\ninto 25% savings in full-system energy-delay-product (EDP). This demonstrates\nthat the proposed hybrid NoC for heterogeneous manycore architectures is\ncapable of significantly accelerating training of CNNs while remaining\nenergy-efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 18:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

However, these existing techniques\nmainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent\nand static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode\nher preference without considering the particular characteristics of each\ncandidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully\ncapture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware\nuser-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL.\nNamely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on\ntheir individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL\nadopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature\ninteractions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction.\nSpecifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit\nreview data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning\nand interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component,\nwith convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for\na user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding\nreviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be\ncomprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts\ncomplementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of\nuser-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear\nfusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL\nachieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing\nstate-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the\nrelevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 08:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 17:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 06:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 06:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input\nbits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing\ncounterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay\nare reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR\ngate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based\non the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode\nand correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and\ncorrection, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is\nalways converted using a binary to BCD converter.

It is a follow-up\nof the work [H. Ammari et al., Reconstructing fine details of small objects by\nusing plasmonic spectroscopic data, SIAM J. Imag.

In that regime, it was shown\nthat the presence of the target object induces small shifts to the resonant\nfrequencies of the plasmonic particle. These shifts, which can be determined\nfrom the far field data, encodes the contracted generalized polarization\ntensors of the target object, from which one can perform reconstruction beyond\nthe usual resolution limit. The main argument is based on perturbation theory.\nHowever, the same argument is no longer applicable in the strong interaction\nregime as considered in this paper due to the large shift induced by strong\nfield interaction between the particles. We develop a novel technique based on\nconformal mapping theory to overcome this difficulty. The key is to design a\nconformal mapping which transforms the two particle system into a shell-core\nstructure, in which the inner dielectric core corresponds to the target object.\nWe show that a perturbation argument can be used to analyze the shift in the\nresonant frequencies due to the presence of the inner dielectric core. This\nshift also encodes information of the contracted polarization tensors of the\ncore, from which one can reconstruct its shape, and hence the target object.\nOur theoretical findings are supplemented by a variety of numerical results\nbased on an efficient optimal control algorithm.

One foundation for the concept of basic potentials and auxiliary\nfields consists of examples where two sets of gauge-related fields are such\nthat one is physical and the other is erroneous, with the information for the\nproper choice supplied by the potentials. A major consequence is that a change\nof gauge is not a unitary transformation in quantum mechanics; a principle\nheretofore unchallenged. The primacy of potentials over fields leads to the\nconcept of a hierarchy of physical quantities, where potentials and energies\nare primary, while fields and forces are secondary. Secondary quantities\nprovide less information than do primary quantities. Some criteria by which\nstrong laser fields are judged are based on secondary quantities, making it\npossible to arrive at inappropriate conclusions. This is exemplified by several\nfield-related misconceptions as diverse as the behavior of charged particles in\nvery low frequency propagating fields, and the fundamental problem of pair\nproduction at very high intensities. In each case, an approach based on\npotentials gives appropriate results, free of ambiguities. The examples\nencompass classical and quantum phenomena, in relativistic and nonrelativistic\nconditions. This is a major extension of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect,\nboth in supporting the primacy of potentials over fields, and also in showing\nhow field-based conceptions can lead to errors in basic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 12:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 21:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 01:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 15:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 17:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 15:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

This research investigates and\ndiscusses the factors that influence the privacy concerns faced by online\nconsumers of internet services and the possible outcomes of these privacy\nconcerns on the African online market with Ghana being the primary focus.\nResults from this study indicated that only 10.1 percent of respondents felt\nthat the internet was safe for purchase and payment transaction in Ghana.\nHowever, respondents were willing to shop online if e-Commerce was the only\nmeans of getting their products. Respondents also had a high sense of perceived\nvulnerability and their perceived vulnerability to unauthorized data collection\nand misuse of personal information could affect Ghanaian e-Commerce platform\nadoption. The perceived ability of users of e-Commerce platforms in Ghana to\ncontrol data collection and its subsequent use by other third parties was also\nfound to negatively impact customers willingness to wholly transact and share\ntheir personal information online. The perceived vulnerability was found to be\naffected by the high levels of internet illiteracy whiles the perceived ability\nto control the collection of information and use was influenced by both the\ninternet literacy level as well as the level of social awareness of the\nGhanaian internet consumer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 21:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

Here, we\nintroduce the concept of coherently enhanced wireless power transfer. We show\nthat a principle similar to the one underlying the operation of coherent\nperfect absorbers can be employed to improve the overall performance of WPT and\npotentially achieve its dynamic control. The concept relies on coherent\nexcitation of the waveguide connected to the antenna load with a backward\npropagating signal of specific amplitude and phase. This signal creates a\nsuitable interference pattern at the load resulting in a modification of the\nlocal wave impedance, which in turn enables conjugate matching and a largely\nincreased amount of energy extracted to the waveguide. We develop an\nillustrative theoretical model describing this concept, demonstrate it with\nfull-wave numerical simulations for the canonical example of a dipole antenna,\nand verify it experimentally in both near-field and far-field regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 22:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Mobile applications such as\nrobotics and vehicles connecting to cloud and surroundings transfer the\nshort-range on-board sensor perception system to long-range mobile-sensing\nperception system. However, the mobile sensing perception brings new challenges\nfor how to efficiently analyze and intelligently interpret the deluge of IoT\ndata in mission- critical services. In this article, we model the challenges as\nlatency, packet loss and measurement noise which severely deteriorate the\nreliability and quality of IoT data. We integrate the artificial intelligence\ninto IoT to tackle these challenges. We propose a novel architecture that\nleverages recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Kalman filtering to anticipate\nmotions and interac- tions between objects. The basic idea is to learn\nenvironment dynamics by recurrent networks. To improve the robustness of IoT\ncommunication, we use the idea of Kalman filtering and deploy a prediction and\ncorrection step. In this way, the architecture learns to develop a biased\nbelief between prediction and measurement in the different situation. We\ndemonstrate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets with noise that\nmimics the challenges of IoT communications. Our method brings a new level of\nIoT intelligence. It is also lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art\nconvolutional recurrent architecture and is ideally suitable for the\nresource-limited mobile applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 02:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 20:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}
