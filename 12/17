This antisymmetric exchange\ninteraction selects a given chirality for the spin textures and allows\nstabilising configurations with nontrivial topology. Moreover, it has many\ncrucial consequences on the dynamical properties of these topological\nstructures, including chiral domain walls (DWs) and magnetic skyrmions. In the\nrecent years the study of noncollinear spin textures has been extended from\nsingle ultrathin layers to magnetic multilayers with broken inversion symmetry.\nThis extension of the structures in the vertical dimension allows very\nefficient current-induced motion and room-temperature stability for both N\\'eel\nDWs and skyrmions. Here we show how in such multilayered systems the interlayer\ninteractions can actually lead to more complex, hybrid chiral magnetisation\narrangements. The described thickness-dependent reorientation of DWs is\nexperimentally confirmed by studying demagnetised multilayers through circular\ndichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering. We also demonstrate a simple\nyet reliable method for determining the magnitude of the DMI from static\ndomains measurements even in the presence of these hybrid chiral structures, by\ntaking into account the actual profile of the DWs. The advent of these novel\nhybrid chiral textures has far-reaching implications on how to stabilise and\nmanipulate DWs as well as skymionic structures in magnetic multilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 16:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 13:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Fast\nisochoric heating of a pre-compressed plasma core with a high-intensity\nshort-pulse laser is an attractive and alternative approach to create\nultra-high-energy-density states like those found in ICF ignition sparks. This\navoids the ignition quench caused by the hot spark mixing with the surrounding\ncold fuel, which is the crucial problem of the currently pursued ignition\nscheme. High-intensity lasers efficiently produce relativistic electron beams\n(REB). A part of the REB kinetic energy is deposited in the core, and then the\nheated region becomes the hot spark to trigger the ignition. However, only a\nsmall portion of the REB collides with the core because of its large\ndivergence. Here we have demonstrated enhanced laser-to-core energy coupling\nwith the magnetized fast isochoric heating. The method employs a\nkilo-tesla-level magnetic field that is applied to the transport region from\nthe REB generation point to the core which results in guiding the REB along the\nmagnetic field lines to the core. 7.7 $\\pm$ 1.3 % of the maximum coupling was\nachieved even with a relatively small radial area density core ($\\rho R$ $\\sim$\n0.1 g/cm$^2$).

A recent beautiful result of Saptharishi,\nShpilka and Volk showed that for binary Reed-Muller codes of length $n$ and\ndistance $d = O(1)$, one can correct $\\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ random errors\nin $\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time (which is well beyond the worst-case error\ntolerance of $O(1)$).\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of `syndrome decoding' Reed-Muller\ncodes from random errors. More specifically, given the\n$\\operatorname{polylog}(n)$-bit long syndrome vector of a codeword corrupted in\n$\\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ random coordinates, we would like to compute the\nlocations of the codeword corruptions. This problem turns out to be equivalent\nto a basic question about computing tensor decomposition of random low-rank\ntensors over finite fields.\n  Our main result is that syndrome decoding of Reed-Muller codes (and the\nequivalent tensor decomposition problem) can be solved efficiently, i.e., in\n$\\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ time.

A single, repeatable wave maker motion\nproducing a breaker with a nominal wavelength of 1.18 m is used.

The surface profile measurements and the impact pressure\nmeasurements are synchronized. When the cube is positioned vertically so that\nits bottom face is at either $0.5L$ or $0.25L$ below the undisturbed water\nsurface, the water surface profile behaviors are basically similar with a\nnearly circular arc forming between the water contact point on the front face\nof the cube and the wave crest.

Therefore, we introduce\nHDM to evaluate the interparticle interactions instead of popular CDM, and\npropose a pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann model based on\nhigh-order difference method. The present model not only retains the advantages\nof the pseudopotential model, such as easy implementation, high efficiency,\nfull parallelism and so on, but also achieves higher accuracies.

The equation is discretized as an indefinite linear system, which is\ndifficult to solve at high wave numbers. In many applications, the solution of\nthe Helmholtz equation is required for a point source. In this case, it is\npossible to reformulate the equation as two separate equations: one for the\ntravel time of the wave and one for its amplitude. The travel time is obtained\nby a solution of the factored eikonal equation, and the amplitude is obtained\nby solving a complex-valued advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation. The\nreformulated equation is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, and the\ndifferences between the numerical solutions of these equations arise only from\ndiscretization errors. We develop an efficient multigrid solver for obtaining\nthe amplitude given the travel time, which can be efficiently computed. This\napproach is advantageous because the amplitude is typically smooth in this\ncase, and hence, more suitable for multigrid solvers than the standard\nHelmholtz discretization. We demonstrate that our second order ADR\ndiscretization is more accurate than the standard second order discretization\nat high wave numbers, as long as there are no reflections or caustics.\nMoreover, we show that using our approach, the problem can be solved more\nefficiently than using the common shifted Laplacian multigrid approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 11:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

If this instability does exist, how far is it from reality? The\npresent work is devoted to answering these questions. To this end, we derive a\nunified macroscopic theory of SPWs that applies to any type of electron\ndynamics, be they local or non-local, classical or quantum-mechanical. In light\nof this theory, we analyze the behaviors of SPWs according to several electron\ndynamics models, including the widely used local dielectric model (DM), the\nhydrodynamic model (HDM) and the specular reflection model (SRM), in addition\nto the less common semi-classical model (SCM).

Railway signals differ a lot from road\nsignals in terms of shapes and rules for placement with respect to track. Due\nto space constraint and traffic densities in urban areas signals are not placed\non the same side of the track and multiple lines can run in parallel. Hence\nthere is need to associate signal detected with the track on which the train\nruns. We present a method to associate the signals to the specific track they\nbelong to using a video feed from the front facing camera mounted on the lead\nlocomotive. A pipeline of track detection, region of interest selection, signal\ndetection has been implemented which gives an overall accuracy of 94.7% on a\nroute covering 150km with 247 signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 13:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

It is shown that the electronic and photonic phase diagrams of\nthe patterned electron gas are strictly related. In particular, the system has\na trivial photonic topology when the inversion symmetry is the prevalent broken\nsymmetry, whereas it has a nontrivial photonic topology for a dominant broken\ntime-reversal symmetry, similar to the electronic case. To confirm these\npredictions, we numerically demonstrate the emergence of topologically\nprotected unidirectional electromagnetic edge-states at the interface with a\ntrivial photonic material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 15:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

In these settings, machine-learning algorithms can become very\ncomputationally demanding, as they may require matching the test samples\nagainst a very large set of reference prototypes. To mitigate this issue,\ndifferent approaches have been developed to reduce the number of required\nreference prototypes. Current reduction approaches select a small subset of\nrepresentative prototypes in the space induced by the similarity measure, and\nthen separately train the classification function on the reduced subset.\nHowever, decoupling these two steps may not allow reducing the number of\nprototypes effectively without compromising accuracy. We overcome this\nlimitation by jointly learning the classification function along with an\noptimal set of virtual prototypes, whose number can be either fixed a priori or\noptimized according to application-specific criteria. Creating a super-sparse\nset of virtual prototypes provides much sparser solutions, drastically reducing\ncomplexity at test time, at the expense of a slightly increased complexity\nduring training. A much smaller set of prototypes also results in\neasier-to-interpret decisions. We empirically show that our approach can reduce\nup to ten times the complexity of Support Vector Machines, LASSO and ridge\nregression at test time, without almost affecting their classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

Friction\ninvolves paradoxes, such as the Painlev\\'e paradoxes of non-existence or\nnon-uniqueness of solutions in mechanical systems of rigid bodies with dry\nfriction. These paradoxes can be treated by introducing ternary logic with the\nthree basic states: rest-motion-undefined. When elastic deformation is\nintroduced, the paradoxical solutions correspond to frictional instabilities\nleading to rest-motion-unstable as three states of a system. The dynamic\nevolution of a frictional interface towards a limit cycle can be viewed as a\nprocess of erasing the information about the interface due to the\ninstabilities. Furthermore, while friction force is universal, it is not\ntreated as a fundamental force and can be considered as an epiphenomenon of\nvarious synergetic mechanisms. This further relates friction to other surface\neffects, including the capillarity, with its binary logic of wetting states and\na possibility of droplet computation for lab-on-a-chip microfluidic reactors.\nWe discuss the logical foundation of biomimetic superhydrophobic surface design\nand how it is different from the conventional design.
