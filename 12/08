Here, we present a unified and intuitive physical\npicture of the ultrafast carrier dynamics and the photoconductivity, combining\noptical pump - terahertz probe measurements on a gate-tunable graphene device,\nwith numerical calculations using the Boltzmann equation. We distinguish two\ntypes of ultrafast photo-induced carrier heating processes: At low\n(equilibrium) Fermi energy ($E_{\\rm F} \\lesssim$ 0.1 eV for our experiments)\nbroadening of the carrier distribution involves interband transitions -\ninterband heating. At higher Fermi energy ($E_{\\rm F} \\gtrsim$ 0.15 eV)\nbroadening of the carrier distribution involves intraband transitions -\nintraband heating. Under certain conditions, additional electron-hole pairs can\nbe created (carrier multiplication) for low $E_{\\rm F}$, and hot carriers\n(hot-carrier multiplication) for higher $E_{\\rm F}$. The resultant\nphotoconductivity is positive (negative) for low (high) $E_{\\rm F}$, which\noriginates from the effect of the heated carrier distributions on the screening\nof impurities, consistent with the DC conductivity being mostly due to impurity\nscattering. The importance of these insights is highlighted by a discussion of\nthe implications for graphene photodetector applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 16:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

We run a suite of N-body\nsimulations with different initial linear matter power spectra to show that,\nonce the system undergoes nonlinear evolution, the shape of the linear power\nspectrum at high wavenumbers does not affect the non-linear power spectrum,\nwhile it still matters for the halo mass function.

Indeed, $\\mathrm{LiH}$\ncooling would only be marginally significant in shocked primordial gas for the\nhighly unlikely case that the $\\mathrm{LiH}$ abundance were increased by nine\norders of magnitude, implying that $all$ lithium would have to be converted\ninto $\\mathrm{LiH}$. In this study, photo-destruction processes are not\nconsidered, and the collisional disassociation rate of $\\mathrm{LiH}$ is\npossibly underestimated, rendering our results an extreme upper limit.\nTherefore, the cooling by $\\mathrm{LiH}$ can safely be neglected for the\nthermal evolution of Population~III star-forming gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 18:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 19:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

We find that on\naverage one third of the initial crust is stripped from embryos as they\naccrete, which leads to a reduction of ~20% in the budgets of the heat\nproducing elements if the stripped crust does not reaccrete. Erosion of crusts\ncan lead to non-chondritic ratios of incompatible elements, but the magnitude\nof this effect depends sensitively on the details of the crust-forming melting\nprocess.

If only AGN\nfeedback is considered, as soon as the SMBH reaches a critical mass, strong\noutflows of hot gas are launched and prevent the cooling halo gas from reaching\nthe disk, thus efficiently halting star formation, leading to the so-called\n\"quenching\". If both feedback mechanisms act in tandem, we observe a non-linear\ncoupling, in the sense that the dense gas in the supernovae-powered galactic\nfountain is propelled by the hot outflow powered by the AGN at much larger\nradii than without AGN. We argue that these particular outflows are able to\nunbind dense gas from the galactic halo, thanks to the combined effect of SN\nand AGN feedback. We speculate that this mechanism occurs at the end of the\nfast growing phase of SMBH, and is at the origin of the dense molecular\noutflows observed in many massive high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 08:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

However, there are cases where this is\nnot possible because the graph is \\textit{hidden} or \\textit{implicit}, meaning\nthat the edges are not recorded explicitly in the form of an adjacency\nrepresentation. In such a case, the only alternative is to pose a sequence of\n\\textit{edge probing queries} asking for the existence or not of a particular\ngraph edge. However, checking all possible node pairs is costly (quadratic on\nthe number of nodes).

In order to maximize the detection rate of HCI instruments and survey\ncampaigns, advanced algorithms with higher sensitivities to faint companions\nare needed, especially for the speckle-dominated innermost region of the\nimages.

The services included in this\nstudy were crop provisioning, beekeeping and honey production, fodder and\nlivestock production, crop pollination, air quality regulation, and aesthetic\nES. This assessment develops different spatial models, which make use of\navailable datasets, causal relationships between datasets, including a\ngenerated land use land cover (LULC) map, and statistical models and indicators\nbased on direct measurements. Individual ES indicators were mapped to visualise\nand compare their spatial patterns across the case study area. Subsequently, an\nanalysis of ES associations and bundles was carried out using Pearson\nparametric correlation test, for both ES capacity and flow indicators generated\nfrom this study, and through Principal Component Analysis. Results demonstrate\nseveral significant synergistic interactions between ES capacity and flow in\nrural landscapes characterised with agricultural and semi-natural LULC\ncategories, indicating high landscape multifunctionality. In contrast,\npredominantly urban areas tend to be characterised with a low ecosystem\ncapacity and ES flow, suggesting that ES delivery in the landscapes of the\nstudy area is determined by land use intensity. These findings support the\nnotion that multifunctional rural landscapes provide multiple ES, making an\nimportant contribution to human well-being, and that land use planning that\ndevelops green infrastructure in urban areas can significantly contribute to\nsupport biodiversity and ES delivery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 20:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

These DFTs are then analyzed\nqualitatively and quantitatively using stochastic or algebraic methods to judge\nthe failure characteristics of the given system in terms of the failures of its\nsub-components. Model checking has been recently proposed to conduct the\nfailure analysis of systems using DFTs with the motivation to provide a\nrigorous failure analysis of safety-critical systems. However, model checking\nhas not been used for the DFT qualitative analysis and the reduction algorithms\nused in model checking are usually not formally verified. Moreover, the\nanalysis time grows exponentially with the increase of the number of states.\nThese issues limit the usefulness of model checking for analyzing complex\nsystems used in safety-critical domains, where the accuracy and completeness of\nanalysis matters the most. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\ncomprehensive methodology to perform the qualitative and quantitative analysis\nof DFTs using an integration of theorem proving and model checking based\napproaches. For this purpose, we formalized all the basic dynamic fault tree\ngates using higher-order logic based on the algebraic approach and formally\nverified some of the simplification properties.

We then investigate the constraining power of the clustering\nratio when cosmological parameters such as the total neutrino mass and the\nequation of state of dark energy are left free. We analyse the joint posterior\ndistribution of the parameters that must satisfy, at the same time, the\nmeasurements of the galaxy clustering ratio in the SDSS DR12, and the angular\npower spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB measured\nby the Planck satellite. We find the clustering ratio to be very sensitive to\nthe CDM density parameter, but not very much so to the total neutrino mass.\nLastly, we forecast the constraining power the clustering ratio will achieve\nwith forthcoming surveys, predicting the amplitude of its errors in a\nEuclid-like galaxy survey. In this case, we find it is expected to improve the\nconstraint at 95% level on the CDM density by 40% and on the total neutrino\nmass by 14%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 23:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

The degree to which a\nstory resonates with its audience may be in part reflected in the emotional\njourney it takes the audience upon. In this paper, we use machine learning\nmethods to construct emotional arcs in movies, calculate families of arcs, and\ndemonstrate the ability for certain arcs to predict audience engagement. The\nsystem is applied to Hollywood films and high quality shorts found on the web.\nWe begin by using deep convolutional neural networks for audio and visual\nsentiment analysis. These models are trained on both new and existing\nlarge-scale datasets, after which they can be used to compute separate audio\nand visual emotional arcs. We then crowdsource annotations for 30-second video\nclips extracted from highs and lows in the arcs in order to assess the\nmicro-level precision of the system, with precision measured in terms of\nagreement in polarity between the system's predictions and annotators' ratings.\nThese annotations are also used to combine the audio and visual predictions.\nNext, we look at macro-level characterizations of movies by investigating\nwhether there exist `universal shapes' of emotional arcs. In particular, we\ndevelop a clustering approach to discover distinct classes of emotional arcs.\nFinally, we show on a sample corpus of short web videos that certain emotional\narcs are statistically significant predictors of the number of comments a video\nreceives. These results suggest that the emotional arcs learned by our approach\nsuccessfully represent macroscopic aspects of a video story that drive audience\nengagement. Such machine understanding could be used to predict audience\nreactions to video stories, ultimately improving our ability as storytellers to\ncommunicate with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 00:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

As opposed to previously\nreported techniques (based on pump modulation or direct application of a\nmodulated electrostatic force), injection locking of OMO via acoustic waves\ndoes not require optical power modulation or physical contact with the OMO and\nit can easily be implemented on various platforms. Using this approach we have\nlocked the phase and frequency of two distinct modes of a microtoroidal silica\nOMO to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). We have characterized the behavior of\nthe injection locked OMO with three acoustic excitation configurations and\nshowed that even without proper acoustic impedance matching the OMO can be\nlocked to the PZT and tuned over 17 kHz with only -30 dBm of RF power fed to\nthe PZT. The high efficiency, simplicity and scalability of the proposed\napproach paves the road toward a new class of photonic systems that rely on\nsynchronization of several OMOs to a single or multiple RF oscillators with\napplications in optical communication, metrology and sensing. Beyond its\npractical applications, injection locking via acoustic waves can be used in\nfundamental studies in quantum optomechanics where thermal and optical\nisolation of the OMO are critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 01:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Evolution of massive stars is affected by a significant loss of mass\neither via (nearly) spherically symmetric stellar winds or by aspherical\nmass-loss mechanisms, namely the outflowing equatorial disks. However, the\nscenario that leads to the formation of a disk or rings of gas and dust around\nmassive stars is still under debate. Aims. We study the hydrodynamic and\nthermal structure of optically thick, dense parts of outflowing circumstellar\ndisks that may be formed around various types of critically rotating massive\nstars, for example, Be stars, B[e] supergiant (sgB[e]) stars or Pop III stars.\nMethods. We specify the optical depth of the disk along the line-of-sight from\nstellar poles. Within the optically thick dense region we calculate the\nvertical disk thermal structure using the diffusion approximation while for the\noptically thin outer layers we assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium with\nthe impinging stellar irradiation. We use two of our own types of hydrodynamic\ncodes: two-dimensional operator-split numerical code and unsplit code based on\nthe Roe's method. Results. Our models show the geometric distribution and\ncontribution of viscous heating that begins to dominate in the central part of\nthe disk. In the models of dense viscous disks the viscosity increases the\ncentral temperature up to several tens of thousands of Kelvins. The high\nmass-loss rates and high viscosity lead to instabilities with significant waves\nor bumps in density and temperature in the very inner disk region. Conclusions.\nThe two-dimensional radial-vertical models of dense outflowing disks including\nthe full Navier-Stokes viscosity terms show very high temperatures that are\nhowever limited to only the central disk cores inside the optically thick area,\nwhile near the edge of the optically thick region the temperature may be low\nenough for the existence of neutral hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 01:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

We compare three possible\ndiscrete notions of Ricci curvature (Olivier Ricci curvature, Bakry-\\'Emery\nRicci curvature, and Forman Ricci curvature) on some model and biological\nnetworks. While the exact relationship of each of the three definitions of\ncurvature to one another is still not known, they do yield similar results on\nour biological networks of interest. These notions are initially defined on\npositively weighted graphs; however, Forman-Ricci curvature can also be defined\non directed positively weighted networks. We will generalize this notion of\ndirected Forman Ricci curvature on the network to a form that also considers\nthe signs of the directions (e. g., activator and repressor in transcription\nnetworks). We call this notion the \\emph{signed-control Ricci curvature}. Given\nreal biological networks are almost always directed and possess positive and\nnegative controls, the notion of signed-control curvature can elucidate the\nnetwork-based study of these complex networks. Finally, we compare the results\nof these notions of Ricci curvature on networks to some known network measures,\nnamely, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficients on graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 05:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

However, it\nfails when particle interactions become frictional and inelastic. For example,\nthe KT is not able to accurately predict the free cooling process of a vibrated\ngranular medium that consists of inelastic frictional particles under\nmicrogravity. The main reason that the classical KT fails to model these flows\nis due to its inability to account for the particle surface friction and its\ninelastic behavior, which are the two most important factors that need be\nconsidered in modeling collisional granular flows. In this study, we have\nmodified the KT model that is able to incorporate these two factors. The\ninelasticity of a particle is considered by establishing a velocity-dependent\nexpression for the restitution coefficient based on many experimental studies\nfound in the literature, and the particle friction effect is included by using\na tangential restitution coefficient that is related to the particle friction\ncoefficient. Theoretical predictions of the free cooling process by the\nclassical KT and the improved KT are compared with the experimental results\nfrom a study conducted on an airplane undergoing parabolic flights without the\ninfluence of gravity [Y.

So far\nneither observational systematics nor new physics has been successfully\nimplemented to explain this tension away. This paper present a new solution to\nthe Hubble constant problem. The solution is based on the Simsilun simulation\n(relativistic simulation of the large scale structure of the Universe) with the\nray-tracing algorithm implemented. The initial conditions for the Simsilun\nsimulation were set up as perturbations around the $\\Lambda$CDM model. However,\nunlike in the Standard Cosmological Model (i.e. $\\Lambda$CDM model +\nperturbations), within the Simsilun simulation relativistic and nonlinear\nevolution of cosmic structures leads to the phenomenon of emerging spatial\ncurvature, where the mean spatial curvature evolves from spatial flatness of\nthe early universe towards slightly curved present-day universe. Consqeuently,\nthe present-day expansion rate is slightly faster compared to the spatially\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model. The results of the ray-tracing analysis show that the\nuniverse which starts with initial conditions consistent with the Planck\nconstraints should have the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72.5 \\pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$. When the Simsilun simulation was re-run with no inhomogeneities\nimposed, the Hubble constant inferred within such a homogeneous simulation was\n$H_0 = 68.1 \\pm 2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

The Sparse Spectral Clustering (SSC) method\nextends SC with a sparse regularization on $UU^\\top$ by using the block\ndiagonal structure prior of $UU^\\top$ in the ideal case. However, encouraging\n$UU^\\top$ to be sparse leads to a heavily nonconvex problem which is\nchallenging to solve and the work (Lu, Yan, and Lin 2016) proposes a convex\nrelaxation in the pursuit of this aim indirectly. However, the convex\nrelaxation generally leads to a loose approximation and the quality of the\nsolution is not clear. This work instead considers to solve the nonconvex\nformulation of SSC which directly encourages $UU^\\top$ to be sparse. We propose\nan efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the\nnonconvex SSC and provide the convergence guarantee. In particular, we prove\nthat the sequences generated by ADMM always exist a limit point and any limit\npoint is a stationary point.

Our proposed ADMM for nonconvex problems\nallows the stepsize to be increasing but upper bounded, and this makes it very\nefficient in practice.

The stability of rock slopes is often dominated by\none or more locked segments along a potential slip surface; these segments have\nrelatively high strength and accumulate strain energy. Locked segments can be\npreliminarily classified into three categories: \"rock bridge\", \"retaining wall\"\nand \"sustaining arch.\" Coupling a one-dimensional renormalization group model\nwith the strain-softening constitutive relation of geo-materials considering\nthe Weibull's distribution, a physical model for predicting the instability of\nslopes with locked segments is established. It is found that the ratio of the\nstrain or displacement at the peak strength point to that at the volume\ndilation point for a locked segment is exclusively dependent on the Weibull's\nshape parameter m, and is approximately constant at 1.48. A corresponding\naccelerating displacement increment (tertiary creep) of the slope can be\nobserved from the onset of the volume dilation of the locked segment due to its\nunsteady cracking. For a slope with multiple locked segments, one can predict\nits critical instability displacement value according to the accelerating\ndisplacement onset corresponding to the volume dilation point of the first\nlocked segment and the number of locked segments. The back-analysis of two\ntypical cases, the Yanchihe rockslide in China and the wedge rockslide, Libby\nDam, USA, shows that their evolutionary processes, dominated respectively by\none and two locked segments, follow this model, confirming the reliability of\nthe proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 08:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 09:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 04:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

However, it is not\nalways possible to acquire such data at the initial stage of project\ndevelopment. Buckley and Leverett (1942) developed the analytical solution\nallowing to assess the oil displacement efficiency. One of the main assumptions\nof this model is incompressibility of oil and injected fluid. For slightly\ncompressible water and oil such assumption is rational. However, that is not\nalways the case when the gas is injected. This research aims to identify the\nconditions at which the usage of the incompressible gas model is appropriate.\nLikewise, the cases when the model of compressible gas is required are also\nevaluated. To accomplish the goals of this research, the comparative analysis\nbetween the injection of compressible and incompressible gases was undertaken\nusing the numerical solution of the correspondent reservoir engineering\nproblem. The validation of the numerical model was undertaken showing that it\nmatches the analytical Buckley-Leverett solution. The findings of this research\nindicate that the relative and absolute density change with the pressure of the\ninjected gas has the profound impact on the convergence between two models\nunder consideration. With the increase in the injection pressure, the\ndiscrepancy between the models of compressible and incompressible gas raises\nfor all the considered injection fluids (CO2, CH4 and N2). Due to a steep slope\nof 'density-pressure' curve for CO2 at low initial reservoir pressure, the\nincompressible model cannot accurately predict the oil displacement efficiency\nby this gas at any reasonable injection pressure. All 1D results are also\nrepresentative for 2D simulation.

The unbounded parts at infinities are approximated or modeled by\npolynomials and then a remaining localized potential dominates the central\narea. The fact that the Moyal expansion reduces to a finite series for\npolynomial potentials is fully utilized.

This is achieved by\nhypofractionating parts of the tumor while delivering approximately uniformly\nfractionated doses to the healthy tissue. Optimization of such treatments is\nbased on biologically effective dose (BED), which leads to computationally\nchallenging nonconvex optimization problems. Current optimization methods yield\nonly locally optimal plans, and it has been unclear whether these are close to\nthe global optimum. We present an optimization model to compute rigorous bounds\non the normal tissue BED reduction achievable by such plans.\n  The approach is demonstrated on liver tumors, where the primary goal is to\nreduce mean liver BED without compromising other treatment objectives. First a\nuniformly fractionated reference plan is computed using convex optimization.\nThen a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming model is\nsolved to local optimality to compute a spatiotemporally fractionated plan that\nminimizes mean liver BED subject to the constraints that the plan is no worse\nthan the reference plan with respect to all other planning goals. Finally, we\nderive a convex relaxation of the second model in the form of a semidefinite\nprogramming problem, which provides a lower bound on the lowest achievable mean\nliver BED.\n  The method is presented on 5 cases with distinct geometries. The computed\nspatiotemporal plans achieve 12-35% mean liver BED reduction over the reference\nplans, which corresponds to 79-97% of the gap between the reference mean liver\nBEDs and our lower bounds.

Here we address the problem\nthrough a complete classification of the magnetic forces on an AFM domain wall\n(DW), revealing the following physical properties: (i) the tiny net\nmagnetization still responses to the field gradient.

Lately, new technologies emerged where prolonged battery life\nis crucial such as environment and industrial monitoring. This inspired the\nfoundation of new CSMA based MAC schemes where links are allowed to transition\ninto sleep mode to reduce the power consumption. However, throughput optimality\nof these schemes was not established. This paper therefore aims to find a new\nCSMA scheme that combines both throughput optimality and energy efficiency by\nadapting to the throughput and power consumption needs of each link. This is\ndone by controlling operational parameters such as back-off and sleeping timers\nwith the aim of optimizing a certain objective function. The resulting CSMA\nscheme is characterized by being asynchronous, completely distributed and being\nable to adapt to different power consumption profiles required by each link\nwhile still ensuring throughput optimality. The performance gain in terms of\nenergy efficiency compared to the conventional adaptive CSMA scheme is\ndemonstrated through computer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 13:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 21:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In contrast, some exactly solvable models\nshowcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small\nnon-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean\nthat a part may contain more information about the global temperature than the\nwhole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove\nthat local quantum thermometry at low $T$ is exponentially inefficient in\nnon-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we\nshow through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a\nharmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by\nmeans of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like\nbehavior as $T \\rightarrow 0$. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the\nfact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature\nmeasurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped\ntranslationally invariant chain (for which low--$T$ thermometry is indeed\nexponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the\nlow-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a\ngapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample\ninteraction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In\nthis way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in\ntypical dissipative models stems from the fact that these are gapless and, as\nsuch, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped\ncounterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the\nultimate limitations of low--$T$ thermometry, is thus whether or not their\nenergy spectrum is gapped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 14:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 16:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Open-shell nuclei have\nbeen further addressed by implementing variants based on the concept of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking (and restoration).\n  Purpose: In order to access the spectroscopy of open-shell nuclei more\nsystematically while controlling the numerical cost, we design a novel\nmany-body method that combines the merit of breaking and restoring symmetries\nwith those brought about by low-rank individual excitations.\n  Methods: The recently proposed truncated configuration-interaction method\nbased on optimized symmetry-broken and -restored states is extended to the\nz-signature symmetry associated with a discrete subgroup of SU(2). The\nhighly-truncated N-body Hilbert subspace within which the Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized is spanned by a z-signature broken and restored Slater determinant\nvacuum and associated low-rank excitations.\n  Results: The proposed method provides an excellent reproduction of the\nground-state energy and of low-lying excitation energies of various\nz-signatures and total angular momenta. In doing so, the successive benefits of\n(i) breaking the symmetry, (ii) restoring the symmetry, (iii) including\nlow-rank particle-hole excitations and (iv) optimizing the amount by which the\nunderlying vacuum breaks the symmetry are illustrated.\n  Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is\npolynomial with respect to the system size. The present study confirms the\nresults obtained previously for the attractive pairing Hamiltonian in\nconnection with the breaking and restoration of U(1) global gauge symmetry.\nThese two studies constitute a strong motivation to apply this method to\nrealistic nuclear Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 14:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

In conjunction with other admitted\nsymmetries of linear type, the associated invariant solution condition poses a\nlinear eigenvalue problem. If this problem is structured such that the spectral\ntheorem applies, then the general solution of the considered linear PDE system\nis obtained by summing or integrating the invariant eigenfunctions (modes) over\nall eigenvalues, depending on whether the spectrum of the operator is discrete\nor continuous. By first studying the 1-D diffusion equation as a demonstrating\nexample, this method is then applied to a relevant 2-D problem from\nhydrodynamic stability analysis. The aim of this study is to draw attention to\nthe following two independent facts that need to be addressed in future studies\nwhen constructing solutions for linear PDEs with the method of Lie-symmetries:\n(i) Although each new symmetry leads to a mathematically different spectral\ndecomposition, they may all be physically redundant to standard ones and do not\nreveal a new physical mechanism behind the overall considered dynamical\nprocess, as incorrectly asserted, for example, in the recent studies by the\ngroup of Oberlack et al. Hence, with regard to linear stability analysis, no\nphysically \"new\" or more \"general\" modes are generated by this method than the\nones already established. (ii) Next to the eigenvalue parameters, each single\nmode can also acquire non-system parameters, depending on the choice of its\nunderlying symmetry. These symmetry-induced parameters, however, are all\nphysically irrelevant, since their effect on a single mode will cancel when\nconsidering all modes collectively. In particular, the collective action of all\nsingle modes is identical for all symmetry-based decompositions and thus\nindistinguishable when considering the full physical fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 18:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

To solve this problem, the authors recommended the\nrandom assignment of the data of each subject to either the training or the\ntest set (subject-wise data split). The adoption of subject-wise split has been\ncriticized in Little et al (2017), on the basis that it can violate assumptions\nrequired by cross-validation to consistently estimate generalization error. In\nparticular, adopting subject-wise splitting in heterogeneous data-sets might\nlead to model under-fitting and larger classification errors. Hence, Little et\nal argue that perhaps the overestimation of prediction errors with subject-wise\ncross-validation, rather than underestimation with record-wise\ncross-validation, is the reason for the discrepancies between prediction error\nestimates generated by the two splitting strategies. In order to shed light on\nthis controversy, we focus on simpler classification performance metrics and\ndevelop permutation tests that can detect identity confounding. By focusing on\npermutation tests, we are able to evaluate the merits of record-wise and\nsubject-wise data splits under more general statistical dependencies and\ndistributional structures of the data, including situations where\ncross-validation breaks down.

We carry out a systematic parameter study of three-dimensional, direct\nnumerical simulations of anelastic convection in rotating spherical shells.\nRestricting our investigations to hydrodynamical models with a thermal Prandtl\nnumber fixed to unity, we consider both thick and thin (solar-like) shells, and\nvary the stratification over three orders of magnitude. We measure the heat\ntransfer efficiency in terms of the Nusselt number, defined as the output\nluminosity normalised by the conductive state luminosity. We report diverse\nNusselt number profiles in latitude, ranging from brighter (usually at the\nonset of convection) to darker equator and uniform profiles. We find that the\nvariations of the surface brightness are mainly controlled by the surface value\nof the local Rossby number: when the Coriolis force dominates the dynamics, the\nheat flux is weakened in the equatorial region by the zonal wind and enhanced\nat the poles by convective motions inside the tangent cylinder. In the presence\nof a strong background density stratification however, as expected in real\nstars, the increase of the local Rossby number in the outer layers leads to\nuniformisation of the surface heat flux distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 15:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Beyond the nearly\nscale-invariant primordial GW spectrum produced during inflation, a spectrum\nwith a much richer structure is typically generated during the preheating phase\nafter inflation (or after some other phase transition at lower energies). This\nraises the question of what one can learn from a future observation of the\nstochastic gravitational wave background spectrum about the underlying physics\nduring preheating. Recently, it has been shown that during preheating\nnon-perturbative quasi-stable objects like oscillons can act as strong sources\nfor GW, leading to characteristic features such as distinct peaks in the\nspectrum. In this paper, we study the GW production from oscillons using\nsemi-analytical techniques. In particular, we discuss how the GW spectrum is\naffected by the parameters that characterise a given oscillon system, e.g. by\nthe background cosmology, the asymmetry of the oscillons and the evolution of\nthe number density of the oscillons. We compare our semi-analytic results with\nnumerical lattice simulations for a hilltop inflation model and a KKLT\nscenario, which differ strongly in some of these characteristics, and find very\ngood agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 15:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

To suppress these effects, we propose a\nmulti-frame reconstruction scheme to recover a latent image from the observed\nimage sequence. Recent approaches are commonly based on registering each frame\nto a reference image, by which geometric turbulent deformations can be\nestimated and a sharp image can be restored. A major challenge is that a fine\nreference image is usually unavailable, as every turbulence-degraded frame is\ndistorted. A high-quality reference image is crucial for the accurate\nestimation of geometric deformations and fusion of frames. Besides, it is\nunlikely that all frames from the image sequence are useful, and thus frame\nselection is necessary and highly beneficial. In this work, we propose a\nvariational model for joint subsampling of frames and extraction of a clear\nimage. A fine image and a suitable choice of subsample are simultaneously\nobtained by iteratively reducing an energy functional. The energy consists of a\nfidelity term measuring the discrepancy between the extracted image and the\nsubsampled frames, as well as regularization terms on the extracted image and\nthe subsample.

Machine\nlearning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use\na random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of urban\nindicators on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97% of accuracy on crime\nprediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in\ngroups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data\nsample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of urban\nindicators to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the\nmost important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We\nfurther believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions\nregarding the effects of urban indicators on crime, having potential\napplications for guiding public policies for crime control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 13:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 12:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

Here we present a new approach of\nfield-free deterministic perpendicular switching using a strain-mediated SOT\nswitching method. The strain-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy breaks the\nlateral symmetry, and the resulting symmetry-breaking is controllable. A finite\nelement model and a macrospin model are used to numerically simulate the\nstrain-mediated SOT switching mechanism.

The\nswitching direction (up or down) is dictated by the voltage polarity (positive\nor negative) applied to the piezoelectric layer in the magnetoelastic/heavy\nmetal/piezoelectric heterostructure.
