Evolutionary soft robotics is concerned with the application of\noptimization algorithms inspired by natural evolution in order to let soft\nrobots (both morphologies and controllers) spontaneously evolve within\nphysically-realistic simulated environments, figuring out how to satisfy a set\nof objectives defined by human designers. In this paper a powerful evolutionary\nsystem is put in place in order to perform a broad investigation on the\nfree-form evolution of walking and swimming soft robots in different\nenvironments. Three sets of experiments are reported, tackling different\naspects of the evolution of soft locomotion. The first two sets explore the\neffects of different material properties on the evolution of terrestrial and\naquatic soft locomotion: particularly, we show how different materials lead to\nthe evolution of different morphologies, behaviors, and energy-performance\ntradeoffs. It is found that within our simplified physics world stiffer robots\nevolve more sophisticated and effective gaits and morphologies on land, while\nsofter ones tend to perform better in water. The third set of experiments\nstarts investigating the effect and potential benefits of major environmental\ntransitions (land - water) during evolution. Results provide interesting\nmorphological exaptation phenomena, and point out a potential asymmetry between\nland-water and water-land transitions: while the first type of transition\nappears to be detrimental, the second one seems to have some beneficial\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

Understanding quantum many-body systems with strong interaction and\nthe unconventional phases therein is one of the most challenging problems in\nphysics nowadays. Cold atom systems possess a natural way to create strong\ninteraction by bringing the system to the vicinity of a scattering resonance.\nAlthough this has been a focused topic in cold atom physics for more than a\ndecade, these studies have so far mostly been limited for $s$-wave resonance.\nHere we report the experimental observation of a broad $d$-wave shape resonance\nin degenerate ${}^{41}$K gas.

Understanding why\ncritical temperatures are so high has been the subject of numerous\ninvestigations and extensive controversy. To realize high temperature\nsuperconductivity, parent compounds are either hole-doped, such as\n{La$_{2}$CuO$_4$} (LCO) with Sr (LSCO), or electron doped, such as\n{Nd$_{2}$CuO$_4$} (NCO) with Ce (NCCO).

By combining quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QS\\emph{GW}) and\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT), that LCO is a Mott insulator; but small\ndisplacements of the apical oxygens drive the compound to a metallic state\nthrough a localization/delocalization transition, with a concomitant maximum\n$d$-wave order parameter at the transition.

Non-equilibrium effects in TR spectra are\ntherefore expected. To investigate the combination of non-equilibrium\nionization and high-energy particles, we apply the model of the periodic\nelectron beam, represented by a kappa-distribution that recurs at periods of\nseveral seconds, to plasma at chromospheric temperatures of 10^4 K. This simple\nmodel can approximate a burst of energy release involving accelerated\nparticles. Instantaneous time-dependent charge states of silicon and oxygen\nwere calculated and used to synthesize the instantaneous and period-averaged\nspectra of Si IV and O IV. The electron beam drives the plasma out of\nequilibrium. At electron densities of N_e = 10^10 cm^-3, the plasma is out of\nionization equilibrium at all times in all cases we considered, while for a\nhigher density of N_e = 10^11 cm^-3, ionization equilibrium can be reached\ntoward the end of each period, depending on the conditions. In turn, the\ncharacter of the period-averaged synthetic spectra also depends on the\nproperties of the beam. While the case of kappa = 2 results in spectra with\nstrong or even dominant O IV, higher values of kappa can approximate a range of\nobserved TR spectra. Spectra similar to typically observed spectra, with the Si\nIV 1402.8 A line about a factor 5 higher than O IV 1401.2 A, are obtained for\nkappa = 3. An even higher value of kappa = 5 results in spectra that are\nexclusively dominated by Si IV, with negligible O IV emission. This is a\npossible interpretation of the TR spectra of UV bursts, although an\ninterpretation that requires a density that is 1-3 orders of magnitude lower\nthan for equilibrium estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 18:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

In the four-dimensional\nscalar-tensor theory with second order equations of motion, the Horndeski\ntheory, this translates into a significant reduction of the viable parameter\nspace of the theory. Recently, extensions of Horndeski theory, which are free\nfrom Ostrogradsky ghosts despite the presence of higher order derivatives in\nthe equations of motion, have been identified and classified exploiting the\ndegeneracy criterium. In these new theories, the fifth force mediated by the\nscalar field must be suppressed in order to evade the stringent Solar System\nconstraints. We study the Vainshtein mechanism in the most general degenerate\nhigher order scalar-tensor theory in which light and gravity propagate at the\nsame speed.

When adjustments are made to the embedding formalisms to\nguarantee uniqueness, approximate functionals may be more meaningfully compared\nto the exact unique NAKE. We use numerically accurate inversions to study the\nexact NAKE of several rare-gas dimers within Partition Density Functional\nTheory, a method that provides the uniqueness for the exact NAKE.

In this work we explore the capabilities\nof computer-guided ranging to aid identification and analysis of mass spectra.\nWe propose a fully robust algorithm for enumeration of the possible identities\nof detected peak positions, which assists labelling. Furthermore, a simple\nranking scheme is developed to allow for evaluation of the likelihood of each\npossible identity being the likely assignment from the enumerated set. We\ndemonstrate a simple, yet complete work-chain that allows for the conversion of\nmass-spectra to fully identified APT spectra, with the goal of minimising\nidentification errors, and the inter-operator variance within APT experiments.\nThis work chain is compared to current procedures via experimental trials with\ndifferent APT operators, to determine the relative effectiveness and precision\nof the two approaches. It is found that there is little loss of precision (and\noccasionally gain) when participants are given computer assistance.

Intra-operator precision is weakly\ntested and found to vary between 1 and 3 significant figures, depending upon\nspecies composition levels.

One way to approach this problem, known as the supertree method,\ninvolves inferring a phylogenetic tree with leaves consisting of a set $X$ of\nspecies from a collection of trees, each having leaf-set some subset of $X$. In\nthe 1980's characterizations, certain inference rules were given for when a\ncollection of 4-leaved trees, one for each 4-element subset of $X$, can all be\nsimultaneously displayed by a single supertree with leaf-set $X$. Recently, it\nhas become of interest to extend such results to phylogenetic networks. These\nare a generalization of phylogenetic trees which can be used to represent\nreticulate evolution (where species can come together to form a new species).\nIt has been shown that a certain type of phylogenetic network, called a level-1\nnetwork, can essentially be constructed from 4-leaved trees. However, the\nproblem of providing appropriate inference rules for such networks remains\nunresolved.

In the opposite limit of\nthe large expansion rate when the inverse Hubble radius is smaller than the\nSchwarzschild radius of a \"would be\" black hole, the new critical distance\nbetween two particles that can make a black hole becomes equal to the particle\nhorizon, which is just a requirement that the particles are in a causal\ncontact.

Learning using delayed and non-local errors makes\nit hard to reconcile backpropagation with the learning mechanisms observed in\nbiological neural networks as it requires the neurons to maintain a memory of\nthe input long enough until the higher-layer errors arrive. In this paper, we\npropose an alternative learning mechanism where errors are generated locally in\neach layer using fixed, random auxiliary classifiers. Lower layers could thus\nbe trained independently of higher layers and training could either proceed\nlayer by layer, or simultaneously in all layers using local error information.\nWe address biological plausibility concerns such as weight symmetry\nrequirements and show that the proposed learning mechanism based on fixed,\nbroad, and random tuning of each neuron to the classification categories\noutperforms the biologically-motivated feedback alignment learning technique on\nthe MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets, approaching the performance of standard\nbackpropagation. Our approach highlights a potential biological mechanism for\nthe supervised, or task-dependent, learning of feature hierarchies. In\naddition, we show that it is well suited for learning deep networks in custom\nhardware where it can drastically reduce memory traffic and data communication\noverheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 22:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Particle filter weights depend on how well\nensemble members agree with observations, and collapse occurs when a few\nensemble members receive most of the weight. Collapse causes catastrophic\nvariance underestimation. Increasing small-scale variance in the observation\nerror model reduces the incidence of collapse by de-emphasizing small-scale\ndifferences between the ensemble members and the observations. Doing so smooths\nthe posterior mean, though it does not smooth the individual ensemble members.\nTwo options for implementing the proposed observation error model are\ndescribed. Taking discretized elliptic differential operators as an observation\nerror covariance matrix provides the desired property of a spectrum that grows\nin the approach to small scales. This choice also introduces structure\nexploitable by scalable computation techniques, including multigrid solvers and\nmultiresolution approximations to the corresponding integral operator.\nAlternatively the observations can be smoothed and then assimilated under the\nassumption of independent errors, which is equivalent to assuming large errors\nat small scales. The method is demonstrated on a linear stochastic partial\ndifferential equation, where it significantly reduces the occurrence of\nparticle filter collapse while maintaining accuracy. It also improves\ncontinuous ranked probability scores by as much as 25%, indicating that the\nweighted ensemble more accurately represents the true distribution. The method\nis compatible with other techniques for improving the performance of particle\nfilters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 22:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 22:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Here we present methods for\ncomputing the instantaneous energy flux $\\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$ for a spatially\nvarying $N(z)$, as in the oceans where $N(z)$ typically decreases by two orders\nof magnitude from shallow water to the deep ocean. Analytic methods are\npresented for computing $\\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$ from a density perturbation field\nfor $N(z)$ varying linearly with $z$ and for $N^2(z)$ varying as $\\tanh (z)$.\nTo generalize this approach to $arbitrary$ $N(z)$, we present a computational\nmethod for obtaining $\\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$. The results for $\\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$\nfor the different cases agree well with results from direct numerical\nsimulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Our computational method can be\napplied to any density perturbation data using the MATLAB graphical user\ninterface EnergyFlux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 23:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Climate\ninfluences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet, with cool\nclimates being favorable for plate tectonics because they enhance stresses in\nthe lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing, and promote hydration and\nweakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics plays a vital role in the\nlong-term carbon cycle, which helps to maintain a temperate climate. Plate\ntectonics provides long-term cooling of the core, which is vital for generating\na magnetic field, and the magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric\nvolatiles from the solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can\npotentially explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies\ntoo close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon\ncycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore plate tectonics cannot\noperate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to insufficient\ncore cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where liquid water is\npossible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can take place depending on\ninitial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile content, or the timing of when\nplate tectonics initiates, among other factors. Many of these evolutionary\ntrajectories would render the planet uninhabitable. However, there is still\nsignificant uncertainty over the nature of the coupling between climate,\nmantle, and core.

The representation of spatial knowledge is often modeled with\nspatial templates, i.e., regions of acceptability of two objects under an\nexplicit spatial relationship (e.g., \"on\", \"below\", etc.). In contrast with\nprior work that restricts spatial templates to explicit spatial prepositions\n(e.g., \"glass on table\"), here we extend this concept to implicit spatial\nlanguage, i.e., those relationships (generally actions) for which the spatial\narrangement of the objects is only implicitly implied (e.g., \"man riding\nhorse\"). In contrast with explicit relationships, predicting spatial\narrangements from implicit spatial language requires significant common sense\nspatial understanding. Here, we introduce the task of predicting spatial\ntemplates for two objects under a relationship, which can be seen as a spatial\nquestion-answering task with a (2D) continuous output (\"where is the man w.r.t.\na horse when the man is walking the horse?\"). We present two simple\nneural-based models that leverage annotated images and structured text to learn\nthis task. The good performance of these models reveals that spatial locations\nare to a large extent predictable from implicit spatial language. Crucially,\nthe models attain similar performance in a challenging generalized setting,\nwhere the object-relation-object combinations (e.g.,\"man walking dog\") have\nnever been seen before. Next, we go one step further by presenting the models\nwith unseen objects (e.g., \"dog\").

The L-Net learns to transfer the\nsegmentation knowledge from strong categories to the images in the weak\ncategories and produces coarse pixel-level semantic maps, by effectively\nexploiting the similar appearance shared across categories.

In this paper, a\nrandom access protocol is proposed that resolves collisions and performs timing\nestimation by simply utilizing the large number of antennas envisioned in\nMassive MIMO networks. UEs entering the network perform spreading in both time\nand frequency domains, and their timing offsets are estimated at the base\nstation in closed-form using a subspace decomposition approach.

To solve\nthis class of problems, we propose a proximal gradient method with\nextrapolation and line search (PGels). This method is developed based on a\nspecial potential function and successfully incorporates both extrapolation and\nnon-monotone line search, which are two simple and efficient accelerating\ntechniques for the proximal gradient method. Thanks to the line search, this\nmethod allows more flexibilities in choosing the extrapolation parameters and\nupdates them adaptively at each iteration if a certain line search criterion is\nnot satisfied. Moreover, with proper choices of parameters, our PGels reduces\nto many existing algorithms. We also show that, under some mild conditions, our\nline search criterion is well defined and any cluster point of the sequence\ngenerated by PGels is a stationary point of our problem. In addition, by\nassuming the Kurdyka-${\\L}$ojasiewicz exponent of the objective in our problem,\nwe further analyze the local convergence rate of two special cases of PGels,\nincluding the widely used non-monotone proximal gradient method as one case.\nFinally, we conduct some numerical experiments for solving the $\\ell_1$\nregularized logistic regression problem and the $\\ell_{1\\text{-}2}$ regularized\nleast squares problem. Our numerical results illustrate the efficiency of PGels\nand show the potential advantage of combining two accelerating techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 09:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:44:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 11:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

In particular, we use a recurrent neural network architecture in\ncombination with Q-learning to find an optimal action-selection policy; we\npre-train the network using a simulated environment that mimics realistic\nscenarios that involve speaking/silent participants, thus avoiding the need of\ntedious sessions of a robot interacting with people.

The clustering coefficient is an important\ncharacteristic of complex networks which is tightly connected with its\ncommunity structure. In the current paper, we study the behaviour of C(d),\nwhich is the average local clustering coefficient for the vertices of degree d.\nIt was empirically shown that in real-world networks C(d) usually decreases as\n1/d^a for some a>0 and it was often observed that a=1. We prove that in the SPA\nmodel C(d) decreases as 1/d. Furthermore, we are also able to prove that not\nonly the average but the individual local clustering coefficient of a vertex v\nof degree $d$ behaves as 1/d if d is large enough.

Our finding clearly manifests that quantum-state\ncorrelations generally have no Gaussian extremality.

We then discuss how the distribution of\nindividual galaxy shapes in the observed field of view can be modeled by\nfitting Fourier modes to the shear pattern directly. We simulated samples of\ngalaxy ellipticities, using both theoretical distributions and real data for\nellipticities and noise.

To study the role of these factors, we perform\nseveral three-dimensional numerical simulations forced with air-sea fluxes at\ndifferent temporal averaging frequencies as well as different spatial\nresolutions. Results show that in the winter, when the average mixed layer is\nmuch deeper than the euphotic layer and the days are short, phytoplankton\nproduction is relatively insensitive to the high-frequency variability in\nair-sea fluxes. The duration of upper ocean stratification due to\nhigh-frequency variability in air-sea fluxes is short and hence has a small\nimpact on phytoplankton production. On the other hand, slumping of fronts\ncreates patchy, stratified, shallow regions that persist considerably longer\nthan stratification caused by changes in air-sea fluxes. Simulations show that\nbefore spring warming, the average MLD with fronts is about 700 m shallower\nthan the average MLD without fronts. Therefore, fronts increase the residence\ntime of phytoplankton in the euphotic layer and contribute to phytoplankton\ngrowth. Results show that before the spring warming, the depth-integrated\nphytoplankton concentration is about twice as large as phytoplankton\nconcentration when there are no fronts. Hence, fronts are important for setting\nthe MLD and sustaining phytoplankton in the winter.

We propose a\nhierarchical meta-classification method, aiming to stratify CKD by severity\nlevels, employing simple quantitative non-text features gathered from office\nvisit records, while addressing data imbalance. Our method effectively\nstratifies CKD severity levels obtaining high average sensitivity, precision\nand F-measure (~93%). We also conduct experiments in which the dimensionality\nof the data is significantly reduced to include only the most salient features.\nOur results show that the good performance of our system is retained even when\nusing the reduced feature sets, as well as under much reduced training sets,\nindicating that our method is stable and generalizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 21:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

To this end, numerous schemes for\nelectronic, MEMS-based, and microwave photonic filters have been demonstrated.\nFiltering schemes based on microwave photonic systems offer superior\nflexibility and tunability to traditional RF filters. However, these\noptical-based filters are typically limited to GHz-widths and often have large\nRF insertion losses, posing challenges for integration into high-fidelity\nradiofrequency circuits. In this article, we demonstrate a novel type of\nmicrowave filter that combines the attractive features of microwave photonic\nfilters with high-Q phononic signal processing using a photonic-phononic\nemit-receive process. Through this process, a RF signal encoded on a guided\noptical wave is transduced onto a GHz-frequency acoustic wave, where it may be\nfiltered through shaping of acoustic transfer functions before being re-encoded\nonto a spatially separate optical probe. This emit-receive functionality,\nrealized in an integrated silicon waveguide, produces MHz-bandwidth band-pass\nfiltering while supporting low RF insertion losses necessary for high dynamic\nrange in a microwave photonic link. We also demonstrate record-high internal\nefficiency for emit-receive operations of this type, and show that the\nemit-receive operation is uniquely suitable for the creation of serial filter\nbanks with minimal loss of fidelity. This photonic-phononic emitter-receiver\nrepresents a new method for low-distortion signal-processing in an integrated\nall-silicon device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 17:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

The result is that later\nmodels appear to either assume that black hole event horizons already exist\n(such as in Hawking's 1975 paper on radiation from black holes), bypass the\nrelative frames altogether (such as in Mirabel's 2017 paper on the formation of\nstellar black holes), or use coordinate systems that essentially ignore the\nremote viewer's point of view (Kruskal 1960).\n  This paper attempts to re-establish the concept of a \"nascent black hole\" as\nthe correct approach for modelling black holes from remote reference frames. It\nuses, and only needs to use, Schwarzschild metrics and presents some example\nscenarios to demonstrate the concepts through worked examples. Alternatives\nsuch as Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates and Penrose's local collapsing frames\nare not disputed; the Schwarzschild metrics must still be valid outside the\nevent horizon and this paper is largely concerned with \"remote viewers\" for\nvarious meanings of \"remote\".\n  For most astrophysical or cosmological questions the difference between\n\"actual\" and \"nascent\" black holes is largely irrelevant as they behave\nsimilarly for most practical purposes. However the difference becomes critical\nfor effects that require an event horizon to interact with the remote viewer,\nsuch as Hawking-Zel'dovich radiation and the related information problems\noutlined by Susskind. That is: if there are no possible observable paths from a\nnascent event horizon to any remote viewer then there also cannot be any\nevaporation to the remote viewer\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 16:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
