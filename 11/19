In this paper, using\nthe mathematical framework of the coagulation-fragmentation process, we develop\nand analyse a model of merge and split group dynamics, also called\nfission-fusion dynamics, for heterogeneous populations that contain two types\n(or species) of individuals. We assume that more heterogeneous groups\nexperience higher split rates than homogeneous groups, forming two daughter\ngroups whose compositions are drawn uniformly from all possible partitions. We\nanalytically derive a master equation for group size and compositions and find\nmean-field steady-state solutions. We predict that there is a critical group\nsize below which groups are more likely to be homogeneous and contain the\nabundant type/species. Despite the propensity of heterogeneous groups to split\nat higher rates, we find that groups are more likely to be heterogeneous but\nonly above the critical group size. Monte-Carlo simulation of the model show\nexcellent agreement with these analytical model results. Thus, our model makes\na testable prediction that composition of flocks are group-size dependent and\ndo not merely reflect the population level heterogeneity.

In a\nrecent breakthrough, Bhattacharya, Henzinger and Nanongkai showed how to\nmaintain a constant approximation to the minimum vertex cover, and thus also a\nconstant-factor estimate of the maximum matching size, with polylogarithmic\nworst-case update time. Later (in SODA'17 Proc.) they improved the\napproximation factor all the way to $2+\\epsilon$. Nevertheless, the\nlongstanding fundamental problem of {maintaining} an approximate matching with\nsub-polynomial worst-case time bounds remained open.\n  We present a randomized algorithm for maintaining an {almost-maximal}\nmatching in fully dynamic graphs with polylogarithmic worst-case update time.\nSuch a matching provides $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximations for both the maximum\nmatching and the minimum vertex cover, for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Our result was\ndone independently of the $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation result of Bhattacharya\net al., so it provides the first $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation for minimum\nvertex cover (together with Bhattacharya et al.'s result) and the first\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum (integral) matching.\n  The polylogarithmic worst-case update time of our algorithm holds\ndeterministically, while the almost-maximality guarantee holds with high\nprobability. This result not only settles the aforementioned problem on dynamic\nmatchings, but also provides essentially the best possible approximation\nguarantee for dynamic vertex cover (assuming the unique games conjecture).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 16:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

We consider\nhistorical and philosophical aspects of the cosmological constant over four\nmain epochs: (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies (both Newtonian and\nrelativistic); (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery of\ncosmic expansion; (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles\nsuch as the timespan of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts\nof the quasars; (iv) the re-emergence of the term in today's Lamda-CDM\ncosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly banished from\ntheoretical models of the universe, but was sidelined by astronomers for\nreasons of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the\nforefront of modern cosmology did not occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to\none particular set of observations, but as the result of a number of empirical\nadvances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN 1a supernovae\nas standard candles, and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background by balloon and satellite.

We\nfind systematic variation in patterns of borrowing from ancestral texts and\n\"biological\"-like behavior in patterns of inheritance with the distribution of\n\"offspring\" arising through a bounded preferential-attachment process. This\nprocess leads to a small number of highly innovative (influential)\nconstitutions some of which have yet to have been identified as so in the\ncurrent literature. Our findings thus shed new light on the critical nodes of\nthe constitution-making network. The constitutional network structure reflects\nperiods of intense constitution creation, and systematic patterns of variation\nin constitutional life-span and temporal influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 17:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

We therefore identified seven\npromising, fundamentally different algorithms based on different user features\nand developed one outstanding, one workable, and one honorable mention gaze\ntracking pipelines that match the performance of modern gaze trackers while\nusing no training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 18:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

It compares the performance\nof the optimal mechanism against the performance of a truthful mechanism, for\nall possible inputs.\n  In this paper, we take the average-case analysis approach, and tackle one of\nthe primary motivating problems in Algorithmic Mechanism Design -- the\nscheduling problem [Nisan and Ronen 1999]. One version of this problem which\nincludes a verification component is studied by [Koutsoupias 2014].

To begin, we establish the condition under\nwhich the fundamental assumption in synthetic control-like approaches holds,\ni.e. when the linear relationship between the treatment unit and the donor pool\nprevails in both the pre- and post-intervention periods. We provide the first\nfinite sample analysis for a broader class of models, the Latent Variable\nModel, in contrast to Factor Models previously considered in the literature.\nFurther, we show that our de-noising procedure accurately imputes missing\nentries, producing a consistent estimator of the underlying signal matrix\nprovided $p = \\Omega( T^{-1 + \\zeta})$ for some $\\zeta > 0$; here, $p$ is the\nfraction of observed data and $T$ is the time interval of interest. Under the\nsame setting, we prove that the mean-squared-error (MSE) in our prediction\nestimation scales as $O(\\sigma^2/p + 1/\\sqrt{T})$, where $\\sigma^2$ is the\nnoise variance. Using a data aggregation method, we show that the MSE can be\nmade as small as $O(T^{-1/2+\\gamma})$ for any $\\gamma \\in (0, 1/2)$, leading to\na consistent estimator. We also introduce a Bayesian framework to quantify the\nmodel uncertainty through posterior probabilities. Our experiments, using both\nreal-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrate that our robust generalization\nyields an improvement over the classical synthetic control method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 23:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Efficient heat dissipation is a\nkey factor for the reliability and stability of topological semimetal-based\nnano-electronics devices, which is closely related to high thermal\nconductivity. In this work, the elastic properties and lattice thermal\nconductivity of TaN are investigated by first-principles calculations and the\nlinearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time\napproximation (RTA). According to the calculated bulk modulus, shear modulus\nand $C_{44}$, TaN can be regarded as a potential incompressible and hard\nmaterial. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is predicted to be\n838.62 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ along a axis and 1080.40 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1}\nK^{-1}}$ along c axis, showing very strong anisotropy. It is found that the\nlattice thermal conductivity of TaN is several tens of times higher than one of\nother topological semimetal, such as TaAs, MoP and ZrTe, which is due to very\nlonger phonon lifetimes for TaN than other topological semimetal. The very\ndifferent atomic masses of Ta and N atoms lead to a very large acoustic-optical\nband gap, and then prohibits the scattering between acoustic and optical phonon\nmodes, which gives rise to very long phonon lifetimes. Based on mass difference\nfactor, the WC and WN can be regarded as potential candidates with ultrahigh\nlattice thermal conductivity.

Our BPGrad algorithm is based on the\nassumption of Lipschitz continuity in DL, and as a result it can adaptively\ndetermine the step size for current gradient given the history of previous\nupdates, wherein theoretically no smaller steps can achieve the global\noptimality. We prove that, by repeating such branch-and-pruning procedure, we\ncan locate the global optimality within finite iterations. Empirically an\nefficient solver based on BPGrad for DL is proposed as well, and it outperforms\nconventional DL solvers such as Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSProp, and Adam in the\ntasks of object recognition, detection, and segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 02:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Cyclone is a replicated log plug-in for key\nvalue stores that systematically addresses various sources of this bottleneck.\nIt uses a small amount of non-volatile memory directly addressable by the CPU -\nsuch as in the form of NVDIMMs or Intel 3DXPoint - to remove block oriented IO\ndevices such as SSDs from the critical path for appending to the log. This\nenables it to address network overheads using an implementation of the RAFT\nconsensus protocol that is designed around a userspace network stack to relieve\nthe CPU of the burden of data copies.

In particular, a complex optimization\nproblem needs to be solved to obtain the remote radio head (RRH) ordering\ncriterion in each transmission block, which will help to determine the active\nRRHs and the associated fronthaul links. In this paper, we propose innovative\napproaches to reduce the complexity of this key step in group sparse\nbeamforming.

The well-structured solutions provide the\nopportunities to apply the large-dimensional random matrix theory to derive\ndeterministic approximations for the RRH ordering criterion. Such an approach\nhelps to guide the RRH selection only based on the statistical channel state\ninformation (CSI), which does not require frequent update, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the computation overhead.

The purpose of paper can be summarized as: A) designing a\ncontroller to overcome CPLs instability; B) obtaining the sufficient conditions\nto guarantee the existence of the equilibria; C) Under the conditions of\nequilibria existing, obtaining the sufficient conditions of local stability.\nFor the first objective, the method based on virtual resistance and virtual\ninductance is proposed. For the second objective, we transform the problem of\nsolvability of quadratic equations into the existence of the fixed point of a\nmapping. Thus, the analytical sufficient conditions is obtained based on Tarski\nfixed point theorem. Moreover, a numerical method is also provided to reduce\nconservatism. For the third objective, the small-signal model is established to\npredict the system qualitative behavior around equilibria. The stability\nconditions are obtained by using quadratic eigenvalue problem (GEP) theorem.\nThese explicit conditions are obtained as a function of system parameters and\nit lead to build reliable microgrid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 10:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 14:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}
