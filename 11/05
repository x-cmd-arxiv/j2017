The APS stream is a sequence of\nstandard grayscale global-shutter image sensor frames. The DVS events represent\nbrightness changes occurring at a particular moment, with a jitter of about a\nmillisecond under most lighting conditions. They have a dynamic range of >120\ndB and effective frame rates >1 kHz at data rates comparable to 30 fps\n(frames/second) image sensors. To overcome some of the limitations of current\nimage acquisition technology, we investigate in this work the use of the\ncombined DVS and APS streams in end-to-end driving applications. The dataset\nDDD17 accompanying this paper is the first open dataset of annotated DAVIS\ndriving recordings. DDD17 has over 12 h of a 346x260 pixel DAVIS sensor\nrecording highway and city driving in daytime, evening, night, dry and wet\nweather conditions, along with vehicle speed, GPS position, driver steering,\nthrottle, and brake captured from the car's on-board diagnostics interface.

At the heart\nof the tension, however, is the fact that CDNs have rich information both about\nthe content they are serving and the users who are requesting that content.\nThis paper offers a technical contribution that is relevant to this ongoing\ntension with the design of an Oblivious CDN (OCDN); the system is both\ncompatible with the existing Web ecosystem of publishers and clients and hides\nfrom the CDN both the content it is serving and the users who are requesting\nthat content. OCDN is compatible with the way that publishers currently host\ncontent on CDNs. Using OCDN, publishers can use multiple CDNs to publish\ncontent; clients retrieve content through a peer-to-peer anonymizing network of\nproxies.

Here we\nintroduce a method for building such a set of users by using an\n\\emph{expand-classify} approach which begins with a small set of seed users\nfrom the target location and then iteratively collects their neighbors and then\nclassifies their locations. We perform this classification using maximum\nlikelihood estimation on a factor graph model which incorporates features of\nthe user profile and also social network connections. We show that maximum\nlikelihood estimation reduces to solving a minimum cut problem on an\nappropriately defined graph. We are able to obtain several thousand users\nwithin a few hours for many diverse locations using our approach. Using\ngeo-located data, we find that our approach typically achieves good accuracy\nfor population centers with less than 500,000 inhabitants, while for larger\ncities performance degrades somewhat. We also find that our approach is able to\ncollect many more users with higher accuracy than existing search methods.\nFinally, we show that by studying the content of location specific users\nobtained with our approach, we can identify the onset of significant social\nunrest in locations such as the Philippines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 19:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

An important accelerator were first\nindications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in\n1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key\nbenefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the\nDAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,\nanswer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D\nphase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the\nfirst one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this\nmeasurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low\ntemperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal\nin the form of scintillation light (in the light detector).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 19:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

This suggests that regular IR changes might lead to maser\nperiodicity. Hence, we scrutinized space-based IR imaging of YSOs associated\nwith periodic methanol masers. We succeeded to extract the IR light curve from\nNEOWISE data for the intermediate mass YSO G107.298+5.639. Thus, for the first\ntime a relationship between the maser and IR variability could be established.\nWhile the IR light curve shows the same period of ~34.6 days as the masers, its\nshape is distinct from that of the maser flares.

The usual procedure is to fit a model\nfor the longitudinal response in the healthy population, a different model for\nthe longitudinal response in disease population, and then apply the Bayes'\ntheorem to obtain disease probabilities given the responses. Unfortunately,\nwhen substantial heterogeneity exists within each population, this type of\nBayes classification may perform poorly. In this paper, we develop a new\napproach by fitting a Bayesian nonparametric model for the joint outcome of\ndisease status and longitudinal response, and then use the clustering induced\nby the Dirichlet process in our model to increase the flexibility of the\nmethod, allowing for multiple subpopulations of healthy, diseased, and possibly\nmixed membership. In addition, we introduce an MCMC sampling scheme that\nfacilitates the assessment of the inference and prediction capabilities of our\nmodel.

In this review, we clarify\nthe reasons for such divergence, some of which come from a lack of numerical\ntechniques, usage of old opacities, different assumptions for binary\nconfigurations, inadequate initial conditions, and unrealistic mass-loss\nmechanisms. We emphasize that these assumptions should be carefully chosen in\ncalculating the long-term evolution of accreting WDs. Importantly, the\nmass-loss mechanism is the key process determining the mass retention\nefficiency: the best approach involves correctly incorporating the optically\nthick wind because it is supported by the multiwavelength light curves of\nnovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 04:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 04:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The key ingredient of the ISDF\ndecomposition is to select a set of non-uniform grid points, so that the values\nof the orbital pairs evaluated at such grid points can be used to accurately\ninterpolate those evaluated at all grid points. The set of non-uniform grid\npoints, called the interpolation points, can be automatically selected by a QR\nfactorization with column pivoting (QRCP) procedure. This is the\ncomputationally most expensive step in the construction of the ISDF\ndecomposition. In this work, we propose a new approach to find the\ninterpolation points based on the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) method,\nwhich offers a much less expensive alternative to the QRCP procedure when ISDF\nis used in the context of hybrid functional electronic structure calculations.\nThe CVT method only uses information from the electron density, and can be\nefficiently implemented using a K-Means algorithm. We find that this new method\nachieves comparable accuracy to the ISDF-QRCP method, at a cost that is\nnegligible in the overall hybrid functional calculations. For instance, for a\nsystem containing $1000$ silicon atoms simulated using the HSE06 hybrid\nfunctional on $2000$ computational cores, the cost of QRCP-based method for\nfinding the interpolation points costs $434.2$ seconds, while the CVT procedure\nonly takes $3.2$ seconds. We also find that the ISDF-CVT method also enhances\nthe smoothness of the potential energy surface in the context of \\emph{ab\ninitio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with hybrid functionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 04:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Our data reveal two sets of absorption\nsystems, separated by 235 km/s, at redshifts matching the host galaxy, NGC3191\nand its companion galaxy 73 arcsec apart. Weakly damped Lyman-alpha absorption\nlines are detected at these two redshifts, with HI column densities of\n$(3.0\\pm0.8)\\times10^{19}$ and $(3.7\\pm0.9)\\times10^{19}$\\,cm$^{-2}$\nrespectively. This is an order of magnitude smaller than HI column densities in\nthe disks of nearby galaxies ($>10^{10}M_\\odot$) and suggests that SN2017egm is\non the near side of NGC3191 and has a low host extinction (E(B-V)=0.007). Using\nunsaturated metal absorption lines and taking into account of H ionization and\ndust depletion corrections, we find that the host of SN2017egm probably has a\nsolar or higher metallicity and is unlikely to be a dwarf companion to NGC3191.\nComparison of early-time UV spectra of SN2017egm, Gaia16apd, iPTF13ajg and\nPTF12dam finds that the continuum at wavelength > 2800A is well fit by a\nblackbody, whereas the continuum at wavelength < 2800A is considerably below\nthe model. The degree of UV suppression varies from source to source, with the\n1400A to 2800A continuum flux ratio of 1.5 for Gaia16apd and 0.4 for iPTF13ajg.\nThis can not be explained by the differences in magnetar power or blackbody\ntemperature (i.e. color temperature).

In recent years, a few dataless text\nclassification techniques have been proposed to address this problem. However,\nexisting works mainly center on single-label classification problems, that is,\neach document is restricted to belonging to a single category. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Seed-guided Multi-label Topic Model, named SMTM. With a few\nseed words relevant to each category, SMTM conducts multi-label classification\nfor a collection of documents without any labeled document. In SMTM, each\ncategory is associated with a single category-topic which covers the meaning of\nthe category. To accommodate with multi-labeled documents, we explicitly model\nthe category sparsity in SMTM by using spike and slab prior and weak smoothing\nprior.

Triton was most likely captured by Neptune and\ndestroyed the primordial regular satellite system. We investigate the\ninteractions between a newly captured Triton and a prior Neptunian satellite\nsystem. We find that a prior satellite system with a mass ratio similar to the\nUranian system or smaller has a substantial likelihood of reproducing the\ncurrent Neptunian system, while a more massive system has a low probability of\nleading to the current configuration. Moreover, Triton's interaction with a\nprior satellite system may offer a mechanism to decrease its high initial\nsemimajor axis fast enough to preserve small irregular satellites (Nereid-like)\nthat might otherwise be lost during a prolonged Triton circularization via\ntides alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 13:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Recent developments are the\nconsideration of pair correlations in the effective description, which lead to\na much more precise description of both spectral properties and the dynamics of\nthe Bose gas in the weak coupling limit. While mean-field results typically\nlead to convergence for the reduced density matrix only, one obtains norm\nconvergence when considering the pair correlations proposed by Bogoliubov in\nhis seminal 1947 paper. In this article we consider an interacting Bose gas in\nthe case where both the volume and the density of the gas tend to infinity\nsimultaneously. We assume that the coupling constant is such that the\nself-interaction of the fluctuations is of leading order, which leads to a\nfinite (non-zero) speed of sound in the gas. In our first main result we show\nthat the difference between the N-body and the Bogoliubov description is small\nin $L^2$ as the density of the gas tends to infinity and the volume does not\ngrow too fast. This describes the dynamics of delocalized excitations of the\norder of the volume.

At the time of Chandra observations, the pulsar was still\nbrighter by a factor of ~22 in comparison with its quiescence. The X-ray images\nreveal a nebula brighter than in the pre-burst Chandra observations (from 2002\nand 2004), with an unabsorbed flux of 2.2e-13 ergs/cm^-2/s.

The interaction between bradyon-tachyon, tachyon-tachyon and\ntachyon-luxon has also been considered and included in the total Lagrangian.\nThe obtained theory is consistent with the CPT invariance and the\nspin-statistics theorem and could explain the existence of new forms of matter\nnot predictable within the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 13:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 09:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 14:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

Most previous RC\nmethods are based on the conventional regression models, such as lasso\nregression, ridge regression or group lasso regression. These regression models\nessentially impose a predefined assumption on the distribution of the noise\nvariable in the query sample, such as the Gaussian or Laplacian distribution.\nHowever, the complicated noises in practice may violate the assumptions and\nimpede the performance of these RC methods. In this paper, we propose a modal\nregression based atomic representation and classification (MRARC) framework to\nalleviate such limitation. Unlike previous RC methods, the MRARC framework does\nnot require the noise variable to follow any specific predefined distributions.\nThis gives rise to the capability of MRARC in handling various complex noises\nin reality. Using MRARC as a general platform, we also develop four novel RC\nmethods for unimodal and multimodal face recognition, respectively. In\naddition, we devise a general optimization algorithm for the unified MRARC\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and\nhalf-quadratic theory. The experiments on real-world data validate the efficacy\nof MRARC for robust face recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 02:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}
