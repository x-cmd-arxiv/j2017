However, the visual-semantic mapping learnt based\non seen categories may not generalize well to unseen categories because the\ndata distributions between seen categories and unseen categories are\nconsiderably different, which is known as the projection domain shift problem\nin ZSL. To address this domain shift issue, we propose a method named Adaptive\nEmbedding ZSL (AEZSL) to learn an adaptive visual-semantic mapping for each\nunseen category based on the similarities between each unseen category and all\nthe seen categories. Then, we further make two extensions based on our AEZSL\nmethod. Firstly, in order to utilize the unlabeled test instances from unseen\ncategories, we extend our AEZSL to a semi-supervised approach named AEZSL with\nLabel Refinement (AEZSL_LR), in which a progressive approach is developed to\nupdate the visual classifiers and refine the predicted test labels\nalternatively based on the similarities among test instances and among unseen\ncategories. Secondly, to avoid learning visual-semantic mapping for each unseen\ncategory in the large-scale classification task, we extend our AEZSL to a deep\nadaptive embedding model named Deep AEZSL (DAEZSL) sharing the similar idea\n(i.e., visual-semantic mapping should be category-specific and related to the\nsemantic space) with AEZSL, which only needs to be trained once, but can be\napplied to arbitrary number of unseen categories.

Such progenitors are expected to have imminent or\nongoing major merging near the brightest group galaxy (BGG) that, when\nconcluded, will meet the fossil criteria within the look back time. Since\nstrong gravitational lensing preferentially selects groups merging along the\nline of sight, or systems with a high mass concentration like fossil systems,\nwe searched the CASSOWARY survey of strong lensing events with the goal of\ndetermining if lensing systems have any predisposition to being fossil systems\nor progenitors.

The\nextension was motivated to remedy the limitation of traditional SAR that only\naddress one aspect of biodiversity scaling, i.e., species richness scaling over\nspace. The extension was made possible by the fact that all Hill numbers are in\nunits of species (referred to as the effective number of species or as species\nequivalents), and I postulated that Hill numbers should follow the same or\nsimilar pattern of SAR. I selected three DAR models, the traditional power law\n(PL), PLEC (PL with exponential cutoff) and PLIEC (PL with inverse exponential\ncutoff). I defined three new concepts and derived their quantifications: (i)DAR\nprofile: z-q series where z is the PL scaling parameter at different diversity\norder (q); (ii)PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile: g-q series where g is\nthe PDO corresponding to q; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile:\nDmax-q series where Dmax is the MAD corresponding to q. Furthermore, the PDO-g\nis quantified based on the self-similarity property of the PL model, and Dmax\ncan be estimated from the PLEC parameters. The three profiles constitute a\nnovel DAR approach to biodiversity scaling. I verified the postulation with the\nAmerican gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1473 healthy North American\nindividuals (the largest human dataset from a single project to date). The PL\nmodel was preferred due to its simplicity and established ecological properties\nsuch as self-similarity (necessary for establishing PDO profile), and PLEC has\nan advantage in establishing the MAD profile.

Many existing methods of reducing\noverfitting are data-independent, and their efficacy is often limited when the\ntraining set is very small. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated\nby the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is\ntypically hard to parametrize explicitly and often requires human input of\ntangent vectors. These methods typically only focus on the geometry of the\ninput data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce\ngeometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose a new framework,\nthe Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which\nincorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of\nboth the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the\nnetwork by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output\nfeatures to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are\nsearched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we\ndirectly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational\nfunctional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami\nequation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method\nwithout increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate two benefits of\nLDMNet in the experiments. First, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms\nwidely-used network regularizers such as weight decay and DropOut. Second, we\nshow that LDMNet can be designed to extract common features of an object imaged\nvia different modalities, which proves to be very useful in real-world\napplications such as cross-spectral face recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 18:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

For instance, strain can be used to enhance the electron mobility\nof a semiconductor, enabling more efficient solar cells and smaller, faster\ntransistors. In the context of nanomechanics, the pursuit of resonators with\nultra-high coherence has led to intense study of a complementary strain\nengineering technique, \"dissipation dilution\", whereby the stiffness of a\nmaterial is effectively increased without added loss. Dissipation dilution is\nknown to underlie the anomalously high Q factor of Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomechanical\nresonators, including recently-developed \"soft-clamped\" resonators; however,\nthe paradigm has to date relied on weak strain produced during material\nsynthesis. By contrast, the use of geometric strain engineering techniques --\ncapable of producing local stresses near the material yield strength -- remains\nlargely unexplored. Here we show that geometric strain combined with\nsoft-clamping can produce unprecedentedly high Q nanomechanical resonators.\nSpecifically, using a spatially non-uniform phononic crystal pattern, we\ncolocalize the strain and flexural motion of a Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam, while\nincreasing the former to near the yield strength. This combined strategy\nproduces string-like modes with room-temperature Q$\\times$frequency products\napproaching $10^{15}$ Hz, an unprecedented value for a mechanical oscillator of\nany size. The devices we study can have force sensitivities of aN/rtHz, perform\nhundreds of quantum coherent oscillations at room temperature, and attain Q >\n400 million at radio frequencies. These results signal a paradigm shift in the\ncontrol of nanomechanical dissipation, with impact ranging from precision force\nmicroscopy to tests of quantum gravity. Combining the reported approach with\ncrystalline or 2D materials may lead to further improvement, of as yet unknown\nlimitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 18:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

The cloud-disk interaction produces two shocks, one\npropagates through the cloud and the other through the disk; the properties of\nthese shocks depend mainly on the cloud velocity and the disk-cloud density\nratio.

For fast\nsolar wind conditions, highly anisotropic field-aligned electrons, denominated\nas the \"strahl\" distribution, are also present. Motivated by these\nobservations, the present paper considers a tenuous plasma with Maxwellian\nions, and electrons described by a summation of an isotropic Maxwellian\ndistribution and an isotropic Kappa distribution. The formalism of weak\nturbulence theory is utilized in order to discuss the spectra of electrostatic\nwaves that must be present in such a plasma, satisfying conditions of\nquasi-equilibrium between processes of spontaneous fluctuations and of induced\nemission. The kappa index and relative density of the Kappa electron\ndistribution are varied. By taking into account effects due to electromagnetic\nwaves into the weak turbulence formalism, we investigate the electromagnetic\nspectra that satisfy conditions of \"turbulent equilibrium\", and also the time\nevolution of the wave spectra and of the electron distribution, which occurs in\nthe case of the presence of an electron beam in the electron distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 18:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

In February-March 2016, we performed the first\nX-ray microcalorimeter spectroscopy with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS)\nonboard the Hitomi satellite of the Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy NGC 1275\nat the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. With the high energy\nresolution of ~5 eV at 6 keV achieved by Hitomi/SXS, we detected the\nFe-K{\\alpha} line with ~5.4 {\\sigma} significance. The velocity width is\nconstrained to be 500-1600 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM for Gaussian models) at 90%\nconfidence. The SXS also constrains the continuum level from the NGC 1275\nnucleus up to ~20 keV, giving an equivalent width ~20 eV of the 6.4 keV line.\nBecause the velocity width is narrower than that of broad H{\\alpha} line of\n~2750 km s$^{-1}$, we can exclude a large contribution to the line flux from\nthe accretion disk and the broad line region. Furthermore, we performed pixel\nmap analyses on the Hitomi/SXS data and image analyses on the Chandra archival\ndata, and revealed that the Fe-K{\\alpha} line comes from a region within ~1.6\nkpc from the NGC 1275 core, where an active galactic nucleus emission\ndominates, rather than that from intracluster media. Therefore, we suggest that\nthe source of the Fe-K{\\alpha} line from NGC 1275 is likely a low-covering\nfraction molecular torus or a rotating molecular disk which probably extends\nfrom a pc to hundreds pc scale in the active galactic nucleus system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is used to\nextract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent\nstructures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent\nanalysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode\nnumbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by\nKelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer\nup to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the\nvery-near-nozzle shear layer.

At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and\nagain at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not\nlow rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes,\nwhich are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated\nwith the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in the range of\nfrequencies dominated by the KH response.

As a consequence of this research, families\nsuch as the family of Fiedler pencils, the family of generalized Fiedler\npencils (GFP), the family of Fiedler pencils with repetition, and the family of\ngeneralized Fiedler pencils with repetition (GFPR) were constructed. In\nparticular, one of the goals was to find in these families structured\nlinearizations of structured matrix polynomials. For example, if a matrix\npolynomial $P(\\lambda)$ is symmetric (Hermitian), it is convenient to use\nlinearizations of $P(\\lambda)$ that are also symmetric (Hermitian). Both the\nfamily of GFP and the family of GFPR contain block-symmetric linearizations of\n$P(\\lambda)$, which are symmetric (Hermitian) when $P(\\lambda)$ is.

The\nATLAS and CMS collaborations have looked for $Z^\\prime$ bosons assuming that\nthey can decay only into Standard Model channels, and have set exclusion limits\nby investigating dilepton, dijet and to a smaller extent top-antitop final\nstates. In this work we explore possible loopholes in these $Z^\\prime$ searches\nby studying supersymmetric as well as leptophobic scenarios. We demonstrate the\nexistence of realizations in which the $Z^\\prime$ boson automatically evades\nthe typical bounds derived from the analyses of the Drell-Yan invariant-mass\nspectrum. Dileptonic final states can in contrast only originate from\nsupersymmetric $Z^\\prime$ decays and are thus accompanied by additional\neffects. This feature is analyzed in the context of judiciously chosen\nbenchmark configurations, for which visible signals could be expected in future\nLHC data with a $4\\sigma-7\\sigma$ significance. Our results should hence\nmotivate an extension of the current $Z^\\prime$ search program to account for\nsupersymmetric and leptophobic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 13:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

We use both Planet and Digital Globe\nimagery with spatial resolutions of 3-5 sq. m. and 50 sq. cm. respectively,\ncovering all 2 million sq. km. of Mexico. Benchmark poverty estimates come from\nthe 2014 MCS-ENIGH combined with the 2015 Intercensus and are used to estimate\npoverty rates for 2,456 Mexican municipalities. CNNs are trained using the 896\nmunicipalities in the 2014 MCS-ENIGH. We experiment with several architectures\n(GoogleNet, VGG) and use GoogleNet as a final architecture where weights are\nfine-tuned from ImageNet. We find that 1) the best models, which incorporate\nsatellite-estimated land use as a predictor, explain approximately 57% of the\nvariation in poverty in a validation sample of 10 percent of MCS-ENIGH\nmunicipalities; 2) Across all MCS-ENIGH municipalities explanatory power\nreduces to 44% in a CNN prediction and landcover model; 3) Predicted poverty\nfrom the CNN predictions alone explains 47% of the variation in poverty in the\nvalidation sample, and 37% over all MCS-ENIGH municipalities; 4) In urban areas\nwe see slight improvements from using Digital Globe versus Planet imagery,\nwhich explain 61% and 54% of poverty variation respectively. We conclude that\nCNNs can be trained end-to-end on satellite imagery to estimate poverty,\nalthough there is much work to be done to understand how the training process\ninfluences out of sample validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 21:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

Nevertheless, little has been said about its use in\nthe context of AllSAT problems: problems where we are interested in listing all\nthe models of a Boolean formula. AllSAT has gained much popularity in recent\nyears due to its many applications in domains like model checking, data mining,\netc. One example of a particularly transparent application of AllSAT to other\nfields of computer science is computational Ramsey theory. In this paper we\nstudy the effect of incorporating Shatter to the workflow of using Boolean\nformulas to generate all possible edge colorings of a graph avoiding prescribed\nmonochromatic subgraphs. Generating complete sets of colorings is an important\nbuilding block in computational Ramsey theory. We identify two drawbacks in the\nna\\\"ive use of Shatter to break the symmetries of Boolean formulas encoding\nRamsey-type problems for graphs: a \"blow-up\" in the number of models and the\ngeneration of incomplete sets of colorings. The issues presented in this work\nare not intended to discourage the use of Shatter as a preprocessing tool for\nAllSAT problems in combinatorial computing but to help researchers properly use\nthis tool by avoiding these potential pitfalls. To this end, we provide\nstrategies and additional tools to cope with the negative effects of using\nShatter for AllSAT. While the specific application addressed in this paper is\nthat of Ramsey-type problems, the analysis we carry out applies to many other\nareas in which highly-symmetrical Boolean formulas arise and we wish to find\nall of their models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 00:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

The optimal solutions to such tasks are\nheavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the\nconfiguration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches,\nhowever, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort\nsearching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search\nstrategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the\ninformation uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a\nproblem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given\niteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning\naction. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial information based\npolicies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key\ninsight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would\neasily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a\nnovel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning\npolicies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that at train time has\nfull knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We\nleverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently\ncomputed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy.

In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for\n3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that\nunifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage,\nend-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud\ninto equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each\nvoxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel\nfeature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a\ndescriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to\ngenerate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that\nVoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a\nlarge margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative\nrepresentation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging\nresults in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 04:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

We show that there is\na new kind of curvature-induced force that acts between nano-corrugated\nelectrically neutral plasmonic surfaces. Absent in flat surfaces, such a force\nowes its existence entirely to geometric curvature, and originates from the\nkinetic energy associated with the electron density which tends to make the\nprofile of the electron density smoother than that of the ionic background and\nhence induces curvature-induced local charges. Such a force cannot be found\nusing standard classical electromagnetic approaches, and we use a\nself-consistent hydrodynamics model as well as first principles density\nfunctional calculations to explore the character of such forces.

However,\nmost existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between\ndifferent styles, and the learned model is thus not generalizable to new\nstyles. We here attempt to separate the representations for styles and\ncontents, and propose a generalized style transfer network consisting of style\nencoder, content encoder, mixer and decoder. The style encoder and content\nencoder are used to extract the style and content factors from the style\nreference images and content reference images, respectively. The mixer employs\na bilinear model to integrate the above two factors and finally feeds it into a\ndecoder to generate images with target style and content. To separate the style\nfeatures and content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of styles\nand contents given an image. During training, the encoder network learns to\nextract styles and contents from two sets of reference images in limited size,\none with shared style and the other with shared content. This learning\nframework allows simultaneous style transfer among multiple styles and can be\ndeemed as a special `multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected\nto capture the underlying features for different styles and contents which is\ngeneralizable to new styles and contents. For validation, we applied the\nproposed algorithm to the Chinese Typeface transfer problem.

Surprisingly, the optimal\nplacement of these game changers is found to be in regions of maximum local\ncrowd speed. The presence of such game changers is effective owing to the\ndiscontinuous nature of the underlying phase transition.

So we propose to\nmodel user preference jointly with user behavior ID features and behavior\nimages. However, training with user behavior images brings tens to hundreds of\nimages in one sample, giving rise to a great challenge in both communication\nand computation. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient\ndistributed machine learning paradigm called Advanced Model Server (AMS). With\nthe well known Parameter Server (PS) framework, each server node handles a\nseparate part of parameters and updates them independently. AMS goes beyond\nthis and is designed to be capable of learning a unified image descriptor model\nshared by all server nodes which embeds large images into low dimensional high\nlevel features before transmitting images to worker nodes. AMS thus\ndramatically reduces the communication load and enables the arduous joint\ntraining process. Based on AMS, the methods of effectively combining the images\nand ID features are carefully studied, and then we propose a Deep Image CTR\nModel. Our approach is shown to achieve significant improvements in both online\nand offline evaluations, and has been deployed in Taobao display advertising\nsystem serving the main traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 11:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 09:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

We propose the use of a\nnew material, polyurethane, for waveguides that allows high flexibility,\novercoming the problem that large sizes otherwise result in rigid structures.\nWith this material we realize antiresonant hollow-core waveguides and we use\nthe flexibility of the material to mechanically twist the waveguide in a\ntunable and reversible manner, with twist periods as short as tens of\nwavelengths. Twisting the waveguide, we demonstrate the generation of modes\ncarrying orbital angular momentum.

The proposed waveguide is a new platform offering new\nperspectives for THz guidance and particularly mode manipulation.

Results\nhave already been obtained on the Riemann sphere and on the unit disk so this\npaper will follow the same approach. The case of the annulus contains two\ndifficulties: it is a surface with two boundaries and it has a non-trivial\nmoduli space. We recover the Weyl anomaly - a formula verified by all CFT - and\ndeduce from it the KPZ formula. We also show that the full partition function\nof Liouville quantum gravity integrated over the moduli space is finite.

It follows that (up to certain not yet discarded unitarily related\nsystems) the only irreducible causal systems are the Dirac and the Weyl\nfermions. Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal\nlocalization. - The bounded localized Dirac and Weyl wavefunctions are studied\nin detail. One finds that, at the speed of light, the carriers shrink in the\npast and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a definite\ntime at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing\ntime characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in\nthe opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one\nshows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz\ncontraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question\nwhether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus\nprovides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike\nhyperplanes. The causal logic generated by the spacelike relation is shown to\ndo not admit representations at all. But the logic generated by the\nnon-timelike relation in general does, and the necessary condition is derived\nthat there is a projection valued measure on every non-timelike non-spacelike\nhyperplane being the high boost limit of the localization on the spacelike\nhyperplanes. Dirac and Weyl systems are shown to satisfy this condition and\nthus to extend to all non-timelike hyperplanes, which implies more profound\nproperties of the causal systems. The bounded localized eigenstates of the\nprojections to non-spacelike flat strips are late-change states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 14:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 13:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 09:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

One implication is\nthat substantial variance (sensitivity) reduction is possible at little cost if\nthe robustness parameter is properly calibrated. To this end, we introduce the\nnotion of a robust mean-variance frontier to select the robustness parameter\nand show that it can be approximated using resampling methods like the\nbootstrap.

The\nproblems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,\nhorizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform\npick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case\nwhere the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For\noverlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of\npick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the\nend-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize\nthe travel distance of the end-effector. While such problems do not involve all\nthe complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard in\nboth cases. This is shown through reductions from well-understood, hard\ncombinatorial challenges to these rearrangement problems. The reductions are\nalso shown to hold in the reverse direction, which enables the convenient\napplication on rearrangement of well studied algorithms. These algorithms can\nbe very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds on\nthese reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with the\nrearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation, including hardware-based\ntrials, shows that the proposed pipeline computes high-quality paths with\nregards to the optimization objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly\ndesirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both the\noverlapping and non-overlapping setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 15:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}
