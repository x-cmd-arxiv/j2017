In this paper, we introduce a random forest semantic\nhashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into\nshallow random forests, with near-optimal information-theoretic code\naggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme, where random\ntrees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting `1' for the visited tree\nleaf, and `0' for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to\ngenerate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees,\nrendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this,\nwe propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node\ninto two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification\nproblem, which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such\nrandom class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to\nshare its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional\nlow-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code\nconsistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class\ndistance for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an\ninformation-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a\nsingle hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The\nproposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods\nfor image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets, while performing at\nthe level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while\nutilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation.

In this work we employ the\nNon-Equilibrium Greens Function (NEGF) quantum transport method to calculate\nthe electronic and thermoelectric coefficients of materials embedded with\nnanoinclusions. For computational effectiveness we consider two-dimensional\nnanoribbon geometries, however, the method includes the details of geometry,\nelectron-phonon interactions, quantisation, tunneling, and the ballistic to\ndiffusive nature of transport, all combined in a unified approach. This makes\nit a convenient and accurate way to understand electronic and thermoelectric\ntransport in nanomaterials, beyond semiclassical approximations, and beyond\napproximations that deal with the complexities of the geometry.

In\nbroadband systems, it is desirable to design common analog beamformer for the\nentire band while employing different digital beamformers in different\nfrequency sub-bands. This paper considers hybrid beamforming design for systems\nwith OFDM modulation. First, for a SU-MIMO system where the hybrid beamforming\narchitecture is employed at both transmitter and receiver, we show that hybrid\nbeamforming with a small number of RF chains can asymptotically approach the\nperformance of fully-digital beamforming for a sufficiently large number of\ntransceiver antennas due to the sparse nature of the mmWave channels. For\nsystems with a practical number of antennas, we then propose a unified\nheuristic design for two different hybrid beamforming structures, the\nfully-connected and the partially-connected structures, to maximize the overall\nspectral efficiency of a mmWave MIMO system. Numerical results are provided to\nshow that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing hybrid beamforming\nmethods and for the fully-connected architecture the proposed algorithm can\nachieve spectral efficiency very close to that of the optimal fully-digital\nbeamforming but with much fewer RF chains. Second, for the MU-MISO case, we\npropose a heuristic hybrid percoding design to maximize the weighted sum rate\nin the downlink and show numerically that the proposed algorithm with practical\nnumber of RF chains can already approach the performance of fully-digital\nbeamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 17:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

Concretely, I considered an $U(1)_\\text{A}\\times\nU(1)_\\text{V}$-Einstein-Maxwell bottom-up model consisting of two massless\ngauge fields, coupled by a Chern-Simons term in the fivedimensional AdS\nspacetime. The two gauge fields provide a time dependent electric field and a\nstatic magnetic field, parallel to it. As response of the system to quench, I\ninvestigated the electromagnetic current in direction of the magnetic field\nwhich is generated due to the CME. In the first part of the thesis, I\ncharacterised the initial response of the system, in a fixed Schwarzschild AdS\nbackground, subjected to a 'fast' quench. The corresponding hyperbolic PDE is\nsolved by means of a fully spectral code in spaces as well as in time\ndirection. Note that this was the first application of a fully spectral code\nwithin holography. In the case of 'fast' quenches, the system exhibits an\nuniversal scaling behaviour, independent of the external parameters as the\nstrength of the anomaly and the magnetic field, respectively. The late time\nbehaviour of the system shows, depending on the quench and external parameters,\nin some cases long lived oscillations in the current. Furthermore, I computed\nthe quasi-normal modes of the systems, including the backreaction of the matter\nfields on the background metric.

When a constant quadrupolar modulation is fitted to\ndata in the range 0.005 < k Mpc < 0.008, its preferred directions are found to\nbe related to the cosmic hemispherical asymmetry and the CMB dipole. To\ndetermine the significance we apply two test statistics to our reconstructions\nof the quadrupolar modulation from data, against reconstructions of\nrealisations of noise only. With a test statistic sensitive only to the\namplitude of the modulation, the reconstructions from the multipole range 30 <\nl < 1200 are unusual with 2.1 sigma significance. With the second test\nstatistic, sensitive also to the direction, the significance rises to 6.9\nsigma. Our approach is easily generalised to include other data sets such as\npolarisation, large-scale structure and forthcoming 21-cm line observations\nwhich will enable these anomalies to be investigated further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 18:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 14:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

This ordering is based on viewing the non-zero\nelements of a symmetric positive definite matrix as edges of an undirected\ngraph, and aims at reducing the additional non-zeros (fill) in the matrix by\nrepeatedly removing the vertex of minimum degree. It is one of the most widely\nused primitives for pre-processing sparse matrices in scientific computing.\n  Our result is in part motivated by the observation that sub-quadratic time\nalgorithms for finding min-degree orderings are unlikely, assuming the strong\nexponential time hypothesis (SETH). This provides justification for the lack of\nprovably efficient algorithms for generating such orderings, and leads us to\nstudy speedups via degree-restricted algorithms as well as approximations. Our\ntwo main results are: (1) an algorithm that produces a min-degree ordering\nwhose maximum degree is bounded by $\\Delta$ in $O(m \\Delta \\log^3{n})$ time,\nand (2) an algorithm that finds an $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximate marginal\nmin-degree ordering in $O(m \\log^{5}n \\epsilon^{-2})$ time.\n  Both of our algorithms rely on a host of randomization tools related to the\n$\\ell_0$-estimator by [Cohen `97].

Previous modeling of the impact of\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an\nEarth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in\nozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more\nrealistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law distribution of\nenergies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model\nto investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and\nsurface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field.\nWe use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined\nwith flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 10$^{30.5}$ to\n10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star\nGJ1243. Our model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on\nthe ozone column depth, but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the\nozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with\nnominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet\ncan be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery\nunlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3\ndepletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$ of UV-C at the planet's surface,\nwhich is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that\nactive M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the\nsurface of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation\nthat can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude\nhabitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 19:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

First, we generalize the treatment by\nforgoing the use of a single chemical timescale, instead developing a pathway\nanalysis tool that allows us to identify the rate-limiting reaction as a\nfunction of temperature and pressure.

We also propose a Feature Map Decoder as part of the interpretation\nanalysis, which outputs a representation of model's hidden variables in the\nsame domain as the input. Such analysis empowers us to expose model's\ncharacteristic learning patterns in an interpretable way. For example, through\nthe diagnosis analysis, we discovered that our model has learned to achieve\nview-point invariance by implicitly learning to perform rotational\nnormalization of the input to a more discriminative view. Based on the findings\nfrom the model interpretation analysis, we propose a targeted refinement\ntechnique, which can generalize to various other recognition models. The\nproposed work introduces a three-stage paradigm for model learning: training,\ninterpretable diagnosis and targeted refinement. We validate our approach on\nskeleton based 3D human action recognition benchmark of NTU RGB+D. We show that\nthe proposed workflow is an effective model learning strategy and the resulting\nMulti-stream Residual Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-Res-TCN) achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 20:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

There are a number of authentication protocols that\nare strong enough to verify identities and protect traditional networked\napplications.

Geometry modulates cell populations collectively through the evolving\nspace available to the cells, but it may also modulate the individual\nbehaviours of cells. To factor out the collective influence of geometry and\ngain access to the geometric regulation of individual cell behaviours, we\ndevelop a mathematical model of the infilling of cortical bone pores and use it\nwith available experimental data on cortical infilling rates. Testing different\npossible modes of geometric controls of individual cell behaviours consistent\nwith the experimental data, we find that efficient smoothing of irregular pores\nonly occurs when cell secretory rate is controlled by porosity rather than\ncurvature.

Multi-level cell (MLC)\nPCM offers high density with low per-byte fabrication cost. However, despite\nmany advantages, such as scalability and low leakage, the energy for\nprogramming intermediate states is considerably larger than programing\nsingle-level cell PCM. In this paper, we study encoding techniques to reduce\nwrite energy for MLC PCM when the encoding granularity is lowered below the\ntypical cache line size. We observe that encoding data blocks at small\ngranularity to reduce write energy actually increases the write energy because\nof the auxiliary encoding bits. We mitigate this adverse effect by 1) designing\nsuitable codeword mappings that use fewer auxiliary bits and 2) proposing a new\nWord-Level Compression (WLC) which compresses more than 91% of the memory lines\nand provides enough room to store the auxiliary data using a novel restricted\ncoset encoding applied at small data block granularities.\n  Experimental results show that the proposed encoding at 16-bit data\ngranularity reduces the write energy by 39%, on average, versus the leading\nencoding approach for write energy reduction. Furthermore, it improves\nendurance by 20% and is more reliable than the leading approach.

On the other hand,\napplying 2D CNN with generalizable features to 2D slices ignores between-slice\ninformation. Coupling 2D network with LSTM to further handle the between-slice\ninformation is not optimal due to the difficulty in LSTM learning. To overcome\nthe above challenges, we propose a 3D Anisotropic Hybrid Network (AH-Net) that\ntransfers convolutional features learned from 2D images to 3D anisotropic\nvolumes. Such a transfer inherits the desired strong generalization capability\nfor within-slice information while naturally exploiting between-slice\ninformation for more effective modelling.

We studied the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in\ndifferent states of the flare during MJD 57530 - 57589 using simultaneous\nmultiwaveband data to understand the possible broadband emission scenario\nduring the flare. Methods : The UV/optical and X-ray data from UVOT and XRT\nrespectively on board Swift and high energy $\\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT\nare used to generate multiwaveband lightcurves as well as to obtain high flux\nstates and quiescent state SEDs. The correlation and lag between different\nenergy bands is quantified using discrete correlation function.

Although the recent success of deep networks has\nled many state-of-the-art methods for 3D pose estimation to train deep networks\nend-to-end to predict from images directly, the top-performing approaches have\nshown the effectiveness of dividing the task of 3D pose estimation into two\nsteps: using a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimator to estimate the 2D pose from\nimages and then mapping them into 3D space. They also showed that a\nlow-dimensional representation like 2D locations of a set of joints can be\ndiscriminative enough to estimate 3D pose with high accuracy. However,\nestimation of 3D pose for individual frames leads to temporally incoherent\nestimates due to independent error in each frame causing jitter. Therefore, in\nthis work we utilize the temporal information across a sequence of 2D joint\nlocations to estimate a sequence of 3D poses.

With the presence of unknown multipath\nfading, the proposed receiver blindly performs joint channel estimation and\ndata decoding without knowing the user activity in the network.

The D-dimensional data\ndistribution is factorized into an autoregressive product of one-dimensional\nconditional distributions according to the chain rule. Data completion is a\nmore involved task than data generation: the model must infer missing variables\nfor any partially observed input vector. Previous work introduced an\norder-agnostic training procedure for data completion with autoregressive\nmodels. Missing variables in any partially observed input vector can be imputed\nefficiently by choosing an ordering where observed dimensions precede\nunobserved ones and by computing the autoregressive product in this order. In\nthis paper, we provide evidence that the order-agnostic (OA) training procedure\nis suboptimal for data completion. We propose an alternative procedure (OA++)\nthat reaches better performance in fewer computations. It can handle all data\ncompletion queries while training fewer one-dimensional conditional\ndistributions than the OA procedure. In addition, these one-dimensional\nconditional distributions are trained proportionally to their expected usage at\ninference time, reducing overfitting. Finally, our OA++ procedure can exploit\nprior knowledge about the distribution of inference completion queries, as\nopposed to OA. We support these claims with quantitative experiments on\nstandard datasets used to evaluate autoregressive generative models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 07:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

However, there have been few positive results of deep models on ad-hoc\nretrieval tasks. This is partially due to the fact that many important\ncharacteristics of the ad-hoc retrieval task have not been well addressed in\ndeep models yet. Typically, the ad-hoc retrieval task is formalized as a\nmatching problem between two pieces of text in existing work using deep models,\nand treated equivalent to many NLP tasks such as paraphrase identification,\nquestion answering and automatic conversation. However, we argue that the\nad-hoc retrieval task is mainly about relevance matching while most NLP\nmatching tasks concern semantic matching, and there are some fundamental\ndifferences between these two matching tasks. Successful relevance matching\nrequires proper handling of the exact matching signals, query term importance,\nand diverse matching requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nrelevance matching model (DRMM) for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, our model\nemploys a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance\nmatching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network,\nand a term gating network, we can effectively deal with the three relevance\nmatching factors mentioned above. Experimental results on two representative\nbenchmark collections show that our model can significantly outperform some\nwell-known retrieval models as well as state-of-the-art deep matching models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

We present here the\nsecond part of a study investigating the evolution of large-scale surface\nmagnetic fields in this critical time period. We observed stars in open\nclusters and stellar associations with known ages between 120 and 650 Myr, and\nused spectropolarimetry and Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize their\nlarge-scale magnetic field strength and geometry.

There is some\ntentative evidence for saturation of the large-scale magnetic field strength at\nRossby numbers below 0.1, although the saturation point is not yet well\ndefined.

This lightcurve is initially dominated by a\nmonth-long extinction event and return to the unocculted brightness.

The unbalanced load\ndistribution on the controllers will increase response delay for processing\nflows and reduce the controllers'throughput. Switch migration is an effective\napproach to solve the problem. However, existing schemes focus only on the load\nbalancing performance but ignore migration efficiency, which may result in high\nmigration costs and unnecessary control overheads. This paper proposes\nEfficiency-Aware Switch Migration (EASM) to balance the controllers'loads and\nimprove migration efficiency. We introduce load difference matrix and trigger\nfactor to measure load balancing on controllers.

Yet, the local APE framework offers the\nadvantage of providing a positive definite local form of potential energy,\nwhich like kinetic energy can be transported, converted, and created/dissipated\nlocally. In contrast to Lorenz's definition, which relies on the exact from of\npotential energy, the local APE theory uses the particular form of potential\nenergy appropriate to the approximations considered. In this paper, this idea\nis illustrated for the dry hydrostatic primitive equations, whose relevant form\nof potential energy is the specific enthalpy. The local APE density is\nnon-quadratic in general, but can nevertheless be partitioned exactly into mean\nand eddy components regardless of the Reynolds averaging operator used.\n  This paper introduces a new form of the local APE that is easily computable\nfrom atmospheric datasets. The advantages of using the local APE over the\nclassical Lorenz APE are highlighted. The paper also presents the first\ncalculation of the three-dimensional local APE in observation-based atmospheric\ndata. Finally, it illustrates how the eddy and mean components of the local APE\ncan be used to study regional and temporal variability in the large-scale\ncirculation. It is revealed that advection from high latitudes is necessary to\nsupply APE into the storm track regions, and that Greenland and Ross Sea, which\nhave suffered from rapid land ice and sea ice loss in recent decades, are\nparticularly susceptible to APE variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 11:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

This result does not hold in the\ncase of qubits, because of the unavoidable negativity of any Wigner function\nrepresentation of qubit stabiliser quantum mechanics. In this work we define\nand characterise the subtheories of Spekkens' theory that are operationally\nequivalent to subtheories of stabiliser quantum mechanics. We use these\nSpekkens' subtheories as a unifying framework for the known examples of\nstate-injection schemes where contextuality is an injected resource to reach\nuniversal quantum computation. In addition, we prove that, in the case of\nqubits, stabiliser quantum mechanics can be reduced to a Spekkens' subtheory in\nthe sense that all its objects that do not belong to the Spekkens' subtheory,\nnamely non-covariant Clifford gates, can be injected. This shows that within\nSpekkens' subtheories we possess the toolbox to perform state-injection of\nevery object outside of them and it suggests that there is no need to use\nbigger subtheories to reach universal quantum computation via state-injection.\nWe conclude with a novel scheme of computation suggested by our approach which\nis based on the injection of CCZ states and we also relate different proofs of\ncontextuality to different state injections of non-covariant gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 12:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 09:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Traditional techniques to this problem focus\non constructing handcrafted features to explore the discriminative information\ncontained in facial appearance and dynamics separately. This relies on\nsophisticated feature-refinement and framework-design. In this paper, we\npresent an end-to-end architecture for age estimation, called Spatially-Indexed\nAttention Model (SIAM), which is able to simultaneously learn both the\nappearance and dynamics of age from raw videos of facial expressions.\nSpecifically, we employ convolutional neural networks to extract effective\nlatent appearance representations and feed them into recurrent networks to\nmodel the temporal dynamics. More importantly, we propose to leverage attention\nmodels for salience detection in both the spatial domain for each single image\nand the temporal domain for the whole video as well. We design a specific\nspatially-indexed attention mechanism among the convolutional layers to extract\nthe salient facial regions in each individual image, and a temporal attention\nlayer to assign attention weights to each frame. This two-pronged approach not\nonly improves the performance by allowing the model to focus on informative\nframes and facial areas, but it also offers an interpretable correspondence\nbetween the spatial facial regions as well as temporal frames, and the task of\nage estimation.

This result show that under these conditions, the considered\nclass of continuous prior can be competitive with the usual two-group model\n(e.g. spike and slab priors). We also show that if the non-zeros component of\nthe parameter are large enough, the minimax risk can be made asymptotically\nnull. The separation rates obtained are consistent with the one that could be\nguessed from the existing literature (see van der Pas et al., 2017b). For both\nproblems, we then give conditions under which an adaptive version of the result\ncan be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 14:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

We\napproximate the bow shock by a statistical distribution of planar shocks\ncomputed with a magnetized shock model. We improve on previous works by\nconsidering arbitrary bow shapes, a finite irradiation field, and by including\nthe age effect of non-stationary C-type shocks on the excitation diagram and\nline profiles of H2.

Theoretical templates of\nexpected signals from such systems have been used to filter the detector data\nusing the \\emph{matched filtering} technique. An efficient grid over the\nparameter space at a fixed minimal match has a direct impact on improving the\ncomputational efficiency of these searches. We present the construction of\nthree-dimensional template banks (in component masses and an effective spin\nparameter) by incorporating several new optimizations to the hybrid\ngeometric-random template placement algorithm that we proposed recently. These\noptimizations allow us to create more efficient template banks in future\ncompact binary searches by shrinking the hybrid banks by $\\sim 34\\%$ in\ncomparison to the basic algorithm. Such optimized banks are also found to be\n$\\sim 22\\%$ smaller than the optimized stochastic bank constructed over a\nnominal range of parameters. We also construct an explicit hybrid template bank\nwith parameters identical to the `uber-bank' used in the recently-concluded CBC\nsearches in the second observation run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo\ndetectors. We demonstrate a reduction of more than 53,000 templates over the\nstochastic template bank at a near-identical coverage as determined by fitting\nfactor studies. A computationally efficient technique for semi-numerical\ncalculation of the parameter space metric, applicable for aligned-spin waveform\nfamily, is also outlined. The resulting hybrid template banks can be generated\nmuch faster in comparison to the stochastic banks, and are ready to be used in\nthe upcoming observation runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 15:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 13:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

The proposed bootstrap CUSUM test is\nfully data-dependent and it has strong theoretical guarantees under arbitrary\ndependence structures and mild moment conditions.

We explore three typical electron densities,\ndilute - where spatial correlations between polarons is weak, intermediate -\nwhere correlations are significant, and half-filling - where there is long\nrange checkerboard order at low temperature. We use two methods both of which\nexploit the \"slowness\" of the phonons to handle the problem.

Experimental results suggest that in fact, there is no\ncorrelation between the reconstruction score and the quality of features for a\nclassification task. This means, more formally, that the sub-dimension\nrepresentation space learned from the Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (while\nbeing trained for input reconstruction) is not necessarily better separable\nthan the initial input space. Furthermore, we show that the reconstruction\nerror is not a good metric to assess the quality of features, because it is\nbiased by the decoder quality.

Despite their wide applications, the PNP equations\nfail in predicting dynamics and equilibrium states of ionic concentrations in\nconfined environments, due to the ignorance of the excluded volume effect. In\nthis work, a simple but effective modified PNP (MPNP) model with the excluded\nvolume effect is derived, based on a modification of diffusion coefficients of\nions. At the steady state, a modified Poisson--Boltzmann (MPB) equation is\nobtained with the help of the Lambert-W special function. The existence and\nuniqueness of a weak solution to the MPB equation are established. Further\nanalysis on the limit of weak and strong electrostatic potential leads to two\nmodified Debye screening lengths, respectively. A numerical scheme that\nconserves total ionic concentration and satisfies energy dissipation is\ndeveloped for the MPNP model. Numerical analysis is performed to prove that our\nscheme respects ionic mass conservation and satisfies a corresponding discrete\nfree energy dissipation law. Positivity of numerical solutions is also\ndiscussed and numerically investigated. Numerical tests are conducted to\ndemonstrate that the scheme is of second-order accurate in spatial\ndiscretization and has expected properties. Extensive numerical simulations\nreveal that the excluded volume effect has pronounced impacts on the dynamics\nof ionic concentration and flux. In addition, the effect of volume exclusion on\nthe timescales of charge diffusion is systematically investigated by studying\nthe evolution of free energies and diffuse charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 12:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}
