As applied to solid-state tunnelling (SST), this\nphysical law was verified, within the field of spintronics, regarding the\nelectron spin in early experiments across Ge tunnel barriers, and in the 90s\nacross Al2O3 barriers. The conservation of the quantum parameter of orbital\noccupancy, as grouped into electronic symmetries, was observed in the '00s\nacross MgO barriers, followed by SrTiO3 (STO). Barrier defects, such as oxygen\nvacancies, partly conserve this electronic symmetry. In the solid-state, an\nadditional subtlety is the sign of the charge carrier: are holes or electrons\ninvolved in transport? We demonstrate that SST across MgO magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) with a large resistance-area (RA) product involves holes by\nexamining how shifting the MTJ's Fermi level alters the ensuing barrier heights\ndefined by the barrier's oxygen vacancies. In the process, we consolidate the\ndescription of tunnel barrier heights induced by specific oxygen-vacancy\ninduced localized states.

Historically, such models have\nconsidered species individually. However, it is well-established that species\ninteract to influence presence-absence and abundance (envisioned as biotic\nfactors). As a result, there has been substantial recent interest in joint\nspecies distribution models with various types of response, e.g.,\npresence-absence, continuous and ordinal data. Such models incorporate\ndependence between species response as a surrogate for interaction.\n  The challenge we focus on here is how to address such modeling in the context\nof a large number of species (e.g., order 102) across sites numbering in the\norder of 102 or 103 when, in practice, only a few species are found at any\nobserved site. Again, there is some recent literature to address this; we adopt\na dimension reduction approach. The novel wrinkle we add here is spatial\ndependence. That is, we have a collection of sites over a relatively small\nspatial region so it is anticipated that species distribution at a given site\nwould be similar to that at a nearby site. Specifically, we handle dimension\nreduction through Dirichlet processes joined with spatial dependence through\nGaussian processes.\n  We use both simulated data and a plant communities dataset for the Cape\nFloristic Region (CFR) of South Africa to demonstrate our approach. The latter\nconsists of presence-absence measurements for 639 tree species on 662\nlocations. Through both data examples we are able to demonstrate improved\npredictive performance using the foregoing specification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:13:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 04:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 22:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Though numerous SSL classification and\nprediction procedures have been proposed in recent years, no methods currently\nexist to evaluate the prediction performance of a working regression model. In\nthe context of developing phenotyping algorithms derived from electronic\nmedical records (EMR), we present an efficient two-step estimation procedure\nfor evaluating a binary classifier based on various prediction performance\nmeasures in the semi-supervised (SS) setting. In step I, the labeled data is\nused to obtain a non-parametrically calibrated estimate of the conditional risk\nfunction. In step II, SS estimates of the prediction accuracy parameters are\nconstructed based on the estimated conditional risk function and the unlabeled\ndata. We demonstrate that under mild regularity conditions the proposed\nestimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Importantly, the\nasymptotic variance of the SS estimators is always smaller than that of the\nsupervised counterparts under correct model specification. We also correct for\npotential overfitting bias in the SS estimators in finite sample with\ncross-validation and develop a perturbation resampling procedure to approximate\ntheir distributions. Our proposals are evaluated through extensive simulation\nstudies and illustrated with two real EMR studies aiming to develop phenotyping\nalgorithms for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 16:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

One of\nthe most successful frameworks for understanding the simplex method was given\nby Spielman and Teng (JACM `04), who developed the notion of smoothed analysis.\nStarting from an arbitrary linear program with $d$ variables and $n$\nconstraints, Spielman and Teng analyzed the expected runtime over random\nperturbations of the LP (smoothed LP), where variance $\\sigma^2$ Gaussian noise\nis added to the LP data. In particular, they gave a two-stage shadow vertex\nsimplex algorithm which uses an expected $\\widetilde{O}(d^{55} n^{86}\n\\sigma^{-30})$ number of simplex pivots to solve the smoothed LP. Their\nanalysis and runtime was substantially improved by Deshpande and Spielman (FOCS\n`05) and later Vershynin (SICOMP `09). The fastest current algorithm, due to\nVershynin, solves the smoothed LP using an expected $O(d^3 \\sigma^{-4} \\log^3 n\n+ d^9\\log^7 n)$ number of pivots, improving the dependence on $n$ from\npolynomial to poly-logarithmic.\n  While the original proof of Spielman and Teng has now been substantially\nsimplified, the resulting analyses are still quite long and complex and the\nparameter dependencies far from optimal. In this work, we make substantial\nprogress on this front, providing an improved and simpler analysis of shadow\nsimplex methods, where our algorithm requires an expected \\[ O(d^2 \\sqrt{\\log\nn} \\sigma^{-2} + d^3 \\log^{3/2} n) \\] number of simplex pivots. We obtain our\nresults via an improved \\emph{shadow bound}, key to earlier analyses as well,\ncombined with improvements on algorithmic techniques of Vershynin.

The UV regulator is to be taken away by\nrenormalisation group techniques which in case of success leads to a measure on\nthe space of generalised Euclidian fields in finite volume. The IR regulator\ncorresponds to the thermodynamic limit of the system in the statistical physics\nsense. If the resulting measure obeys the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, the\nactual QFT on Minkowski space is then obtained by Osterwalder-Schrader\nreconstruction. In this work we study the question whether it is possible to\nreformulate the renormalisation group non-perturbatively directly at the\noperator (Hamiltonian) level. Hamiltonian renormalisation would be the natural\nroute to follow if one had easier access to an interacting Hamiltonian operator\nrather than to a path integral, at least in the presence of UV and/or IR\ncut-off, which is generically the case in complicated gauge theories such as\nGeneral Relativity. Our guiding principle for the definition of the direct\nHamiltonian renormalisation group is that it results in the same continuum\ntheory as the covariant (path integral) renormalisation group. In order to\nachieve this, we invert the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction, which may be\ncalled Osterwalder-Schrader construction of a Wiener measure from the\nunderlying Hamiltonian theory. The resulting correspondence between reflection\npositive measures and Osterwalder-Schrader data consisting of a Hilbert space,\na Hamiltonian and a ground state vector allows us to monitor the effect of the\nrenormalisation flow of measures in terms of their Osterwalder-Schrader data\nwhich motivates a natural direct Hamiltonian renormalisation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 17:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2019 15:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

As the bacterium swims forward, all its flagella rotate in\nsynchrony behind the cell in a helical bundle. When the bacterium changes its\ndirection, the flagellar filaments unbundle and reorient the cell for a short\nperiod of time before returning to their bundled state and resuming swimming.\nThis rapid bundling and unbundling is, at its heart, a mechanical process\nwhereby hydrodynamic interactions balance with elasticity to determine the\ntime-varying deformation of the filaments. Inspired by this biophysical\nproblem, we present in this paper what is perhaps the simplest model of\nbundling whereby two, or more, straight elastic filaments immersed in a viscous\nfluid rotate about their centreline, inducing rotational flows which tend to\nbend the filaments around each other. We derive an integro-differential\nequation governing the shape of the filaments resulting from mechanical balance\nin a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number. We show that such equation may be\nevaluated asymptotically analytically in the long-wavelength limit, leading to\na local partial differential equation governed by a single dimensionless\nBundling number. A numerical study of the dynamics predicted by the model\nreveals the presence of two configuration instabilities with increasing\nBundling numbers: first to a crossing state where filaments touch at one point\nand then to a bundled state where filaments wrap along each other in a helical\nfashion. We next provide an intuitive physical model for the crossing\ninstability and show that it may be used to predict analytically its threshold,\nand adapted to address the transition to a bundling state. We then use a\nmacro-scale experimental implementation of the two-filament configuration in\norder to validate our theoretical predictions and obtain excellent agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 17:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Many approaches\nexist, but they are frequently only designed to perform brain extraction from\nimages without strong pathologies. Extracting the brain from images with strong\npathologies, for example, the presence of a tumor or of a traumatic brain\ninjury, is challenging. In such cases, tissue appearance may deviate from\nnormal tissue and violates algorithmic assumptions for these approaches; hence,\nthe brain may not be correctly extracted. This paper proposes a brain\nextraction approach which can explicitly account for pathologies by jointly\nmodeling normal tissue and pathologies. Specifically, our model uses a\nthree-part image decomposition: (1) normal tissue appearance is captured by\nprincipal component analysis, (2) pathologies are captured via a total\nvariation term, and (3) non-brain tissue is captured by a sparse term.\nDecomposition and image registration steps are alternated to allow statistical\nmodeling in a fixed atlas space. As a beneficial side effect, the model allows\nfor the identification of potential pathologies and the reconstruction of a\nquasi-normal image in atlas space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on four datasets: the IBSR and LPBA40 datasets which show normal images,\nthe BRATS dataset containing images with brain tumors and a dataset containing\nclinical TBI images.

In this work, we exploit the spatial relations between objects in\norder to improve detection capacity, as well as analyze various properties of\nthe contextual object detection problem. To precisely calculate context-based\nprobabilities of objects, we developed a model that examines the interactions\nbetween objects in an exact probabilistic setting, in contrast to previous\nmethods that typically utilize approximations based on pairwise interactions.\nSuch a scheme is facilitated by the realistic assumption that the existence of\nan object in any given location is influenced by only few informative locations\nin space. Based on this assumption, we suggest a method for identifying these\nrelevant locations and integrating them into a mostly exact calculation of\nprobability based on their raw detector responses. This scheme is shown to\nimprove detection results and provides unique insights about the process of\ncontextual inference for object detection. We show that it is generally\ndifficult to learn that a particular object reduces the probability of another,\nand that in cases when the context and detector strongly disagree this learning\nbecomes virtually impossible for the purposes of improving the results of an\nobject detector.

This paper discusses in detail this NNPDA - its\nconstruction, how it can be trained and how useful symbolic information can be\nextracted from the trained network.\n  In order to couple the external stack to the neural network, an optimization\nmethod is developed which uses an error function that connects the learning of\nthe state automaton of the neural network to the learning of the operation of\nthe external stack. To minimize the error function using gradient descent\nlearning, an analog stack is designed such that the action and storage of\ninformation in the stack are continuous. One interpretation of a continuous\nstack is the probabilistic storage of and action on data. After training on\nsample strings of an unknown source grammar, a quantization procedure extracts\nfrom the analog stack and neural network a discrete pushdown automata (PDA).\nSimulations show that in learning deterministic context-free grammars - the\nbalanced parenthesis language, 1*n0*n, and the deterministic Palindrome - the\nextracted PDA is correct in the sense that it can correctly recognize unseen\nstrings of arbitrary length. In addition, the extracted PDAs can be shown to be\nidentical or equivalent to the PDAs of the source grammars which were used to\ngenerate the training strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 18:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

The dark\nmatter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong\nself-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We\nfinally point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular\nin dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular\nclusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior depends on the position with\nrespect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation. Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and\ngravitons follow the same geodesics, and that galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing\nlarger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should follow\npredictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's\nlaw.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Their rational design offers opportunities for profound\ntechnological advancements enabled by their extraordinary structural and\nelectronic properties. Thus far the most critical aspect of their synthesis,\nthe control over sequence and position of heterojunctions along the length of a\nribbon, has been plagued by randomness in monomer sequences emerging from\nstep-growth copolymerization of distinct monomers. All bottom-up GNR\nheterojunction structures created so far have exhibited random sequences of\nheterojunctions and, while useful for fundamental scientific studies, are\ndifficult to incorporate into functional nanodevices as a result. Here we\ndescribe a new hierarchical fabrication strategy that allows deterministic\ngrowth of bottom-up GNRs that preferentially exhibit a single heterojunction\ninterface rather than a random statistical sequence of junctions along the\nribbon. Such heterojunctions provide a viable new platform that could be\ndirectly used in functional GNR-based device applications at the molecular\nscale. Our hierarchical GNR fabrication strategy is based on differences in the\ndissociation energies of C-Br and C-I bonds that allow control over the growth\nsequence of the block-copolymers from which GNRs are formed, and consequently\nyields a significantly higher proportion of single-junction GNR\nheterostructures. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and density functional\ntheory calculations confirm that hierarchically-grown heterojunctions between\nchevron GNR (cGNR) and binaphthyl-cGNR segments exhibit straddling Type I band\nalignment in structures that are only one atomic layer thick and 3 nm in width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

Combining attribute constraints with\na universal \"realism\" constraint, which enforces similarity to the data\ndistribution, we generate realistic conditional images from an unconditional\nvariational autoencoder. Further, using gradient-based optimization, we\ndemonstrate identity-preserving transformations that make the minimal\nadjustment in latent space to modify the attributes of an image.

We develop an efficient algorithmic\napproach called rigid graph compression (RGC) to describe the transition from\nfloppy to rigid in disordered fiber networks ('rod-hinge systems'), which form\nthe reinforcing phase in many composite systems. To establish RGC on a firm\ntheoretical foundation, we adapt rigidity matroid theory to identify primitive\ntopological network motifs that serve as rules for composing interacting rigid\npar- ticles into larger rigid components. This approach is computationally\nefficient and stable, because RGC requires only topological information about\nrod interactions (encoded by a sparse unweighted network) rather than\ngeometrical details such as rod locations or pairwise distances (as required in\nrigidity matroid theory). We conduct numerical experiments on simulated\ntwo-dimensional rod-hinge systems to demonstrate that RGC closely approximates\nthe rigidity percolation threshold for such systems, through comparison with\nthe pebble game algorithm (which is exact in two dimensions). Importantly,\nwhereas the pebble game is derived from Laman's condition and is only valid in\ntwo dimensions, the RGC approach naturally extends to higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Earth\nobservation data is often plagued with spatially and temporally correlated\nnoise, outliers and missing data due to atmospheric disturbances which pose a\nchallenge in learning the mapping from a local neighborhood at individual\ntimesteps. In this paper, we aim to exploit time-independent global\nrelationships between pixels for robust transfer of information across\ndifferent scales.

We address the problem of optimally identifying seed varieties to\nreliably increase crop yield within a risk-sensitive decision-making framework.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel hierarchical machine learning mechanism for\npredicting crop yield (the yield of different seed varieties of the same crop).\nWe integrate this prediction mechanism with a weather forecasting model, and\npropose three different approaches for decision making under uncertainty to\nselect seed varieties for planting so as to balance yield maximization and\nrisk.We apply our model to the problem of soybean variety selection given in\nthe 2016 Syngenta Crop Challenge. Our prediction model achieves a median\nabsolute error of 3.74 bushels per acre and thus provides good estimates for\ninput into the decision models.Our decision models identify the selection of\nsoybean varieties that appropriately balance yield and risk as a function of\nthe farmer's risk aversion level. More generally, our models support farmers in\ndecision making about which seed varieties to plant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 21:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

Practically, subproblems for updating primal\nvariables in the framework of ALM usually can only be solved inexactly. The\nconvergence and local convergence speed of ALM have been extensively studied.\nHowever, the global convergence rate of inexact ALM is still open for problems\nwith nonlinear inequality constraints. In this paper, we work on general convex\nprograms with both equality and inequality constraints. For these problems, we\nestablish the global convergence rate of inexact ALM and estimate its iteration\ncomplexity in terms of the number of gradient evaluations to produce a solution\nwith a specified accuracy.\n  We first establish an ergodic convergence rate result of inexact ALM that\nuses constant penalty parameters or geometrically increasing penalty\nparameters. Based on the convergence rate result, we apply Nesterov's optimal\nfirst-order method on each primal subproblem and estimate the iteration\ncomplexity of the inexact ALM. We show that if the objective is convex, then\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ gradient evaluations are sufficient to guarantee an\n$\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in terms of both primal objective and\nfeasibility violation. If the objective is strongly convex, the result can be\nimproved to $O(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|\\log\\varepsilon|)$.

We analyze the\nMpemba effect in Markovian dynamics and discover that a stronger version of the\neffect often exists for a carefully chosen set of initial temperatures. In this\n\\emph{strong Mpemba effect}, the relaxation time jumps to a smaller value\nleading to exponentially faster equilibration dynamics. The number of such\nspecial initial temperatures defines the \\emph{Mpemba index}, whose parity is a\ntopological property of the system. To demonstrate these concepts, we first\nanalyze the different types of Mpemba relaxations in the mean field\nanti-ferromagnet Ising model, which demonstrates a surprisingly rich Mpemba\nphase diagram. Moreover, we show that the strong effect survives the\nthermodynamic limit and that it is tightly connected with thermal overshoot --\nin the relaxation process, the temperature of the relaxing system can decay\nnon-monotonically as a function of time. Using the parity of the Mpemba index,\nwe then study the occurrence of the strong Mpemba effect in a large class of\nthermal quench processes and show that it happens with non-zero probability\neven in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by introducing the\n\\emph{isotropic} model for which we obtain analytical lower bound estimates for\nthe probability of the strong Mpemba effects.

The\nkey observation of the paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to\nthe dip events of the received signal, are fairly robust to the attenuation\nthrough walls (for instance as compared to the exact dip values). We then\npropose a methodology that can extract the total number of people from the\ninter-event times.

The\nthree-dimensional stress tensor induced by hydrogen concentration, which is in\nequilibrium with respect to the dislocation stress field, is derived using the\nEshelby inclusion model, while the hydrogen diffusion is treated as a continuum\nprocess. This newly developed framework is utilized to quantify the effect of\ndifferent hydrogen concentrations on the dynamics of a glide dislocation in the\nabsence of an applied stress field as well as on the spacing between\ndislocations in an array of parallel edge dislocations. A shielding effect is\nobserved for materials having a large hydrogen diffusion coefficient, with the\nshield effect leading to the homogenization of the shrinkage process leading to\nthe glide loop maintaining its circular shape, as well as resulting in a\ndecrease in dislocation separation distances in the array of parallel edge\ndislocations. On the other hand, for materials having a small hydrogen\ndiffusion coefficient, the high hydrogen concentrations around the edge\ncharacters of the dislocations act to pin them. Higher stresses are required to\nbe able to unpin the dislocations from the hydrogen clouds surrounding them.\nFinally, this new framework can open the door for further large scale studies\non the effect of hydrogen on the different aspects of dislocation-mediated\nplasticity in metals.

Assuming the magnetic field strength in the\n$\\gamma$-ray emitting region as constrained from the SED fitting follows the\nmagnetic field distribution as derived from the radio core-shift measurements\n(i.e., $B(R)\\simeq B_{\\rm 1 pc}(R/\\rm 1pc)^{-1}$, $R$ is the distance from the\ncentral engine and $B_{\\rm 1 pc}$ is the magnetic field strength at 1 pc), we\nfurther calculate the location of the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region,\n$R_{\\gamma}$, for these blazars. We find that\n$R_{\\gamma}\\sim2\\times10^{4}R_{\\rm S}\\simeq10 R_{\\rm BLR}$ ($R_{\\rm S}$ is the\nSchwarzschild radius and $R_{\\rm BLR}$ is the BLR size), where $R_{\\rm BLR}$ is\nestimated from the broad line luminosities using the empirical correlations\nobtained using the reverberation mapping methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 01:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 01:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

Unfortunately, researchers\nhave shown that DNNs are easily attacked by adversarial examples, slightly\nperturbed images which can mislead DNNs to give incorrect classification\nresults. Such attack has seriously hampered the deployment of DNN systems in\nareas where security or safety requirements are strict, such as autonomous\ncars, face recognition, malware detection. Defensive distillation is a\nmechanism aimed at training a robust DNN which significantly reduces the\neffectiveness of adversarial examples generation. However, the state-of-the-art\nattack can be successful on distilled networks with 100% probability. But it is\na white-box attack which needs to know the inner information of DNN. Whereas,\nthe black-box scenario is more general. In this paper, we first propose the\nepsilon-neighborhood attack, which can fool the defensively distilled networks\nwith 100% success rate in the white-box setting, and it is fast to generate\nadversarial examples with good visual quality. On the basis of this attack, we\nfurther propose the region-based attack against defensively distilled DNNs in\nthe black-box setting. And we also perform the bypass attack to indirectly\nbreak the distillation defense as a complementary method.

We\nalso propose the first deep CNN model designed specifically for 3D face\nrecognition and trained on 3.1 Million 3D facial scans of 100K identities. Our\ntest dataset comprises 1,853 identities with a single 3D scan in the gallery\nand another 31K scans as probes, which is several orders of magnitude larger\nthan existing ones. Without fine tuning on this dataset, our network already\noutperforms state of the art face recognition by over 10%. We fine tune our\nnetwork on the gallery set to perform end-to-end large scale 3D face\nrecognition which further improves accuracy. Finally, we show the efficacy of\nour method for the open world face recognition problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 06:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 09:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 07:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

We also find an overlap between the AG and mode coupling power\nlaw regime leading to a power law behaviour of $S_c$.

The KVN radio core is\noptically thick at least up to 86 GHz; there is indication that it might be\noptically thin at higher frequencies. To first order, the radio light curves\ndecay exponentially over the time span covered by our observations, with decay\ntimescales of 411+/-85 days, 352+/-79 days, 310+/-57 days, and 283+/-55 days at\n22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz, respectively.

The\nnewly-revealed effects of the prevailing small-scale magnetic field within the\nconvection zone may offer possible solutions to this problem. The small-scale\nmagnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions\nthrough the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent\nmixing of entropy between upflows and downflows. As a result, the effective\nPrandtl number may exceed unity inside the solar convection zone. In this\npaper, we propose and numerically confirm a possible suppression mechanism of\nconvective velocity in the effectively high-Prandtl number regime. If the\neffective horizontal thermal diffusivity decreases (the Prandtl number\naccordingly increases), the subadiabatic layer which is formed near the base of\nthe convection zone by continuous depositions of low entropy transported by\nadiabatically downflowing plumes is enhanced and extended. The global\nconvective amplitude in the high-Prandtl thermal convection is thus reduced\nespecially in the lower part of the convection zone via the change in the mean\nentropy profile which becomes more subadiabatic near the base and less\nsuperadiabatic in the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 07:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

We critically analyze the available observational\ndata of rotation speeds of the O-type components in WR+O binaries. By combining\na binary evolutionary code and a formalism that describes the effects of tides\nin massive stars with an envelope in radiative equilibrium, we compute the\ncorresponding rotational velocities during the Roche lobe overflow of the\nprogenitor binaries. In all the studied WR+O binaries, we find that the O-type\nstars were affected by accretion of matter during the RLOF of the progenitor.\nThis means that common envelope evolution which excludes any accretion onto the\nsecondary O-star, has not played an important role to explain the WR+O\nbinaries. Moreover, although it is very likely that the O-type star progenitors\nwere spun-up by the mass transfer, many ended the RLOF/mass transfer phase with\na rotational velocity that is significantly smaller than the critical rotation\nspeed. This may indicate that during the mass transfer phase there is a\nspin-down process which is of the same order as, although significantly less\nthan that of the spin-up process.

The model is\napplied to the case of the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), an\nendangered species in North America reliant on captive breeding for survival.\nThe timing of reintroduction is an important concern in these programs as there\nis a tradeoff between the duration (and therefore the cost) of the captive\nbreeding program and the period the population spends in recovery and in the\nwild. In this paper, we develop a stylized bioeconomic model to determine the\noptimal reintroduction time, in which the objective is to minimize the cost of\nreintroduction while providing a viably-sized population in the wild. Our\ncontrol variable is the timing of reintroduction, which departs from a large\nbody of work in bioeconomics that focuses on adjustable controls that directly\naffect the target population.

Text---a document or a query---is represented\nby a bag of its words that ignores grammar and word order, but retains word\nfrequency counts. When presented with a search query, the engine then ranks\ndocuments according to their relevance scores by computing, among other things,\nthe matching degrees between query and document terms. While term-based\napproaches are intuitive and effective in practice, they are based on the\nhypothesis that documents that exactly contain the query terms are highly\nrelevant regardless of query semantics. Inversely, term-based approaches assume\ndocuments that do not contain query terms as irrelevant. However, it is known\nthat a high matching degree at the term level does not necessarily mean high\nrelevance and, vice versa, documents that match null query terms may still be\nrelevant. Consequently, there exists a vocabulary gap between queries and\ndocuments that occurs when both use different words to describe the same\nconcepts. It is the alleviation of the effect brought forward by this\nvocabulary gap that is the topic of this dissertation. More specifically, we\npropose (1) methods to formulate an effective query from complex textual\nstructures and (2) latent vector space models that circumvent the vocabulary\ngap in information retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

We attribute the observed spread of radio\nsurface brightnesses for corresponding SNR diameters to the spread of these\nparameters. In addition to our simulations of type Ia SNRs, we also considered\nSNR radio evolution in denser, nonuniform circumstellar environment, modified\nby the progenitor star wind.

However, an accurate and robust calibration of\nthe mass-observable relation for clusters is necessary for the comparison,\nwhich has been proven difficult to obtain so far. Here, we present new\ncontraints on the mass-pressure relation by combining tSZ and CMB lensing\nmeasurements about optically-selected clusters. Consequently, our galaxy\ncluster sample is independent from the data employed to derive cosmological\nconstrains.

This value greatly\nreduces the tension between the predictions of $\\Lambda$CDM and the observed\nabundance of tSZ clusters while being in agreement with recent estimations from\ntSZ clustering.

To deconvolute\nthe rest-frame distribution effects, we propose to use a method based directly\non the coordinate representation. We treat matrix elements $M(z_3,p_3)$ as\ndistributions ${\\cal M} (\\nu, z_3^2)$ depending on the Ioffe-time $\\nu = p_3\nz_3$ and the distance parameter $z_3^2$. The rest-frame spatial distribution is\ngiven by ${\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$. Using the reduced Ioffe function ${\\mathfrak M}\n(\\nu, z_3^2) \\equiv {\\cal M} (\\nu, z_3^2)/ {\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$ we divide out\nthe rest frame effects,including the notorious link renormalization factors.\nThe $\\nu$-dependence remains intact and determines the shape of PDFs in the\nsmall $z_3$ region. The residual $z_3^2$ dependence of the ${\\mathfrak M} (\\nu,\nz_3^2)$ is governed by perturbative evolution. The Fourier transform of ${\\cal\nM} (\\nu, z_3^2)$ produces pseudo-PDFs ${\\cal P}(x, z_3^2)$ that generalize the\nlight-front PDFs onto spacelike intervals. On the basis of these findings we\npropose a new method for extraction of PDFs from lattice calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 11:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

Different conductance states of a channel imply that the ssPNP\nequations probably have multiple solutions with different level of currents. We\npropose numerical approaches to study multiple solutions to the ssPNP equations\nwith multiple ionic species. To find complete current-voltage (I-V ) and\ncurrent-concentration (I-C) curves, we reformulate the ssPNP equations into\nfour different boundary value problems (BVPs). Numerical continuation\napproaches are developed to provide good initial guesses for iteratively\nsolving algebraic equations resulting from discretization.

Analysis of brain signals from a human interacting with a robot may\nhelp identifying robot errors, but accuracies of such analyses have still\nsubstantial space for improvement. In this paper we evaluate whether a novel\nframework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could\nimprove the accuracy of decoding robot errors from the EEG of a human observer,\nboth during an object grasping and a pouring task. We show that deep ConvNets\nreached significantly higher accuracies than both regularized Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP)\ncombined with rLDA, both widely used EEG classifiers.

Visualization of the time-domain\nEEG features learned by the ConvNets to decode errors revealed spatiotemporal\npatterns that reflected differences between the two experimental paradigms.\nAcross subjects, ConvNet decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with\nthose obtained with rLDA, but not CSP, indicating that in the present context\nConvNets behaved more 'rLDA-like' (but consistently better), while in a\nprevious decoding study with another task but the same ConvNet architecture, it\nwas found to behave more 'CSP-like'.

Survey results tend to be\nbiased under selective non-participation. One approach to bias reduction is to\ncollect information about non-participants by contacting them again and asking\nthem to fill in a questionnaire. This information is called re-contact data,\nand it allows to adjust the estimates for non-participation.\n  Methods: We analyse data from the FINRISK 2012 survey, where re-contact data\nwere collected. We assume that the respondents of the re-contact survey are\nsimilar to the remaining non-participants with respect to the health given\ntheir available background information. Validity of this assumption is\nevaluated based on the hospitalization data obtained through record linkage of\nsurvey data to the administrative registers. Using this assumption and multiple\nimputation, we estimate the prevalences of daily smoking and heavy alcohol\nconsumption and compare them to estimates obtained with a commonly used\nassumption that the participants represent the entire target group.\n  Results: This approach produces higher prevalence estimates than what is\nestimated from participants only. Among men, smoking prevalence estimate was\n28.5% (23.2% for participants), heavy alcohol consumption prevalence was 9.4%\n(6.8% for participants). Among women, smoking prevalence was 19.0% (16.5% for\nparticipants) and heavy alcohol consumption 4.8% (3.0% for participants).\nConclusion: Utilization of re-contact data is a useful method to adjust for\nnon-participation bias on population estimates in epidemiological surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 13:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

However, the advent of Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging\n(BCDI) has made possible the 3D imaging of multiple dislocations in\nnanoparticles ranging in size from 100 nm to1000 nm.

For M15, we have studied the relativistic spin\nprecession effect in PSR B2127+11C. We have used full-Stokes observations to\nmodel the precession effect, and to constrain the system geometry.

However, these models cannot be directly applied on\nimage/video sequences because of an intrinsic drawback- the reconstructions\nmight be independently realistic, but, when visualized as a sequence, often\nlacks fidelity to the original uncorrupted sequence. The fundamental reason is\nthat these methods try to find the best matching latent space representation\nnear to natural image manifold without any explicit distance based loss. In\nthis paper, we present a semantically conditioned Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) for sequence inpainting. The conditional information constrains\nthe GAN to map a latent representation to a point in image manifold respecting\nthe underlying pose and semantics of the scene. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work which simultaneously addresses consistency and\ncorrectness of generative model based inpainting. We show that our generative\nmodel learns to disentangle pose and appearance information; this independence\nis exploited by our model to generate highly consistent reconstructions. The\nconditional information also aids the generator network in GAN to produce\nsharper images compared to the original GAN formulation. This helps in\nachieving more appealing inpainting performance. Though generic, our algorithm\nwas targeted for inpainting on faces. When applied on CelebA and Youtube Faces\ndatasets, the proposed method results in a significant improvement over the\ncurrent benchmark, both in terms of quantitative evaluation (Peak Signal to\nNoise Ratio) and human visual scoring over diversified combinations of\nresolutions and deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 08:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

We bring\nconvincing experimental evidence for this splitting resulting from our\npolarized neutron diffraction experiment. Proper treatment of the flipping\nratios collected in the ordered state and in the paramagnetic state reveals\ndramatically different magnetic moments on the U1 and U2 sites. We have reached\ngood agreement of the results from the MAXENT method and from direct fitting of\nthe data. The ratio of the orbital and spin component on the U2 site is lower\nthan for the free $\\mathrm{U^{3+}}$ or $\\mathrm{U^{4+}}$ ion and points to a\nstrong hybridization between the U $5f$ and Ru $4d$ wave functions. The same\nratio on the U1 site is unexpectedly low. This would mean that its orbital\ncomponent is almost quenched. We have observed the absence of a magnetic moment\non the Ru1 site, but a rather large induced moment on the Ru2 site. Very\nsimilar results were obtained also in the paramagnetic state in the regime\ninduced by the magnetic field. It points to the intimate coupling of the\nmagnetic ordering and structural distortion as it is possible to split the U\nsite in to two different polarizing paramagnetic U moments above\n$T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ by a strong magnetic field. We propose that the difference\nbetween the magnetic moment on the U sites is caused by the change of local\npoint symmetry of the sites that is tightly bound to the role of the strong\nspin-orbit interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

The recently installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) is capable of observing the Sun in that wavelength range with an\nunprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret solar\nobservations with ALMA the first important step is to compare ALMA maps with\nsimultaneous images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges. First we\nidentify different structures in the solar atmosphere seen in the optical, IR\nand EUV parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun (QS), active regions (AR), prominences\non the disc, magnetic inversion lines (IL), coronal holes (CH) and coronal\nbright points (CBPs)) in a full disc solar ALMA image.

As accurate modelling of the sources of variability is a\ncornerstone to intelligent decision making, we investigate the consequences of\nthe assumption of independent and identically distributed variables that is\noften made when modelling sources of variability such as down-times, arrivals,\nor process-times. We first explain the experiment setting that allows, through\nsimulations and statistical tests, to measure the variability potential stored\nin a specific sequence of data. We show from industrial data that dependent\nbehaviors might actually be the rule with potentially considerable consequences\nin terms of cycle time. As complex industries require strong levers to allow\ntheir tractability, this work underlines the need for a richer and more\naccurate modelling of real systems. Keywords-variability; cycle time; dependent\nevents; simulation; complex manufacturing; industry 4.0 I. Accurate modelling\nof variability and the independence assumption Industry 4.0 is said to be the\nnext industrial revolution. The proper use of real-time information in complex\nmanufacturing systems is expected to allow more customization of products in\nhighly flexible production factories. Semiconductor High Mix Low Volume (HMLV)\nmanufacturing facilities (called fabs) are one example of candidates for this\ntransition towards \"smart industries\". However, because of the high levels of\nvariability, the environment of a HMLV fab is highly stochastic and difficult\nto manage. The uncontrolled variability limits the predictability of the system\nand thus the ability to meet delivery requirements in terms of volumes, cycle\ntimes and due dates. Typically, the HMLV STMicroelectronics Crolles 300 fab\nregularly experiences significant mix changes that result in unanticipated\nbottlenecks, leading to firefighting to meet commitment to customers. The\noverarching goal of our strategy is to improve the forecasting of future\noccurrences of bottlenecks and cycle time issues in order to anticipate them\nthrough allocation of the correct attention and resources. Our current finite\ncapacity projection engine can effectively forecast bottlenecks, but it does\nnot include reliable cycle time estimates. In order to enhance our projections,\nbetter forecast cycle time losses (queuing times), improve the tractability of\nour system and reduce our cycle times, we now need accurate dynamic cycle time\npredictions. As increased cycle-time is the main reason workflow variability is\nstudied (both by the scientific community and practitioners, see e.g. [1] and\n[2]), what follows concentrates on cycle times. Moreover, the \"variability\" we\naccount for should be understood as the potential to create higher cycle times,\neven though \"variability\" may be understood in a broader meaning. This choice\nis made for the sake of clarity, but the methodology we propose and the\ndiscussion we lead can be applied to any other measurable indicator. Sources of\nvariability have been intensely investigated in both the literature and the\nindustry, and tool down-times, arrivals variability as well as process-time\nvariability are recognized as the major sources of variability in that sense\nthat they create higher cycle times (see [3] for a review and discussion). As a\nconsequence, these factors are widely integrated into queuing formulas and\nsimulation models with the objective to better model the complex reality of\nmanufacturing facilities. One commonly accepted assumption in the development\nof these models is that the variables (MTBF, MTTR, processing times, time\nbetween arrivals, etc.) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nrandom variables. However, these assumptions might be the reason for models\ninaccuracies as [4] points out in a literature review on queuing theory.\nSeveral authors have studied the potential effects of dependencies, such as [5]\nwho studied the potential effects of dependencies between arrivals and\nprocess-times or [6] who investigated dependent process times, [4] also gives\nfurther references for studies on dependencies effects. In a previous work [3],\nwe pinpointed a few elements from industrial data that questioned the viability\nof this assumption in complex manufacturing systems.

The joint detection of gravitational waves (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging of a binary system of compact\nobjects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of extra\ndimensions beyond our 3+1 spacetime ones. A theoretically well-motivated\npossibility is that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface,\nor brane, embedded in a higher 4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$)\nspacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates through the\ninfinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these\ntypes of brane-world models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane\nwould, in general, travel different paths. This would result in a time-lag\nbetween the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously from the same\nsource. We consider the recent near-simultaneous detection of the GW event\nGW170817 from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, and its EM counterpart, the short\ngamma-ray burst GRB170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and\nthe INTEGRAL Anti-Coincidence Shield spectrometer.

Although the\nbound is not competitive with current Solar System constraints, it is the first\ntime that data from a multi-messenger GW-EM measurement is used to constrain\nextra-dimensional models.

The guiding principle was to map\nthe usual Wilsonian path integral renormalisation flow onto a flow of the\ncorresponding OS data.\n  We showed that this induced flow on the OS data has an unwanted feature which\ndisqualifies the associated coarse grained Hamiltonians from being the\nprojections of a continuum Hamiltonian onto vectors in the coarse grained\nHilbert space.

The generality of these\nsymmetry breaking measures and their tight connection to experimental\nmeasurements make them applicable to a very wide range of physics, like\nquantification of phase transitions, constraints in dynamical evolution, and\nthe search for hidden symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 11:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This quantum phenomenon originates from an\nasymmetry between left- and right-handed relativistic fermions in the presence\nof a magnetic field and gives rise to a chiral dynamo. We show that the\nmagnetic field evolution proceeds in three stages: (1) a small-scale chiral\ndynamo instability; (2) production of chiral magnetically driven turbulence and\nexcitation of a large-scale dynamo instability due to a new chiral effect\n(alpha_mu effect); and (3) saturation of magnetic helicity and magnetic field\ngrowth controlled by a conservation law for the total chirality. The\n$\\alpha_\\mu$ effect becomes dominant at large fluid and magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers and is not related to kinetic helicity.

We are proposing a novel approach where\nparticles movement will not be depend on its velocity rather it will be decided\nby constrained biased random walk of particles. In random walk every particles\nmovement based on two significant parameters, one is random process like toss\nof a coin and other is how much displacement a particle should have. In our\napproach we exploit this idea by performing a biased random operation and based\non the outcome of that random operation, PSO particles choose the direction of\nthe path and move non-uniformly into the solution space. This constrained,\nnon-uniform movement helps the random walking particle to converge quicker then\nclassical PSO.
