Thus, this study aims to: 1) discover an\neffective classification technique to solve the problem, and 2) develop a model\nfor composition of the software development team. The model developed was\ncomposed of three predictors: team role, personality types, and gender\nvariables; it also contained one outcome: team performance variable.

Statistics\nbeyond the power spectrum are therefore potentially important sources of\ninformation about the physics of these processes. We combine data from the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope and with data from the Planck satellite (only using\nPlanck data in the overlapping region) to constrain the amplitudes of a set of\ntheoretical bispectrum templates from the tSZ effect, DSFGs, gravitational\nlensing, and radio galaxies. We make a strong detection of radio galaxies\n(>5$\\sigma$) and have hints of non-Gaussianity arising from the tSZ effect,\nDSFGs, from cross-correlations between the tSZ effect and DSFGs and from\ncross-correlations among the tSZ effect, DSFGs and radio galaxies. These\nresults suggest that the same halos host radio sources, DSFGs, and have tSZ\nsignal. We present a new method to calculate the non-Gaussian contributions to\nthe template covariances. Using this method we find significant non-Gaussian\ncontributions to the variance and covariance of our templates, with templates\ninvolving the tSZ effect most effected. Strong degeneracies exist between the\nvarious sources at the current noise levels. In light of these degeneracies,\ncombined with theoretical uncertainty in the templates, these results are a\ndemonstration of this technique. With these caveats, we demonstrate the utility\nof future bispectrum measurements by using the tSZ bispectrum measurement to\nconstrain a combination of the amplitude of matter fluctuations and the matter\ndensity to be $\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.17}=0.65^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. Improvements in\nsignal to noise from upcoming observations will enable the separation of\nbispectrum components and robust constraints on cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 16:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 10:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

There are several methods developed for this research field, many\nof them working very differently from each other, covering distinct aspects of\nthe problem and disparate strategies. Despite the large number of existent\ntechniques, there is no single one which fits well in all cases or for all data\nsources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations but\nthey require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive\nto acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, in here, we propose\nto combine several very popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment\nanalysis methods, by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy for\npolarity classification. One of our main goals is to reduce the large\nvariability (lack of stability) of the unsupervised methods across different\ndomains (datasets). Our solution was thoroughly tested considering thirteen\ndifferent datasets in several domains such as opinions, comments, and social\nmedia. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka,\n10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, but more\nimportantly, it solves a key problem in the field. It is consistently among the\nbest methods in many data types, meaning that it can produce the best (or close\nto best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional\ncosts (e.g., manual labeling). Our self-learning approach is also very\nindependent of the base methods, which means that it is highly extensible to\nincorporate any new additional method that can be envisioned in the future.\nFinally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment\nanalysis as a means to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the\nproposed approach and we show the potential of this technique to improve our\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 17:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

This document represents a first step towards establishing a common\nlanguage between the two communities, to foster dialogue and to further improve\nour knowledge of PDFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 17:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 17:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Yet, the molecular machinery that\nregulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with\nnoisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time\napproach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance\nthreshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a\ndiminishing repressor. We find that the optimal strategy corresponds to a\nnonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time. Optimality\narises from a tradeoff between minimizing the extrinsic timing noise of the\nregulator, and minimizing the intrinsic timing noise of the target molecule\nitself. Although either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated\nstrategy, when we consider the effects of cell division, we find that\nrepression outperforms activation if division occurs late in the process. Our\nresults explain the nonlinear increase and low noise of mig-1 gene expression\nin migrating neuroblast cells during Caenorhabditis elegans development, and\nsuggest that mig-1 regulation is dominated by repression for maximal temporal\nprecision. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and\npowerful strategy for precise cellular timing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 17:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

This evolution is largely driven by tides\nacting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones.

We\nanalyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this\nobservation: the population expansion rate ($v$) results from an interplay of\ngrowth ($r$) and dispersal ($D$) and is independent of the carrying capacity:\n$v=2\\sqrt{rD}$. A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate\n($v_2$) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species ($v_1$); this\nsimple condition ($v_2 > v_1$) determines the maximum cost in slower growth\nthat a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical\nsimulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging\nbacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay\nbut do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest.

Specifically, we aim to answer why sparse graph problems are so hard,\nand why the Longest Common Subsequence problem gets a savings of a factor of\nthe size of cache times the length of a cache line, but no more. We take the\nreductions and techniques from complexity and fine-grained complexity and apply\nthem to the I/O model to generate new (conditional) lower bounds as well as\nfaster algorithms. We also prove the existence of a time hierarchy for the I/O\nmodel, which motivates the fine-grained reductions.\n  Using fine-grained reductions, we give an algorithm for distinguishing 2 vs.\n3 diameter and radius that runs in $O(|E|^2/(MB))$ cache misses, which for\nsparse graphs improves over the previous $O(|V|^2/B)$ running time. We give new\nreductions from radius and diameter to Wiener index and median. We show\nmeaningful reductions between problems that have linear-time solutions in the\nRAM model. The reductions use low I/O complexity (typically $O(n/B)$), and thus\nhelp to finely capture the relationship between \"I/O linear time\" $\\Theta(n/B)$\nand RAM linear time $\\Theta(n)$. We generate new I/O assumptions based on the\ndifficulty of improving sparse graph problem running times in the I/O model. We\ncreate conjectures that the current best known algorithms for Single Source\nShortest Paths (SSSP), diameter, and radius are optimal. From these I/O-model\nassumptions, we show that many of the known reductions in the word-RAM model\ncan naturally extend to hold in the I/O model as well (e.g., a lower bound on\nthe I/O complexity of Longest Common Subsequence that matches the best known\nrunning time).

Data\nare compared with models in which the lightest neutralino has bino- or\nwino-like components, resulting in decays to photons and gravitinos, where the\ngravitinos escape detection. The event selection is optimized for both\nelectroweak (EWK) and strong production SUSY scenarios. The observed data are\nconsistent with standard model predictions, and limits are set in the context\nof a general gauge mediation model in which gaugino masses up to 980 GeV are\nexcluded at 95% confidence level.

Since incoherent quantum tunneling is employed by quantum annealers (QAs)\nto solve optimization problems, this result suggests there is no quantum\nadvantage in using QAs w.r.t. quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. A\ncounterexample is the recently introduced shamrock model, where topological\nobstructions cause an exponential slowdown of the PIMC tunneling dynamics with\nrespect to incoherent quantum tunneling, leaving the door open for potential\nquantum speedup, even for stoquastic models.

Relativistic electrons accelerated by electric\nfields therein emit bremsstrahlung gamma rays, which have been detected at\nground observations, by airborne detectors, and as terrestrial gamma-ray\nflashes (TGFs) from space. The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to\npotentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which\nwould produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of\ngenerated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear\nobservational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we\nreport the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with\na ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a\nTGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites\n0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly\nsubsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a\nprolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a\nminute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the\ninitial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the\nnuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line\nemission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the\nconclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection\nof neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning\ntriggers photonuclear reactions.

To explore this question, we conducted a\nclonal analysis study in mice expressing the Brainbow fluorescent protein\nreporter construct in dentate granule cell progenitors.

The robust resurgence of QSH state coexisting with the CDW phase is\nshown to originate from band inversions induced by the nonsymmorphic lattice\ndistortion through the strong electron-phonon interaction, thus suggesting a\nrealization of various interfacial states between superconducting, density wave\nand topological states on a two-dimensional crystal only by doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 22:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

The coming mass migration to IPv6 as the primary\ntransport of Internet traffic promises to make one such technology, end-to-end\nhost based encryption, more readily available to the average user. In a world\nwhere end-to-end encryption is ubiquitous, what can replace the existing models\nfor network intrusion detection?

In an encrypted world, signature based event detection is\nunlikely to prove useful. In order to secure a network in such an environment,\nwithout trampling the privacy afforded to users by end-to-end encryption, our\nthreat detection model needs to evolve from signature based detection to a\nheuristic model that flags deviations from normal network-wide behavior for\nfurther investigation.

A convolution-based model\nis used to represent non-stationary Gaussian processes that allows for\nvariation in the correlation range and vari- ance of the process across space.\nApplication of this model has two steps: windowed estimates of the covariance\nfunction under the as- sumption of local stationary and encoding the local\nestimates into a single spatial process model that allows for efficient\nsimulation. Specifically we give evidence to show that non-stationary\ncovariance functions based on the Mat`ern family can be reproduced by the Lat-\nticeKrig model, a flexible, multi-resolution representation of Gaussian\nprocesses. We propose to fit locally stationary models based on the Mat`ern\ncovariance and then assemble these estimates into a single, global LatticeKrig\nmodel. One advantage of the LatticeKrig model is that it is efficient for\nsimulating non-stationary fields even at 105 locations. This work is motivated\nby the interest in emulating spatial fields derived from numerical model\nsimulations such as Earth system models.

In these cases the fluid velocity at the location of the\nparticle, which is often used as an estimation of the undisturbed velocity, is\naltered by the presence of the particle, modifying the slip velocity and\nproducing an erroneous prediction of coupling forces between fluid and\nparticle. In this article, we propose a correction scheme to eliminate this\nerror and predict the undisturbed fluid velocity accurately. Conceptually, in\nthis method, the computation cell is treated as a solid object immersed in the\nfluid that is subjected to the two-way coupling force and dragged at a velocity\nthat is identical to the disturbance created by the particle. The proposed\nscheme is generic as it can be applied to unstructured grids with arbitrary\ngeometry and particles that have different size and density. At its crudest\nform for isotropic grids, the present correction scheme reduces to dividing the\nStokes drag by $1 - 0.75\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the ratio of the particle\ndiameter to the grid size. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is evaluated by\ncomparing the computed settling velocity of individual and pair of particles\nunder gravity on anisotropic rectilinear grids against analytical solutions.\nThis comparison shows up to two orders of magnitude reduction in error in cases\nwhere the particle is up to 5 times larger than the grid that may have an\naspect ratio of over 10. Furthermore, a comparison against the\nparticle-resolved simulation of decaying turbulence demonstrates the excellent\naccuracy of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 23:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

If they can be mined\nand fused sufficiently, performances of related video tasks can be\nsignificantly enhanced. However, due to the environmental interference or\nsensor fault, sometimes, only one modality exists while the other is abandoned\nor missing. By recovering the missing modality from the existing one based on\nthe common information shared between them and the prior information of the\nspecific modality, great bonus will be gained for various vision tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a Cross-Modal Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CMCGAN)\nto handle cross-modal visual-audio mutual generation. Specifically, CMCGAN is\ncomposed of four kinds of subnetworks: audio-to-visual, visual-to-audio,\naudio-to-audio and visual-to-visual subnetworks respectively, which are\norganized in a cycle architecture. CMCGAN has several remarkable advantages.\nFirstly, CMCGAN unifies visual-audio mutual generation into a common framework\nby a joint corresponding adversarial loss. Secondly, through introducing a\nlatent vector with Gaussian distribution, CMCGAN can handle dimension and\nstructure asymmetry over visual and audio modalities effectively. Thirdly,\nCMCGAN can be trained end-to-end to achieve better convenience. Benefiting from\nCMCGAN, we develop a dynamic multimodal classification network to handle the\nmodality missing problem. Abundant experiments have been conducted and validate\nthat CMCGAN obtains the state-of-the-art cross-modal visual-audio generation\nresults. Furthermore, it is shown that the generated modality achieves\ncomparable effects with those of original modality, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 01:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 04:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

These protrusions are similar to those described in the art\nconservation literature as metallic soaps. Since the presence of these\nprotrusions raises questions about the state of conservation and long-term\nprospects for deterioration of these artworks, a 3D-imaging technique,\nphotometric stereo using ultraviolet illumination, was developed for the\nlong-term monitoring of the surface-shape of the protrusions and the\nsurrounding paint. Because the UV fluorescence response of painting materials\nis isotropic, errors typically caused by non-Lambertian (anisotropic)\nspecularities when using visible reflected light can be avoided providing a\nmore accurate estimation of shape. As an added benefit, fluorescence provides\nadditional contrast information contributing to materials characterization. The\ndeveloped methodology aims to detect, characterize, and quantify the\ndistribution of micro-protrusions and their development over the surface of\nentire artworks. Combined with a set of analytical in-situ techniques, and\ncomputational tools, this approach constitutes a novel methodology to\ninvestigate the selective distribution of protrusions in correlation with the\ncomposition of painting materials at the macro-scale. While focused on\nO'Keeffe's paintings as a case study, we expect the proposed approach to have\nbroader significance by providing a non-invasive protocol to the conservation\ncommunity to probe topological changes for any relatively flat painted surface\nof an artwork, and more specifically to monitor the dynamic formation of\nprotrusions, in relation to paint composition and modifications of\nenvironmental conditions, loans, exhibitions and storage over the long-term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 01:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

A small rotation angle introduces\nlow-energy van Hove singularities (VHSs) approaching the Fermi level, which\nresult in unusual correlated states in the bilayer graphene. It is reasonable\nto expect that the twist could also affect the electronic properties of\nfew-layer graphene dramatically. However, such an issue has remained\nexperimentally elusive. Here, by using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we systematically studied a twisted trilayer\ngraphene (TTG) with two different small twist angles between adjacent layers.\nTwo sets of VHSs originating from the two twist angles were observed in the\nTTG, indicating that the TTG could be simply regarded as a combination of two\ndifferent twisted bilayer graphene. By using high-resolution STS, we observed\nsplit of the VHSs and directly imaged spatial symmetry breaking of electronic\nstates around the VHSs. These results suggest that electron-electron\ninteractions play an important role in affecting the electronic properties of\ngraphene systems with low-energy VHSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 02:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

We present a sample of 21 new CL AGNs\nat $0.08<z<0.58$, which doubles the number of such objects known to date. These\nnew CL AGNs were discovered by several ways, from (1) repeat spectra in the\nSDSS, (2) repeat spectra in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic\nTelescope (LAMOST) and SDSS, and (3) photometric variability and new\nspectroscopic observations. We use the photometric data from surveys, including\nthe SDSS imaging survey, the Pan-STARRS1, the DESI Legacy imaging survey, the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Catalina Real-time Transient\nSurvey, and the Palomar Transient Factory. The estimated upper limits of\ntransition timescale of the CL AGNs in this sample spans from 0.9 to 13 years\nin the rest frame. The continuum flux in the optical and mid-infrared becomes\nbrighter when the CL AGNs turn on, or vice versa. Variations of more than 0.2\nmag in $W1$ band were detected in 15 CL AGNs during the transition. The optical\nand mid-infrared variability is not consistent with the scenario of variable\nobscuration in 10 CL AGNs at more than $3\\sigma$ confidence level. We confirm a\nbluer-when-brighter trend in the optical. However, the mid-infrared WISE colors\n$W1-W2$ become redder when the objects become brighter in the $W1$ band,\npossibly due to a stronger hot dust contribution in the $W2$ band when the AGN\nactivity becomes stronger. The physical mechanism of type transition is\nimportant for understanding the evolution of AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 03:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 01:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

This paper presents a novel cascaded 3D full-body pose\nregression method to estimate accurate pose from a single depth image at 100\nfps. The key idea is to train cascaded regressors based on Gradient Boosting\nalgorithm from pre-recorded human motion capture database.

We\ndiscover that the strongest scintillators at 5 GHz (modulation index, $m_5 \\geq\n0.02$) all exhibit strong 15 GHz intrinsic variability ($m_{15} \\geq 0.1$).\nThis relationship can be attributed mainly to the mutual dependence of\nintrinsic variability and ISS amplitudes on radio core compactness at $\\sim\n100\\, \\mu$as scales, and to a lesser extent, on their mutual dependences on\nsource flux density, arcsec-scale core dominance and redshift. However, not all\nsources displaying strong intrinsic variations show high amplitude\nscintillation, since ISS is also strongly dependent on Galactic line-of-sight\nscattering properties. This observed relationship between intrinsic variability\nand ISS highlights the importance of optimizing the observing frequency,\ncadence, timespan and sky coverage of future radio variability surveys, such\nthat these two effects can be better distinguished to study the underlying\nphysics. For the full MASIV sample, we find that Fermi-detected gamma-ray loud\nsources exhibit significantly higher 5 GHz ISS amplitudes than gamma-ray quiet\nsources. This relationship is weaker than the known correlation between\ngamma-ray loudness and the 15 GHz variability amplitudes, most likely due to\njet opacity effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 05:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

In this setup, source\nmessages are distributed among the senders possibly with common messages. In\naddition, there are multiple receivers, with each receiver having some messages\na priori, known as side-information, and requesting one unique message such\nthat each message is requested by only one receiver. Index coding in this setup\nis called two-sender unicast index coding (TSUIC). The main goal is to find the\nshortest aggregate normalized codelength, which is expressed as the optimal\nbroadcast rate. In this work, firstly, for a given TSUIC problem, we form three\nindependent sub-problems each consisting of the only subset of the messages,\nbased on whether the messages are available only in one of the senders or in\nboth senders. Then we express the optimal broadcast rate of the TSUIC problem\nas a function of the optimal broadcast rates of those independent sub-problems.\nIn this way, we discover the structural characteristics of TSUIC.

In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional\narms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses\nfor $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave\nmodes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the\nprimary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms\ncan provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in\nprotoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 07:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 16:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 15:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The behavior of the system is\nmodeled by means of (finite) Kripke structures, as usual.

The warped 5D model can\nbe reformulated by considering the warp factor as a dilaton field ($\\omega$)\nconformally coupled to gravity and embedded in a smooth $M_4 \\otimes R$\nmanifold. On the brane, where the U(1) scalar gauge fields live, the dilaton\nfield manifests itself classically as a warp factor and enters the evolution\nequations for the metric components and matter fields. We write the Lagrangian\nfor the Einstein-scalar gauge fields in a conformal invariant setting. However,\nas expected, the conformal invariance is broken (trace-anomaly) by the\nappearance of a mass term and a quadratic term in the energy-momentum tensor of\nthe scalar gauge field, arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the\nprojected Einstein tensor. These terms can be interpreted as a constraint in\norder to maintain conformal invariance. By considering the dilaton field and\nHiggs field on equal footing on small scales, there will be no singular\nbehavior, when $\\omega\\rightarrow 0$ and one can deduce constraints to maintain\nregularity of the action. Our conjecture is that $\\omega$, alias warp factor,\nhas a dual meaning. At very early times, when $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$, it\ndescribes the small-distance limit, while at later times it is a warp (or\nscale) factor that determines the dynamical evolution of the universe. We also\npresent a numerical solution of the model and calculate the (time-dependent)\ntrace-anomaly. The solution depends on the mass ratio of the scalar and gauge\nfields, the parameters of the model and the vortex charge $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 09:42:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 09:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 11:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 18:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

Tetraquarks in this framework can have two spin configurations\ncontaining either spin-0 diquark or spin-1 diquark and each configuration forms\na nonet in flavor space. The two spin configurations are found to mix strongly\nthrough the color-spin interactions. Their mixtures, which diagonalize the\nhyperfine masses, can generate the physical resonances constituting the two\nnonets, which, in fact, coincide roughly with the experimental observation. We\nidentify that $f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$ are the isoscalar members in the light\nnonet, and $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ are the similar members in the heavy\nnonet.

As matter is endowed with angular momentum, its inflow toward\nthe star is often mediated by an accretion disc. The pressure of matter and\nthat originating from the stellar magnetic field balance at the magnetospheric\nradius: at smaller distances the motion of matter is dominated by the magnetic\nfield, and funnelling towards the magnetic poles ensues. However, if the star,\nand thus its magnetosphere, is fast spinning, most of the inflowing matter will\nbe halted at the magnetospheric radius by centrifugal forces, resulting in a\ncharacteristic reduction of the accretion luminosity. The onset of this\nmechanism, called the propeller, has been widely adopted to interpret a\ndistinctive knee in the decaying phase of the light curve of several\ntransiently accreting X-ray pulsar systems. By comparing the observed\nluminosity at the knee for different classes of objects with the value\npredicted by accretion theory on the basis of the independently measured\nmagnetic field, spin-period, mass, and radius of the star, we disclose here a\ngeneral relation for the onset of the propeller which spans about eight orders\nof magnitude in spin period and ten in magnetic moment.

Recent gravity and\nlibration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is\nrather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are\nenhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of\ntidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations\nof shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic\nthin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations\nof shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial\ndifferential equations of the 4th order on the sphere which take into account\nself-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity.\nIf the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas\nfor tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5%\nand 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the\nshell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of\ncoupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite\nelement models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to\nEnceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If\nEnceladus's shell is conductive with isostatic thickness variations, surface\nstresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness.\nThe radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination\nof crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar\nstresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between\nthe maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes.

Previous work has shown that Coactive Learning is a\nsuitable method for learning user preferences in constructive scenarios. In\nCoactive Learning the user provides feedback to the algorithm in the form of an\nimprovement to a suggested configuration.

The heterogeneity is likely to\nconfound the association between explanatory variables and responses, resulting\nin a wealth of false discoveries when Lasso or its variants are na\\\"ively\napplied. Therefore, the research interest of developing effective confounder\ncorrection methods is growing. However, ordinarily employing recent confounder\ncorrection methods will result in undesirable performance due to the ignorance\nof the convoluted interdependency among the prolific response variables. To\nfully improve current variable selection methods, we introduce a model that can\nutilize the dependency information from multiple responses to select the active\nvariables from heterogeneous data.

Existing graph representation learning\nmethods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the\nunderlying connectivity distribution in the graph, and discriminative models\nthat predict the probability of edge existence between a pair of vertices. In\nthis paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning\nframework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model\nand discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically,\nfor a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true\nconnectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces \"fake\" samples\nto fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to\ndetect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the\ngenerative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them\ncan alternately and iteratively boost their performance. Moreover, when\nconsidering the implementation of generative model, we propose a novel graph\nsoftmax to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax function, which can\nbe proven satisfying desirable properties of normalization, graph structure\nawareness, and computational efficiency.

Despite their promising performances on many\ntasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine\nintelligence. One is that CNNs are complex and hard to interpret. Another is\nthat standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes\nhard to obtain, and it is desirable to learn to recognize objects from few\nexamples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing\nnovel, flexible, and interpretable models for few-shot learning. Our models are\nbased on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts (VCs), which\nare interpretable visual cues represented by the feature vectors within CNNs.\nWe first adapt the learning of VCs to the few-shot setting, and then uncover\ntwo key properties of feature encoding using VCs, which we call category\nsensitivity and spatial pattern. Motivated by these properties, we present two\nintuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning.

We try to\nextract common features of scalar-tensor black holes in an expanding universe\nand point out the gaps that must be filled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 11:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Conventional\nsuperconducting memories use an architecture based on Josephson junctions (JJs)\nand have demonstrated access times less than 10 ps and power dissipation as low\nas $10^{-19}$ J. However, their scalability has been slow to develop due to the\nchallenges in reducing the dimensions of JJs and minimizing the area of the\nsuperconducting loops. In addition to the memory itself, complex readout\ncircuits require additional JJs and inductors for coupling signals, increasing\nthe overall area. Here, we have demonstrated a superconducting memory based\nsolely on lithographic nanowires. The small dimensions of the nanowire ensure\nthat the device can be fabricated in a dense area in multiple layers, while the\nhigh kinetic inductance makes the loop essentially independent of geometric\ninductance, allowing it to be scaled down without sacrificing performance.

However, it was observed that it also leads to a\nhigher variance in the controlled network than that obtained when using a\nconstitutive (i.e. open-loop) control strategy. This was interpreted as the\ncost of the adaptation property and may be viewed as a performance\ndeterioration for the overall controlled network. To decrease this variance and\nimprove the performance, we propose to combine the antithetic integral feedback\nmotif with a negative feedback strategy. Both theoretical and numerical results\nare obtained. The theoretical ones are based on a tailored moment closure\nmethod allowing one to obtain approximate expressions for the stationary\nvariance for the controlled network and predict that the variance can indeed be\ndecreased by increasing the strength of the negative feedback. Numerical\nresults verify the accuracy of this approximation and show that the controlled\nspecies variance can indeed be decreased, sometimes below its constitutive\nlevel. Three molecular networks are considered in order to verify the wide\napplicability of two types of negative feedback strategies. The main conclusion\nis that there is a trade-off between the speed of the settling-time of the mean\ntrajectories and the stationary variance of the controlled species; i.e.\nsmaller variance is associated with larger settling-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

Recent work has focused on the\nresponse of a single neuron to a weak, subthreshold periodic signal. By\nsimulating the FitzHugh-Nagumo stochastic model and then using a symbolic\nmethod to analyze the firing activity of the neuron, preferred and infrequent\nspike patterns (defined by the relative timing of the spikes) were detected,\nwhose probabilities encode information about the signal. As not individual\nneurons in isolation but neuronal populations are responsible for the emergence\nof complex behaviors, a relevant question is whether this coding mechanism is\nrobust when the neuron is not isolated. We study how a second neuron, which\ndoes not perceive the subthreshold signal, affects the detection and the\nencoding of the signal, done by the first neuron. Through simulations of two\ncoupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons we show that the coding mechanism is indeed\nrobust, as the neuron that perceives the signal fires a spike train that has\nsymbolic patterns whose probabilities depend on the features of the signal.\nMoreover, we show that the second neuron facilitates the detection of the\nsignal, by lowering the firing threshold of the first neuron. This in turn\ndecreases the internal noise level need to fire the spikes that encode the\nsignal.

Classical stabilized formulations can create unwanted artificial\nenergy. Our contribution corrects this undesired property by employing the\nconcepts of dynamic as well as orthogonal small-scales within the variational\nmultiscale framework (VMS). The desire for correct energy indicates that the\nlarge- and small-scales should be $H_0^1$-orthogonal. Using this orthogonality\nthe VMS method can be converted into the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin\n(SUPG) or the Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) method. Incorporating both large-\nand small-scales in the energy definition asks for dynamic behavior of the\nsmall-scales. Therefore, the large- and small-scales are treated as separate\nequations.\n  Two consistent variational formulations which depict correct-energy behavior\nare proposed: (i) the Galerkin/least-squares method with dynamic small-scales\n(GLSD) and (ii) the dynamic orthogonal formulation (DO).

We\ndesign a relational symbolic execution engine, named RelSym which supports\ninteractive refutation, as well as proving of relational properties for\nprograms written in a language with arrays and for-like loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 15:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 21:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 21:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

The micellar\nsolution is treated as a dilute suspension of rigid Brownian rods whose length\nvaries dynamically. Consistent with the mechanism presented by Turner and Cates\n[J. Phys.:~Condens. Matter 4, 3719 (1992)], flow-induced alignment of the rods\nis assumed to promote increase of rod length that corresponds to the formation\nof flow-induced structures observed in experiments. At very high deformation\nrate, hydrodynamic stresses causes the rod length to decrease. These mechanisms\nare implemented in a phenomenological equation governing the evolution of rod\nlength, with the number density of rods appropriately modified to ensure\nconservation of surfactant mass. The model leads first to an increase in both\nshear and extensional viscosity as deformation rate increases and then to a\ndecrease at higher rates. If the rate constant for flow-induced rod growth is\nsufficiently large, the model predicts a multivalued relation between stress\nand deformation rate in both shear and uniaxial extension. Predictions for\nshear and extensional flow at steady state are in reasonable agreement with\nexperimental results.

We also propose a novel sequence-only predictor of\nbinding affinity called ISLAND which gives better accuracy than existing\nmethods over the same validation set as well as on external independent test\ndataset. A cloud-based webserver implementation of ISLAND and its Python code\nare available at the URL:\nhttp://faculty.pieas.edu.pk/fayyaz/software.html#island.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 07:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 06:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system with an auto\nattention mechanism for robust and efficient 2D/3D image registration.\nSpecifically, an individual agent is trained with dilated Fully Convolutional\nNetwork (FCN) to perform registration in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by\nobserving a local region, and the final action is then taken based on the\nproposals from multiple agents and weighted by their corresponding confidence\nlevels. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we formulate\n2D/3D registration as a MDP with observations, actions, and rewards properly\ndefined with respect to X-ray imaging systems. Second, to handle various\nartifacts in 2D X-ray images, multiple local agents are employed efficiently\nvia FCN-based structures, and an auto attention mechanism is proposed to favor\nthe proposals from regions with more reliable visual cues. Third, a dilated\nFCN-based training mechanism is proposed to significantly reduce the Degree of\nFreedom in the simulation of registration environment, and drastically improve\ntraining efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to standard CNN-based\ntraining method. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high\nrobustness on both spine cone beam Computed Tomography data with a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio and data from minimally invasive spine surgery where\nsevere image artifacts and occlusions are presented due to metal screws and\nguide wires, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods (single agent-based\nand optimization-based) by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 03:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

To this end, we study a number of\nmethods for video-based person re-identification and make the following\nfindings: 1) Max-pooling only focuses on the maximum value of a receptive\nfield, wasting a lot of information. 2) Networks with different streams even\nincluding the one with the worst performance work better than networks with\nsame streams, where each one has the best performance alone. 3) A full\nconnection layer at the end of convolutional networks is not necessary. Based\non these studies, we propose a new convolutional architecture termed\nThree-Stream Convolutional Networks (TSCN). It first uses different streams to\nlearn different aspects of feature maps for attentive spatio-temporal fusion of\nvideo, and then merges them together to study some union features. To further\nutilize the feature maps, two architectures are designed by using the\nstrategies of multi-scale and upsampling. Comparative experiments on iLIDS-VID,\nPRID-2011 and MARS datasets illustrate that the proposed architectures are\nsignificantly better for feature extraction than the state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 15:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

If CCS is going\nto be a widespread technology to deliver energy without CO2 emissions,\ncost-efficient monitoring programs will be a key to reduce the storage costs. A\nsimulation framework, previously used to estimate flow parameters at Sleipner\nLayer 9 [1], is here extended and employed to identify how the number of\nmeasurements can be reduced without significantly reducing the obtained\ninformation. The main part of the methodology is based on well-proven, stable\nand robust, simulation technology together with adjoint-based sensitivities and\ndata mining techniques using singular value decomposition (SVD). In particular\nwe combine the simulation framework with time-dependent (seismic) measurements\nof the migrating plume. We also study how uplift data and gravitational data\ngive complementary information.\n  We apply this methodology to the Sleipner project, which provides the most\nextensive data for CO2 storage to date. For this study we utilize a\nvertical-equilibrium (VE) flow model for computational efficiency as\nimplemented in the open-source software MRST-co2lab.\n  However, our methodology for deriving efficient monitoring schemes is not\nrestricted to VE-type flow models, and at the end, we discuss how the\nmethodology can be used in the context of full 3D simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}
