Experimental evidence shows that 50% of\nthe energy consumed by a core and its data memory is related to FP\ncomputations. The adoption of FP formats requiring a lower number of bits is an\ninteresting opportunity to reduce energy consumption, since it allows to\nsimplify the arithmetic circuitry and to reduce the memory bandwidth between\nmemory and registers by enabling vectorization. From a theoretical point of\nview, the adoption of multiple FP types perfectly fits with the principle of\ntransprecision computing, allowing fine-grained control of approximation while\nmeeting specified constraints on the precision of final results. In this paper\nwe propose an extended FP type system with complete hardware support to enable\ntransprecision computing on low-power embedded processors, including two\nstandard formats (binary32 and binary16) and two new formats (binary8 and\nbinary16alt). First, we introduce a software library that enables exploration\nof FP types by tuning both precision and dynamic range of program variables.\nThen, we present a methodology to integrate our library with an external tool\nfor precision tuning, and experimental results that highlight the clear\nbenefits of introducing the new formats.

Experimental results on FP-intensive\nbenchmarks show that up to 90% of FP operations can be safely scaled down to\n8-bit or 16-bit formats. Thanks to precision tuning and vectorization,\nexecution time is decreased by 12% and memory accesses are reduced by 27% on\naverage, leading to a reduction of energy consumption up to 30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The implementation in\nClang/LLVM aims to deliver a generic GPU compilation toolchain that supports\nboth the native CUDA C/C++ and the OpenMP device offloading models. There are\nsituations where the semantics of OpenMP and those of CUDA diverge. One such\nexample is the policy for implicitly handling local variables. In CUDA, local\nvariables are implicitly mapped to thread local memory and thus become private\nto a CUDA thread. In OpenMP, due to semantics that allow the nesting of regions\nexecuted by different numbers of threads, variables need to be implicitly\n\\emph{shared} among the threads of a contention group. In this paper we\nintroduce a re-design of the OpenMP device data sharing infrastructure that is\nresponsible for the implicit sharing of local variables in the Clang/LLVM\ntoolchain. We introduce a new data sharing infrastructure that lowers\nimplicitly shared variables to the shared memory of the GPU. We measure the\namount of shared memory used by our scheme in cases that involve scalar\nvariables and statically allocated arrays. The evaluation is carried out by\noffloading to K40 and P100 NVIDIA GPUs. For scalar variables the pressure on\nshared memory is relatively low, under 26\\% of shared memory utilization for\nthe K40, and does not negatively impact occupancy. The limiting occupancy\nfactor in that case is register pressure. The data sharing scheme offers the\nusers a simple memory model for controlling the implicit allocation of device\nshared memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 17:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Following\nSchaller, Kie{\\ss}lich and Brandes we explicitly account for a meter that\nregisters the transported charge outside the system. The gauge freedom\nunderlying geometric pumping effects in all moments of the transported charge\nemerges naturally as the calibration of this meter. Remarkably, we find that\ngeometric and physical considerations cannot be applied independently as done\nin closed systems: physical recalibrations do not form a group due to\nconstraints of positivity (Bochner's theorem). This complication goes unnoticed\nwhen considering only the average charge but it is relevant for understanding\nthe origin of geometric effects in the higher moments of the charge-transport\nstatistics.

Due to the\nhighly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures\noften require proper regularization (e.g. trimming, regularized cost,\nprojection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such\nas gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly\nconservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks\nperformance guarantees.\n  This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in\nthe absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper\nregularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient\ndescent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry,\nconsisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This \"implicit\nregularization\" feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more\naggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial\ncomputational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation\nproblems, i.e. phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind\ndeconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal\nstatistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In\nparticular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory,\nwe develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative\nalgorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a byproduct, for noisy\nmatrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal\nerror control --- measured entrywise and by the spectral norm --- which might\nbe of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 18:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 10:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 02:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Here, we\nshow both theoretically and experimentally that the existence of such a scale\nis unjustifiable from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a\nvariant of the Wigner's friend experiment in which a multiparticle quantum\nsystem is observed by the friend. The friend undergoes rapid decoherence\nthrough her interactions with the environment. In the usual version of this\nthought experiment, decoherence removes the need for Wigner to treat her as a\nquantum system.

Importantly, we show that the friend is\nindispensable for the entanglement to be observed. Hence Wigner is compelled to\ntreat the friend as part of a larger quantum system.

An intelligent recommender\nsystem is not only useful for the user but also for businesses which want to\nlearn the tendencies of their users.

Many successful wake sensing\nstrategies have been devised based on models of von Karman-type wakes; however,\nsuch wake sensing technologies are invalid in the context of exotic wake types\nthat commonly arise in swimming locomotion. Indeed, exotic wakes can exhibit\nmarkedly different dynamics, and so must be modeled and sensed accordingly.\nHere, we propose a general wake detection protocol for distinguishing between\nwake types from measured hydrodynamic signals alone. An ideal-flow model is\nformulated and used to demonstrate the general wake detection framework in a\nproof-of-concept study. We show that wakes with different underlying dynamics\nimpart distinct signatures on a fish-like body, which can be observed in\ntime-series measurements at a single location on the body surface. These\nhydrodynamic wake signatures are used to construct a wake classification\nlibrary that is then used to classify unknown wakes from hydrodynamic signal\nmeasurements. The wake detection protocol is found to have an accuracy rate of\nover 95% in the majority of performance studies conducted here. Thus, exotic\nwake detection is shown to be viable, which suggests that such technologies\nhave the potential to become key enablers of multi-model sensing and locomotion\ncontrol strategies in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 21:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

The patients had no preoperative therapy before breast MRI and no\nprior history of breast cancer. We explored two different deep learning\napproaches to predict whether there was a hidden (occult) invasive component in\nthe analyzed tumors that was ultimately detected at surgical excision. In the\nfirst approach, we adopted the transfer learning strategy, in which a network\npre-trained on a large dataset of natural images is fine-tuned with our DCIS\nimages. Specifically, we used the GoogleNet model pre-trained on the ImageNet\ndataset.

An\nindividualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from\npatient information to a recommended treatment. A treatment rule is defined to\nbe optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of\ninterest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention\nscientists often must balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g.,\nsymptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision\nmedicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all\ncompeting outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from\npatients is difficult without a high-quality instrument, and an expert-derived\ncomposite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We\npropose a new paradigm for the study of precision medicine using observational\ndata that relies solely on the assumption that clinicians are approximately\n(i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility.\nEstimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of\nan individualized treatment rule which maximizes the mean of patient-specific\ncomposite outcomes.

We study these\nproblems in the ordinal setting: latent numerical utilities exist, but we only\nhave access to ordinal preference information, i.e., every agent specifies an\nordering over the other agents by preference. We prove that for the large class\nof graph problems we identify, ordinal information is enough to compute\nsolutions which are close to optimal, thus demonstrating there is no need to\nknow the underlying numerical utilities. For example, for problems in this\nclass with bounded degree $b$ a simple ordinal greedy algorithm always produces\na ($b+1$)-approximation; we also quantify how the quality of ordinal\napproximation depends on the sparsity of the resulting graphs. In particular,\nour results imply that ordinal information is enough to obtain a\n2-approximation for Maximum Spanning Tree; a 4-approximation for Max Weight\nPlanar Subgraph; a 2-approximation for Max-TSP; and a 2-approximation for\nvarious Matching problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 22:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

While many\nstatistical learning and data mining techniques have been used for developing\nmore effective outlier detection algorithms, the interpretation of detected\noutliers does not receive much attention. Interpretation is becoming\nincreasingly important to help people trust and evaluate the developed models\nthrough providing intrinsic reasons why the certain outliers are chosen. It is\ndifficult, if not impossible, to simply apply feature selection for explaining\noutliers due to the distinct characteristics of various detection models,\ncomplicated structures of data in certain applications, and imbalanced\ndistribution of outliers and normal instances. In addition, the role of\ncontrastive contexts where outliers locate, as well as the relation between\noutliers and contexts, are usually overlooked in interpretation. To tackle the\nissues above, in this paper, we propose a novel Contextual Outlier\nINterpretation (COIN) method to explain the abnormality of existing outliers\nspotted by detectors. The interpretability for an outlier is achieved from\nthree aspects: outlierness score, attributes that contribute to the\nabnormality, and contextual description of its neighborhoods. Experimental\nresults on various types of datasets demonstrate the flexibility and\neffectiveness of the proposed framework compared with existing interpretation\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 22:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 21:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 23:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

We identify two primary causes of halo mass loss: relaxation after\na major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major\nmergers initially boost $M_{\\mathrm{vir}}$ and typically cause the final halo\nto become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW\nconcentration. As the halo relaxes, high energy material from the recent merger\ngradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net\nnegative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by $5-15\\%$ on average.\nHalos that experience a major merger around $z = 0.4$ typically reach a minimum\nmass near $z = 0$. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it\ncauses halos to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW\nconcentrations. Tidally stripped halos often lose a large fraction of their\npeak mass ($> 20\\%$) and most never recover (or even reattain a positive\naccretion rate).

However, transmission of information in wireless channels is\nprimarily impaired by deleterious multipath fading, which affects the quality\nand reliability of the system. In order to overcome the detrimental effects of\nfading, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology is an attractive\nscheme that employs multiple transceiver antennas to carry the data over the\nsame frequency band over a variety of signal paths. This technology has shown\ngreat solutions due to its ability to provide better spectral efficiency,\ncapacity, throughput and robustness of the data transmission. But in practice,\nit is impractical to install multiple antennas on small-sized devices. Hence,\nto overcome the limitations of MIMO gain in the future wireless networks,\ncooperative diversity has recently draw in attention due to its ability to\ncircumvent the difficulties of implementing actual antenna arrays in\nMultiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO). By exploiting the broadcast feature\nof the wireless medium, cooperation among multiple nearby nodes is formed for\ndata transmission. At the receiver, the signals are either coherently or\ndifferentially detected. Coherent detection requires exact channel estimation,\nwhich is difficult to apply in a time-varying channel. Hence, when the nodes\nare mobile, or when the channel is inaccurately estimated, the differential\ndetection techniques that omit channel estimation become an alternative as\ncompared to coherent detection. This article presents a review of the\ndifferential transmission techniques for cooperative diversity networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 02:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

By work of Agol and Cooper-Long-Reid,\nmost 3-manifold groups are large; in particular, the fundamental groups of\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds are large. In previous work, the first author gave\nexamples of closed, hyperbolic 3-manifolds with arbitrarily large first\nhomology rank but whose fundamental groups do not surject onto a non-abelian\nfree group. We call a group very large if it surjects onto a non-abelian free\ngroup. In this paper, we consider the question of whether the groups of\nhomology handlebodies - which are very close to being free - are very large. We\nshow that the fundamental group of W. Thurston's tripus manifold, is not very\nlarge; it is known to be weakly parafree by Stallings' Theorem and large by the\nwork of Cooper-Long-Reid since the tripus is a hyperbolic manifold with totally\ngeodesic boundary. It is still unknown if a 3-manifold group that is weakly\nparafree of rank at least 3 must be very large. However, we more generally\nconsider the co-rank of the fundamental group, also known as the cut number of\nthe manifold. For each positive integer g we construct a homology handlebody\nY_g of genus g whose group has co-rank equal to r(g), where r(g)=g/2 for g even\nand r(g)=(g+1)/2 for g odd. That is, these groups are weakly parafree of rank g\nand surject onto a free group of rank roughly half of g but no larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 03:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

They aim to learn a linear model jointly in\na federated setting, namely, data is local and a shared model is trained from\nlocally computed updates. In contrast with most work on distributed learning,\nin this scenario (i) data is split vertically, i.e. by features, (ii) only one\ndata provider knows the target variable and (iii) entities are not linked\nacross the data providers. Hence, to the challenge of private learning, we add\nthe potentially negative consequences of mistakes in entity resolution. Our\ncontribution is twofold. First, we describe a three-party end-to-end solution\nin two phases ---privacy-preserving entity resolution and federated logistic\nregression over messages encrypted with an additively homomorphic scheme---,\nsecure against a honest-but-curious adversary. The system allows learning\nwithout either exposing data in the clear or sharing which entities the data\nproviders have in common. Our implementation is as accurate as a naive\nnon-private solution that brings all data in one place, and scales to problems\nwith millions of entities with hundreds of features. Second, we provide what is\nto our knowledge the first formal analysis of the impact of entity resolution's\nmistakes on learning, with results on how optimal classifiers, empirical\nlosses, margins and generalisation abilities are affected. Our results bring a\nclear and strong support for federated learning: under reasonable assumptions\non the number and magnitude of entity resolution's mistakes, it can be\nextremely beneficial to carry out federated learning in the setting where each\npeer's data provides a significant uplift to the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 04:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

Recently, generative adversarial net (GAN) and\nencoder-decoder architecture are usually incorporated to handle this task with\npromising results. Based on the encoder-decoder architecture, facial attribute\nediting is achieved by decoding the latent representation of the given face\nconditioned on the desired attributes. Some existing methods attempt to\nestablish an attribute-independent latent representation for further attribute\nediting. However, such attribute-independent constraint on the latent\nrepresentation is excessive because it restricts the capacity of the latent\nrepresentation and may result in information loss, leading to over-smooth and\ndistorted generation. Instead of imposing constraints on the latent\nrepresentation, in this work we apply an attribute classification constraint to\nthe generated image to just guarantee the correct change of desired attributes,\ni.e., to \"change what you want\". Meanwhile, the reconstruction learning is\nintroduced to preserve attribute-excluding details, in other words, to \"only\nchange what you want\". Besides, the adversarial learning is employed for\nvisually realistic editing. These three components cooperate with each other\nforming an effective framework for high quality facial attribute editing,\nreferred as AttGAN. Furthermore, our method is also directly applicable for\nattribute intensity control and can be naturally extended for attribute style\nmanipulation. Experiments on CelebA dataset show that our method outperforms\nthe state-of-the-arts on realistic attribute editing with facial details well\npreserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 04:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 04:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 10:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

In particular, we\nstudy the characteristics of the tails of yield distributions, which correspond\nto very asymmetric fission. We use the stochastic Langevin framework to\nsimulate the nuclear evolution after the system tunnels through the\nmulti-dimensional potential barrier. For a representative sample of different\ninitial configurations along the outer turning-point line, we define effective\nfission paths by computing a large number of Langevin trajectories. We extract\nthe relative contribution of each such path to the fragment distribution. We\nthen use nucleon localization functions along effective fission pathways to\nanalyze the characteristics of prefragments at pre-scission configurations. We\nfind that non-Newtonian Langevin trajectories, strongly impacted by the random\nforce, produce the tails of the fission fragment distribution. The prefragments\ndeduced from nucleon localizations are formed early and change little as the\nnucleus evolves towards scission. On the other hand, the system contains many\nnucleons that are not localized in the prefragments, even near the scission\npoint. Such nucleons are rapidly distributed at scission to form the final\nfragments. Our study shows that only theoretical models of fission that account\nfor some form of dissipative/stochastic dynamics can give an accurate\ndescription of the structure of fragment distributions. In particular, it\nshould be nearly impossible to predict the tails of these distributions within\nthe standard formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. At the\nsame time, the large number of non-localized nucleons during fission suggests\nthat adiabatic approaches are ill-suited to describe fission fragment\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 05:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The purpose was to image part of the USC main campus in Los\nAngeles, USA, using two portable COTS (commercial off the shelf) aerial drone\nsolutions for data acquisition, for photogrammetry (3D reconstruction from\nimages), and fusion of hyperspectral data with the recovered set of 3D point\nclouds representing the target area. The research aims for determining the\nviability of having a machine capable of segmenting the target area into key\nmaterial classes (e.g., manmade structures, live vegetation, water) for use in\nmultiple purposes, to include providing the user with a more accurate scene\nunderstanding and enabling the unsupervised automatic sampling of meaningful\nmaterial classes from the target area for adaptive semi-supervised machine\nlearning. In the latter, a target set library may be used for automatic machine\ntraining with data of local material classes, as an example, to increase the\nprediction chances of machines recognizing targets. The field experiment and\nassociated data post processing approach to correct for reflectance,\ngeo-rectify, recover the area's dense point clouds from images, register\nspectral with elevation properties of scene surfaces from the independently\ncollected datasets, and generate the desired scene segmented maps are\ndiscussed. Lessons learned from the experience are also highlighted throughout\nthe paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 06:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

Specifically, the\ninformation-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two\nwireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx, and the\nbackscatter channel from the Tx to the Tag and then to the Rx. The received\nsignal from the backscatter channel also carries the Tag's information because\nof the multiplicative backscatter operation at the Tag. This multiple-access\nsystem introduces a new channel model, referred to as multiplicative\nmultiple-access channel (M-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the\nM-MAC, and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the\nconventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including,\ne.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger\nthan the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme\nis an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter\ncommunication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for\ncoherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the Tag,\nrespectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further\nbring interesting insights for practical system design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 06:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

In transition metal complexes, the interaction\nbetween the metal and the different ligands gives rise to a rich variety of\nexcited states, including metal-centered, intra-ligand, metal-to-ligand charge\ntransfer, ligand-to-metal charge transfer, and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer\nstates. Most often, these excited states are identified by considering the most\nimportant wave function excitation coefficients and inspecting visually the\ninvolved orbitals. This procedure is tedious, subjective, and imprecise.\nInstead, automatic and quantitative techniques for excited-state\ncharacterization are desirable. In this contribution we review the concept of\ncharge transfer numbers---as implemented in the TheoDORE package---and show its\nwide applicability to characterize the excited states of transition metal\ncomplexes. Charge transfer numbers are a formal way to analyze an excited state\nin terms of electron transitions between groups of atoms based only on the\nwell-defined transition density matrix. Its advantages are many: it can be\nfully automatized for many excited states, is objective and reproducible, and\nprovides quantitative data useful for the discussion of trends or patterns. We\nalso introduce a formalism for spin-orbit-mixed states and a method for\nstatistical analysis of charge transfer numbers. The potential of this\ntechnique is demonstrated for a number of prototypical transition metal\ncomplexes containing Ir, Ru, and Re. Topics discussed include orbital\ndelocalization between metal and carbonyl ligands, nonradiative decay through\nmetal-centered states, effect of spin-orbit couplings on state character, and\ncomparison among results obtained from different electronic structure methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 07:13:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based\nrecommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from\nHINs. Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity,\nwhich cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items. In this\npaper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for\nHIN based recommendation, called HERec. To embed HINs, we design a meta-path\nbased random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network\nembedding. The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion\nfunctions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization\n(MF) model. The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly\noptimized for the rating prediction task. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HERec model. Moreover,\nwe show the capability of the HERec model for the cold-start problem, and\nreveal that the transformed embedding information from HINs can improve the\nrecommendation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 08:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

We explore\nthe propagation of the kink MHD mode along the jet that can become unstable\nagainst the KHI if its speed exceeds a critical value. Concerning magnetic\nfields topology we consider three different configurations, notably of (i)\nspatially homogeneous magnetic fields (untwisted magnetic flux tube), (ii)\ninternal (label `i') twisted magnetic field and external homogeneous one (label\n`e') (single-twisted flux tube), and (iii) both internal and external twisted\nmagnetic fields (double-twisted magnetic flux tube).

Furthermore, by adopting\nNesterov's extrapolation we show that the convergence rates can be improved to\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)$ for the generally convex problems and\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{K^2}\\right)$ for strongly convex ones.\n  When applied to the decentralized distributed optimization, the penalty\nmethods studied in this paper become the widely used distributed gradient\nmethod and the fast distributed gradient method. However, due to the totally\ndifferent analysis framework, we can improve their $O\\left(\\frac{\\log\nK}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$ and $O\\left(\\frac{\\log K}{K}\\right)$ convergence rates to\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$ and $O\\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)$ with fewer\nassumptions on the network topology for general convex problems. Using our\nanalysis framework, we also extend the fast distributed gradient method to a\ncommunication efficient version, i.e., finding an $\\varepsilon$ solution in\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ communications and\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2+\\delta}}\\right)$ computations for the\nnon-smooth problems, where $\\delta$ is a small constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 11:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

This process leads to\ngradients in chemical composition along the surface of the particle, as well as\nalong any nearby boundaries, including solid walls. Chemical gradients along a\nwall can give rise to chemi-osmosis, i.e., the gradients drive surface flows\nwhich, in turn, drive flow in the volume of the solution. This bulk flow\ncouples back to the particle, and thus contributes to its self-motility. Since\nchemi-osmosis strongly depends on the molecular interactions between the\ndiffusing molecular species and the wall, the response flow induced and\nexperienced by a particle encodes information about any chemical patterning of\nthe wall. Here, we extend previous studies on self-phoresis of a sphere near a\nchemically patterned wall to the case of particles with elongated shape. We\nfocus our analysis on the new phenomenology potentially emerging from the\ncoupling -- which is inoperative for a spherical shape -- of the elongated\nparticle to the strain rate tensor of the chemi-osmotic flow. Via numerical\ncalculations, we show that the dynamics of a rod-like particle exhibits a novel\n\"edge-following\" steady state: the particle translates along the edge of a\nchemical step at a steady distance from the step and with a steady orientation.\nWithin a certain range of system parameters, the edge-following state co-exists\nwith a \"docking\" state (the particle stops at the step, oriented perpendicular\nto the step edge), i.e., a bistable dynamics occurs. These findings are\nrationalized as a consequence of the competition between fluid vorticity and\nthe rate of strain by using analytical theory based on the point-particle\napproximation which captures quasi-quantitatively the dynamics of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

During this period, the PAMELA space\nexperiment observed spectra for galactic cosmic rays, specifically for protons,\nelectrons and positrons over a wide energy range, during what is called an A <\n0 solar magnetic polarity cycle. Drift theory predicts a difference in the\nbehaviour for these oppositely charge particles during A < 0 cycles. An\nopportunity was thus created to study the predicted charge-sign-dependent\nmodulation, also now for very quiet heliospheric conditions. A comprehensive\nthree-dimensional, drift modulation model has been used to study the solar\nmodulation for cosmic rays in detail with extensive comparison to the observed\nPAMELA spectra for the mentioned period. First, this was done for protons and\nsecondly for electrons, as already published, to test and to authenticate the\nmodelling approach and then to come to a better understanding and appreciation\nof the underlying physics, such as diffusion and drift theory. The results were\nalso used to make predictions of how cosmic rays are differently modulated down\nto low energies (1 MeV) for the two magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, and\nwhat role drifts play in this process. All computed solutions are based on new\nvery local interstellar spectra, now also done for positrons. This report is\nfocussed on detailed aspects of the solar modulation of positrons during the\nextraordinary quiet solar modulation period from 2006 to 2009.

In\nhigh-recombining sequence, the targets of selection are individual genetic\nloci; under low recombination, selection collectively acts on large,\ngenetically linked genomic segments. Selection under linkage can induce clonal\ninterference, a specific mode of evolution by competition of genetic clades\nwithin a population. This mode is well known in asexually evolving microbes,\nbut has not been traced systematically in an obligate sexual organism. Here we\nshow that the Drosophila genome is partitioned into two modes of evolution: a\nlocal interference regime with limited effects of genetic linkage, and an\ninterference condensate with clonal competition. We map these modes by\ndifferences in mutation frequency spectra, and we show that the transition\nbetween them occurs at a threshold recombination rate that is predictable from\ngenomic summary statistics.

The MSP in the HMF model is a\nconsequence of the Landau damping (LD) and it appears in systems that the\ninteractions belongs to a long range regime. Actually HMF is a toy model known\nto show up the main characteristics of astrophysical systems due to the mean\nfield character of the potential and for different masses, as stellar and\ngalaxies clusters, also exhibits MSP.

An interesting result is that increases caused by DSA at the TS\nare comparable in magnitude to electron intensity enhancements observed by\nVoyager 1 ahead of the TS crossing. These intensity increases are large enough\nto account for observed intensity peaks, and thus supports the view that DSA is\ninvolved in their production. Additionally, the energy spectra observed by\nVoyager 1 throughout the heliosheath are reproduced satisfactorily, as well as\nthe PAMELA spectrum at Earth at higher energies.

Two approaches\nto loop quantum cosmology with admissible ultraviolet behavior leading to\npredictions that are compatible with observations are the so-called hybrid and\ndressed metric approaches.

Besides, given\nthe privileged role that the big bounce plays in loop quantum cosmology, e.g.\nas a natural instant of time to set initial conditions for the perturbations,\nwe also analyze the positivity of the time-dependent mass when this bounce\noccurs. We prove that the mass of the tensor perturbations is positive in the\nhybrid approach when the kinetic contribution to the energy density of the\ninflaton dominates over its potential, as well as for a considerably large\nsector of backgrounds around that situation, while this mass is always\nnonpositive in the dressed metric approach. Similar results are demonstrated\nfor the scalar perturbations in a sector of background solutions that includes\nthe kinetically dominated ones; namely, the mass then is positive for the\nhybrid approach, whereas it typically becomes negative in the dressed metric\ncase.

In the experiments, HMDN produces interpretable\nand diverse candidate samples, and significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks with occlusions, and performs\ncomparably on another benchmark free of occlusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 14:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 18:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

For example, when Mg is\npartially substituted by Cu or Zn, the displacement of Cu or Zn is much larger\nthan that of Mg, and is even comparable to that of Nb. The polarization of\nthese systems is also increased, especially for the Cu-doped solution, due to\nthe large polarizability of Cu and Zn. As a result, the predicted maximum\ndielectric constant temperatures ($T_m$) are increased. On the other hand, the\nreplacement of a Ti atom with a Mo or Tc dramatically decreases the\ndisplacements of the cations and the polarization, and thus, the $T_m$ values\nare also substantially decreased. The higher $T_m$ cannot be explained by the\nconventional argument based on the ionic radii of the cations. Furthermore, we\nfind that Cu, Mo, or Tc doping increase the cations displacement disorder.

At test time, most spatio-temporal encoding\nmethods assume that a temporally segmented sequence is fed to a learned model,\nwhich could require the prediction to wait until the full sequence is available\nto an auxiliary task that performs the temporal segmentation. This causes a\ndelay in predicting the expression. In an interactive setting, such as\naffective interactive agents, such delay in the prediction could not be\ntolerated. Therefore, training a model that can accurately predict the facial\nexpression \"on-the-fly\" (as they are fed to the system) is essential.

Crowd wisdom\nestimates each individual's independent error level arising from their limited\nknowledge, and finds the crowd consensus that minimizes the overall error.\nHowever, previous studies have merely built isolated, problem-specific models\nwith limited generalizability, and mainly for binary (yes/no) responses.

A central challenge when dealing with many demand\nresponse providers is the uncertainty of its realization. In this paper, a new\neconomic dispatch framework that is based on the recent theoretical development\nof the scenario approach is introduced. By removing samples from a finite\nuncertainty set, this approach improves dispatch performance while guaranteeing\na quantifiable risk level with respect to the probability of violating the\nconstraints. The theoretical bound on the level of risk is shown to be a\nfunction of the number of scenarios removed. This is appealing to the system\noperator for the following reasons: (1) the improvement of performance comes at\nthe cost of a quantifiable level of violation probability in the constraints;\n(2) the violation upper bound does not depend on the probability distribution\nassumption of the uncertainty in demand response.

One vital challenge is that the legitimate spectrum\nexploitation and misuse behaviors coexist and the illegitimate user may act in\nan intermittent and fast-changing manner, which brings about much uncertainty\nfor spectrum sensing. To tackle it, we firstly formulate the spectrum sensing\nproblems under illegitimate access and rogue power emission as a uniform\nternary hypothesis test.

The circulation of exoplanets with\n$P_{orb} \\leq $ 25~days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave\nin the troposphere and also in the stratosphere: It leads to a strong\nequatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that\nconfines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the\ndistribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited\nto an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,\nlike GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the\nstratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.\n  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked\nExoEarths with $P_{orb} \\leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep\nstratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like\non Earth.

We observe a complex\nbehavior, that is we find out that the residence time does not depend\nmonotonically on the geometric properties of the obstacle, such as its width,\nlength, and position. In some cases, due to the presence of the obstacle, the\nmean residence time is shorter with respect to the one measured for the\nobstacle--free strip. We explain the residence time behavior by developing a 1D\nanalog of the 2D model where the role of the obstacle is played by two defect\nsites having a smaller probability to be crossed with respect to all the other\nregular sites. The 1D and 2D models behave similarly, but in the 1D case we are\nable to compute exactly the residence time finding a perfect match with the\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 12:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

According to the spherical\nsymmetry, similar angular dependencies in all the regions are considered using\nspherical harmonics. To extract the radial dependency, the system of\ndifferential equations of wave propagation toward the inhomogeneity direction\nis equated with the dual planar ones. A general duality between electromagnetic\nfields and parameters and scattering parameters of the two structures is\nintroduced. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through a\ncomprehensive example. The presented approach substitutes a complicated problem\nin spherical coordinate to an easy, well posed, and a previously solved problem\nin planar geometry. This approach is valid for all continuously varying\ninhomogeneity profiles. One of the major advantages of the proposed method is\nthe capability of studying two general and applicable types of RISSs. As an\ninteresting application, a new class of lens antenna based on the physical\nconcept of the gradient refractive index material is introduced. The approach\nis used to analyze the EM scattering from the structure and validate strong\nperformance of the lens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

By introducing the correlation\nanalysis technique, the mathematical expression of a convex model can be\nconveniently formulated once the correlation matrix of the uncertain parameters\nis created. More importantly, from the theoretic analysis level, an evaluation\ncriterion for convex modelling methods is proposed, which can be regarded as a\ntest standard for validity verification of subsequent newly proposed convex\nmodelling methods.
