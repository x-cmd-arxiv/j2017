The\nconfiguration studied was a rectangular channel with a supersonic inflow of\nstoichiometric ethylene-oxygen and a transimissive outflow boundary. The\ncalculation is initialized with a velocity in the computational domain equal to\nthat of the inflow, which is held constant for the duration of the calculation.\nThe compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations were solved by a high-order\nnumerical algorithm on an adapting mesh. This paper describes two calculations,\none with a Mach 3 inflow and one with Mach 5.25. In the Mach 3 case, the\nfuel-oxidizer mixture does not ignite and the flow reaches a steady-state\noblique shock train structure. In the Mach 5.25 case, ignition occurs in the\nboundary layers and the flame front becomes unstable due to a Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability at the interface between the burned and unburned gas. Growth of the\nreaction front and expansion of the burned gas compress and preheat the\nunburned gas. DDT occurs in several locations, initiating both at the flame\nfront and in the unburned gas, due to an energy-focusing mechanism. The growth\nof the flame instability that leads to DDT is analyzed using the Atwood number\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

This class of parametrizations has to satisfy\nspecific geometric continuity constraints, and is of importance since it allows\nto construct, on the multi-patch domain, $C^1$ isogeometric spaces with optimal\napproximation properties. It was demonstrated in (Kapl, Sangalli, Takacs; CAD,\n2018) that AS-$G^1$ multi-patch parametrizations are suitable for modeling\ncomplex planar multi-patch domains.\n  In this work, we construct a basis, and an associated dual basis, for a\nspecific $C^1$ isogeometric spline space $\\mathcal{W}$ over a given AS-$G^1$\nmulti-patch parametrization.

A\npower dominating set of a graph is a set of vertices that observes every vertex\nin the graph, following a set of rules for power system monitoring. A practical\nproblem of interest is to determine the minimum number of additional\nmeasurement devices needed to monitor a power network when the network is\nexpanded and the existing devices remain in place. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of finding the smallest power dominating set that contains a given set\nof vertices X. We also study the related problem of finding the smallest zero\nforcing set that contains a given set of vertices X. The sizes of such sets in\na graph G are respectively called the restricted power domination number and\nrestricted zero forcing number of G subject to X.

The\nnumerical inversion of the RTM equations is a challenging and computationally\ndemanding problem, and for this reason, often the application of a nonlinear\nstatistical regression is preferred. In general, regression models predict the\nbiophysical parameter of interest from the corresponding received radiance.\nHowever, this approach does not employ the physical information encoded in the\nRTMs. An alternative strategy, which attempts to include the physical\nknowledge, consists in learning a regression model trained using data simulated\nby an RTM code.

Within this\nframework, a CSP instance is decomposed into a number of sub-problems, called\nviews, whose solutions are either already available or can be computed\nefficiently. The goal is to arrange portions of these views in a tree-like\nstructure, called tree projection, which determines an efficiently solvable CSP\ninstance equivalent to the original one. Deciding whether a tree projection\nexists is NP-hard. Solution methods have therefore been proposed in the\nliterature that do not require a tree projection to be given, and that either\ncorrectly decide whether the given CSP instance is satisfiable, or return that\na tree projection actually does not exist. These approaches had not been\ngeneralized so far on CSP extensions for optimization problems, where the goal\nis to compute a solution of maximum value/minimum cost. The paper fills the\ngap, by exhibiting a fixed-parameter polynomial-time algorithm that either\ndisproves the existence of tree projections or computes an optimal solution,\nwith the parameter being the size of the expression of the objective function\nto be optimized over all possible solutions (and not the size of the whole\nconstraint formula, used in related works). Tractability results are also\nestablished for the problem of returning the best K solutions. Finally,\nparallel algorithms for such optimization problems are proposed and analyzed.\nGiven that the classes of acyclic hypergraphs, hypergraphs of bounded\ntreewidth, and hypergraphs of bounded generalized hypertree width are all\ncovered as special cases of the tree projection framework, the results in this\npaper directly apply to these classes. These classes are extensively considered\nin the CSP setting, as well as in conjunctive database query evaluation and\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 17:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Majority of existing works on PIR assume the\npresence of replicated databases, each storing all the $K$ messages. In this\nwork, we consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each\ndatabase has a storage capacity of $\\mu KL$ bits, where $K$ is the number of\nmessages, $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$ is\nthe normalized storage. In the storage constrained PIR problem, there are two\nkey design questions: a) how to store content across each database under\nstorage constraints; and b) construction of schemes that allow efficient PIR\nthrough storage constrained databases. The main contribution of this work is a\ngeneral achievable scheme for PIR from storage constrained databases for any\nvalue of storage. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, with normalized storage $\\mu=\nt/N$, where the parameter $t$ can take integer values $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots,\nN\\}$, we show that our proposed PIR scheme achieves a download cost of\n$\\left(1+ \\frac{1}{t}+ \\frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \\cdots + \\frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\\right)$. The\nextreme case when $\\mu=1$ (i.e., $t=N$) corresponds to the setting of\nreplicated databases with full storage. For this extremal setting, our scheme\nrecovers the information-theoretically optimal download cost characterized by\nSun and Jafar as $\\left(1+ \\frac{1}{N}+ \\cdots + \\frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\\right)$. For\nthe other extreme, when $\\mu= 1/N$ (i.e., $t=1$), the proposed scheme achieves\na download cost of $K$. The interesting aspect of the result is that for\nintermediate values of storage, i.e., $1/N < \\mu <1$, the proposed scheme can\nstrictly outperform memory-sharing between extreme values of storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

The scatter in the simulated MZR contains a clear correlation with\nthe gas-mass or star formation rate of the system, in agreement with the\nobserved fundamental metallicity relation. The scatter in the MZR is driven by\na competition between periods of enrichment- and accretion-dominated\nmetallicity evolution.

These investigations\nhave revealed that entanglement between holographic degrees of freedom is\ncrucial for the existence of bulk spacetime. We examine this connection from\nthe other end of the entanglement spectrum and clarify the assertion that\nmaximally entangled states have no reconstructable spacetime. To do so, we\nfirst define the conditions for bulk reconstructability. Under these terms, we\nscrutinize two cases of maximally entangled holographic states. One is the\nfamiliar example of AdS black holes; these are dual to thermal states of the\nboundary CFT. Sending the temperature to the cutoff scale makes the state\nmaximally entangled and the respective black hole consumes the spacetime. We\nthen examine the de Sitter limit of FRW spacetimes. This limit is maximally\nentangled if one formulates the boundary theory on the holographic screen.\nParalleling the AdS black hole, we find the resulting reconstructable region of\nspacetime vanishes. Motivated by these results, we prove a theorem showing that\nmaximally entangled states have no reconstructable spacetime. Evidently, the\nemergence of spacetime is endemic to intermediate entanglement. By studying the\nmanner in which intermediate entanglement is achieved, we uncover important\nproperties about the boundary theory of FRW spacetimes. With this clarified\nunderstanding, our final discussion elucidates the natural way in which\nholographic Hilbert spaces may house states dual to different geometries.

Furthermore, the lens-model fitted z_s's of the recent Kawamata\net al. reconstruction are biased systematically low compared to photometric\nz_s's, and the bias is a function of images' distance from the cluster center.\nWe argue that these mimic the effect of LoS. We conclude that even in the\npresence of 100-200 images, lens-model adjusted source redshifts can conceal\nthe presence of LoS, demonstrating the existence of degeneracies between z_s\nand (sub)structure.

Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM\nsubstructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that\nlarge fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we\nuse both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to\ninvestigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating\nand stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive\nexpectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock $\\Delta E$ that exceeds\nthe subhalo's binding energy, $|E_{\\rm b}|$, do not undergo disruption, even\nwhen $\\Delta E/|E_{\\rm b}|$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and\ncontrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter\nfrom the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete\ndisruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In\naddition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters\nwith other subhaloes (`harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal\neffects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of\nbaryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is\nextremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore\nmust be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with\nnumerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most\nlikely culprit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The\ncrisis literature has so far identified a number of distinct effects or\nchannels that can propagate distress contagiously both directly within the\nbanking network itself and indirectly, between the network and the external\neconomy. These contagious effects, and the potential events that trigger these\neffects, can explain most aspects of past crises, and are thought to be likely\nto dominate future financial crises. Since the current international financial\nregulatory regime based on the Basel III Accord does a good job of ensuring\nthat banks are resilient to such contagion effects taken one at a time,\nsystemic risk theorists increasingly understand that future crises are likely\nto be dominated by the spillovers between distinct contagion channels. The\npresent paper aims to provide a model for systemic risk that is comprehensive\nenough to include the important contagion channels identified in the\nliterature. In such a model one can hope to understand the dangerous spillover\neffects that are expected to dominate future crises. To rein in the number and\ncomplexity of the modelling assumptions, two requirements are imposed, neither\nof which is yet well-known or established in the main stream of systemic risk\nresearch. The first, called stock-flow consistency, demands that the financial\nsystem follows a rigorous set of rules based on accounting principles. The\nsecond requirement, called Asset-Liability symmetry, implies that every\nproposed contagion channel has a dual channel obtained by interchanging assets\nand liabilities, and that these dual channel pairs have a symmetric\nmathematical representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

In the attractor regime, the standard derivation of the\nbispectrum's squeezed limit using co-moving coordinates gives the well known\nMaldacena's consistency relation $f_{NL} = 5(1-n_{s})/12$. On the other hand,\nin the non-attractor regime, the squeezed limit offers a substantial violation\nof this relation given by $f_{NL} = 5/2$. In this work we argue that,\nindependently of whether inflation is attractor or non-attractor, the size of\nthe observable primordial local non-Gaussianity is predicted to be\n$f_{NL}^{obs} = 0$ (a result that was already understood to hold in the case of\nattractor models).

These algorithms explore trees of\nunknown structure, and in certain cases exponentially outperform classical\nprocedures (such as DPLL). Some of the previous work focused on obtaining a\nquantum advantage for trees in which a unique marked vertex is promised to\nexist. We remove this restriction and re-characterise the problem in terms of\nthe effective resistance of the search space. To this end, we present a\ngeneralisation of one of Montanaro's algorithms to trees containing $k \\geq 1$\nmarked vertices, where $k$ is not necessarily known \\textit{a priori}.\n  Our approach involves using amplitude estimation to determine a near-optimal\nweighting of a diffusion operator, which can then be applied to prepare a\nsuperposition state that has support only on marked vertices and ancestors\nthereof. By repeatedly sampling this state and updating the input vertex, a\nmarked vertex is reached in a logarithmic number of steps. The algorithm\nthereby achieves the conjectured bound of\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{TR_{\\mathrm{max}}})$ for finding a single marked\nvertex and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(k\\sqrt{T R_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right)$ for\nfinding all $k$ marked vertices, where $T$ is an upper bound on the tree size\nand $R_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum effective resistance encountered by the\nalgorithm. This constitutes a speedup over Montanaro's original procedure in\nboth the case of finding one and finding multiple marked vertices in an\narbitrary tree. If there are no marked vertices, the effective resistance\nbecomes infinite, and we recover the scaling of Montanaro's existence\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:43:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 04:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The luminous infrared\ngalaxy Zw 049.057 harbours a compact obscured nucleus with a possible far-IR\nsignature of outflowing molecular gas. Due to the high optical depths at far-IR\nwavelengths, the interpretation of the outflow signature is uncertain. At mm\nand radio wavelengths, the radiation is better able to penetrate the large\ncolumns of gas and dust. We used high resolution observations from the SMA,\nALMA, and the VLA to image the CO 2-1 and 6-5 emission, the 690 GHz continuum,\nthe radio cm continuum, and absorptions by rotationally excited OH. The CO line\nprofiles exhibit wings extending 300 km/s beyond the systemic velocity. At cm\nwavelengths, we find a compact (40 pc) continuum component in the nucleus, with\nweaker emission extending several 100 pc approximately along the major and\nminor axes of the galaxy. In the OH absorption lines toward the compact\ncontinuum, wings extending to a similar velocity as for the CO are seen on the\nblue side of the profile. The weak cm continuum emission along the minor axis\nis aligned with a highly collimated, jet-like dust feature previously seen in\nnear-IR images of the galaxy. Comparison of the apparent optical depths in the\nOH lines indicate that the excitation conditions in Zw 049.057 differ from\nthose in other OH megamaser galaxies. We interpret the wings in the spectral\nlines as signatures of a molecular outflow. A relation between this outflow and\nthe minor axis radio feature is possible, although further studies are required\nto investigate this possible association and understand the connection between\nthe outflow and the nuclear activity. Finally, we suggest that the differing OH\nexcitation conditions are further evidence that Zw 049.057 is in a transition\nphase between megamaser and kilomaser activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 21:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

To support our claim, we establish a position error model of a robot,\nwhich traverses a taught path by only correcting its heading.

One of the major challenges on the\nconstruction of a RCPP code is to design a common information set which is good\nfor all the codes in the family. In the proposed construction, a common\ninformation set is simply optimized for the highest-rate punctured polar code\nin the family and then, this set is updated for each other code by satisfying\nthe condition that information bits are unchanged during retransmissions. This\nis enabled by presenting a novel hierarchical puncturing and information-copy\ntechnique. To be specific, some information bits are copied to frozen-bit\nchannels, which yields an information-dependent frozen vector. Then, the\nupdated information sets are obtained by appropriately combining the common\ninformation set and an information-dependent frozen vector. Moreover, the\nimpact of unknown frozen bits are resolved using the proposed hierarchical\npuncturing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RCPP code attains\na significant performance gain (about 2dB) over a benchmark RCPP code where\nboth codes use the same puncturing patterns but the latter uses the\nconventional all-zero frozen vector. Therefore, the proposed method would be\ncrucial to construct a good RCPP code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 23:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 07:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 01:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

Kernel methods form an important\nclass of techniques that induce a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for\ninferring non-linear models through the construction of similarity functions\nfrom data. These methods are particularly preferred in cases where the training\ndata sizes are limited and when prior knowledge of the data similarities is\navailable. Despite their usefulness, they are limited by the computational\ncomplexity and their inability to support end-to-end learning with a\ntask-specific objective. On the other hand, deep neural networks have become\nthe de facto solution for end-to-end inference in several learning paradigms.\nIn this article, we explore the idea of using deep architectures to perform\nkernel machine optimization, for both computational efficiency and end-to-end\ninferencing. To this end, we develop the DKMO (Deep Kernel Machine\nOptimization) framework, that creates an ensemble of dense embeddings using\nNystrom kernel approximations and utilizes deep learning to generate\ntask-specific representations through the fusion of the embeddings.\nIntuitively, the filters of the network are trained to fuse information from an\nensemble of linear subspaces in the RKHS. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel\ndropout regularization to enable improved training convergence. Finally, we\nextend this framework to the multiple kernel case, by coupling a global fusion\nlayer with pre-trained deep kernel machines for each of the constituent\nkernels. Using case studies with limited training data, and lack of explicit\nfeature sources, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over\nconventional model inferencing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 01:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

The celebrated result for the CGT problem is that the number of tests\n$t$ can be made logarithmic in $n$ when $d=O(poly(\\log n))$. However,\nstate-of-the-art GT codes require the items to be tested $w=\\Omega(d\\log n)$\ntimes and tests to include $\\rho=\\Omega(n/d)$ items (within log factors). In\nmany applications, items can only participate in a limited number of tests and\ntests are constrained to include a limited number of items.\n  In this paper, we study the \"sparse\" regime for the group testing problem\nwhere we restrict the number of tests each item can participate in by\n$w_{\\max}$ or the number of items each test can include by $\\rho_{\\max}$ in\nboth noiseless and noisy settings.

This model introduces latent\nchunk-level representations into conventional sequential neural encoders, i.e.,\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, to\nconsider the compositionality of languages in semantic modeling. An SNELSD\nmodel has a hierarchical structure that includes a detection layer and a\ndescription layer. The detection layer predicts the boundaries of latent word\nchunks in an input sentence and derives a chunk-level vector for each word. The\ndescription layer utilizes modified LSTM units to process these chunk-level\nvectors in a recurrent manner and produces sequential encoding outputs. These\noutput vectors are further concatenated with word vectors or the outputs of a\nchain LSTM encoder to obtain the final sentence representation. All the model\nparameters are learned in an end-to-end manner without a dependency on\nadditional text chunking or syntax parsing. A natural language inference (NLI)\ntask and a sentiment analysis (SA) task are adopted to evaluate the performance\nof our proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed SNELSD model on exploring task-dependent chunking patterns\nduring the semantic modeling of sentences. Furthermore, the proposed method\nachieves better performance than conventional chain LSTMs and tree-structured\nLSTMs on both tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 07:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

To populate the graphs,\nknowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding\nmodels map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and\npredict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first\ntranslation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and\nefficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the\ndifferences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle\nseems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge\ngraph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces\nentity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This\nregularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill\nthe abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the\naccuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is\nimportant because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it.\nThis paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the\nregularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie\ngroup. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the\nembedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE\nis the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector\nspace, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of\nregularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art\napproaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction\ntask. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is\nfaster than the original TransE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 07:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Most of the existing graph anonymization\nmechanisms rely on the perturbation of the original graph's edge set. In this\npaper, we identify a fundamental weakness of these mechanisms: They neglect the\nstrong structural proximity between friends in social graphs, thus add\nimplausible fake edges for anonymization.\n  To exploit this weakness, we first propose a metric to quantify an edge's\nplausibility by relying on graph embedding. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-life social network datasets demonstrate that our plausibility metric can\nvery effectively differentiate fake edges from original edges with AUC (area\nunder the ROC curve) values above 0.95 in most of the cases. We then rely on a\nGaussian mixture model to automatically derive the threshold on the edge\nplausibility values to determine whether an edge is fake, which enables us to\nrecover to a large extent the original graph from the anonymized graph. We\nfurther demonstrate that our graph recovery attack jeopardizes the privacy\nguarantees provided by the considered graph anonymization mechanisms.\n  To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a method to generate fake yet\nplausible edges given the graph structure and incorporate it into the existing\nanonymization mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates that the enhanced\nmechanisms decrease the chances of graph recovery, reduce the success of graph\nde-anonymization (up to 30%), and provide even better utility than the existing\nanonymization mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 14:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

In this paper we start from the observation that\nUEs are more likely to enter from some directions than from others, as they\ntypically move along streets, while other movements are impossible due to the\npresence of obstacles. Moreover, users are entering with a given time\nstatistics, for example described by inter-arrival times.

In particular, we propose two approaches: a memory-less random\nillumination (MLRI) algorithm and a statistic and memory-based illumination\n(SMBI) algorithm. The MLRI algorithm scans a random sector in each slot, based\non the statistics of sector entrance, without memory. The SMBI algorithm\ninstead scans sectors in a deterministic sequence selected according to the\nstatistics of sector entrance and time of entrance, and taking into account the\nfact that the user has not yet been discovered (thus including memory).

Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity\nmodels or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based\non population and distance features only. These models have been validated on\ncommuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in\nmodeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are\nnot available.

The use of distributed representations in\ncomputational linguistics has also become increasingly popular. A recent\ndevelopment is to learn distributed representations of language, such that\ntypologically similar languages are spatially close to one another. Although\nempirical successes have been shown for such language representations, they\nhave not been subjected to much typological probing. In this paper, we first\nlook at whether this type of language representations are empirically useful\nfor model transfer between Uralic languages in deep neural networks. We then\ninvestigate which typological features are encoded in these representations by\nattempting to predict features in the World Atlas of Language Structures, at\nvarious stages of fine-tuning of the representations. We focus on Uralic\nlanguages, and find that some typological traits can be automatically inferred\nwith accuracies well above a strong baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 09:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

This intuitive observation indeed\nled many researchers to endow appearance-based detectors with explicit\nreasoning about context. The underlying thesis suggests that stronger\ncontextual relations would facilitate greater improvements in detection\ncapacity. In practice, however, the observed improvement in many cases is\nmodest at best, and often only marginal. In this work we seek to improve our\nunderstanding of this phenomenon, in part by pursuing an opposite approach.\nInstead of attempting to improve detection scores by employing context, we\ntreat the utility of context as an optimization problem: to what extent can\ndetection scores be improved by considering context or any other kind of\nadditional information? With this approach we explore the bounds on improvement\nby using contextual relations between objects and provide a tool for\nidentifying the most helpful ones. We show that simple co-occurrence relations\ncan often provide large gains, while in other cases a significant improvement\nis simply impossible or impractical with either co-occurrence or more precise\nspatial relations. To better understand these results we then analyze the\nability of context to handle different types of false detections, revealing\nthat tested contextual information cannot ameliorate localization errors,\nseverely limiting its gains.

Architectural diversity among\ndifferent processors together with structural diversity among different sparse\nmatrices lead to bottleneck diversity. This justifies an SpMV optimizer that is\nboth matrix- and architecture-adaptive through runtime specialization. To this\ndirection, we present an approach that first identifies the performance\nbottlenecks of SpMV for a given sparse matrix on the target platform either\nthrough profiling or by matrix property inspection, and then selects suitable\noptimizations to tackle those bottlenecks. Our optimization pool is based on\nthe widely used Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse matrix storage format and\nhas low preprocessing overheads, making our overall approach practical even in\ncases where fast decision making and optimization setup is required. We\nevaluate our optimizer on three x86-based computing platforms and demonstrate\nthat it is able to distinguish and appropriately optimize SpMV for the majority\nof matrices in a representative test suite, leading to significant speedups\nover the CSR and Inspector-Executor CSR SpMV kernels available in the latest\nrelease of the Intel MKL library.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 10:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Like\nfor the canonical Ginibre ensemble, its complex eigenvalues can be interpreted\nas a two-dimensional Coulomb gas, which are now subject to a constraint and a\nmodified, collective confining potential. Despite the lack of determinantal\nstructure in this fixed trace ensemble, we compute all its density correlation\nfunctions at finite matrix size and compare to a fixed trace ensemble of normal\nmatrices, representing a different Coulomb gas. Our main tool of investigation\nis the Laplace transform, that maps back the fixed trace to the induced Ginibre\nensemble. Products of random matrices have been used to study the Lyapunov and\nstability exponents for chaotic dynamical systems, where the latter are based\non the complex eigenvalues of the product matrix. Because little is known about\nthe universality of the eigenvalue distribution of such product matrices, we\nthen study the product of $m$ induced Ginibre matrices with a fixed trace\nconstraint - which are clearly non-Gaussian - and $M-m$ such Ginibre matrices\nwithout constraint. Using an $m$-fold inverse Laplace transform, we obtain a\nconcise result for the spectral density of such a mixed product matrix at\nfinite matrix size, for arbitrary fixed $m$ and $M$. Very recently local and\nglobal universality was proven by the authors and their coworker for a more\ngeneral, single elliptic fixed trace ensemble in the bulk of the spectrum.\nHere, we argue that the spectral density of mixed products is in the same\nuniversality class as the product of $M$ independent induced Ginibre ensembles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 10:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Thus, brilliant ideas in the field of semantic segmentation with\ndeep learning have completed the state of the art of accuracy, however this\narchitectures become very difficult to apply in embedded systems as is the case\nfor autonomous driving.

We use a SqueezeNet-like\nencoder and a decoder formed by our proposed squeeze-decoder module and\nupsample layer using downsample indices like in SegNet and we add a\ndeconvolution layer to provide final multi-channel feature map. On datasets\nlike Camvid or City-states, our net gets SegNet-level accuracy with less than\n10 times fewer parameters than SegNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 10:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

For the well-being of our societies, it\nis thus crucial to find mechanisms to promote pro-social choices over egoistic\nones. Particularly important, because cheap and easy to implement, are those\nmechanisms that can change people's behaviour without forbidding any options or\nsignificantly changing their economic incentives, the so-called \"nudges\".\nPrevious research has found that moral nudges (e.g., making norms salient) can\npromote pro-social behaviour. However, little is known about whether their\neffect persists over time and spills across context. This question is key in\nlight of research showing that pro-social actions are often followed by selfish\nactions, thus suggesting that some moral manipulations may backfire. Here we\npresent a class of simple moral nudges that have a great positive impact on\npro-sociality. In Studies 1-4 (total N = 1,400), we use economic games to\ndemonstrate that asking subjects to self-report \"what they think is the morally\nright thing to do\" does not only increase pro-sociality in the choice\nimmediately after, but also in subsequent choices, and even when the social\ncontext changes.

It is\nknown that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection\nprobability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate\nthe source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source\noften entails the process of querying that asks \"Are you the rumor source?\" or\n\"Who tells you the rumor?\" that would increase the chance of detecting the\nsource. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch\nquerying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that\nqueries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation\nalgorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the\namount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that\nquerying significantly improves the detection performance.

In the presence of only very few labeled\npixels, this task becomes challenging. In this paper we address the following\ntwo research questions: 1) Can a simple neural network with just a single\nhidden layer achieve state of the art performance in the presence of few\nlabeled pixels? 2) How is the performance of hyperspectral image classification\nmethods affected when using disjoint train and test sets? We give a positive\nanswer to the first question by using three tricks within a very basic shallow\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture: a tailored loss function, and\nsmooth- and label-based data augmentation. The tailored loss function enforces\nthat neighborhood wavelengths have similar contributions to the features\ngenerated during training. A new label-based technique here proposed favors\nselection of pixels in smaller classes, which is beneficial in the presence of\nvery few labeled pixels and skewed class distributions. To address the second\nquestion, we introduce a new sampling procedure to generate disjoint train and\ntest set. Then the train set is used to obtain the CNN model, which is then\napplied to pixels in the test set to estimate their labels. We assess the\nefficacy of the simple neural network method on five publicly available\nhyperspectral images. On these images our method significantly outperforms\nconsidered baselines. Notably, with just 1% of labeled pixels per class, on\nthese datasets our method achieves an accuracy that goes from 86.42%\n(challenging dataset) to 99.52% (easy dataset). Furthermore we show that the\nsimple neural network method improves over other baselines in the new\nchallenging supervised setting.

Here I use the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the\ndefinition of normality by Burke et al. to define a path toward exactness and\nstraying from the path by separating errors in \\r{ho} and E[\\r{ho}]. A\nconsistent path toward exactness involves minimizing both errors. Second, a\nsuitably diverse test set of trial densities \\r{ho}' can be used to estimate\nthe significance of errors in \\r{ho} without knowing the exact densities which\nare often computationally inaccessible. To illustrate this, the systems\npreviously studied by Medvedev et al., the first ionization energies of atoms\nwith Z = 1 to 10, the ionization energy of water, and the bond dissociation\nenergies of five diatomic molecules were investigated and benchmarked against\nCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z. A test set of four functionals of distinct designs was\nused: B3LYP, PBE, M06, and S-VWN. For atomic cations regardless of charge and\ncompactness up to Z = 10, the energy effects of variations in \\r{ho} are < 4\nkJ/mol (chemical accuracy) defined here as normal, even though these four\nfunctionals ranked very differently in the previous test. Thus, the off-path\nbehavior for such cations is energy-wise insignificant and in fact,\nindeterminate because of noise from other errors. An interesting oscillating\nbehavior in the density sensitivity is observed vs. Z, explained by orbital\noccupation effects. Finally, it is shown that even large normal problems such\nas the Co-C bond energy of cobalamins can use simpler (e.g. PBE) trial\ndensities to drastically speed up computation by loss of a few kJ/mol in\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

In this paper, we propose a new system to discriminatively embed\nthe image and text to a shared visual-textual space. In this field, most\nexisting works apply the ranking loss to pull the positive image / text pairs\nclose and push the negative pairs apart from each other. However, directly\ndeploying the ranking loss is hard for network learning, since it starts from\nthe two heterogeneous features to build inter-modal relationship. To address\nthis problem, we propose the instance loss which explicitly considers the\nintra-modal data distribution. It is based on an unsupervised assumption that\neach image / text group can be viewed as a class. So the network can learn the\nfine granularity from every image/text group. The experiment shows that the\ninstance loss offers better weight initialization for the ranking loss, so that\nmore discriminative embeddings can be learned.

It affects a wide range of\nflows, such as planetary atmospheres, plasmas or wall-bounded flows, and\nhampers turbulence models. We consider the special case of a two-dimensional\nflow in a periodic box, for which the mean-flow, a pair of box-size vortices\ncalled \\emph{condensate}, emerges from turbulence through an inverse cascade\nprocess. As was recently shown, a perturbative closure describes correctly the\ncondensate when turbulence is excited at small scales. In this context, we\nobtain explicit results for the statistics of turbulence, encoded in the\nReynolds stress tensor. We demonstrate that the two components of the Reynolds\nstress, the momentum flux and the turbulent energy, are determined by different\nmechanisms. It was suggested previously that the momentum flux is fixed by a\nbalance between forcing and mean-flow advection: using unprecedently long\nnumerical simulations, we provide the first direct evidence supporting this\nprediction. By contrast, combining analytical computations with numerical\nsimulations, we show that the turbulent energy is determined only by mean-flow\nadvection, and obtain for the first time a formula describing its profile in\nthe vortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

For $Z$ regular and affine\nwe prove a PBW theorem for $A^e$ and use this to characterise the annihilators\nof simple Poisson modules: they coincide with the Poisson weakly locally\nclosed, the Poisson primitive and the Poisson rational ideals. We view this as\na generalised weak Poisson Dixmier--Moeglin equivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 10:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 16:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The continuous entropy analysis of the ideal MHD\nequations, which are the advective parts of the resistive MHD equations, shows\nthat the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field components must be\nincorporated as a non-conservative term in a form either proposed by Powell or\nJanhunen. Consequently, this non-conservative term needs to be discretized,\nsuch that the approximation is consistent with the entropy. As an extension of\nthe ideal MHD system, we address in this work the continuous analysis of the\nresistive MHD equations and show that the entropy inequality holds. Thus, our\nfirst contribution is the proof that the resistive terms are symmetric and\npositive semi-definite when formulated in entropy space as gradients of the\nentropy variables. Moreover, this enables the construction of an entropy stable\nDG discretization for the resistive MHD equations. However, the resulting\nmethod suffers from large errors in the divergence-free constraint, since no\nparticular treatment of divergence errors is included in the standard resistive\nMHD model. Hence, our second contribution is the extension of the resistive MHD\nequations with proper divergence cleaning based on a generalized Lagrange\nmultiplier (GLM) strategy.

This system is the\nlightest black hole binary so far observed, with component masses\n$12^{+7}_{-2}\\,M_\\odot$ and $7^{+2}_{-2}\\,M_\\odot$ (90% credible intervals).\nThese lie in the range of measured black hole masses in low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, thus allowing us to compare black holes detected through\ngravitational waves with electromagnetic observations. The source's luminosity\ndistance is $340^{+140}_{-140}$ Mpc, corresponding to redshift\n$0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$.

It is challenging to achieve both a\nlow ionization energy and the reasonable size for the PbI$_3$ cage to\ncircumvent the stability issue inherent to hybrid halide perovskites. Here we\npropose a new three-membered charged ring radical, which demonstrates a low\nionization energy that renders a good stability for its corresponding\nperovskite and a reasonable cation size that translates into a suitable bandgap\nfor the photovoltaic application. We use ab initio calculations to evaluate a\npolymorphism of the crystal structure of the proposed halide hybrid perovskite,\nits stability and electronic properties in comparison to the mainstream\nperovskites, such as the methylammonium and formamidinium lead iodide. Our\nresults highlight the importance of van der Waals interactions for predicting a\ncorrect polymorphism of the perovskite vs hexagonal crystal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 14:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

However, in avionics, for ease of deployment, or for new\nfunctionality featuring mobile devices, there is a strong interest for wireless\nsolutions. Low-power wireless protocols have been proposed, but requirements of\na large class of CPS applications can still not be satisfied. This paper\npresents Time-Triggered-Wireless (TTW), a distributed low-power wireless system\ndesign that minimizes energy consumption and offers end-to-end timing\npredictability, adaptability, reliability, low latency.

A Finite-Difference Time\nDomain (FDTM) model of the cochlea is used to calculate spike trains caused by\ntone complexes and by a recorded classical guitar tone. All harmonic tone\ncomplexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern\nat the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this\nfundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the\nrespective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark\nbands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the\nbasically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These\ndrop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time\nspans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the\nfundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary\nto pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over\nbark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue\npitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause\nundertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case\novertones can appear. This might explain the musical minor scale, which was\nproposed to be caused by undertones already in 1880 by Hugo Riemann, still\nuntil now without knowledge about any physical realization of such undertones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 14:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

However, most (if not all) of these approaches\nrestricted their efforts to uncovering change over time, thus neglecting other\nvaluable dimensions such as social or political variability. We propose an\napproach for detecting semantic shifts between different viewpoints--broadly\ndefined as a set of texts that share a specific metadata feature, which can be\na time-period, but also a social entity such as a political party. For each\nviewpoint, we learn a semantic space in which each word is represented as a low\ndimensional neural embedded vector. The challenge is to compare the meaning of\na word in one space to its meaning in another space and measure the size of the\nsemantic shifts. We compare the effectiveness of a measure based on optimal\ntransformations between the two spaces with a measure based on the similarity\nof the neighbors of the word in the respective spaces. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the combination of these two performs best. We show that the\nsemantic shifts not only occur over time, but also along different viewpoints\nin a short period of time. For evaluation, we demonstrate how this approach\ncaptures meaningful semantic shifts and can help improve other tasks such as\nthe contrastive viewpoint summarization and ideology detection (measured as\nclassification accuracy) in political texts. We also show that the two laws of\nsemantic change which were empirically shown to hold for temporal shifts also\nhold for shifts across viewpoints. These laws state that frequent words are\nless likely to shift meaning while words with many senses are more likely to do\nso.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 14:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

The proposed method quantifies the interpretability of CNN\nrepresentations by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and\na set of visual semantic concepts. By identifying the best alignments, units\nare given human interpretable labels across a range of objects, parts, scenes,\ntextures, materials, and colors. The method reveals that deep representations\nare more transparent and interpretable than expected: we find that\nrepresentations are significantly more interpretable than they would be under a\nrandom equivalently powerful basis. We apply the method to interpret and\ncompare the latent representations of various network architectures trained to\nsolve different supervised and self-supervised training tasks. We then examine\nfactors affecting the network interpretability such as the number of the\ntraining iterations, regularizations, different initializations, and the\nnetwork depth and width. Finally we show that the interpreted units can be used\nto provide explicit explanations of a prediction given by a CNN for an image.\nOur results highlight that interpretability is an important property of deep\nneural networks that provides new insights into their hierarchical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 15:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Most prominently, the substrate deformation\ncauses an increase in the splashing threshold as compared to impact onto\nperfectly rigid surfaces, and can thus lead to splash suppression. Here, we\nexperimentally determine the splashing threshold for impact on thin membranes\nas a function of the tension in the membrane and its elastic properties. The\ndrop dynamics is correlated to the membrane deformation, which is\nsimultaneously measured using a laser profilometry technique. The experimental\nresults enable us to adapt current models for splashing, showing quantitatively\nhow substrate deformation alters the splashing threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

We describe measurements of\nthe PVD of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey as a function\nof projected separation and galaxy luminosity. Due to the faint magnitude limit\n($r < 19.8$) and highly-complete spectroscopic sampling of the GAMA survey, we\nare able to reliably measure the PVD to smaller scales ($r_\\bot = 0.01$ Mpc/h)\nthan previous work. The measured PVD at projected separations $r_\\bot <~ 1$\nMpc/h increases near-monotonically with increasing luminosity from $\\sigma\n\\approx 200$ km/s at $M_r = -17$ mag to $\\sigma \\approx 600$ km/s at $M_r\n\\approx -22$ mag. Analysis of the Gonzalez-Perez (2014) GALFORM semi-analytic\nmodel yields no such trend of PVD with luminosity: the model over-predicts the\nPVD for faint galaxies.

Thus far, the proposed estimation methods in the literature\nare based on spectral averaging, eigenvalues of sample covariance matrix,\ninformation theory, and statistical signal analysis. Each method is\ncharacterized by certain stability, accuracy and complexity. However, the\nexisting literature does not provide an appropriate comparison.

The source of used\nbackground distortions is complex noise measurement, recorded by USRP-2932 in\nan industrial production area. Based on the examined solutions, we also analyze\nthe influence of noise samples separation techniques on the estimation process.\nAs a response to the defects in the used methods, we propose a novel noise\nsamples separation algorithm based on the adaptation of rank order filtering\n(ROF).

A\n'guide-mesh' approach allows the user to create embedded high resolution\nsub-regions within a coarser mesh. The method converges rapidly. For example,\nin 3-D, the algorithm is able to refine a specific region within an\nunstructured tetrahedral spherical shell so that the edge-length factor\n$l_{0r}/l_{0c} = 1/33$ within a few iterations, where $l_{0r}$ and $l_{0c}$ are\nthe desired spring length for elements inside the refined and coarse regions\nrespectively.

Given the\nvast amount of data handled, understanding the intricate physics and trade-offs\nof modulators on-chip allows revealing performance regimes not explored yet.\nHere we show a holistic performance analysis for waveguide-based\nelectro-absorption modulators. Our approach centers around material properties\nrevealing obtainable optical absorption leading to effective modal\ncross-section, and material broadening effects. Taken together both describe\nthe modulator physical behavior entirely. We consider a plurality of material\nmodulation classes to include two-level absorbers such as quantum dots, free\ncarrier accumulation or depletion such as ITO or Silicon, two-dimensional\nelectron gas in semiconductors such as quantum wells, Pauli blocking in\nGraphene, and excitons in two-dimensional atomic layered materials such as\nfound in transition metal dichalcogendies. Our results show that reducing the\nmodal area generally improves modulator performance defined by the amount of\ninduced electrical charge, and hence the energy-per-bit function, required\nswitching the signal. We find that broadening increases the amount of switching\ncharge needed. While some material classes allow for reduced broadening such as\nquantum dots and 2-dimensional materials due to their reduced Coulomb screening\nleading to increased oscillator strengths, the sharpness of broadening is\novershadowed by thermal effects independent of the material class. Further we\nfind that plasmonics allows the switching charge and energy-per-bit function to\nbe reduced by about one order of magnitude compared to bulk photonics. This\nanalysis is aimed as a guide for the community to predict anticipated modulator\nperformance based on both existing and emerging materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 14:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

This is\nin part due to their nonlinear dynamics, and a strong dependence on the circuit\ntopology. We provide evidence that also purely memristive circuits can be\nemployed for computational purposes. In the present paper we show that a\npolynomial Lyapunov function in the memory parameters exists for the case of DC\ncontrolled memristors. Such Lyapunov function can be asymptotically\napproximated with binary variables, and mapped to quadratic combinatorial\noptimization problems. This also shows a direct parallel between memristive\ncircuits and the Hopfield-Little model. In the case of Erdos-Renyi random\ncircuits, we show numerically that the distribution of the matrix elements of\nthe projectors can be roughly approximated with a Gaussian distribution, and\nthat it scales with the inverse square root of the number of elements. This\nprovides an approximated but direct connection with the physics of disordered\nsystem and, in particular, of mean field spin glasses. Using this and the fact\nthat the interaction is controlled by a projector operator on the loop space of\nthe circuit. We estimate the number of stationary points of the approximate\nLyapunov function and provide a scaling formula as an upper bound in terms of\nthe circuit topology only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 06:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 14:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 13:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}
