Understanding\nmagnetic reconnection thus requires study of the stability of a current sheet\nas it forms. Formation can occur due to sheared, sub-Alfv\\'enic incompressible\nflows which narrow the sheet. Standard tearing theory (Furth et al. 1963; Coppi\net al. 1976; Rutherford 1973) is not immediately applicable to such forming\nsheets for two reasons: first, because the flow introduces terms not present in\nthe standard calculation; second, because the changing equilibrium introduces\ntime dependence to terms which are constant in the standard calculation,\ncomplicating the formulation of an eigenvalue problem. This paper adapts\nstandard tearing mode analysis to confront these challenges. In an initial\nphase when any perturbations are primarily governed by ideal MHD, a coordinate\ntransformation reveals that the flow compresses and stretches perturbations. A\nmultiple scale formulation describes how linear tearing mode theory (Furth et\nal. 1963; Coppi et al. 1976) can be applied to an equilibrium changing under\nflow, showing that the flow affects the separable exponential growth only\nimplicitly, by making the standard scalings time-dependent. In the nonlinear\nRutherford stage, the coordinate transformation shows that standard theory can\nbe adapted by adding to the stationary rates time dependence and an additional\nterm due to the strengthening equilibrium magnetic field. Overall, this\nunderstanding supports the use of flow-free scalings with slight modifications\nto study tearing in a forming sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 16:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 20:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

By resolving the Si IV BAL\ninto multiple NALs, we present the following main results and conclusions.\nFirst, all these NALs show coordinated variations between the two-epoch SDSS\nobservations, suggesting that they all originate in the quasar outflow, and\nthat their variations are due to global changes in the ionization condition of\nthe absorbing gas. Secondly, a BAL consisting of a number of NAL components\nindicates that this type of BAL is basically the same as the intrinsic NAL,\nwhich tends to support the inclination model rather than the evolution model.\nThirdly, although both the C IV and Si IV BALs originate from the same clumpy\nsubstructures of the outflow, they show different profile shapes: multiple\nabsorption troughs for the Si IV BAL in a wider velocity range, while P-Cygni\nfor the C IV BAL in a narrower velocity range.

In theory, the solution to this\nproblem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is\nonly defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite\nprecision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly\nconvoluted Euclidean sets, are \\emph{a priori} unknown, and, as it happens in\nany real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and\nover a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a\nnetwork composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional\ncomplex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to\napproximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and\nfinite-time trajectory.

We show that these\nsequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any\nspurious information added.

We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons\nwith weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic\nweights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity.\nThese states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the\nneurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower\nthe response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results,\nthe latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of\npatterns within a narrow energy gap.

The radial-excitation is\nconstituted similarly, and the pointwise form of its PDA, which is negative on\na material domain, is the result of marked interference between the\ncontributions from both types of diquark; particularly, the locus of zeros that\nhighlights its character as a radial excitation.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ngeometric understanding of amplitudes for a large class of theories. The key is\nto think of amplitudes as differential forms directly on kinematic space. We\nexplore this picture for a wide range of massless theories in general spacetime\ndimensions. For the bi-adjoint cubic scalar, we establish a direct connection\nbetween its \"scattering form\" and a classic polytope--the associahedron--known\nto mathematicians since the 1960's. We find an associahedron living naturally\nin kinematic space, and the tree amplitude is simply the \"canonical form\"\nassociated with this \"positive geometry\". Basic physical properties such as\nlocality, unitarity and novel \"soft\" limits are fully determined by the\ngeometry. Furthermore, the moduli space for the open string worldsheet has also\nlong been recognized as an associahedron. We show that the scattering equations\nact as a diffeomorphism between this old \"worldsheet associahedron\" and the new\n\"kinematic associahedron\", providing a geometric interpretation and novel\nderivation of the bi-adjoint CHY formula. We also find \"scattering forms\" on\nkinematic space for Yang-Mills and the Non-linear Sigma Model, which are dual\nto the color-dressed amplitudes despite having no explicit color factors. This\nis possible due to a remarkable fact--\"Color is Kinematics\"--whereby kinematic\nwedge products in the scattering forms satisfy the same Jacobi relations as\ncolor factors. Finally, our scattering forms are well-defined on the\nprojectivized kinematic space, a property that provides a geometric origin for\ncolor-kinematics duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 17:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

This sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$\nmodel also displays bluer maximum-light colours due to the larger specific\nheating rate, and larger post-maximum uvoir and $B$-band decline rates. The\nluminosity decline at nebular times is also more pronounced, reflecting the\nenhanced escape of gamma rays resulting from the lower density of the\nprogenitor WD.

The conditions for GC formation are met in the\nextremely turbulent \"eyewall\" at ~0.3 R_{vir}, where counter-rotating streams\ncan collide, driving very large densities. Our scenario can account for the\nobserved kinematics and spatial distribution of MP GCs, the correlation between\ntheir mass and metalicity, and the mass ratio between the GC system and the\nhost halo.

The duration and efficiency of exchange\nbetween the primitive massive atmosphere and the global impact-induced water\nocean likely play a key role in the chemical evolution of the early Titan's\natmosphere. To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a\nwide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first\ndeveloped a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the\nnon-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of\nvolatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that\nthe relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's\natmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean. On the\ncontrary, for CO2/NH3 > 1, CO2 is the main constituent of Titan's primitive\natmosphere while the NH3 atmospheric content is dramatically decreased. We then\ninvestigate the conditions for the formation of CH4-rich clathrates hydrates at\nTitan's surface that could be the main reservoir of methane for the present-day\natmosphere. In absence of reliable experimental data in the CH4-CO2-NH3-H2O\nsystem, the dissolution of methane in water is included using a simplified\nHenry's law approach. We find that if the concentration of CH4 in Titan's\nbuilding block was higher than ~0.1 mol.kg-1 and CO2/NH3 < 3, a large fraction\nof methane may be stored in the primordial crust, which would form at\ntemperature below ~10{\\deg}C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 20:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

This paper introduces SHIP, an IPv6 lookup algorithm that\nexploits prefix characteristics to build a two-level data structure designed to\nmeet future application requirements. Using both prefix length distribution and\nprefix density, SHIP first clusters prefixes into groups sharing similar\ncharacteristics, then it builds a hybrid trie-tree for each prefix group. The\ncompact and scalable data structure built can be stored in on-chip low-latency\nmemories, and allows the traversal process to be parallelized and pipelined at\neach level in order to support high packet bandwidth. Evaluated on real and\nsynthetic prefix tables holding up to 580 k IPv6 prefixes, SHIP has a\nlogarithmic scaling factor in terms of the number of memory accesses, and a\nlinear memory consumption scaling. Using the largest synthetic prefix table,\nsimulations show that compared to other well-known approaches, SHIP uses at\nleast 44% less memory per prefix, while reducing the memory latency by 61%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 22:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

This VR resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative\ngame that allows jointly optimizing the computational and spectrum resources,\nwhile being cognizant of the data correlation. To solve this game, a transfer\nlearning algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state\nnetworks (ESNs) is proposed. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning\nalgorithms that must be executed each time the environment changes, the\nproposed algorithm can intelligently transfer information on the learned\nutility, across time, to rapidly adapt to environmental dynamics due to factors\nsuch as changes in the users' content or data correlation. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 16.7% and 18.2% gains in terms\nof delay compared to the Q-learning with data correlation and Q-learning\nwithout data correlation. The results also show that the proposed algorithm has\na faster convergence time than Q-learning and can guarantee low delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 01:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

However, such models have often been based on one field of the document,\nfor example considering document title only or document body only. Since in\npractice documents typically have multiple fields, and given that non-neural\nranking models such as BM25F have been developed to take advantage of document\nstructure, this paper investigates how neural models can deal with multiple\ndocument fields. We introduce a model that can consume short text fields such\nas document title and long text fields such as document body. It can also\nhandle multi-instance fields with variable number of instances, for example\nwhere each document has zero or more instances of incoming anchor text. Since\nfields vary in coverage and quality, we introduce a masking method to handle\nmissing field instances, as well as a field-level dropout method to avoid\nrelying too much on any one field. As in the studies of non-neural field\nweighting, we find it is better for the ranker to score the whole document\njointly, rather than generate a per-field score and aggregate. We find that\ndifferent document fields may match different aspects of the query and\ntherefore benefit from comparing with separate representations of the query\ntext. The combination of techniques introduced here leads to a neural ranker\nthat can take advantage of full document structure, including multiple instance\nand missing instance data, of variable length. The techniques significantly\nenhance the performance of the ranker, and also outperform a learning to rank\nbaseline with hand-crafted features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 01:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Advances in the science of distributed\nsystems has led to the development of large scale statechart models which are\ndistributed among multiple locations. Taking medicine for example, models of\nbest-practice guidelines during rural ambulance transport are distributed\nacross hospital settings from a rural hospital, to an ambulance, to a central\ntertiary hospital. Unfortunately, these medical models require continuous and\nreal-time communication across individual medical models in physically\ndistributed treatment locations which provides vital assistance to the\nclinicians and physicians. This makes it necessary to offer methods for\nmodel-driven communication and synchronization in a distributed environment. In\nthis paper, we describe ModelSink, a middleware to address the problem of\ncommunication and synchronization of heterogeneous distributed models. Being\nmotivated by the synchronization requirements during emergency ambulance\ntransport, we use medical best-practice models as a case study to illustrate\nthe notion of distributed models. Through ModelSink, we achieve an efficient\ncommunication architecture, open-loop-safe protocol, and queuing and mapping\nmechanisms compliant with the semantics of statechart-based model-driven\ndevelopment. We evaluated the performance of ModelSink on distributed sets of\nmedical models that we have developed to assess how ModelSink performs in\nvarious loads. Our work is intended to assist clinicians, EMT, and medical\nstaff to prevent unintended deviations from medical best practices, and\novercome connectivity and coordination challenges that exist in a distributed\nhospital network. Our practice suggests that there are in fact additional\npotential domains beyond medicine where our middleware can provide needed\nutility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 05:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 06:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

During the\nstage II these waves are triggered by a transient network of neurons, called\nStarburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), showing a bursting activity which disappears\nupon further maturation. While several models have attempted to reproduce\nretinal waves, none of them is able to mimic the rhythmic autonomous bursting\nof individual SACs and reveal how these cells change their intrinsic properties\nduring development. Here, we introduce a mathematical model, grounded on\nbiophysics, which enables us to reproduce the bursting activity of SACs and to\npropose a plausible, generic and robust, mechanism that generates it. The core\nparameters controlling repetitive firing are fast depolarizing $V$-gated\ncalcium channels and hyperpolarizing $V$-gated potassium channels. The\nquiescent phase of bursting is controlled by a slow after hyperpolarization\n(sAHP), mediated by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Based on a\nbifurcation analysis we show how biophysical parameters, regulating calcium and\npotassium activity, control the spontaneously occurring fast oscillatory\nactivity followed by long refractory periods in individual SACs. We make a\ntestable experimental prediction on the role of voltage-dependent potassium\nchannels on the excitability properties of SACs and on the evolution of this\nexcitability along development. We also propose an explanation on how SACs can\nexhibit a large variability in their bursting periods, as observed\nexperimentally within a SACs network as well as across different species, yet\nbased on a simple, unique, mechanism.

A classical result is that its rate of\nconvergence depends on the number of covariates and deteriorates quickly as the\ndimension grows, which underscores the \"curse of dimensionality\" and has\nlimited its use in high dimensional settings. In this article, we show that\nwhen the true regression function is single or multi-index, the effects of the\ncurse of dimensionality may be mitigated for the Nadaraya-Watson kernel\nestimator. Specifically, we prove that with $K$-fold cross-validation, the\nNadaraya-Watson kernel estimator indexed by a positive semidefinite bandwidth\nmatrix has an oracle property that its rate of convergence depends on the\nnumber of indices of the regression function rather than the number of\ncovariates.

Then, how is the photon helicity translated into the\nelectric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of propagation?\nThis is an issue of the internal space-time symmetries defined by Wigner's\nlittle group for massless particles. It is noted that there are three\ngenerators for the rotation group defining the spin of a particle at rest. The\nclosed set of commutation relations is a direct consequence of Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relations. The rotation group can be generated by three two-by-two\nPauli matrices for spin-half particles. This group of two-by-two matrices is\ncalled SU(2), with two-component spinors. The direct product of two spinors\nleads to four states leading to one spin-0 state and one spin-1 state with\nthree sub-states. The SU(2) group can be expanded to another group of\ntwo-by-two matrices called SL(2,c), which serves as the covering group for the\ngroup of Lorentz transformations. In this Lorentz-covariant regime, it is\npossible to Lorentz-boost the particle at rest to its infinite-momentum or\nmassless state.
