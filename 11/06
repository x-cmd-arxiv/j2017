An AMQ supports lookups, inserts, and (for some\nAMQs) deletes. A query for an x in S is guaranteed to return \"present.\" A query\nfor x not in S returns \"absent\" with probability at least 1-epsilon, where\nepsilon is a tunable false positive probability. If a query returns \"present,\"\nbut x is not in S, then x is a false positive of the AMQ. Because AMQs have a\nnonzero probability of false-positives, they require far less space than\nexplicit set representations.\n  AMQs are widely used to speed up dictionaries that are stored remotely (e.g.,\non disk/across a network). Most AMQs offer weak guarantees on the number of\nfalse positives they will return on a sequence of queries. The false-positive\nprobability of epsilon holds only for a single query. It is easy for an\nadversary to drive an AMQ's false-positive rate towards 1 by simply repeating\nfalse positives.\n  This paper shows what it takes to get strong guarantees on the number of\nfalse positives. We say that an AMQs is adaptive if it guarantees a\nfalse-positive probability of epsilon for every query, regardless of answers to\nprevious queries. First, we prove that it is impossible to build a small\nadaptive AMQ, even when the AMQ is immediately told whenever it returns a false\npositive. We then show how to build an adaptive AMQ that partitions its state\ninto a small local component and a larger remote component. In addition to\nbeing adaptive, the local component of our AMQ dominates existing AMQs in all\nregards. It uses optimal space up to lower-order terms and supports queries and\nupdates in worst-case constant time, with high probability. Thus, we show that\nadaptivity has no cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 17:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 22:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 00:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The device is mechanically biased by a substrate and returns\nto the ground state when electric field is removed, giving a repeatable\nactuation cycle. The mechanical strains which accompany ferroelectric switching\nare several times greater than the strains attained due to the piezoelectric\neffect alone.

Here, we model worlds with\nArchean-like levels of carbon dioxide orbiting the ancient sun and an M4V dwarf\n(GJ 876) and show that organic haze formation requires methane fluxes\nconsistent with estimated Earth-like biological production rates. On planets\nwith high fluxes of biogenic organic sulfur gases (CS2, OCS, CH3SH, and\nCH3SCH3), photochemistry involving these gases can drive haze formation at\nlower CH4/CO2 ratios than methane photochemistry alone. For a planet orbiting\nthe sun, at 30x the modern organic sulfur gas flux, haze forms at a CH4/CO2\nratio 20% lower than at 1x the modern organic sulfur flux. For a planet\norbiting the M4V star, the impact of organic sulfur gases is more pronounced:\nat 1x the modern Earth organic sulfur flux, a substantial haze forms at CH4/CO2\n~ 0.2, but at 30x the organic sulfur flux, the CH4/CO2 ratio needed to form\nhaze decreases by a full order of magnitude.

The\nrelativistic electrons in graphene exhibit the same physics but at a much lower\ncritical charge ($Z_c \\approx 1$) which has made it possible to confirm this\nphenomenon experimentally. However, there exist conflicting predictions on the\neffect of a magnetic field on atomic collapse. These theoretical predictions\nare based on the continuum Dirac-Weyl equation, which does not have an exact\nanalytical solution for the interplay of a supercritical Coulomb potential and\nthe magnetic field. Approximative solutions have been proposed, but because the\ntwo effects compete on similar energy scales, the theoretical treatment varies\ndepending on the regime which is being considered. These limitations are\novercome here by starting from a tight-binding approach and computing exact\nnumerical results.

If the empirical distribution of the entries of\nthe spikes is known, optimal estimators that exploit this knowledge can\nsubstantially outperform simple spectral approaches. Recent work characterizes\nthe asymptotic accuracy of Bayes-optimal estimators in the high-dimensional\nlimit. In this paper we present a practical algorithm that can achieve\nBayes-optimal accuracy above the spectral threshold. A bold conjecture from\nstatistical physics posits that no polynomial-time algorithm achieves optimal\nerror below the same threshold (unless the best estimator is trivial). Our\napproach uses Approximate Message Passing (AMP) in conjunction with a spectral\ninitialization. AMP algorithms have proved successful in a variety of\nstatistical estimation tasks, and are amenable to exact asymptotic analysis via\nstate evolution. Unfortunately, state evolution is uninformative when the\nalgorithm is initialized near an unstable fixed point, as often happens in\nlow-rank matrix estimation. We develop a new analysis of AMP that allows for\nspectral initializations. Our main theorem is general and applies beyond matrix\nestimation.

Special cases of this problem are\nclosely related---via universality arguments---to the network community\ndetection problem for two asymmetric communities.

By offloading\ncomputation intensive tasks from resource constrained mobile devices to fog\nnodes or the remote cloud, the energy of mobile devices can be saved and the\ncomputation capability can be enhanced. For fog nodes, they can rent the\nresource rich remote cloud to help them process incoming tasks from mobile\ndevices. In this architecture, the benefit of short computation and computation\ndelay of mobile devices can be fully exploited. However, existing studies\nmostly assume fog nodes possess unlimited computing capacity, which is not\npractical, especially when fog nodes are also energy constrained mobile\ndevices. To provide incentive of fog nodes and reduce the computation cost of\nmobile devices, we provide a cost effective offloading scheme in mobile edge\ncomputing with the cooperation between fog nodes and the remote cloud with task\ndependency constraint. The mobile devices have limited budget and have to\ndetermine which task should be computed locally or sent to the fog. To address\nthis issue, we first formulate the offloading problem as a task finish time\ninimization problem with given budgets of mobile devices, which is NP-hard.

Extensive configurational sampling combined with\nquantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics (QM/MM MD) provides an\napproach to calculate entropic contribution in condensed phase reactions.\nComplete reaction pathway is exploited by QM/MM MD simulations at DFT and\nSCC-DFTB levels. The overall entropy change calculated at SCC-DFTB level QM/MM\nMD simulations, is close agreement with the experimental value. Conformation\nanalysis indicates that the self-ordering of chorismate in the active site of\nPchB also contributes to total entropy change. This entropy penalty including\nconformational transformation entropy and activation entropy cannot be\nintuitively speculated from the crystal structure that only acts as a\nstationary state along the reaction pathway of PchB catalyzed reaction. This is\nthe first time to use QM/MM MD simulations to calculate the activation entropy\nfrom the temperature dependence of reliable free energy profiles with extensive\nsimulation time. The reasonable insight in enthalpy/entropy scheme clarifies\nthe detailed entropy change and provides a quantitative tool to the\ncontradicted experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 03:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

In this game, the task of the\ndiscriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data,\nwhilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally\nconfuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs,\nwhich is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows\na connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a\nconvex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data\ndistributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification\nproblem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss\nof this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a\ncertain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning\nthe generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data\ndistributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the\nmin-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification\nproblem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows\nus to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it\nsuggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can\nalternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then\npropose using the kernel-based family for discriminators. This family has two\nappealing features: i) a powerful capacity in classifying non-linear nature\ndata and ii) being convex in the feature space. Using the convexity of this\nfamily, we can further develop Fenchel duality to equivalently transform the\nmax-min problem to the max-max dual problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 06:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Our LAEs reach\nunprecedented depths, both in Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities and UV absolute\nmagnitudes, from log($L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$/erg s$^{-1}$) $\\sim$41.0 to 43.0 and\nfrom Muv $\\sim$ -16 to -21 (0.01-1.0 $L^{*}_{\\rm z=3}$).

The intrinsic X-ray spectral slope recently\nmeasured by NuSTAR is unusually hard (photon index of ~1.3) for a Seyfert\nnucleus, for which we seek an alternative explanation. We hypothesise a\nstrongly absorbed X-ray source in N, of which X-ray emission rises steeply\nabove 10 keV, in addition to the known X-ray source in SW, and test it against\nthe NuSTAR data, assuming the standard spectral slope (photon index of 1.9).\nThis double X-ray source model gives a good explanation of the hard continuum\nspectrum, the deep Fe K absorption edge, and the strong Fe K line observed in\nthis ULIRG, without invoking the unusual spectral slope required for a single\nsource interpretation. The putative X-ray source in N is found to be absorbed\nby nH = 1.4(+0.7/-0.4)e24 cm-2. The estimated 2-10 keV luminosity of the N\nsource is 1.3e43 erg/s, about a factor of 2 larger than that of SW during the\nNuSTAR observation. Uncorrelated variability above and below 10 keV between the\nSuzaku and NuSTAR observations appears to support the double source\ninterpretation. Variability in spectral hardness and Fe K line flux between the\nprevious X-ray observations is also consistent with this picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 07:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

This is because in a\ngeneric experimental situation with sufficiently many subsystems involved, the\nproduction of so-called genuine multipartite entanglement remains a formidable\nchallenge. Consequently, focusing exclusively on the identification of this\nstrongest type of entanglement may result in an all or nothing situation where\nsome inherently quantum aspects of the resource are overlooked. On the\ncontrary, even if the system is not genuinely multipartite entangled, there may\nstill be many-body entanglement present in the system. An identification of the\nentanglement structure may thus provide us with a hint about where\nimperfections in the setup may occur, as well as where we can identify groups\nof subsystems that can still exhibit strong quantum-information-processing\ncapabilities. However, there is no known efficient methods to identify the\nunderlying entanglement structure. Here, we propose two complementary families\nof witnesses for the identification of such structures. They are based on the\ndetection of entanglement intactness and entanglement depth, each requires only\nthe implementation of solely two local measurements.

Hence, we can\ninterpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance\nby avoiding overfitting.

The construction of accurate simulation model for flow in\nfractures is challenging due to the high ratios between a fracture's length and\nwidth, which makes modeling by lower-dimensional manifolds a natural option. In\nthis paper we present a mixed-dimensional Darcy problem able to describe\npressure and Darcy velocity in all the dimensions, i.e. in the rock matrix, in\nthe fractures, and in their intersections. Moreover, we present a\nmixed-dimensional transport problem which, given the Darcy velocity, describes\ncoupled advection and diffusion of a passive scalar into the fractured porous\nmedia. The approach can handle both conducting and blocking fractures. Our\ncomputational grids are created by coarsening of simplex tessellations that\nconform to the fractures surfaces. An accurate choice of the discrete\napproximation of the previous model, by virtual finite element and finite\nvolume, allows us to simulate complex problem with a good balance in term of\naccuracy and computational cost.

This is one of the most simple and fundamental\nproblems in online decision making that models the process selling one item to\na sequence of costumers. For a closely related problem called the Prophet\nInequality where the order of the random variables is adversarial, it is known\nthat one can achieve in expectation $1/2$ of the expected maximum, and no\nbetter ratio is possible. For the Prophet Secretary problem, that is, when the\nvariables arrive in a random order, Esfandiari et al.\\ (ESA 2015) showed that\none can actually get $1-1/e$ of the maximum.

In\nthis paper, a novel method for minimum phase HRTF modelling of Pinna Spectral\nNotches (PSNs) using group delay decomposition is proposed. The proposed model\ncaptures the PSNs contributed by both the minimum phase and all pass component\nof HRTF thus facilitating an accurate reconstruction of HRTFs.

Many measures,\noften termed `centrality', have been constructed to achieve these aims. Here we\nconsider Katz centrality and provide a new interpretation as a steady-state\nsolution to continuous-time dynamics. This enables us to implement a\nsensitivity analysis which is similar to metabolic control analysis used in the\nanalysis of biochemical pathways. The results yield a centrality which\nquantifies, for each node, the net impact of its absence from the network. It\nalso has the desirable property of requiring a node with a high centrality to\nplay a central role in propagating the dynamics of the system by having the\ncapacity to both receive flux from others and then to pass it on.

In particular, we focus on the expensive evaluation of the\ndiscrete weak form of boundary operators associated with the Laplace and the\nHelmholtz equation in three space dimensions. The method is based on offloading\nthe CPU assembly of elements during the ACA assembly onto a GPU device and to\nuse threading strategies across ACA blocks to create sufficient workload for\nthe GPU. The proposed GPU strategy is designed such that it can be implemented\nin existing code with minimal changes to the surrounding application structure.\nThis is in particular interesting for existing legacy code that is not from the\nground-up designed with GPU computing in mind.

Our main lower-bound\nresult unconditionally shows the existence of functions whose circuit\ncomplexity is polynomially bounded while every hazard-free implementation is\nprovably of exponential size. Previous lower bounds on the hazard-free\ncomplexity were only valid for depth 2 circuits. The same proof method yields\nthat every subcubic implementation of Boolean matrix multiplication must have\nhazards.\n  These results follow from a crucial structural insight: Hazard-free\ncomplexity is a natural generalization of monotone complexity to all (not\nnecessarily monotone) Boolean functions. Thus, we can apply known monotone\ncomplexity lower bounds to find lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity. We\nalso lift these methods from the monotone setting to prove exponential\nhazard-free complexity lower bounds for non-monotone functions.\n  As our main upper-bound result we show how to efficiently convert a Boolean\ncircuit into a bounded-bit hazard-free circuit with only a polynomially large\nblow-up in the number of gates. Previously, the best known method yielded\nexponentially large circuits in the worst case, so our algorithm gives an\nexponential improvement.\n  As a side result we establish the NP-completeness of several hazard detection\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 14:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 21:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The spiral structure is transient, but can survive\ntens of dynamical times, and further reproduces qualitatively noted features of\nspiral galaxies as the predominance of trailing two-armed spirals and large\npitch angles. As our models are highly idealized, a detailed comparison with\nobservations is not appropriate, but generic features of the velocity\ndistributions can be identified to be potential observational signatures of\nsuch a mechanism. Indeed, the mechanism leads generically to a characteristic\ntransition from predominantly rotational motion, in a region outside the core,\nto radial ballistic motion in the outermost parts. Such radial motions are\nexcluded in our Galaxy up to 15 kpc, but could be detected at larger scales in\nthe future by GAIA.

However, as modern vehicles\nbecome more connected, they also become much more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\nIn this paper, a fully working machine learning approach is proposed to protect\nconnected vehicles (fleets and individuals) against such attacks. We present a\nsystem that monitors different vehicle's interfaces (Network, CAN and OS),\nextracts relevant information based on configurable rules and sends it to a\ntrained generative model to detect deviations from normal behavior. Using\nconfigurable data collector, we provide a higher level of data abstraction as\nthe model is trained based on events instead of raw data, which has a\nnoise-filtering effect and eliminates the need to retrain the model whenever a\nprotocol changes. We present a new approach for detecting anomalies, tailored\nto the temporal nature of our domain. Adapting the hybrid approach of Gutflaish\net al. (2017) to the fully temporal setting, we first train a Hidden Markov\nModel to learn normal vehicle behavior, and then a regression model to\ncalibrate the likelihood threshold for anomaly. Using this architecture, our\nmethod detects sophisticated and realistic anomalies, which are missed by other\nexisting methods monitoring the CAN bus only. We also demonstrate the\nsuperiority of adaptive thresholds over static ones. Furthermore, our approach\nscales efficiently from monitoring individual cars to serving large fleets.

Since the 1990s, this problem has been studied extensively in\nthe discrete optimization and operations research communities and has emerged\nas a framework unifying many fundamental clustering and location problems such\nas k-Median and k-Center. This generality, however, renders the problem\nintriguing from the algorithmic perspective and obtaining non-trivial\napproximation algorithms was an open problem even for simple topologies such as\ntrees. Recently, Aouad and Segev were able to obtain an O(log n) approximation\nalgorithm for Ordered k-Median using a sophisticated local-search approach and\nthe concept of surrogate models thereby extending the result by Tamir (2001)\nfor the case of a rectangular weight vector, also known as k-Facility\np-Centrum.\n  In this paper, we provide an LP-rounding constant-factor approximation\nalgorithm for the Ordered k-Median problem.\n  We first provide a new analysis of the rounding process by Charikar and Li\n(2012) for k-Median, when applied to a fractional solution obtained from\nsolving an LP relaxation over a non-metric, truncated cost vector, resulting in\nan elegant 15-approximation for the rectangular case. Then, we show that a\nsimple weight bucketing can be applied to the general case resulting in O(log\nn) rectangles and hence in a constant-factor approximation in quasi-polynomial\ntime. Finally, we show that also the clever distance bucketing by Aouad and\nSegev can be combined with the objective-oblivious version of our LP-rounding\nfor the rectangular case, and that it results in a true, polynomial time,\nconstant-factor approximation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 15:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 18:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

The main idea is to exploit adversarial\nlearning to learn an embedded subspace that simultaneously maximizes the\nconfusion between two domains while semantically aligning their embedding. The\nsupervised setting becomes attractive especially when there are only a few\ntarget data samples that need to be labeled. In this few-shot learning\nscenario, alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is\ndifficult because of the lack of data. We found that by carefully designing a\ntraining scheme whereby the typical binary adversarial discriminator is\naugmented to distinguish between four different classes, it is possible to\neffectively address the supervised adaptation problem. In addition, the\napproach has a high speed of adaptation, i.e. it requires an extremely low\nnumber of labeled target training samples, even one per category can be\neffective. We then extensively compare this approach to the state of the art in\ndomain adaptation in two experiments: one using datasets for handwritten digit\nrecognition, and one using datasets for visual object recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 17:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

However, in some cases, it has been proposed\nthat non-thermal emission could also be present. This additional contribution\nfrom non-thermal emission has been inferred through negative spectral indices\nat centimeter wavelengths in some regions of the radio jets. In the case of HH\n80-81, one of the most powerful protostellar jets known, linearly polarized\nemission has also been detected, revealing that the non-thermal emission is of\nsynchrotron nature from a population of relativistic particles in the jet. This\nresult implies that an acceleration mechanism should be taking place in some\nparts of the jet. Here, we present new high sensitivity and high angular\nresolution radio observations at several wavelengths (in the 3-20 cm range) of\nthe HH80-81 radio jet. These new observations represent an improvement in\nsensitivity and angular resolution by a factor of $\\sim$10 with respect to\nprevious observations. This allows us to resolve the morphology of the radio\njet, and to study the different emission mechanisms involved through spectral\nindex maps. We conclude that synchrotron emission in this jet arises from an\nextended component detected at low frequencies and from the termination points\nof the jet, where strong shocks against the ambient medium can produce\nefficient particle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 15:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

To quantify how component failure\nprobabilities (CFP) influences blackout risk (BR), this paper proposes a\nsample-induced semi-analytic approach to characterize the relationship between\nCFP and BR. To this end, we first give a generic component failure probability\nfunction (CoFPF) to describe CFP with varying parameters or forms. Then the\nexact relationship between BR and CoFPFs is built on the abstract\nMarkov-sequence model of cascading outages. Leveraging a set of samples\ngenerated by blackout simulations, we further establish a sample-induced\nsemi-analytic mapping between the unbiased estimation of BR and CoFPFs.\nFinally, we derive an efficient algorithm that can directly calculate the\nunbiased estimation of BR when the CoFPFs change. Since no additional\nsimulations are required, the algorithm is computationally scalable and\nefficient. Numerical experiments well confirm the theory and the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 04:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Here we study a paradigmatic nonlinear\noscillator of van-der-Pol/FitzHugh-Nagumo type under quenched noise as a\npiecewise-deterministic Markov process. There are several interesting effects\nsuch as period shifts and new different trapped types of small-amplitude\noscillations, which can be captured analytically.

We consider the\ncomputation of equilibria of convex stochastic Nash games characterized by a\npossibly nonconvex potential function. Our focus is on two classes of\nstochastic Nash games: (P1): A potential stochastic Nash game, in which each\nplayer solves a parameterized stochastic convex program; and (P2): A\nmisspecified generalization, where the player-specific stochastic program is\ncomplicated by a parametric misspecification. In both settings, exact proximal\nBR solutions are generally unavailable in finite time since they necessitate\nsolving parameterized stochastic programs. Consequently, we design two\nasynchronous inexact proximal BR schemes to solve the problems, where in each\niteration a single player is randomly chosen to compute an inexact proximal BR\nsolution with rivals' possibly outdated information. Yet, in the misspecified\nregime (P2), each player possesses an extra estimate of the misspecified\nparameter and updates its estimate by a projected stochastic gradient (SG)\nalgorithm. By Since any stationary point of the potential function is a Nash\nequilibrium of the associated game, we believe this paper is amongst the first\nones for stochastic nonconvex (but block convex) optimization problems equipped\nwith almost-sure convergence guarantees. These statements can be extended to\nallow for accommodating weighted potential games and generalized potential\ngames. Finally, we present preliminary numerics based on applying the proposed\nschemes to congestion control and Nash-Cournot games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 14:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 15:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 17:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}
