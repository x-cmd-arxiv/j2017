The optimal\ncontrol model is constructed using principled approach in which we forbid the\nmuscle forces to exhibit any discontinuities and require the cost to be\nexpressed in terms of a psychophysical representation of the movement. This\nyields a yank-control or jerk-control model of the movement which exhibits two\nconstants of the motion that are closely related to the energy and momentum in\nclassical mechanics. We force the optimal control model to obey Fitts law by\nrequiring a particular relationship hold between the constants of the motion\nand the size of the target and show that the resulting model compares well to a\nstandard expression of Fitts law obtained empirically using observations of\ncomputer mouse movements.

Our segmentation method consists of the three steps: generating seed\nregions, merging the regions, and applying a pixel-wise boundary determination\nalgorithm to the resultant polygonal regions. The major features of our method\nare as follows: the use of square elemental regions instead of pixels as the\nprocessing unit, a seed generation method based on enhanced gradient values, a\nseed region growing method exploiting local gradient values, a region merging\nmethod using a similarity measure including a homogeneity distance based on\nTsallis entropy, and a termination condition of region merging using an\nestimated desired number of regions. Using square regions as the processing\nunit substantially reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and makes the\nperformance stable. The experimental results show that our method exhibits\nstable performance for a variety of natural images, including heavily textured\nareas, and produces good segmentation results using the same parameter values.\nThe results of our method are fairly comparable to, and in some respects better\nthan, those of existing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 09:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Due to the more or less random arrangement of the\nnanofibers and the possibility of gaining bent nanofibers in this production\nprocess, elementary single nanofibers with varying bending radii, from straight\nfibers to those bent along half-circles, were investigated by micromagnetic\nsimulations, using different angles with respect to the external magnetic\nfield. As expected from the high aspect ratios and the resulting strong shape\nanisotropy, all magnetization reversal processes took place via domain wall\nprocesses. Changing the cross-section from circular to a circle-segment or a\nrectangle significantly altered the coercive fields and its dependence on the\nbending radius, especially for the magnetic field oriented perpendicular (90\ndeg) to the fiber axes. In all three cross-sections, an angle of 45{\\deg}\nbetween the fiber orientation and the external magnetic field resulted in the\nsmallest influence of the bending radius. The shapes of the longitudinal and\ntransverse hysteresis curves showed strong differences, depending on\ncross-section, bending radius and orientation to the magnetic field, often\ndepicting distinct transverse magnetization peaks perpendicular to the fibers\nfor fibers which were not completely oriented parallel to the magnetic field.\nVarying these parameters thus provides a broad spectrum of magnetization\nreversal processes in magnetic nanofibers and correspondingly scenarios for a\nvariety of fiber-based information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 11:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

A group of nonlocal similar patches form a 4D tensor for\nwhich a nonlocal higher order dictionary is learned via higher order singular\nvalue decomposition. The multiple sub-dictionaries contained in the higher\norder dictionary decorrelate the group in each corresponding dimension, thus\nhelp the detail of color images to be reconstructed better.

It can distinguish those coefficients of the sparse\nrepresentation generated by the higher order dictionary which are expected to\nhave large magnitude from the others in the optimization. Accordingly, in the\niterative solution, it acts like a weighting process which is designed by\napproximating the minimum mean squared error filter for more faithful recovery.\nExperimental results confirm improvement by the proposed method over the\nstate-of-the-art ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 12:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

We apply our approach to three\nprototypical estimators, two inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators,\nusing a misspecified propensity score model, and a doubly robust (DR)\nestimator, using misspecified models for the outcome regression and the\npropensity score. To analyze the question of when the use of two misspecified\nmodels are better than one we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for\nwhen the DR estimator has a smaller bias than a simple IPW estimator and when\nit has a smaller bias than an IPW estimator with normalized weights. If the\nmisspecificiation of the outcome model is moderate the comparisons of the\nbiases of the IPW and DR estimators suggest that the DR estimator has a smaller\nbias than the IPW estimators. However, all biases include the PS-model error\nand we suggest that a researcher is careful when modeling the PS whenever such\na model is involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 13:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

In recent years, more and more\nonline application service sites can be represented as massive and complex\nnetworks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning\nalgorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into\nlow-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space and\nenable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network\ndata. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of\na sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this\npaper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging\nnetwork based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is\naligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the\nproblem, a new embedding framework, namely \"Deep alIgned autoencoder based\neMbEdding\" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link\nand attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the\nmultiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the\nnetwork structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which\ndefine various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and\nattribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as\nthe meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding\nvectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done\non real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 15:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}
