As is the case with Fiedler matrices, we\nobserve that the new bounds from intercyclic companion matrices can improve\nthose from the Frobenius matrix by at most a factor of two. By using the\nHessenberg form of an intercyclic companion matrix, we describe how to\ndetermine the best upper bound when restricted to Fiedler companion matrices\nusing the $\\infty$-norm.

The X-shooter archive of several thousand telluric star spectra was\nskimmed for Be and Be-shell stars to derive the stellar fundamental parameters\nand statistical properties, in particular for the less investigated late type\nBe stars, and the extension of the Be phenomenon into early A stars. Methods.\nAn adapted version of the BCD method is used, utilizing the Balmer\ndiscontinuity parameters to determine effective temperature and surface\ngravity. This method is optimally suited for late B stars. The projected\nrotational velocity was obtained by profile fitting to the Mg ii lines of the\ntargets, and the spectra were inspected visually for the presence of peculiar\nfeatures such as the infrared Ca ii triplet or the presence of a double Balmer\ndiscontinuity. The Balmer line equivalent widths were measured, but due to\nuncertainties in determining the photospheric contribution are useful only in a\nsubsample of Be stars for determining the pure emission contribution. Results.\nA total of 78 Be stars, mostly late type ones, were identified in the X-shooter\ntelluric standard star archive, out of which 48 had not been reported before.\nThe general trend of late type Be stars having more tenuous disks and being\nless variable than early type ones is confirmed. The relatively large number\n(48) of relatively bright (V > 8.5) additional Be stars casts some doubt on the\nstatistics of late type Be stars; they are more common than currently thought:\nThe Be/B star fraction may not strongly depend on spectral subtype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 17:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The hierarchy turns out to be bi-Hamiltonian, labeled by a nonnegative\ninteger $k$, and defined through a suitable generalization of the Gelfand-Dikii\npolynomials.

However, the latency of probe data, defined as the lag\nbetween the time that disturbance in traffic speed is reported in the\noutsourced data feed, and the time that the traffic is perturbed, has become a\nsubject of interest. The extent of latency of probe data for real-time\napplications is critical, so it is important to have a good understanding of\nthe amount of latency and its influencing factors. This paper uses high-quality\nindependent Bluetooth/Wi-Fi re-identification data collected on multiple\nfreeway segments in three different states, to measure the latency of the\nvehicle probe data provided by three major vendors. The statistical\ndistribution of the latency and its sensitivity to speed slowdown and recovery\nperiods are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 19:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 16:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Existing methods for\nthis problem in the setting of the Wright-Fisher diffusion model are primarily\nlikelihood-based, and rely on numerical approximation for likelihood\ncomputation and on bootstrapping for assessment of variability in the resulting\nestimates, requiring extensive computation. Recent work (Jenkins and Spano,\n2015) has provided a method for obtaining exact samples from general\nWright-Fisher diffusion processes, enabling the development of methods for\nBayesian estimation in this setting. We develop and implement a Bayesian method\nfor estimating the strength of selection based on the Wright-Fisher diffusion\nfor data sampled at a single time point. The method utilizes the work of\nJenkins and Spano (2015) to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to\ndraw samples from the joint posterior distribution of the selection coefficient\nand the allele frequencies. We demonstrate that when assumptions about the\ninitial allele frequencies are accurate the method performs well for both\nsimulated data and for an empirical data set on hypoxia in flies (Zhou et al.\n2011), where we find evidence for strong positive selection in a region of\nchromosome 2L previously identified by Ronen et al.

Crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport and characterized\nusing temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and\nmagnetization measurements. A structural phase transition occurs near 585 K, at\nwhich the Mo-Mo dimers present at room temperature are broken. A nearly regular\nhoneycomb net of Mo is observed above the transition, and an optical phonon\nassociated with the dimerization instability is identified in the Raman data\nand in first-principles calculations. The crystals are diamagnetic at room\ntemperature in the dimerized state, and the magnetic susceptibility increases\nsharply at the structural transition. Moderately strong paramagnetism in the\nhigh-temperature structure indicates the presence of local moments on Mo. This\nis consistent with results of spin-polarized density functional theory\ncalculations using the low- and high-temperature structures. Above the\nmagnetostructural phase transition the magnetic susceptibility continues to\nincrease gradually up to the maximum measurement temperature of 780 K, with a\ntemperature dependence that suggests two-dimensional antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 20:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

We characterize the queuing stability region of a network\nmodel that consists of two types of communications: (i) users communicating\nwith the base station and (ii) users communicating with each other by passing\nthrough the base station. When a communication passes through the base station\n(BS) then a packet cannot be delivered to the destination UE until it is first\nreceived by the BS queue from the source UE. Due to the relaying functionality\nat the BS level, a coupling is created between the queues of the source users\nand the BS queues. In addition, contrarily to the majority of the existing\nworks where an ON/OFF model of transmission is considered, we assume a link\nadaptation model (i.e. multiple rate model) where the bit rate of a link\ndepends on its radio conditions. The coupling between the queues as well as the\nmultiple rate model are the main challenges that highly increase the complexity\nof the stability region characterization.

An approximated model is proposed for reducing the\ncomputational complexity of the exact stability region. For the multi-user\nscenario, a trade-off is established between the complexity and the preciseness\nof the approximated stability region compared to the exact one.

Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory\nrelative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse\noperations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to\naddress this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block\nsparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso\nregularization to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques,\nwe demonstrate that we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from\n80% to 90% with small loss in accuracy. This allows us to reduce the model size\nby roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover\nthis loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the\noverall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up\nto 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and\nirregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to\nunstructured sparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 00:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

The discriminator of\nMLGANs can dynamically learn an appropriate metric, rather than a static one,\nto measure the distance between generated samples and real samples.

In particular, it is proven by Kaledin that\nunder some assumptions on a DG algebra $A$ over a perfect field $k$ of\ncharacteristic $p$, a lifting of $A$ over the ring of second Witt vectors\n$W_2(k)$ specifies the structure of a Fontaine-Laffaille module on the periodic\ncyclic homology of $A$.

In this article we consider a new\napproach to replace the particle filter, using transport methods in [27]. In\nthe context of filtering, one expects that the proposed method improves upon\nthe MLPF by yielding, under assumptions, a MSE of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)$ for\na cost of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$. This is established theoretically in an\n\"ideal\" example and numerically in numerous examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 05:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 06:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

In attempting to explain the origin of\nadversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that\nneural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too\nlinear. Here we argue that the origin of adversarial examples is primarily due\nto an inherent uncertainty that neural networks have about their predictions.\nWe show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of\narchitecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the\nstatistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change\nsignificantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a\nuniversal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial\nperturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of\ndatasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including\nstate-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks,\nand networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step\nl.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing\nprediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of\nnetwork architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural\narchitecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust\narchitectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white\n\\emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 06:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

Experiments using a benchmark dataset of highly repetitive texts show\nthat the pattern search of TST-index is significantly improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 07:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 02:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 09:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Most\nexisting ZSH approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate shared\nsemantic representations between the seen/source classes and novel/target\nclasses. However, due to having disjoint, the hash functions learned from the\nsource dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. In this\npaper, we study the transductive ZSH, i.e., we have unlabeled data for novel\nclasses. We put forward a simple yet efficient joint learning approach via\ncoarse-to-fine similarity mining which transfers knowledges from source data to\ntarget data. It mainly consists of two building blocks in the proposed deep\narchitecture: 1) a shared two-streams network, which the first stream operates\non the source data and the second stream operates on the unlabeled data, to\nlearn the effective common image representations, and 2) a coarse-to-fine\nmodule, which begins with finding the most representative images from target\nclasses and then further detect similarities among these images, to transfer\nthe similarities of the source data to the target data in a greedy fashion.\nExtensive evaluation results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed hashing method achieves significant improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 07:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

In this paper we consider the No Restart Random Walk (NRRW) model\nwhere a walker builds its graph (tree) while moving around. In particular, the\nwalker takes s steps (a parameter) on the current graph. A new node with degree\none is added to the graph and connected to the node currently occupied by the\nwalker. The walker then resumes, taking another s steps, and the process\nrepeats. We analyze this process from the perspective of the walker and the\nnetwork, showing a fundamental dichotomy between transience and recurrence for\nthe walker as well as power law and exponential degree distribution for the\nnetwork. More precisely, we prove the following results: i) for s=1 the random\nwalk is transient and the degree of every node is bounded from above by a\ngeometric distribution. ii) for s even the random walk is recurrent and the\ndegree of non-leaf nodes is bounded from below by a power law distribution with\nexponent decreasing in s. We also provide a lower bound for the fraction of\nleaves in the graph, and for s=2 our bound implies that the fraction of leaves\ngoes to one as the graph size goes to infinity. NRRW exhibits an interesting\nmutual dependency between graph building and random walking that is\nfundamentally influenced by the parity of s. Understanding this kind of coupled\ndynamics is an important step towards modeling more realistic network growth\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 12:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

We report\non a systematic census of the compact radio sources toward NGC 6334, and their\ncharacteristics. This will be used to try and define their very nature. We use\nVLA C band (4-8 GHz) archive data with 0.36\" of spatial resolution and noise\nlevel of 50 uJy/bm to carry out a systematic search for compact radio sources\nwithin NGC 6334.

Delivery of planetesimals to the\nwhite dwarf by orbiting planets is a leading candidate to explain these\nphenomena. Here, we study systems of planets and planetesimals undergoing\nplanet-planet scattering triggered by the star's post-main sequence mass loss,\nand test whether this can maintain high rates of delivery over the several Gyr\nthat they are observed.

Higher-mass planets are less efficient, and the delivery only lasts a\nrelatively brief time before the planetesimal populations are cleared.

The TCO material indium tin oxide\n(ITO) exhibits unity-strong index changes, and epsilon-near-zero behavior.\nHowever, with such tuning the corresponding high optical losses, originating\nfrom the fundamental Kramers-Kronig relations, result in low cavity finesse.\nHowever, achieving efficient tuning in ITO-cavities without using light matter\ninteraction enhancement techniques such as polaritonic modes, which are\ninherently lossy, is a challenge.

We report six detections in\nour sample, and also confirm an additional three cases that were previously\nreported in the literature. The majority of these bursts have a narrow range of\nblackbody radii around ~ 2 x 10^{12} cm, despite having a large range of\nluminosities (L ~ 10^{47} - 10^{51} erg s^{-1}). This points to an origin\nconnected to the progenitor stars, and we suggest that emission from a cocoon\nbreaking out from a thick wind may explain the observations. For two of the\nbursts in the sample, an explanation in terms of late prompt emission from the\njet is instead more likely. We also find that these thermal components are\npreferentially detected when the X-ray luminosity is low, which suggests that\nthey may be hidden by bright afterglows in the majority of GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 14:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Therefore, dynamically\nless complex mathematical formulations are necessary for coarse-grained\nsimulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation\n(LES) are probably the most popular example thereof. This type of models\nrequires the calculation of a subgrid characteristic length which is usually\nassociated with the local grid size. For isotropic grids this is equal to the\nmesh step. However, for anisotropic or unstructured grids, such as the\npancake-like meshes that are often used to resolve near-wall turbulence or\nshear layers, a consensus on defining the subgrid characteristic length has not\nbeen reached yet despite the fact that it can strongly affect the performance\nof LES models. In this context, a new definition of the subgrid characteristic\nlength is presented in this work. This flow-dependent length scale is based on\nthe turbulent, or subgrid stress, tensor and its representations on different\ngrids. The simplicity and mathematical properties suggest that it can be a\nrobust definition that minimizes the effects of mesh anisotropies on simulation\nresults. The performance of the proposed subgrid characteristic length is\nsuccessfully tested for decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent channel\nflow using artificially refined grids. Finally, a simple extension of the\nmethod for unstructured meshes is proposed and tested for a turbulent flow\naround a square cylinder. Comparisons with existing subgrid characteristic\nlength scales show that the proposed definition is much more robust with\nrespect to mesh anisotropies and has a great potential to be used in complex\ngeometries where highly skewed (unstructured) meshes are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 15:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 18:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

We calculate\naccurate total Lya fluxes capturing low surface brightness extended Lya\nemission now known to be a generic property of high-redshift star-forming\ngalaxies. We simulated realistic extended LAEs to characterise the selection\nfunction of our samples, and performed flux-recovery experiments to test and\ncorrect for bias in our determination of total Lya fluxes. We find an accurate\ncompleteness correction accounting for extended emission reveals a very steep\nfaint-end slope of the LF, alpha, down to luminosities of log10 L erg s^-1<\n41.5, applying both the 1/Vmax and maximum likelihood estimators. Splitting the\nsample into three broad redshift bins, we see the faint-end slope increasing\nfrom -2.03+1.42-inf at z ~ 3.44 to -2.86+0.76-inf at z ~ 5.48, however no\nstrong evolution is seen between the 68% confidence regions in L*-alpha\nparameter space. Using the Lya line flux as a proxy for star formation\nactivity, and integrating the observed LFs, we find that LAEs' contribution to\nthe cosmic SFRD rises with redshift until it is comparable to that from\ncontinuum-selected samples by z ~ 6. This implies that LAEs may contribute more\nto the star-formation activity of the early Universe than previously thought -\nany additional interglactic medium correction would act to further boost the\nLya luminosities. Finally, assuming fiducial values for the escape of Lya and\nLyC radiation, and the clumpiness of the IGM, we integrated the maximum\nlikelihood LF at 5.00 < z < 6.64 and find we require only a small extrapolation\nbeyond the data (< 1 dex in L) for LAEs alone to maintain an ionised IGM at z ~\n6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

We also find, based on our H$_\\alpha$ spectroscopy\nand Doppler tomography, that there is indication for change in the accretion\ndisc structure/emission during the flares, possibly due to a change in\naccretion flow. This, together with changing polarisation during the flares,\ncould mark the existence of magnetic propeller mass ejection process in the\nsystem. Furthermore, our analysis of flare profiles in both optical and NIR\nshows that NIR flares are at least as powerful as the optical ones and both can\nexhibit transition time scales less than 3 sec.

It is straightforward to see that\nthe power of the momentum in the integrand can be increased by $2$ in the\ninfrared using large gauge transformations, which are sufficient for rendering\nthese two-point functions infrared finite for slow-roll inflation. In other\nwords, if the integrand of the momentum integral for these two-point functions\nbehaves like $p^{-2\\nu}$, where $p$ is the momentum, in the infrared, then it\ncan be made to behave like $p^{-2\\nu+2}$ by large gauge transformations. On the\nother hand, it is known that, if one smears these two-point functions in a\ngauge-invariant manner, the power of the momentum in the integrand is changed\nfrom $p^{-2\\nu}$ to $p^{-2\\nu+4}$. This fact suggests that the power of the\nmomentum in the integrand for these two-point functions can be increased by $4$\nusing large gauge transformations. In this paper we show that this is indeed\nthe case. Thus, the two-point functions for the graviton and inflaton fields\ncan be made finite by large gauge transformations for a large class of\npotentials and states in single-field inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 11:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

Once the quantum\nhydrodynamic motion equations have been covariantly extended to the curved\nspace-time, the gravity equation (GE), determining the geometry of the\nspace-time, is obtained by minimizing the overall action comprehending the\ngravitational field. The derived Einstein-like gravity for the KGE field shows\nan energy-impulse tensor density (EITD) that is a function of the field with\nthe spontaneous emergence of the cosmological pressure tensor density (CPTD)\nthat in the classical limit leads to the cosmological constant(CC). The\nenergy-impulse tensor of the theory shows analogies with the modified\nBrans-Dick gravity with an effective gravity constant G divided by the field\nsquared. Even if the classical cosmological constant is set to zero, the model\nshows the emergence of a theory-derived quantum CPTD that, in principle, allows\nto have a stable quantum vacuum (out of the collapsed branched polymer phase)\nwithout postulating a non-zero classical CC. In the classical macroscopic\nlimit, the gravity equation of the KGE field leads to the Einstein equation.\nMoreover, if the boson field of the photon is considered, the EITD correctly\nleads to its electromagnetic energy-impulse tensor density. The outputs of the\ntheory show that the expectation value of the CPTD is independent by the\nzero-point vacuum energy density and that it tends to zero as the space-time\napproaches to the flat vacuum, leading to an overall cosmological effect on the\nmotion of the galaxies that may possibly be compatible with the astronomical\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 16:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 11:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 07:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 09:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 17:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 16:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 08:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based\nlocalization is one of the most promising approaches. However, it is\nchallenging to apply this localization to real-world environments since it is\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive to construct a fingerprint database as a\nprior for localization. Another challenge is that the presence of anomaly\nreadings in the fingerprints reduces the localization accuracy. To address\nthese two challenges, we propose an efficient and robust indoor localization\napproach. First, we model the fingerprint database as a 3-D tensor, which\nrepresents the relationships between fingerprints, locations and indices of\naccess points. Second, we introduce a tensor decomposition model for robust\nfingerprint data recovery, which decomposes a partial observation tensor as the\nsuperposition of a low-rank tensor and a spare anomaly tensor. Third, we\nexploit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the\nconvex optimization problem of tensor-nuclear-norm completion for the anomaly\ncase. Finally, we verify the proposed approach on a ground truth data set\ncollected in an office building with size 80m times 20m. Experiment results\nshow that to achieve a same error rate 4%, the sampling rate of our approach is\nonly 10%, while it is 60% for the state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, the\nproposed approach leads to a more accurate localization (nearly 20%, 0.6m\nimprovement) over the compared approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 05:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}
