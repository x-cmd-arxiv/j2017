In this work, we focus on modelling the CO\nemission from simulated giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and study the variations\nin the resulting line ratios arising from the emission from the $J=1-0$,\n$J=2-1$ and $J=3-2$ transitions. We perform a set of smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with time-dependent chemistry, in which\nenvironmental conditions -- including total cloud mass, density, size, velocity\ndispersion, metallicity, interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and the cosmic ray\nionisation rate (CRIR) -- were systematically varied. The simulations were then\npost-processed using radiative transfer to produce synthetic emission maps in\nthe 3 transitions quoted above. We find that the cloud-averaged values of the\nline ratios can vary by up to $\\pm 0.3$ dex, triggered by changes in the\nenvironmental conditions. Changes in the ISRF and/or in the CRIR have the\nlargest impact on line ratios since they directly affect the abundance,\ntemperature and distribution of CO-rich gas within the clouds. We show that the\nstandard methods used to convert CO emission to H$_2$ column density can\nunderestimate the total H$_2$ molecular gas in GMCs by factors of 2 or 3,\ndepending on the environmental conditions in the clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 16:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 14:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Using a master equation,\nwe analyze the stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled,\nbut strongly interacting single-level quantum dot subject to electrical and\nthermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality shows that\nfeatures of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the\naverage and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed\nby attractive instead of repulsive electron-electron interaction. In the\nnonlinear regime, the duality furthermore relates most transport coefficients\nto much better understood equilibrium quantities. Finally, we naturally\nidentify the fermion-parity as the part of the Coulomb interaction relevant for\nboth the linear and nonlinear Fourier heat. Altogether, our findings hence\nreveal that next to time-reversal, the duality imposes equally important\nsymmetry restrictions on thermoelectric transport.

We calculate the redshift between an Earth-bound clock and static\nobservers, observers in radial free fall, on circular geodesics, and on\narbitrary bound quasi-elliptical orbits. For the latter case, we consider as\nexamples an almost circular orbit, the Schwarzschild analog of Galileo\nsatellites 5 orbits with a moderate eccentricity, and a highly elliptical orbit\nas special examples. Furthermore, we also use orbits close to a Schwarzschild\nblack hole to highlight the influence of the relativistic perigee precession on\nthe redshift signal.

To investigate\nthe impact of higher order relativistic multipole moments on the gravitational\nredshift, we consider static observers in a general Weyl spacetime.

To address this issue we introduce the\nrouting network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A\nrouting network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two\ncomponents: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block\nmay be any neural network - for example a fully-connected or a convolutional\nlayer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function\nblock to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively,\nterminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing\nnetwork dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We\nemploy a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to\njointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against\ncross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the\nMNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a\nsignificant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition,\nrouting networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch\nnetworks scale linearly with the number of tasks.

With this in mind, we present a 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of face-on RPS of a disk galaxy to study\nthe impact of the galactic MF in the gas stripping. The main effect of\nincluding a galactic MF is a flared disk. When the intracluster medium (ICM)\nwind hits this flared disk, oblique shocks are produced at the interaction\ninterface, where the ISM is compressed, generating a gas inflow from large\nradii towards the central regions of the galaxy.

The effects of opacity sources and\nmany physical processes combine to set the shape of a transit spectrum. Two\nsuch key processes - refraction and cloud and/or haze forward scattering - have\nseen substantial recent study. However, models of these processes are typically\ncomplex, which prevents their incorporation into observational analyses and\nstandard transit spectrum tools. In this work, we develop analytic expressions\nthat allow for the efficient parameterization of forward scattering and\nrefraction effects in transit spectra. We derive an effective slant optical\ndepth that includes a correction for forward scattered light, and present an\nanalytic form of this correction. We validate our correction against a\nfull-physics transit spectrum model that includes scattering, and we explore\nthe extent to which the omission of forward scattering effects may bias models.\nAlso, we verify a common analytic expression for the location of a refractive\nboundary, which we express in terms of the maximum pressure probed in a transit\nspectrum. This expression is designed to be easily incorporated into existing\ntools, and we discuss how the detection of a refractive boundary could help\nindicate the background atmospheric composition by constraining the bulk\nrefractivity of the atmosphere.

Both phenomena are\nrelated to the linear-in-$\\mathbf{q}$ spatial dispersion of the optical\nconductivity tensor, and can be calculated within the formalism of the\nsemiclassical kinetic equation. Therefore, we calculate the dispersion of\noptical conductivity up to the linear order of the wave vector, in the low\nfrequency regime, with both the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and the Kubo\nformula. The two different methods of calculation provide us the same result.\nIn this result, the static and dynamic chiral magnetic effects are revealed to\nhave different origin: one comes from topology, related to Berry monopoles, and\nthe other has a geometric origin, which is determined by the orbital magnetic\nmoment. The Faraday rotation of the polarization of light transmitted through a\nslab of the sample provides us the most direct way to measure the magnitude of\ndynamic chiral magnetic effect. We develop an effective medium theory for\nelectromagnetic wave propagating through gapless nonuniform systems, to\ncalculate macroscopic sample inhomogeneities induced corrections to the chiral\nmagnetic conductivity.

We examine the\nmotions of internetwork flux elements in a 24 hour long Hinode/NFI magnetogram\nsequence with 90 second cadence, and study both the scaling of their mean\nsquared displacement and the shape of their displacement probability\ndistribution as a function of time.

In particular, the\nfunctionality of the IoT devices is extremely dependent on the reliability of\ntheir message transmission. Cyber attacks such as data injection,\neavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle threats can lead to security challenges.\nSecuring IoT devices against such attacks requires accounting for their\nstringent computational power and need for low-latency operations. In this\npaper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic watermarking of IoT\nsignals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices to extract a\nset of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically\nwatermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT's cloud\ncenter, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively\nauthenticate the reliability of the signals. Furthermore, the proposed method\nprevents complicated attack scenarios such as eavesdropping in which the cyber\nattacker collects the data from the IoT devices and aims to break the\nwatermarking algorithm. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection\ndelay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with\nan almost 100% reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 19:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

The BCD spectrophotometric system is a powerful tool to obtain\nfundamental parameters and infer the main properties of open clusters: distance\nmodulus, color excess, and age.

It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced\nby the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity\nalong our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.\nLow-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities\nof 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015).

For $k$-means with outliers, we give an $(\\alpha_2+\\epsilon \\leq\n53.002 + \\epsilon)$-approximation, which is the first $O(1)$-approximation for\nthis problem. The iterative algorithm framework is very versatile; we show how\nit can be used to give $\\alpha_1$- and $(\\alpha_1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithms for matroid and knapsack median problems respectively, improving\nupon the previous best approximations ratios of $8$ [Swamy, ACM Trans.\nAlgorithms] and $17.46$ [Byrka et al, ESA 2015].\n  The natural LP relaxation for the $k$-median/$k$-means with outliers problem\nhas an unbounded integrality gap. In spite of this negative result, our\niterative rounding framework shows that we can round an LP solution to an\nalmost-integral solution of small cost, in which we have at most two\nfractionally open facilities. Thus, the LP integrality gap arises due to the\ngap between almost-integral and fully-integral solutions. Then, using a\npre-processing procedure, we show how to convert an almost-integral solution to\na fully-integral solution losing only a constant-factor in the approximation\nratio. By further using a sparsification technique, the additive factor loss\nincurred by the conversion can be reduced to any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 20:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 14:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

We aim at evaluating\nEuclid capability to discover SSOs, and measure their position, apparent\nmagnitude, and SED. Also, we investigate how these measurements can lead to the\ndetermination of their orbits, morphology, physical properties, and surface\ncomposition. We use current census of SSOs to estimate the number of SSOs\ndetectable by Euclid. Then we estimate how Euclid will constrain the SSOs\ndynamical, physical, and compositional properties. With current survey design,\nabout 150,000 SSOs, mainly from the asteroid main-belt, should be observed by\nEuclid. These objects will all have high inclination. There is a potential for\ndiscovery of several 10,000 SSOs, in particular KBOs at high declination.\nEuclid observations will refine the spectral classification of SSOs by\nextending the spectral coverage provided by, e.g. Gaia and the LSST to 2\nmicrons. The time-resolved photometry, combined with sparse photometry will\ncontribute to the determination of SSO rotation period, spin orientation, and\nshape model. The sharp and stable point-spread function of Euclid will also\nallow to resolve KBO binary systems and detect activity around Centaurs. The\ndepth of Euclid survey, its spectral coverage, and observation cadence has\ngreat potential for Solar System research. A dedicated processing for SSOs is\nbeing set in place to produce catalogs of astrometry, multi-color and\ntime-resolved photometry, and spectral classification of some 10$^5$ SSOs,\ndelivered as Legacy Science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 21:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

While much theoretical and experimental work over the last 20 years\nhas made clear that the adsorption of large, polarizable anions is\nthermodynamically favorable, determining the role of polarizability in\nadsorption has proven surprisingly challenging. Simple physical models make\nclear that nonpolarizable anions will not adsorb, but trends in adsorption are\ndifficult to rationalize based on polarizability and in some theoretical\napproaches adsorption is observed without change in anion polarization. Because\nthere are no experimental studies of interfacial anion polarizability, one\npossible explanation of these results is that theoretical descriptions suffer\nfrom systematic error. In this study we use interface specific nonlinear\noptical spectroscopy to extract the spectral response of the interfacial\nClO$_{4}^{-}$ anion. We find that (i) the interfacial environment induces a\nbreak in symmetry of the anion due to its solvation anisotropy (ii) the Raman\ndepolarization ratio, a measure of the ratio of the change in two components of\nClO$_{4}^{-}$'s polarizability tensor with change in nuclear positions, is\n$>2\\times$ larger than its value in the adjoining bulk phase and interfacial\nconcentration dependent and (iii) using a simple theoretical description we\nfind that our measured changes in depolarization ratio are consistent with\nknown changes in surface potential and tension with small changes in bulk\nClO$_{4}^{-}$ concentration. The notion that interfacial anion polarizability\ndiffers from that in bulk, and that this polarizability is coverage dependent,\nis not accounted for in any current theoretical treatment of ions at the\nair/water interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 22:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Most recently,\nthe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has extended VLBI to short millimeter\nwavelengths with a goal of achieving angular resolution sufficient for imaging\nthe event horizons of nearby supermassive black holes. VLBI provides\nmeasurements related to the underlying source image through a sparse set\nspatial frequencies. An image can then be recovered from these measurements by\nmaking assumptions about the underlying image. One of the most important\nassumptions made by conventional imaging methods is that over the course of a\nnight's observation the image is static. However, for quickly evolving sources,\nsuch as the galactic center's supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) targeted by the\nEHT, this assumption is violated and these conventional imaging approaches\nfail. In this work we propose a new way to model VLBI measurements that allows\nus to recover both the appearance and dynamics of an evolving source by\nreconstructing a video rather than a static image. By modeling VLBI\nmeasurements using a Gaussian Markov Model, we are able to propagate\ninformation across observations in time to reconstruct a video, while\nsimultaneously learning about the dynamics of the source's emission region.

Moreover, they mainly\nfocus on RGB image and ignore the depth information for RGBD images. In this\npaper, we propose an iterative RGBD co-saliency framework, which utilizes the\nexisting single saliency maps as the initialization, and generates the final\nRGBD cosaliency map by using a refinement-cycle model. Three schemes are\nemployed in the proposed RGBD co-saliency framework, which include the addition\nscheme, deletion scheme, and iteration scheme. The addition scheme is used to\nhighlight the salient regions based on intra-image depth propagation and\nsaliency propagation, while the deletion scheme filters the saliency regions\nand removes the non-common salient regions based on interimage constraint. The\niteration scheme is proposed to obtain more homogeneous and consistent\nco-saliency map. Furthermore, a novel descriptor, named depth shape prior, is\nproposed in the addition scheme to introduce the depth information to enhance\nidentification of co-salient objects.

A reasonably\naccurate LES prediction of turbulence in such an UABL must resolve a\nsignificant proportion of the small but energetic eddies in the roughness\nsublayer, which remains prohibitive even though computational power has been\nincreased significantly. In this article, we present a large-eddy simulation\nmethodology to study turbulence in UABLs, where the turbulence closure is based\non coupling the eddy viscosity method with the canopy stress method. Unlike the\nclassical Smagorinsky model that considers only the strain portion of the\nvelocity gradient tensor, we consider both the strain tensor and the rotation\ntensor to compute the eddy viscosity. This allows us to dynamically adapt the\nrate of energy dissipation to the scales of the energetic eddies in the\nroughness sublayer. Without employing a mesh conforming to the urban roughness\nelements, the effect of such solid bodies are represented in the LES model\nthrough a canopy stress method in which the loss of pressure and the sink of\nmomentum due to the interaction between eddies and roughness elements are\nparameterized using the instantaneous velocity field. Simulation results of the\nproposed canopy stress method is compared with that of a conventional\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method employing a block-structured mesh\nconforming around the roughness elements. For urban flow simulations, the\nresults demonstrate that the proposed canopy stress model is accurate in\npredicting vertical profiles of mean and variance, as well as the temporal\nintermittency of coherent structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 00:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

A recent\ntechnique introduced by Miller et al, which relies on a spectral framework for\nanomaly detection, has the potential to address many of these challenges. In\ntheir discussion of the spectral framework, three algorithms were proposed that\nrelied on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the residual matrix of a binary\nnetwork.

For such\ncomplex planning problems, unguided uniform sampling of actions until a path to\na goal is found is hopelessly inefficient, and gradient-based approaches often\nfall short when the optimization manifold of a given problem is not smooth. In\nthis paper we present an approach that guides the search of a state-space\nplanner, such as A*, by learning an action-sampling distribution that can\ngeneralize across different instances of a planning problem. The motivation is\nthat, unlike typical learning approaches for planning for continuous action\nspace that estimate a policy, an estimated action sampler is more robust to\nerror since it has a planner to fall back on. We use a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN), and address an important issue: search experience consists of a\nrelatively large number of actions that are not on a solution path and a\nrelatively small number of actions that actually are on a solution path. We\nintroduce a new technique, based on an importance-ratio estimation method, for\nusing samples from a non-target distribution to make GAN learning more\ndata-efficient.

This is especially true for arrays of telescopes spread over a\nlarge area such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this paper, the\nfeasibility of using UAVs to calibrate CTA is investigated. Assuming a UAV at 1\nkm altitude above CTA, operating on astronomically clear nights with\nstratified, low atmospheric dust content, appropriate thermal protection for\nthe calibration light source and an onboard photodiode to monitor its absolute\nlight intensity, inter-calibration of CTA's telescopes of the same size class\nis found to be achievable with a 6-8 % uncertainty. For cross-calibration of\ndifferent telescope size classes, a systematic uncertainty of 8-10 % is found\nto be achievable. Importantly, equipping the UAV with a multi-wavelength\ncalibration light source affords us the ability to monitor the\nwavelength-dependent degradation of CTA telescopes' optical system, allowing us\nto not only maintain this 6-10 % uncertainty after the first few years of\ntelescope deployment, but also to accurately account for the effect of\nmulti-wavelength degradation on the cross-calibration of CTA by other\ntechniques, namely with images of air showers and local muons. A UAV-based\nsystem thus provides CTA with several independent and complementary methods of\ncross-calibrating the optical throughput of individual telescopes. Furthermore,\nhousing environmental sensors on the UAV system allows us to not only minimise\nthe systematic uncertainty associated with the atmospheric transmission of the\ncalibration signal, it also allows us to map the dust content above CTA as well\nas monitor the temperature, humidity and pressure profiles of the first\nkilometre of atmosphere above CTA with each UAV flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 08:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The study of the fragmentation process has been motivated\nby simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have\nanalysed the evolution of filaments using numerical simulations where the\nfilaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the\nearly evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds. We\nfocus on three questions: How do the line masses of filaments evolve? How and\nwhen do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line\nmasses of the filaments? We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in\nkpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the\nproperties of the identified filaments with the predictions of analytic\nfilament stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the\nidentified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The\nfirst fragments appear early when the line masses lie well below the critical\nline mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium solution. The average line\nmasses of filaments identified in 3D density cubes increases far more quickly\nthan those identified in 2D column density maps. Our results suggest that\nhydrostatic or dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant\nimpact on the early dynamical evolution of filaments. A simple model of an\nisolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good approach for fragmentation\nanalysis. Caution must be exercised in interpreting distributions of properties\nof filaments identified in column density maps, especially in the case of\nlow-mass filaments.

Apart from\nbeing part of MEC, D2D can extend cellular coverage allowing users to\ncommunicate directly when telecommunication infrastructure is highly congested\nor absent. This significant departure from the typical cellular paradigm\nimposes the need for decentralised network routing protocols. Moreover,\nenhanced capabilities of mobile devices and D2D networking will likely result\nin proliferation of new malware types and epidemics. Although the literature is\nrich in terms of D2D routing protocols that enhance quality-of-service and\nenergy consumption, they provide only basic security support, e.g., in the form\nof encryption. Routing decisions can, however, contribute to collaborative\ndetection of mobile malware by leveraging different kinds of anti-malware\nsoftware installed on mobile devices. Benefiting from the cooperative nature of\nD2D communications, devices can rely on each other's contributions to detect\nmalware. The impact of our work is geared towards having more malware-free D2D\nnetworks. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel routing protocol\nfor D2D communications that optimises routing decisions for explicitly\nimproving malware detection. The protocol identifies optimal network paths, in\nterms of malware mitigation and energy spent for malware detection, based on a\ngame theoretic model. Diverse capabilities of network devices running different\ntypes of anti-malware software and their potential for inspecting messages\nrelayed towards an intended destination device are leveraged using game\ntheoretic tools. An optimality analysis of both Nash and Stackelberg security\ngames is undertaken, including both zero and non-zero sum variants, and the\nDefender's equilibrium strategies. By undertaking network simulations,\ntheoretical results obtained are illustrated through randomly generated network\nscenarios showing how our protocol outperforms conventional routing protocols,\nin terms of expected payoff, which consists of: security damage in inflicted by\nmalware and malware detection cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 15:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

The metasurface antenna consists of an array of metamaterial\nelements distributed over an electrically large structure, each subwavelength\nin dimension and with subwavelength separation between elements. In the antenna\nconfiguration we consider here, the metasurface is excited by the fields from\nan attached waveguide. Each metamaterial element can be modeled as a\npolarizable dipole that couples the waveguide mode to radiation modes. Distinct\nfrom the phased array and electronically scanned antenna (ESA) architectures, a\ndynamic metasurface antenna does not require active phase shifters and\namplifiers, but rather achieves reconfigurability by shifting the resonance\nfrequency of each individual metamaterial element.

We derive analytical approximations for the array\nfactors of the 1D antenna, including the effective polarizabilities needed for\namplitude-only, phase-only, and binary constraints.

Regarding dark energy, the\ntriad behaves asymptotically as a couple of radiation perfect fluids whose\nenergy densities are negative for the $S$ term but positive for the Yang-Mills\nterm.

In production environments, it is crucial to\nperform accurate and (time-)efficient training. Existing deep learning\napproaches for classifying documents do not meet these requirements, as they\nrequire much time for training and fine-tuning the deep architectures.\nMotivated from Computer Vision, we propose a two-stage approach. The first\nstage trains a deep network that works as feature extractor and in the second\nstage, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) are used for classification. The\nproposed approach outperforms all previously reported structural and deep\nlearning based methods with a final accuracy of 83.24% on Tobacco-3482 dataset,\nleading to a relative error reduction of 25% when compared to a previous\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach (DeepDocClassifier). More\nimportantly, the training time of the ELM is only 1.176 seconds and the overall\nprediction time for 2,482 images is 3.066 seconds. As such, this novel approach\nmakes deep learning-based document classification suitable for large-scale\nreal-time applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 17:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

While over 100 RRATs have\nbeen detected, only a small fraction (roughly 20\\%) have phase-connected timing\nsolutions, which are critical for determining how they relate to other neutron\nstar populations. Detecting more pulses in order to achieve solutions is a key\nto understanding their physical nature. Astronomical signals collected by radio\ntelescopes contain noise from many sources, making the detection of weak pulses\ndifficult. Applying a denoising method to raw time series prior to performing a\nsingle-pulse search typically leads to a more accurate estimation of their\ntimes of arrival (TOAs). Taking into account some features of RRAT pulses and\nnoise, we present a denoising method based on wavelet data analysis, an\nimage-processing technique. Assuming that the spin period of an RRAT is known,\nwe estimate the frequency spectrum components contributing to the composition\nof RRAT pulses. This allows us to suppress the noise, which contributes to\nother frequencies. We apply the wavelet denoising method including selective\nwavelet reconstruction and wavelet shrinkage to the de-dispersed time series of\neight RRATs with existing timing solutions. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of\nmost pulses are improved after wavelet denoising. Compared to the conventional\napproach, we measure 12% to 69% more TOAs for the eight RRATs. The new timing\nsolutions for the eight RRATs show 16% to 90% smaller estimation error of most\nparameters. Thus, we conclude that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for\ndenoising RRATs signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 19:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Our\nsimulation studies find that in organizations with flatter structures,\ncorruption permeates the organization at a lower threshold value of corruption\nprobability compared to those with taller structures. However, the final\nproportion of corrupted individuals is higher in the latter as compared to the\nformer. Also, we find that for a 1,000 strong organization, 5 percent of the\nworkforce is a critical threshold in terms of the number of whistle-blowers\nneeded to constrain the spread of corruption, and if this number is around 25\npercent, the corruption contagion is negligible.
