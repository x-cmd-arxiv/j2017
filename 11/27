Analyzing such data and obtaining proper\nconcordance among the instruments is challenging when the physical source\nmodels are not well understood, when there are uncertainties in \"known\"\nphysical quantities, or when data quality varies in ways that cannot be fully\nquantified. Furthermore, the number of model parameters increases with both the\nnumber of instruments and the number of sources. Thus, concordance of the\ninstruments requires careful modeling of the mean signals, the intrinsic source\ndifferences, and measurement errors. In this paper, we propose a log-Normal\nhierarchical model and a more general log-t model that respect the\nmultiplicative nature of the mean signals via a half-variance adjustment, yet\npermit imperfections in the mean modeling to be absorbed by residual variances.\nWe present analytical solutions in the form of power shrinkage in special cases\nand develop reliable MCMC algorithms for general cases. We apply our method to\nseveral data sets obtained with a variety of X-ray telescopes such as Chandra.\nWe demonstrate that our method provides helpful and practical guidance for\nastrophysicists when adjusting for disagreements among instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 17:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 21:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

This constraint can be\nautomatically satisfied in the framework of massive gravity. In this work we\nconsider a general $SO(3)$-invariant massive gravity with five propagating\ndegrees of freedom and derive the conditions for the absence of ghosts and\nLaplacian instabilities in the presence of a matter perfect fluid on the flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background. The\ngraviton potential containing the dependence of three-dimensional metrics and a\nfiducial metric coupled to a temporal scalar field gives rise to a scenario of\nthe late-time cosmic acceleration in which the dark energy equation of state\n$w_{\\rm DE}$ is equivalent to $-1$ or varies in time. We find that the\ndeviation from the value $w_{\\rm DE}=-1$ provides important contributions to\nthe quantities associated with the stability conditions of tensor, vector, and\nscalar perturbations. In concrete models, we study the dynamics of dark energy\narising from the graviton potential and show that there exist viable parameter\nspaces in which neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities are present for both\n$w_{\\rm DE}>-1$ and $w_{\\rm DE}<-1$.

When learning from user behavior, systems must\ninteract with users while simultaneously learning from those interactions.\nUnlike other Learning to Rank (LTR) settings, existing research in this field\nhas been limited to linear models. This is due to the speed-quality tradeoff\nthat arises when selecting models: complex models are more expressive and can\nfind the best rankings but need more user interactions to do so, a requirement\nthat risks frustrating users during training. Conversely, simpler models can be\noptimized on fewer interactions and thus provide a better user experience, but\nthey will converge towards suboptimal rankings. This tradeoff creates a\ndeadlock, since novel models will not be able to improve either the user\nexperience or the final convergence point, without sacrificing the other. Our\ncontribution is twofold. First, we introduce a fast OLTR model called Sim-MGD\nthat addresses the speed aspect of the speed-quality tradeoff. Sim-MGD ranks\ndocuments based on similarities with reference documents. It converges rapidly\nand, hence, gives a better user experience but it does not converge towards the\noptimal rankings. Second, we contribute Cascading Multileave Gradient Descent\n(C-MGD) for OLTR that directly addresses the speed-quality tradeoff by using a\ncascade that enables combinations of the best of two worlds: fast learning and\nhigh quality final convergence. C-MGD can provide the better user experience of\nSim-MGD while maintaining the same convergence as the state-of-the-art MGD\nmodel. This opens the door for future work to design new models for OLTR\nwithout having to deal with the speed-quality tradeoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 19:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

First\nthe sample gets eroded by inert gas ion impact during sputter depth profiling.\nThen the elemental composition of the freshly unveiled surface is determined by\nusing a surface sensitive analytical method as AES or XPS, for instance. This\nway the depth distributions of the elements are recorded as a function of\nsputter time. The time to record the spectral data in a certain sputter depth\nis kept as short as possible to avoid recontamination of the freshly sputtered\nsurface by adsorption of gas particles from the vacuum during the measurement.\nTherefore in every sputter depth only those spectral regions are recorded,\nwhich belong to the elements expected to be in the sample.

By this approach the depth distributions of all elements\nare estimated, which are detectable by the used analytical method. The\nmeasurement of wide energy range spectra during sputter depth profile\nacquisition is promising for samples, which are very insulating. If the surface\npotential varies in different sputter depths, the elemental peaks are shifted\nin an unpredictable way.

Open-loop control of fully separated,\nincompressible flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil at $\\alpha = 9^\\circ$ and $Re =\n23,000$ is examined with large-eddy simulations. This study independently\nintroduces wall-normal momentum and angular momentum into the separated flow\nusing swirling jets through model boundary conditions. The response of the flow\nfield and the surface vorticity fluxes to various combinations of actuation\ninputs are examined in detail.

Lift enhancement and suppression of separation with the\nwall-normal and angular momentum inputs are characterized by modifying the\nstandard definition of the coefficient of momentum. The effect of angular\nmomentum is incorporated into the modified coefficient of momentum by\nintroducing a characteristic swirling jet velocity based on the non-dimensional\nswirl number. With this single modified coefficient of momentum, we are able to\ncategorize each controlled flow into separated, transitional, and attached\nflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 22:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

To compute the solution of the\noriginal eigenvalue problem at the interface variables we leverage ideas from\ncontour integral eigenvalue solvers. The second subproblem is associated with\nthe interior variables in each subdomain and can be solved in parallel among\nthe different subdomains using real arithmetic only. Compared to rational\nfiltering projection methods applied to the original matrix pencil, the\nproposed technique integrates only a part of the matrix resolvent while it\napplies any orthogonalization necessary to vectors whose length is equal to the\nnumber of interface variables. In addition, no estimation of the number of\neigenvalues lying inside the interval of interest is needed.

SVD restart is an effective approach to reset the aggregated error,\nbut when to restart SVD for dynamic networks is not addressed in literature. In\nthis paper, we propose TIMERS, Theoretically Instructed Maximum-Error-bounded\nRestart of SVD, a novel approach which optimally sets the restart time in order\nto reduce error accumulation in time. Specifically, we monitor the margin\nbetween reconstruction loss of incremental updates and the minimum loss in SVD\nmodel.

In this paper we propose and study a conceptual resource\nmodel that describes a simple and easily understandable mechanism for resource\ncompetition, generalizes the well-known Huisman and Weissing model, and takes\ninto account species self-regulation, extinctions, and time dependence of\nresources. We use analytical investigations and numerical simulations to study\nthe dynamics of our model under chaotic and periodic climate oscillations, and\nshow that the stochastic dynamics of our model exhibit strong dependence on\ninitial parameters. We also demonstrate that extinctions in our model are\ninevitable if an ecosystem has the maximal possible biodiversity and uses the\nmaximal amount of resources. Our conceptual modeling provides theoretical\nsupport for suggestions that non-linear processes were important during major\nextinction events in Earth history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 06:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a\nprobability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous\nposes. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from\nthe same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random\ndistribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic\npredictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that\nlearns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion.\n  We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and\nHuman3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its\npredictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating\nmultiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input.\nWe show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50\\%\nprobabilities of being judged as a real human sequence.

However, in present\nenergy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits\nthe capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends.

The solution is based on a blockchain transactive\nplatform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy\nwith their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production.\nWe propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an\nincentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that\nresponds to both pro-sumer and operator needs.

Old rarely utilized knowledge can be\noverwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used\nknowledge is prevented from being erased.

In this paper, we argue that,\ngiven the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be\nlearned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively.

We analyze how the threshold parameter of the criterion\ninfluences accuracy and computational cost of the new multiphysics model and\ngive recommendations for the choice of optimal threshold parameters.

The spectra are analyzed using a two-band model\nmodified to account for depairing. We show that in the bulk, the smaller gap\nexhibits strong depairing in an in-plane magnetic field, consistent with a high\nFermi velocity. In the few-layer devices, depairing of the large gap is\nnegligible, consistent with out-of-plane spin-locking due to Ising spin-orbit\ncoupling.

The coherence of neuronal dynamics over different\nscales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this\nintegration. Balanced excitation and inhibition may amplify microscopic\nfluctuations to a macroscopic level, thus providing a mechanism for generating\ncoherent multiscale dynamics. Previous theories of brain dynamics, however,\nwere restricted to cases in which inhibition dominated excitation and\nsuppressed fluctuations in the macroscopic population activity. In the present\nstudy, we investigate the dynamics of neuronal networks at a critical point\nbetween excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant states. In these networks,\nthe microscopic fluctuations are amplified by the strong excitation and\ninhibition to drive the macroscopic dynamics, while the macroscopic dynamics\ndetermine the statistics of the microscopic fluctuations. Developing a novel\ntype of mean-field theory applicable to this class of interscale interactions,\nwe show that the amplification mechanism generates spontaneous, irregular\nmacroscopic rhythms similar to those observed in the brain. Through the same\nmechanism, microscopic inputs to a small number of neurons effectively entrain\nthe dynamics of the whole network. These network dynamics undergo a\nprobabilistic transition to a coherent state, as the magnitude of either the\nbalanced excitation and inhibition or the external inputs is increased. Our\nmean-field theory successfully predicts the behavior of this model.\nFurthermore, we numerically demonstrate that the coherent dynamics can be used\nfor state-dependent read-out of information from the network.

This contribution demonstrates the superior accuracy of the present\ndataset with respect to existing measurements. The comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb\ncollisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitudinal\nevolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other\nmesons. Furthermore, proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible\norder parameter of the second order phase transition in the neighbourhood of\nthe critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. An intermittency\nanalysis is performed of the proton second scaled factorial moments in\ntransverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this sort revealed\nsignificant power-law fluctuations for the \"Si\"+Si system at 158A GeV measured\nby the NA49 experiment. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent within\nerrors with the theoretically expected critical value, a result suggesting a\nbaryochemical potential in the vicinity of the CP of about 250 MeV. The\nanalysis will now be extended to NA61/SHINE systems of similar size, Be+Be and\nAr+Sc, at 150A GeV. Finally, spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects on\ncharged meson production are being studied and bring information on the\nspace-time position of the pion formation zone, which appears to be much closer\nto the spectator system for faster pions than for slower ones. On that basis,\nwe demonstrate that the longitudinal evolution of the system at CERN SPS\nenergies may be interpreted as a pure consequence of local energy-momentum\nconservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 11:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

It is found that the\nelectron-hole compensation level in MoSi$_2$ evolves with magnetic field, which\nis resulted from strong Zeeman effect, and found beneficial in boosting the\nlarge non-saturating magnetoresistance. The non-trivial Berry phase in the de\nHaas-van Alphen oscillations and the moderate suppression of backward\nscattering of the charge carriers lend support for the topological nature of\nthis semimetal. The ultra-large carrier mobility of the topologically protected\ncharge carriers reinforces the magnetoresistance of MoSi2 to an unprecedented\nlarge value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 12:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

A\nfilter-tree corresponding to a filter in k^{th} convolu- tional layer of a CNN\nis a subnetwork consisting of the filter along with all its connections to\nfilters in all preceding layers. An ensemble of such filter-trees created from\nthe k^{th} layers of many CNNs learnt on different but related tasks, forms the\nBFT. To learn a new CNN, we sample from the BFT to select a set of filter\ntrees. This fixes the target net up to the k th layer and only the remaining\nnetwork would be learnt using train- ing data of new task. Through simulations\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea of BFT.

We aim to\nprovide a new, independent measurement of the distance to R Sculptoris,\nreducing the absolute uncertainty of the distance estimate to this source. R\nScl is a semi-regular pulsating star, surrounded by a thin shell of dust and\ngas created during a thermal pulse approximately 2000 years ago. The stellar\nlight is scattered by the dust particles in the shell at a radius of 19 arcsec.\nThe variation in the stellar light affects the amount of dust-scattered light\nwith the same period and amplitude ratio, but with a phase lag that depends on\nthe absolute size of the shell. We measured this phase lag by observing the\nstar R Scl and the dust-scattered stellar light from the shell at five epochs\nbetween June - December 2017. By observing in polarised light, we imaged the\nshell in the plane of the sky, removing any uncertainty due to geometrical\neffects. The phase lag gives the absolute size of the shell, and together with\nthe angular size of the shell directly gives the absolute distance to R\nSculptoris. We measured a phase lag between the stellar variations and the\nvariation in the shell of 40.0 +/- 4.0 days. The angular size of the shell is\nmeasured to be 19.1 arcsec +/- 0.7 arcsec. Combined, this gives an absolute\ndistance to R Sculptoris of 361 +/- 44 pc. We independently determined the\nabsolute distance to R Scl with an uncertainty of 12%. The estimated distance\nis consistent with previous estimates, but is one of the most accurate\ndistances to the source to date.

In\naddition to this performance enhancement problem, we show that the proposed PGN\ncan be adopted to solve the classical adversarial problem without utilizing the\ninformation on the target classifier.

It is possible that the atomically\nsmooth disorder produced by the corrugated graphene does not destroy the\nsuperfluidity even in a very thin film, where the system can be considered as\nquasi two-dimensional topological material. This will allow us to study the\neffect of disorder on different classes of the $2+1$ topological materials: the\nchiral $^3$He-A with intrinsic quantum Hall effect and the time reversal\ninvariant planar phase with intrinsic spin quantum Hall effect. In the limit of\nsmooth disorder, the system can be considered as a Chern mosaic -- a collection\nof domains with different values of Chern numbers. In this limit, the\nquantization of the Hall conductance is determined by the percolated domain,\nwhile the density of the fermionic states is determined by the edge modes on\nthe boundaries of the finite domains. This system can be useful for the general\nconsideration of disorder in the topological matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 15:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 18:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Witnet runs on a blockchain with a native protocol\ntoken (called Wit), which miners-called witnesses-earn by retrieving, attesting\nand delivering web contents for clients.

Intriguingly, much prior experimental and\ntheoretical work has found that, from the perspective of their time-averaged\nstructure and picosecond structural dynamics, hydrogen-bonded OH groups at an\nair/water interface behave the same as hydrogen-bonded OH groups in bulk liquid\nwater. Here we report the first experimental observation of interfacial water's\nlibration (i.e. frustrated rotation) using the laser-based technique\nvibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. We find this mode has a frequency of\n834 cm$^{-1}$, $\\approx 165$ cm$^{-1}$ higher than in bulk liquid water at the\nsame temperature and similar to bulk ice. Because libration frequency is\nproportional to the stiffness of water's rotational potential, this increase\nsuggests that one effect of terminating bulk water's hydrogen bonding network\nat the air/water interface is retarding rotation of water around intact\nhydrogen bonds.

The\nstimulus was based on vertical sinusoidal gratings masked by a circular (for\nfoveal area) or a ring (for parafoveal area). To increase the luminance\nresolution of the display a bit-stealing technique was used. Four different\nsets of stimuli were generated, two for exploring the foveal sensitivity and\ntwo for the parafoveal area. The difference between the sets designed for the\nsame area was the presence, or absence, of a fixation target (a white cross) in\nthe centre of the stimulus. A modified staircase method was implemented.\n  Results\n  The results show a drop in the contrast sensitivity when the fixation target\nwas present on the stimulus for frequencies smaller than 4 cycles per degree.\n  Conclusions\n  The presence of fixation targets diminishes the contrast sensitivity for low\nto mid frequencies over different concentric areas of the retina. This could be\ndue to the fixational eye movements, different patterns of eye movements were\nfound using an eye tracker. The relationship between the sensitivity in the\nfoveal area and the parafoveal agrees with those reported by other authors\nusing different designs confirming that the new stimulus design is suitable to\nmeasure the contrast sensitivity outside the foveal area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 15:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

Inspired by the theories of\nimage structure analysis, this paper presents a simple, efficient, yet robust\ndescriptor namely local jet pattern (LJP) for texture classification. In this\napproach, a jet space representation of a texture image is derived from a set\nof derivatives of Gaussian (DtGs) filter responses up to second order, so\ncalled local jet vectors (LJV), which also satisfy the Scale Space properties.\nThe LJP is obtained by utilizing the relationship of center pixel with the\nlocal neighborhood information in jet space. Finally, the feature vector of a\ntexture region is formed by concatenating the histogram of LJP for all elements\nof LJV. All DtGs responses up to second order together preserves the intrinsic\nlocal image structure, and achieves invariance to scale, rotation, and\nreflection. This allows us to develop a texture classification framework which\nis discriminative and robust.

It is shown that axial anomaly leads to a particular kind of the FFLO\nstate within the two dimensional Nambu-Jona Lasinio model, where axial anomaly\nis manifested in a different mode.
