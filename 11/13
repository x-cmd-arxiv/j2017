Reversible logic gates can provide an\nenergy-efficient alternative since they can operate with reversible processes\nthat have no dissipation, such as with scattering processes involving elastic\nparticles. The presented logic uses fluxons, topological solitons in Long\nJosephson Junctions (LJJs), as inputs into and outputs from logic gates. An\nadvantage of using LJJs for connections is that they restrict scattering to 1D\npaths, in contrast to previous ballistic logic which is based on 2D scattering.\nFurthermore, we find through simulation that there is almost no energy loss in\nthe scattering of fluxons between LJJs of designed unpowered circuit gates. To\nswitch bit states, the fluxons are made to change polarity during operations --\nfluxons in an input LJJ freely propagate into the gate circuit, excite a\nnonlinear oscillatory interface mode, and quickly scatter deterministically to\nan output LJJ as a fluxon or antifluxon. The numerically simulated soliton\ndynamics shows that over $97\\%$ of the total energy is preserved as fluxon\nenergy after gate operations. These phenomena are further analyzed with a\ncollective coordinate ansatz, reducing the dynamics of many degrees of freedom\nto two coordinates which characterize fluxon and antifluxon type excitations in\nthe input and the output LJJs. The solutions of the reduced model accurately\ndescribe the four possible energy-conserving scattering processes found in\nsimulations of one-bit gate circuits (with two scattering directions and two\noutput polarities).

The energy distance\nclustering criterion assigns observations to clusters according to a\nmulti-sample energy statistic that measures the distance between distributions.\nThe energy distance determines a consistent test for equality of distributions,\nand it is based on a population distance that characterizes equality of\ndistributions. The k-groups procedure therefore generalizes the k-means method,\nwhich separates clusters that have different means. We propose two k-groups\nalgorithms: k-groups by first variation; and k-groups by second variation. The\nimplementation of k-groups is partly based on Hartigan and Wong's algorithm for\nk-means. The algorithm is generalized from moving one point on each iteration\n(first variation) to moving $m$ $(m > 1)$ points. For univariate data, we prove\nthat Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm is a special case of k-groups by\nfirst variation. The simulation results from univariate and multivariate cases\nshow that our k-groups algorithms perform as well as Hartigan and Wong's\nk-means algorithm when clusters are well-separated and normally distributed.\nMoreover, both k-groups algorithms perform better than k-means when data does\nnot have a finite first moment or data has strong skewness and heavy tails. For\nnon--spherical clusters, both k-groups algorithms performed better than k-means\nin high dimension, and k-groups by first variation is consistent as dimension\nincreases.

These boundary conditions are devised based on the\nproperties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability\nproperty ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the\nenergy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to\nincrease over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very\neffective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems.

To achieve the\ncapacity, the UAV should use a sufficiently long code that spans over its whole\ncommunication period. Accordingly, the multicast channel capacity is achieved\nvia maximizing the minimum achievable time-averaged rates of the $K$ users, by\njointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power allocation over\ntime. However, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally.\nTo tackle this problem, we first consider a relaxed problem by ignoring the\nmaximum UAV speed constraint, and obtain its globally optimal solution via the\nLagrange dual method. The optimal solution reveals that the UAV should hover\nabove a finite number of ground locations, with the optimal hovering duration\nand transmit power at each location. Next, based on such a\nmulti-location-hovering solution, we present a successive hover-and-fly\ntrajectory design and obtain the corresponding optimal transmit power\nallocation for the case with the maximum UAV speed constraint. Numerical\nresults show that our proposed joint UAV trajectory and transmit power\noptimization significantly improves the achievable rate of the UAV-enabled\nmulticast channel, and also greatly outperforms the conventional multicast\nchannel with a fixed-location transmitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 01:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 01:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

This wrap-around\nof the chain is achieved using a coupling procedure, and produces states that\nall have close to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain, under the\nassumption that coupled chains are likely to coalesce in less than N/2\niterations. This procedure therefore automatically eliminates the initial\nportion of the chain that would otherwise need to be discarded to get good\nestimates of equilibrium averages. The assumption of rapid coalescence can be\ntested using auxiliary chains started at times spaced between 0 and N. When\nmultiple processors are available, such auxiliary chains can be simulated in\nparallel, and pieced together to give the circularly-coupled chain, in less\ntime than a sequential simulation would have taken, provided that coalescence\nis indeed rapid.\n  The practical utility of these procedures is dependent on the development of\ngood coupling schemes.

Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent\nserializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the\nchoice from one of them.

In this contribution, an analogue of grad-div\nstabilization for Discontinuous Galerkin methods is studied.

But applying pattern theory to real\nworld images is currently less successful than discriminative methods such as\ndeep networks. Deep networks, however, are black-boxes which are hard to\ninterpret and can easily be fooled by adding occluding objects. It is natural\nto wonder whether by better understanding deep networks we can extract building\nblocks which can be used to develop pattern theoretic models. This motivates us\nto study the internal representations of a deep network using vehicle images\nfrom the PASCAL3D+ dataset. We use clustering algorithms to study the\npopulation activities of the features and extract a set of visual concepts\nwhich we show are visually tight and correspond to semantic parts of vehicles.\nTo analyze this we annotate these vehicles by their semantic parts to create a\nnew dataset, VehicleSemanticParts, and evaluate visual concepts as unsupervised\npart detectors. We show that visual concepts perform fairly well but are\noutperformed by supervised discriminative methods such as Support Vector\nMachines (SVM). We next give a more detailed analysis of visual concepts and\nhow they relate to semantic parts. Following this, we use the visual concepts\nas building blocks for a simple pattern theoretical model, which we call\ncompositional voting. In this model several visual concepts combine to detect\nsemantic parts. We show that this approach is significantly better than\ndiscriminative methods like SVM and deep networks trained specifically for\nsemantic part detection. Finally, we return to studying occlusion by creating\nan annotated dataset with occlusion, called VehicleOcclusion, and show that\ncompositional voting outperforms even deep networks when the amount of\nocclusion becomes large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 07:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

The new\nalgorithm incorporates an intra-loop re-scaling operator ${\\cal R}(H)$, which\nis essential for both convergence and getting self-normalised solutions. The\nmain control parameter is the external-to-core enthalpy ratio. In the case of\nuniform rotation rate and uniform surrounding pressure, we compute the mass,\nthe volume, the rotation rate and the maximum enthalpy. This is repeated for a\nfew polytropic indices $n$. For a given axis ratio, over-pressurization\nglobally increases all output quantities, and this is more pronounced for large\n$n$. Density profiles are flatter than in the absence of an external pressure.\nWhen the control parameter asymptotically tends to unity, the fluid converges\ntoward the incompressible solution, whatever the index, but becomes\ngeometrically singular.

Using this as cue in this present\ncommunication a hypothetical model to study the spread of disease is presented.\nThis model can help the epidemiologists to understand the mechanism of\nmicrobial traffic like for example flu getting transferred within the same\nspecies or cross species ,spatial diffusion like for example human traveling\npattern and newly recognized diseases for example various type of flu and\nvector borne diseases like malaria , dengue etc. This model also covers some\nrelevant scenarios like global climate change, political ecologic emergences of\naerial transmitted diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 10:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

An induced matching $H$ of $G$ is a\nmatching such that no edge of $E$ connects endpoints of two different edges of\n$H$. We show that in a convex bipartite graph with $n$ vertices and $m$\nweighted edges, an induced matching of maximum total weight can be computed in\n$O(n+m)$ time. An unweighted convex bipartite graph has a representation of\nsize $O(n)$ that records for each vertex $u\\in U$ the first and last neighbor\nin the ordering of $V$. Given such a compact representation, we compute an\ninduced matching of maximum cardinality in $O(n)$ time.\n  In convex bipartite graphs, maximum-cardinality induced matchings are dual to\nminimum chain covers. A chain cover is a covering of the edge set by chain\nsubgraphs, that is, subgraphs that do not contain induced matchings of more\nthan one edge. Given a compact representation, we compute a representation of a\nminimum chain cover in $O(n)$ time. If no compact representation is given, the\ncover can be computed in $O(n+m)$ time.\n  All of our algorithms achieve optimal running time for the respective problem\nand model. Previous algorithms considered only the unweighted case, and the\nbest algorithm for computing a maximum-cardinality induced matching or a\nminimum chain cover in a convex bipartite graph had a running time of $O(n^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 10:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The formalism incorporates\nquarkonium production and its subsequent evolution in the fireball including\nquarkonium dissociation and recombination. We consider a fireball with a local\ntemperature that is much smaller than the inverse size of the quarkonium and\nmuch larger than its binding energy. The calculation is performed at an\naccuracy that is leading-order in the heavy-quark density expansion and\nnext-to-leading order in the multipole expansion. Within this accuracy, for a\nsmooth variation of the temperature and large times, the evolution equation can\nbe written as a Lindblad equation.

Such an algorithm\nis essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder surveys, such as the\nMultifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR),\nas data volumes are significant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We\npresent a new strategy of `Faraday Moments' for source-finding in linear\npolarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent\nfull-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess\nkurtosis). Through simulations of the sky, we find that moments can identify\npolarized sources with a high completeness: 98.5% at a signal-to-noise of 5.\nWhile the method has low reliability, Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis can be\napplied per candidate source to filter out instrumental and spurious\ndetections. This combined strategy will result in a complete and reliable\ncatalogue of polarized sources that includes the full sensitivity of the\nobservational bandwidth. We find that the technique can reduce the number of\npixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of\n$\\approx1\\times10^{5}$ for source distributions anticipated with modern radio\ntelescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we find that the technique works\neffectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method are\ndirectly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization\nSky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) with the Australia Square\nKilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and the SKA itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 10:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Scalar fields with millicharges are viable and limits on their masses\nand charges are found to be $q\\lesssim10^{-3}e$ and $m_{\\phi_{\\rm\nEM}}\\lesssim10^{-5} \\rm eV$. Furthermore, it is possible that $U(1)_{\\rm EM}$\nhas already been broken at temperatures higher than $T=2.7K$ given the nonzero\nlimits on the mass of the photon.

Finally,\nthe cosmological fate of the strong interaction is studied. $SU(3)_C$ is tested\nfor complementarity in which the confinement phase of QCD $+$ colored scalars\nis equivalent to a spontaneously broken $SU(3)$ gauge theory. If\ncomplementarity is not applicable, $SU(3)_C$ has multiple symmetry breaking\npaths with various final symmetry structures. The stability of the colored\nvacuum at finite temperature in this scenario is nonperturbative and a\ndefinitive statement on the fate of $SU(3)_C$ is left open.

Our goal is to quantify the contamination of this YSO sample by\nreddened giant stars with circumstellar envelopes and to determine the star\nformation rate in the CMZ. We obtained KMOS low-resolution near-infrared\nspectra (R ~4000) between 2.0 and 2.5 um of sources, many of them previously\nidentified, by mid-infrared photometric criteria, as massive YSOs in the\nGalactic center. Our final sample consists of 91 stars with good\nsignal-to-noise ratio. We separate YSOs from cool late-type stars based on\nspectral features of CO and Br_gamma at 2.3 um and 2.16 um respectively. We\nmake use of SED model fits to the observed photometric data points from 1.25 to\n24 um in order to estimate approximate masses for the YSOs. Using the\nspectroscopically identified YSOs in our sample, we confirm that existing\ncolour-colour diagrams and colour-magnitude diagrams are unable to efficiently\nseparate YSOs and cool late-type stars. In addition, we define a new\ncolour-colour criterion that separates YSOs from cool late-type stars in the\nH-Ks vs H-[8.0] diagram. We use this new criterion to identify YSO candidates\nin the |l| < 1.5, |b|<0.5 degree region and use model SED fits to estimate\ntheir approximate masses. By assuming an appropriate initial mass function\n(IMF) and extrapolating the stellar IMF down to lower masses, we determine a\nstar formation rate (SFR) of ~0.046 +/- 0.026 Msun/yr assuming an average age\nof 0.75 +/- 0.25 Myr for the YSOs. This value is lower than estimates found\nusing the YSO counting method in the literature. Our SFR estimate in the CMZ\nagrees with the previous estimates from different methods and reaffirms that\nstar formation in the CMZ is proceeding at a lower rate than predicted by\nvarious star forming models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 12:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Here we report the discovery\nof the most energetic of these to date: PS1-10adi, with a total radiated energy\nof ~ 2.3 x 10^52 erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently\nnarrow spectral lines over ~3 yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring\nblack hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock\ninteraction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding\ndense matter. Plausible sources of this expanding material are a star that has\nbeen tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could\nsatisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new\nand hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova\norigin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear\nlocation.

In\norder to quantify how severe these limitations are when modeling GIs we carried\nout a comparison of simulations with identical initial conditions performed\nwith the standard SPH as well as with the novel Lagrangian Meshless Finite Mass\n(MFM) method in the GIZMO code. We confirm the lack of mixing between the\nimpactor and target when SPH is employed, while MFM is capable of driving\nvigorous sub-sonic turbulence and leads to significant mixing between the two\nbodies. Modern SPH variants with artificial conductivity, a different\nformulation of the hydro force or reduced artificial viscosity, do not improve\nmixing as significantly. Angular momentum is conserved similarly well in both\nmethods, but MFM does not suffer from spurious transport induced by artificial\nviscosity, resulting in a slightly higher angular momentum of the proto-lunar\ndisk.

However, while they have had great success with time series\ndata [1], [2], many time series have a multiscale structure, which a\nsingle-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we\npropose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo\nState Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its\nability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections.\nSpecifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional\necho-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA,\nautoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations\ninto a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then\nbe processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers\nalternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate\nthe effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage\nof the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time\nseries. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we\nadd connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical\nanalyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state\nproperty (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN.\nExperimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate\nthat Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard\nESNs and previous hierarchical ESN-based models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 13:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

For such HMMs, the marginal\ndistribution at any time position follows a Gaussian mixture distribution, a\nfact exploited to softly match, aka register, the states in two HMMs. We refer\nto such HMMs as Gaussian mixture model-HMM (GMM-HMM). The registration of\nstates is inspired by the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the\nWasserstein metric between distributions. Specifically, the components of the\nmarginal GMMs are matched by solving an optimal transport problem where the\ncost between components is the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions.\nThe solution of the optimization problem is a fast approximation to the\nWasserstein metric between two GMMs. The new Aggregated Wasserstein distance is\na semi-metric and can be computed without generating Monte Carlo samples. It is\ninvariant to relabeling or permutation of states. The distance is defined\nmeaningfully even for two HMMs that are estimated from data of different\ndimensionality, a situation that can arise due to missing variables. This\ndistance quantifies the dissimilarity of GMM-HMMs by measuring both the\ndifference between the two marginal GMMs and that between the two transition\nmatrices. Our new distance is tested on tasks of retrieval, classification, and\nt-SNE visualization of time series. Experiments on both synthetic and real data\nhave demonstrated its advantages in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency in\ncomparison with existing distances based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2017 22:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 20:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}
