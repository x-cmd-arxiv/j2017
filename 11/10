In particular, the maximum stable time-step scales inversely\nwith the highest degree in the DG polynomial approximation space and becomes\nprogressively smaller with each added spatial dimension. In this work we\nintroduce a novel approach that we have dubbed the regionally implicit\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (RIDG) method to overcome these small time-step\nrestrictions. The RIDG method is based on an extension of the Lax-Wendroff DG\n(LxW-DG) method, which previously had been shown to be equivalent to a\npredictor-corrector approach, where the predictor is a locally implicit\nspacetime method (i.e., the predictor is something like a block-Jacobi update\nfor a fully implicit spacetime DG method). The corrector is an explicit method\nthat uses the spacetime reconstructed solution from the predictor step. In this\nwork we modify the predictor to include not just local information, but also\nneighboring information. With this modification we show that the stability is\ngreatly enhanced; in particular, we show that we are able to remove the\npolynomial degree dependence of the maximum time-step and show how this extends\nto multiple spatial dimensions.

In the past, mechanisms for the formation of different organic\nmolecules were studied, providing only in a few cases energetic conditions\nfavorable to a synthesis at very low temperature.

Refraction thus provides an avenue to probe physical\nproperties of exoplanet atmospheres and to constrain the presence of clouds and\nhazes. In addition, an effective surface can be imposed by refraction, thereby\nlimiting the pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy. The main\nobjective of the paper is to model the effects of refraction on photometric\nlight curves for realistic planets and to explore the dependencies on\natmospheric physical parameters. We also explore under which circumstances\ntransmission spectra are significantly affected by refraction. Finally, we\nsearch for refraction signatures in photometric residuals in Kepler data. We\nuse the model of Hui & Seager (2002) to compute deflection angles and\nrefraction transit light curves, allowing us to explore the parameter space of\natmospheric properties.

This\nconstraint may be interpreted in terms of the distance between to vertices and\nso a more general coloring concept can be defined: The strong coloring of a\ngraph. So a k-strong coloring is a coloring where two vertices may not have the\nsame color if their distance to each other is at most k. The 2-strong coloring\nof the line graph is known as the strong edge coloring. Coloring the kth power\nG^k of a graph G is the same as finding a k-strong coloring of G itself. In\norder to obtain a graph class on which the 2-strong coloring becomes\nefficiently solvable we are looking for a structure that produces induced\ncycles in the square of G, so that by excluding this structure we obtain a\ngraph class with chordal squares, where a chordal graph is a graph without any\ninduced cycles of length at least 4. Such a structure is called a flower.\nAnother structure will be found and explained, which is responsible for flowers\nto appear in the line graph of G: The sprouts. With this graphs with chordal\nline graph squares are described as well. Some attempts in generalizing those\nstructures to obtain perfect graph squares are being made and the general\nconcept of chordal graph powers, i.e. the existence of a smallest power for\nwhich a graph becomes chordal, the power of chordality is introduced in order\nto solve some coloring related NP-hard problems on graphs with parameterized\nalgorithms. Some connections to the famous parameter treewidth arise alongside\nwith some deeper connections between edge and vertex coloring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 16:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals exemplify a diverse family of\nmaterials that permit ions to reversibly associate with a host atomic lattice\nby intercalation into interlamellar gaps. Motivated principally by the search\nfor high-capacity battery anodes, ion intercalation in composite materials is a\nsubject of intense study.

An approach is presented to find the global solution of the\ntransmission planning problem using an AC network model. The approach builds on\nthe semidefinite relaxation of the AC optimal power flow problem (ACOPF); its\ncomputational engine is a new specialized branch-and-cut algorithm for\ntransmission expansion planning to deal with the underlying mixed-integer ACOPF\nproblem. Valid inequalities that are based on specific knowledge of the\nexpansion problem are employed to improve the solution quality at any node of\nthe search tree, and thus significantly reduce the overall computational effort\nof the branch-and-bound algorithm. Additionally, sparsity of the semidefinite\nrelaxation is exploited to further reduce the computation time at each node of\nthe branch-and-cut tree.

Numerous methods have been developed to calculate how the energy and\nthe effective mass of the polaron are renormalized by the medium for\nequilibrium situations. Here we address the much less studied non-equilibrium\nregime and investigate how polarons form dynamically in time. To this end, we\ndevelop a time-dependent renormalization group approach which allows\ncalculations of all dynamical properties of the system and takes into account\nthe effects of quantum fluctuations in the polaron cloud. We apply this method\nto calculate trajectories of polarons following a sudden quench of the\nimpurity-boson interaction strength, revealing how the polaronic cloud around\nthe impurity forms in time. Such trajectories provide additional information\nabout the polaron's properties which are challenging to extract directly from\nthe spectral function measured experimentally using ultracold atoms. At strong\ncouplings, our calculations predict the appearance of trajectories where the\nimpurity wavers back at intermediate times as a result of quantum fluctuations.\nOur method is applicable to a broader class of non-equilibrium problems. We\nalso apply it to calculate the spectral function and find good agreement with\nexperimental results. At very strong couplings, we predict that quantum\nfluctuations lead to the appearance of a dark continuum with strongly\nsuppressed spectral weight at low energies. While our calculations start from\nan effective Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian describing impurities in a\nthree-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, we also calculate the effects of\nadditional terms in the Hamiltonian beyond the Fr\\\"ohlich paradigm. We\ndemonstrate that the main effect of these additional terms on the attractive\nside of a Feshbach resonance is to renormalize the coupling strength of the\neffective Fr\\\"ohlich model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 17:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 00:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Furthermore, network\ninfrastructure densification has been considered as one of the most substantial\nmethods to increase system performance, taking advantage of base station\nproximity and spatial reuse of system resources. However, could we improve\nsystem performance by leveraging both of these two 5G enabling technologies\ntogether in a multi-cell environment? How does spectrum sharing affect\nperformance enhancement? This article investigates the implications of\ninterference, densification and spectrum sharing in D2D performance gain. The\nin-band D2D approach, where legacy users coexist with potential D2D pairs, is\nconsidered in a multi-cell system. Overlay and underlay spectrum sharing\napproaches are employed in order for the potential D2D pairs to access the\nspectrum. Given that two of the most critical problems in the D2D concept are\nmode selection and user scheduling, we jointly address them, aiming at\nmaximizing the total system uplink throughput. Thus, we present a radio\nresource management mechanism for intra-cell and cross-cell overlay/underlay\nD2D communications enabled in a multi-cell system. System-level simulations are\nexecuted to evaluate the system performance and examine the trends of D2D\ncommunication gain for the different spectrum sharing approaches and various\ndensification scenarios.

The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the\nsub-millimeter continuum with ALMA.

Evidence suggests that mobile applications are not thoroughly\ntested as their desktop counterparts. In particular GUI testing is generally\nlimited. Like web-based applications, mobile apps suffer from GUI test\nfragility, i.e. GUI test classes failing due to minor modifications in the GUI,\nwithout the application functionalities being altered.\n  Aims. The objective of our study is to examine the diffusion of GUI testing\non Android, and the amount of changes required to keep test classes up to date,\nand in particular the changes due to GUI test fragility. We define metrics to\ncharacterize the modifications and evolution of test classes and test methods,\nand proxies to estimate fragility-induced changes.\n  Method. To perform our experiments, we selected six widely used open-source\ntools for scripted GUI testing of mobile applications previously described in\nthe literature. We have mined the repositories on GitHub that used those tools,\nand computed our set of metrics.\n  Results. We found that none of the considered GUI testing frameworks achieved\na major diffusion among the open-source Android projects available on GitHub.\nFor projects with GUI tests, we found that test suites have to be modified\noften, specifically 5\\%-10\\% of developers' modified LOCs belong to tests, and\nthat a relevant portion (60\\% on average) of such modifications are induced by\nfragility.\n  Conclusions. Fragility of GUI test classes constitute a relevant concern,\npossibly being an obstacle for developers to adopt automated scripted GUI\ntests. This first evaluation and measure of fragility of Android scripted GUI\ntesting can constitute a benchmark for developers, and the basis for the\ndefinition of a taxonomy of fragility causes, and actionable guidelines to\nmitigate the issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 19:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

The goal of this paper is to\nintroduce a new form of indirect effect, the population intervention indirect\neffect (PIIE), that can be nonparametrically identified in the presence of an\nunmeasured common cause of exposure and outcome. This new type of indirect\neffect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an\nintermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of\nexposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The PIIE is in\nfact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced\nby Hubbard and Van der Laan (2008).

Evaluating our method using a set of both pure and stateful\nbenchmarks, we are able to verify 99.94% of checks statically (all but 28 of\n49, 861).\n  Stateful, higher-order functions pose significant challenges for static\ncontract verification in particular.

In contrast to the dynamics of a typical illicit drug or\ndisease epidemic, opioid addiction has its roots in legal, prescription\nmedication - a fact which greatly increases the exposed population and provides\nadditional drug accessibility for addicts. In this paper, we present a\nmathematical model for prescription drug addiction and treatment with\nparameters and validation based on data from the opioid epidemic. Key dynamics\nconsidered include addiction through prescription, addiction from illicit\nsources, and treatment. Through mathematical analysis, we show that no\naddiction-free equilibrium can exist without stringent control over how opioids\nare administered and prescribed, effectively transforming the dynamics of the\nopioid epidemic into those found in a purely illicit drug model. Numerical\nsensitivity analysis suggests that relatively low states of endemic addiction\ncan be obtained by primarily focusing on medical prevention followed by\naggressive treatment of remaining cases - even when the probability of relapse\nfrom treatment remains high.

Most works focus on alleviating heavy burden\nof macro base stations by moving the computation tasks on macro-cell user\nequipment (MUE) to remote cloud or small-cell base stations. But the\nselfishness of network users is seldom considered. Motivated by the cloud edge\ncomputing, this paper provides incentive for task transfer from macro cell\nusers to small cell base stations. The proposed incentive scheme utilizes small\ncell user equipment to provide relay service. The problem of computation\noffloading is modelled as a two-stage auction, in which the remote MUEs with\ncommon social character can form a group and then buy the computation resource\nof small-cell base stations with the relay of small cell user equipment. A\ntwo-stage auction scheme named TARCO is contributed to maximize utilities for\nboth sellers and buyers in the network.

In contrast to\ntraditional fully supervised learning approaches, in this paper we propose\nlearning intrinsic image decomposition by explaining the input image. Our\nmodel, the Rendered Intrinsics Network (RIN), joins together an image\ndecomposition pipeline, which predicts reflectance, shape, and lighting\nconditions given a single image, with a recombination function, a learned\nshading model used to recompose the original input based off of intrinsic image\npredictions. Our network can then use unsupervised reconstruction error as an\nadditional signal to improve its intermediate representations. This allows\nlarge-scale unlabeled data to be useful during training, and also enables\ntransferring learned knowledge to images of unseen object categories, lighting\nconditions, and shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nperforms well on both intrinsic image decomposition and knowledge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 03:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 22:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

In\nother words, should the systems community continue working on this problem?\nCurrently, there is no principled answer to this question. In practice, object\nsizes often vary by several orders of magnitude, where computing the optimal\nmiss ratio (OPT) is known to be NP-hard. The few known results on caching with\nvariable object sizes provide very weak bounds and are impractical to compute\non traces of realistic length.\n  We propose a new method to compute upper and lower bounds on OPT. Our key\ninsight is to represent caching as a min-cost flow problem, hence we call our\nmethod the flow-based offline optimal (FOO). We prove that, under simple\nindependence assumptions, FOO's bounds become tight as the number of objects\ngoes to infinity. Indeed, FOO's error over 10M requests of production CDN and\nstorage traces is negligible: at most 0.3%. FOO thus reveals, for the first\ntime, the limits of caching with variable object sizes. While FOO is very\naccurate, it is computationally impractical on traces with hundreds of millions\nof requests. We therefore extend FOO to obtain more efficient bounds on OPT,\nwhich we call practical flow-based offline optimal (PFOO). We evaluate PFOO on\nseveral full production traces and use it to compare OPT to prior online\npolicies. This analysis shows that current caching systems are in fact still\nfar from optimal, suffering 11-43% more cache misses than OPT, whereas the best\nprior offline bounds suggest that there is essentially no room for improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 06:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 20:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-09"}

Although\nthese disordered systems form stable structures if unperturbed, in practice\nthey do relax because of the presence of unavoidable external influences such\nas tapping or shear. Often it is tacitly assumed that for granular systems this\nrelaxation dynamics is similar to the one of thermal glass-formers, but in fact\nexperimental difficulties have so far prevented to determine the dynamic\nproperties of three dimensional granular systems on the particle level. This\nlack of experimental data, combined with the fact that in these systems the\nmotion of the particles involves friction, makes it very challenging to come up\nwith an accurate description of their relaxation dynamics. Here we use X-ray\ntomography to determine the microscopic relaxation dynamics of hard granular\nellipsoids that are subject to an oscillatory shear. We find that the\ndistribution function of the particle displacement can be described by a Gumbel\nlaw with a shape parameter that is independent of time and the strain amplitude\n$\\gamma$. Despite this universality, the mean squared displacement of a tagged\nparticle shows power-laws as a function of time with an exponent that depends\non $\\gamma$ and the time interval considered. We argue that these results are\ndirectly related to the existence of the microscopic relaxation mechanisms that\ninvolve friction and memory effects. These observations demonstrate that on the\nparticle level the dynamical behavior of granular systems is qualitatively\ndifferent from the one of thermal glass-formers and instead more similar to the\none of complex fluids. Thus we conclude that granular materials can relax even\nwhen the driving is weak, an insight which impacts our understanding of the\nnature of granular solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 08:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

In light of recent interest, we apply the\ntheoretical tools of the framework to a qubit coupled with many bosonic\nsub-environments.

Explicitly, the decoherence system can be modeled by that a\ntripartite Werner-type state suffers from the non-Markovian regimes and one\nsubsystem of the tripartite is under a non-inertial frame. The conditions for\nsteerable and nonlocal states can be obtained with respect to the tripartite\nWerner-type state established initially.

Besides, all achievable GMN's states are steerable, while not every\nsteerable state (GMS's state) can achieve nonlocality. It means that the\nsteering-nonlocality hierarchy is still tenable and GMN's states are a strict\nsubset of the GMS's states in such a scenario.

To capture the\nextreme dependence among obligors, we provide an efficient simulation method\nfor multi-factor models with a normal mixture copula that allows the\nmultivariate defaults to have an asymmetric distribution, while most of the\nliterature focuses on simulating one-dimensional cases. To this end, we first\npropose a general account of an importance sampling algorithm based on an\nunconventional exponential embedding, which is related to the classical\nsufficient statistic.

Period variations have been detected in a number of eclipsing close\ncompact binary subdwarf B stars (sdBs) and these have often been interpreted as\ncaused by circumbinary massive planets or brown dwarfs.

We\ncombined our new data with previously published measurements to analyse the\nETVs of these systems. Results. Our data shows that period variations cannot be\nmodelled simply on the basis of circumbinary objects. This implies that more\ncomplex processes may be taking place in these systems.

We find\nagreement with other observers that at least a decade of observations is\nrequired to establish reliable ephemeris.

Although temperature is an old and\nwell-established notion, it still presents controversial facets. After a short\nhistorical survey of the key role of temperature in thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics, we tackle a series of issues which have been recently\nreconsidered. In particular, we discuss different definitions and their\nrelevance for energy fluctuations. The interest in such a topic has been\ntriggered by the recent observation of negative temperatures in condensed\nmatter experiments. Moreover, the ability to manipulate systems at the micro\nand nano-scale urges to understand and clarify some aspects related to the\nstatistical properties of small systems (as the issue of temperature's\n\"fluctuations\"). We also discuss the notion of temperature in a dynamical\ncontext, within the theory of linear response for Hamiltonian systems at\nequilibrium and stochastic models with detailed balance, and the generalised\nfluctuation-response relations, which provide a hint for an extension of the\ndefinition of temperature in far-from-equilibrium systems. To conclude we\nconsider non-Hamiltonian systems, such as granular materials, turbulence and\nactive matter, where a general theoretical framework is still lacking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 11:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

However, it is not always true that edge computing consumes less\npower compared to device computing. It may take more power for the mobile\ndevice to transmit a file to the cloud than running the task itself. This paper\ninvestigates the power minimization problem for the mobile devices by data\noffloading in multi-cell multi-user OFDMA mobile edge computing networks.

To solve the converted\noptimization problem, we have proposed centralized and distributed algorithms\nfor joint power allocation and channel assignment together with\ndecision-making.

In such synthetic ribbon configurations, manipulation of the\ntransitions between the hyperfine levels provide direct control of the hopping\nin the synthetic dimension. This effect was used to simulate a magnetic field\nthrough the ribbon. Precise control over the hopping matrix elements in the\nsynthetic dimension makes it possible to change this artificial magnetic field\nmuch faster than the time scales associated with atomic motion in the lattice.\nIn this paper, we consider such a magnetic flux quench scenario in synthetic\ndimensions. Sudden changes have not been considered for real magnetic fields as\nsuch changes in a conducting system would result in large induced currents.\nHence, we first study the difference between a time varying real magnetic field\nand an artificial magnetic field using a minimal six site model. This minimal\nmodel clearly shows the connection between gauge dependence and the lack of on\nsite induced scalar potential terms. We then investigate the dynamics of a\nwavepacket in an infinite two or three leg ladder following a flux quench and\nfind that the gauge choice has a dramatic effect on the packet dynamics.\nSpecifically, a wavepacket splits into a number of smaller packets. Both the\nweights and the number of packets depend on the implemented gauge. If an\ninitial packet, prepared under zero flux in a n--leg ladder, is quenched to\nHamiltonian with a vector potential parallel to the ladder; it splits into at\nmost $n$ smaller wavepackets. The same initial packet splits up to $n^2$\npackets if the vector potential is implemented to be along the rungs. Finally,\nwe show that edge states in a thick ribbon are robust under the quench only\nwhen the same gap supports an edge state for the final Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 11:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 19:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

A\ncluster analysis reveals the presence of two distinct groups. `Fast' SLSNe show\nfast light curves and color evolution, large velocities, and a large velocity\ngradient. `Slow' SLSNe show slow light curve and color evolution, small\nexpansion velocities, and an almost non-existent velocity gradient.

The theory\ndeveloped here shows that if the absorption is large enough, and if the\nsubdomain and coarse mesh diameters and overlap are chosen appropriately, then\nthe classical two-level overlapping Additive Schwarz preconditioner (with PEC\nboundary conditions on the subdomains) performs optimally -- in the sense that\nGMRES converges in a wavenumber-independent number of iterations -- for the\nproblem with absorption. An important feature of the theory is that it allows\nthe coarse space to be built from low-order elements even if the PDE is\ndiscretised using high-order elements. It also shows that additive methods with\nminimal overlap can be robust. Numerical experiments are given that illustrate\nthe theory and its dependence on various parameters.

These include extremely\nlong coherence times, high-fidelity quantum operation, and the ability to\nshuttle electrons as a mechanism for on-chip flying qubits. In order to\nincrease the number of qubits to the thousands or millions of qubits needed for\npractical quantum information we present an architecture based on shared\ncontrol and a scalable number of lines. Crucially, the control lines define the\nqubit grid, such that no local components are required. Our design enables\nqubit coupling beyond nearest neighbors, providing prospects for non-planar\nquantum error correction protocols. Fabrication is based on a three-layer\ndesign to define qubit and tunnel barrier gates. We show that a double\nstripline on top of the structure can drive high-fidelity single-qubit\nrotations. Qubit addressability and readout are enabled by self-aligned\ninhomogeneous magnetic fields induced by direct currents through\nsuperconducting gates. Qubit coupling is based on the exchange interaction, and\nwe show that parallel two-qubit gates can be performed at the detuning noise\ninsensitive point. While the architecture requires a high level of uniformity\nin the materials and critical dimensions to enable shared control, it stands\nout for its simplicity and provides prospects for large-scale quantum\ncomputation in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 13:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In empirically measured networks, most connections are\nshort, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small\nnumber of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the\nfunctionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise\nfunction of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading\nhypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain\nareas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this\nhypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we\ncontend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve\nto diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex\ndynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that\nlong-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal\ntopological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range\nneighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting\nthat long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs\nand outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance\nconnectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that\nthe communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that\nmay serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of\nWilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity\nand show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of\nfunctional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that\nlong-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex\nbrain dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 13:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Spatial Fourier\nrepresentations are almost universal in local gyrokinetic codes, and the\nwavevector-remap method was introduced in [Hammett et. al., Bull Am Phys Soc\nVP1 136, (2006)] as a simple method for expressing the local gyrokinetic\nequations with a background shear flow in a Fourier representation.

Due to a\nlimited 180 KHz bandwidth used in NB-IoT, the time-domain auto-correlation\nfunction (ACF) of transmitted NB positioning reference signal (NPRS) has a wide\nmain lobe. Without considering that, the performance of ToA estimation can be\ndegraded for two reasons. Firstly, under multiple-path channel environments,\nthe NPRS corresponding to different received paths are superimposed on each\nother, and so are the cross-correlations corresponding to them. Secondly, the\nmeasured peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) used for detecting the presence of\nNPRS is inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we propose a space-alternating\ngeneralized expectation-maximization (SAGE) based method to jointly estimate\nthe number of channel taps, the channel coefficients and the corresponding\ndelays in NB-IoT systems, with considering the imperfect ACF of NPRS. Such a\nproposed method only uses the time-domain cross-correlations between the\nreceived signal and the transmitted NPRS, and has a low complexity. We show\nthrough simulations that, the ToA estimation of the proposed method performs\nclose to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for a single-path channel, and\nsignificantly outperforms a traditional ToA estimator that uses signal-to-noise\n(SNR) or power thresholds based estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 14:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

Our main result is to dervie a lower bound for the\nprobability of the system to remain in the basin, given that perturbations are\nrare enough.

This is the time after which a perturbed state has probably\nreturned close to the attractor, meaning that subsequent perturbations can be\nconsidered separately. The effect of jump-like perturbations that occur at\nleast the independence time apart is thus well described by a fixed probability\nto exit the basin at each jump, allowing us to obtain the bound.\n  To determine the independence time, we introduce the concept of finite-time\nbasin stability, which corresponds to the probability that a perturbed\ntrajectory returns to an attractor within a given time. The independence time\ncan then be determined as the time scale at which the finite-time basin\nstability reaches its asymptotic value.

As their evaluation is\nexpensive and very often dominated by the output size, it is an important task\nfor database query optimisers to compute estimates on the size of joins and to\nfind good execution plans for sequences of joins. We study these problems from\na theoretical perspective, both in the worst-case model, and in an average-case\nmodel where the database is chosen according to a known probability\ndistribution. In the former case, our first key observation is that the\nworst-case size of a query is characterised by the fractional edge cover number\nof its underlying hypergraph, a combinatorial parameter previously known to\nprovide an upper bound. We complete the picture by proving a matching lower\nbound, and by showing that there exist queries for which the join-project plan\nsuggested by the fractional edge cover approach may be substantially better\nthan any join plan that does not use intermediate projections. On the other\nhand, we show that in the average-case model, every join-project plan can be\nturned into a plan containing no projections in such a way that the expected\ntime to evaluate the plan increases only by a constant factor independent of\nthe size of the database. Not surprisingly, the key combinatorial parameter in\nthis context is the maximum density of the underlying hypergraph. We show how\nto make effective use of this parameter to eliminate the projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 15:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

The control action is located\nat the other end of the pipe. The feedback law is a classical Neumann velocity\nfeedback with a feedback parameter $k>0$.\n  We show that as long as the $H^1$-norm of the function that describes the\nnoise in the customer's behavior decays exponentially with a rate that is\nsufficiently large, the velocity of the gas can be stabilized exponentially\nfast in the sense that a suitably chosen Lyapunov function decays\nexponentially.

Accurate predictions of energetic and\nspectroscopic properties require a delicate balance between describing the most\nimportant configurations (static correlation) and obtaining dynamical\ncorrelation efficiently. The former is most naturally done through a\nmulticonfigurational (MC) wave function, whereas the latter can be done by,\ne.g., perturbation theory. We have employed a different strategy, namely, a\nhybrid between multiconfigurational wave functions and density-functional\ntheory (DFT) based on range separation. The method is denoted by MC short-range\n(sr) DFT and is more efficient than perturbative approaches as it capitalizes\non the efficient treatment of the (short-range) dynamical correlation by DFT\napproximations. In turn, the method also improves DFT with standard\napproximations through the ability of multiconfigurational wave functions to\nrecover large parts of the static correlation. Until now, our implementation\nwas restricted to closed-shell systems, and to lift this restriction, we\npresent here the generalization of MC-srDFT to open-shell cases. The additional\nterms required to treat open-shell systems are derived and implemented in the\nDALTON program.

We then consider a simple continuous dynamical system, the 'Active\nOscillator', which illustrates this principle in another fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 04:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

In the Li network model, with the increase\nof its spacial exponent, the network's structure will vary from the random type\nto the small-world one, and finally to the regular lattice.We first explore how\nthe spacial exponent influences the synchronizability of Kuramoto oscillators\non single layer Li networks and find that the closer the Li network is to a\nregular lattice, the more difficult for it to evolve into synchronization. Then\nwe investigate synchronizability of duplex Li networks and find that the\nexistence of inter-layer interaction can greatly enhance inter-layer and global\nsynchronizability. When the inter-layer coupling strength is larger than a\ncertain critical value, whatever the intra-layer coupling strength is, the\ninter-layer synchronization will always occur. Furthermore, on single layer Li\nnetworks, nodes with larger degrees more easily reach global synchronization,\nwhile on duplex Li networks, this phenomenon becomes much less obvious.\nFinally, we study the impact of inter-link density on global synchronization\nand obtain that sparse inter-links can lead to the emergence of global\nsynchronization for duplex Li networks just as dense inter-links do. In a word,\ninter-layer interaction plays a vital role in determining synchronizability for\nduplex spacial networks with total cost constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 01:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The\nunusual phase transition, characterized by jumps in both the bulk density and\nthe current (in the thermodynamic limit), as $\\alpha$ crosses the boundary\n$\\alpha =p$ from the MP to the CF phase, is explained by the finite-size\nbehavior of P(1). By using a random walk theory, we find that, when $\\alpha$\napproaches from below the boundary $\\alpha =p$, three different regimes appear,\nas the size $L\\rightarrow \\infty$: (i) the lifetime of the gap between the\nrightmost clusters is of the order $O(L)$ in the MP phase; (ii) small jams,\nseparated by gaps with lifetime $O(1)$, exist in the MP+CF phase close to the\nleft chain boundary; and (iii) when $\\beta =p$, the jams are divided by gaps\nwith lifetime of the order $O(L^{1/2})$.
