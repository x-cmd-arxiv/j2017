For linearly polarized excitation, we\ndemonstrate that the question whether the constituents of the initial\nsuperpositions are dipole coupled or not, strongly influences the dynamics.

A dataset is imbalanced when one class (the majority\nclass) has significantly more samples than the other class (the minority\nclass). Such datasets cause typical machine learning algorithms to perform\npoorly on the classification task. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes\na new approach Neighbors Progressive Competition (NPC) for classification of\nimbalanced datasets. Whilst the proposed algorithm is inspired by weighted\nk-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, it has major differences from them.\nUnlike k- NN, NPC does not limit its decision criteria to a preset number of\nnearest neighbors. In contrast, NPC considers progressively more neighbors of\nthe query sample in its decision making until the sum of grades for one class\nis much higher than the other classes. Furthermore, NPC uses a novel method for\ngrading the training samples to compensate for the imbalance issue. The grades\nare calculated using both local and global information. In brief, the\ncontribution of this paper is an entirely new classifier for handling the\nimbalance issue effectively without any manually-set parameters or any need for\nexpert knowledge. Experimental results compare the proposed approach with five\nrepresentative algorithms applied to fifteen imbalanced datasets and illustrate\nthis algorithms effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis.

Prior BA\nschemes typically considered deterministic channels, where the instantaneous\nchannel coefficients are assumed to stay constant for a long time.

In fact, the standard SHP,\nwhere the DM particle, $S$, only has renormalizable interactions with the\nHiggs, is non-operational due to strong constraints, specially from DM direct\ndetection limits. Thus we consider a most economical extension, called ESHP\n(for extended SHP), which simply consists in the addition of a second (heavier)\nscalar singlet in the dark sector. The second scalar can be integrated-out,\nleaving a standard SHP plus a dimension-6 operator.

We estimate the value ranges of plasma beta in\ndifferent regions within the solar atmosphere and we describe a possible\nmechanism that helps forming a penumbra. For that we evaluate data from a 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona above a magnetically active\nregion. We compare our results with previously established data that is based\non magnetic field extrapolations and that was matched for some observations.\nOur model data suggest that plasma beta in the photosphere should be considered\nto be larger than unity outside of sunspots. However, in the corona we also\nfind that the beta value range reaches lower than previously thought, which\ncoincides with a recent observation. We present an idea based on a\ngravity-driven process in a high-beta regime that might be responsible for the\nformation of the penumbra around sunspot umbra, where the vertical field\nstrength reaches a given threshold. This process would also explain\ncounter-Evershed flows.

Currently, max-pooling is one of the most commonly used operators\nin the computational literature.

Pooling\nmechanisms are also present in the primate visual cortex where neurons of\nhigher cortical areas pool signals from lower ones. The receptive fields of\nthese neurons have been shown to vary according to the contrast by aggregating\nsignals over a larger region in the presence of low contrast stimuli. We\nhypothesise that this contrast-variant-pooling mechanism can address some of\nthe shortcomings of max-pooling. We modelled this contrast variation through a\nhistogram clipping in which the percentage of pooled signal is inversely\nproportional to the local contrast of an image.

In the present paper a model for droplets with a third\namphiphilic component is adopted. The dynamics is described by Navier-Stokes\nand convection-diffusion equations, solved by lattice Boltzmann method coupled\nwith finite-difference schemes. We focus on two cases. First the study of\nself-propulsion of an isolated droplet is carried on and, then, the interaction\nof two self-propelled droplets is investigated. In both cases, when the\nsurfactant migrates towards the interface, a quadrupolar vortex of the velocity\nfield forms inside the droplet and causes the motion. A weaker dipolar field\nemerges instead when the surfactant is mainly diluted in the bulk. The dynamics\nof two interacting droplets is more complex and strongly depends on their\nreciprocal distance. If, in a head-on collision, droplets are close enough, the\nvelocity field initially attracts them until a motionless steady state is\nachieved. If the droplets are vertically shifted, the hydrodynamic field leads\nto an initial reciprocal attraction followed by a scattering along opposite\ndirections. This hydrodynamic interaction acts on a separation of some droplet\nradii otherwise it becomes negligible and droplets motion is only driven by\nMarangoni effect. Finally, if one of the droplets is passive, this latter is\ngenerally advected by the fluid flow generated by the active one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 18:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

One factor that\ncan contribute to the attrition is the lack of visible role models for women in\nacademia. At early career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play\na formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping women's\nimpressions of whether or not they can be successful in academia. One common\nand formative setting to observe role models is the local departmental academic\nseminar, talk, or presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through\nthe question-asking behaviour of academics at seminars using observations and\nan online survey. From the survey responses of over 600 academics in 20\ncountries, we found that women reported asking fewer questions after seminars\ncompared to men. This impression was supported by observational data from\nalmost 250 seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely\nand proportionally fewer questions than male audience members. When asked why\nthey did not ask questions when they wanted to, women, more than men, endorsed\ninternal factors (e.g., not working up the nerve). However, our observations\nsuggest that structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the\nfirst to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women asked\nproportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the latter effect by\nmanipulating the time for questions (in an effort to provoke more questions) in\ntwo departments were unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for\ncreating an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask\nquestions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members of other less\nvisible groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 18:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 20:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

We study the physical implications of the DAMPE data in this work.\nThe presence of the spectral break significantly tightens the constraints on\nthe model parameters to explain the electron/positron excesses.

The model explains the neural mechanisms underlying\nthe generation of the POR and quantitatively accounts for the relation between\nits peak latency and the perceived pitch.\n  Next, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the POR as elicited\nby six consonant and dissonant dyads. The peak latency of the POR was strongly\nmodulated by the degree of consonance within the stimuli; specifically, the\nmost dissonant dyad exhibited a POR with a latency that was about 30ms longer\nthan that of the most consonant dyad, an effect that greatly exceeds the\nexpected latency difference induced by a single pitch sound.\n  Our model was able to predict the POR latency pattern observed in the\nneuromagnetic data, and to generalize this prediction to additional dyads.\nThese results indicate that the neural mechanisms responsible for pitch\nprocessing exhibit an intrinsic differential response to concurrent consonant\nand dissonant pitch combinations, suggesting that the perception of consonance\nand dissonance might be an emergent property of the pitch processing system in\nhuman auditory cortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 18:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

In this paper, we present a scalable data-driven framework to\nanalyze EMR data corpus in a disease agnostic way that systematically uncovers\nimportant factors influencing outcomes in patients, as supported by data and\nwithout expert guidance.

We compute Bayesian evidences and Bayes Factors for a set of\nvariations of the classical radial models by King (1962), Elson et al. (1987)\nand Lauer et al. (1995). The variations incorporate different degrees of model\nfreedom and complexity, amongst which we include biaxial (elliptical) symmetry,\nand luminosity segregation. As a by-product of the model comparison, we obtain\nposterior distributions and maximum a posteriori estimates for each set of\nmodel parameters. Results. We find that the model comparison results depend on\nthe spatial extent of the region used for the analysis. For a circle of 11.5\nparsecs around the cluster centre (the most homogeneous and complete region),\nwe find no compelling reason to abandon Kings model, although the Generalised\nKing model, introduced in this work, has slightly better fitting properties.\nFurthermore, we find strong evidence against radially symmetric models when\ncompared to the elliptic extensions. Finally, we find that including mass\nsegregation in the form of luminosity segregation in the J band, is strongly\nsupported in all our models. Conclusions. We have put the question of the\nprojected spatial distribution of the Pleiades cluster on a solid probabilistic\nframework, and inferred its properties using the most exhaustive and least\ncontaminated list of Pleiades candidate members available to date. Our results\nsuggest however that this sample may still lack about 20% of the expected\nnumber of cluster members. Therefore, this study should be revised when the\ncompleteness and homogeneity of the data can be extended beyond the 11.5\nparsecs limit.

Lesions of interest were identified by\nradiologists. The task was to automatically determine whether the tumor is of\nthe Luminal A subtype or of another subtype based on the MR image patches\nrepresenting the tumor. Three different deep learning approaches were used to\nclassify the tumor according to their molecular subtypes: learning from scratch\nwhere only tumor patches were used for training, transfer learning where\nnetworks pre-trained on natural images were fine-tuned using tumor patches, and\noff-the-shelf deep features where the features extracted by neural networks\ntrained on natural images were used for classification with a support vector\nmachine.

Since space charge (SC) changes coherent spectra, it affects the\nTMCI threshold. Generally, there are only two types of TMCI with respect to SC:\nthe vanishing type and the strong space charge (SSC) type. For the former, the\nthreshold value of the wake tune shift is asymptotically proportional to the SC\ntune shift, as it was first observed twenty years ago by M. Blaskiewicz for\nexponential wakes. For the latter, the threshold value of the wake tune shift\nis asymptotically inversely proportional to the SC, as it was shown by one of\nthe authors. In the presented studies of various wakes, potential wells, and\nbunch distributions, the second type of instability was always observed for\ncosine wakes; it was also seen for the sine wakes in the case of a bunch within\na square potential well. The vanishing TMCI was observed for all other wakes\nand distributions we discuss in this paper: always for the negative wakes, and\nalways, except the cosine wake, for parabolic potential wells.

This oversimplification permits us to expand the\nmodel easily: to take into account the thermal noise and inter-particle\ninteraction that allows to estimate from unified positions the role of thermal\nactivation and dipole interaction in the heating process. Our studies are\nconducted in three stages. The exact expressions for the average power loss of\na single particle are obtained within the dynamical approximation.

The offloading of computational tasks\nand collection of results rely on successful transmissions between vehicles and\ninfrastructures during encounters. In this paper, we investigate how to provide\ntimely computational services in VCC systems. In particular, we seek to\nminimize the deadline violation probability given a set of tasks to be executed\nin vehicular clouds. Due to the uncertainty of vehicle movements, the task\nreplication methodology is leveraged which allows one task to be executed by\nseveral vehicles, and thus trading computational resources for delay reduction.\nThe optimal task replication policy is of key interest. We first formulate the\nproblem as a finite-horizon sampled-time Markov decision problem and obtain the\noptimal policy by value iterations. To conquer the complexity issue, we propose\nthe balanced-task-assignment (BETA) policy which is proved optimal and has a\nclear structure: it always assigns the task with the minimum number of\nreplicas. Moreover, a tight closed-form performance upper bound for the BETA\npolicy is derived, which indicates that the deadline violation probability\nfollows the Rayleigh distribution approximately. Applying the vehicle\nspeed-density relationship in the traffic flow theory, we find that vehicle\nmobility benefits VCC systems more compared with road traffic systems, by\nshowing that the optimum vehicle speed to minimize the deadline violation\nprobability is larger than the critical vehicle speed in traffic theory which\nmaximizes traffic flow efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

We consider the case where players are allowed to move in\nfour orthogonal directions in a grid. Then, we use multi-armed bandit approach\nto give rewards in the end of every move that players do using RSS\nmeasurements. Taking into account that we have an adversarial setting, we\npropose different algorithms to solve the meeting problem. We start with\nconsidering two players and then extend the work to multiplayer by considering\nmultiplayer problem as multiple two player problems. Throughout the paper, we\nconstruct mathematical bounds on meeting times and related concepts and\nevaluate the simulation results in the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

In this study, the effect\nof the respiration on the SCG signal morphology is investigated. SCG, ECG, and\nrespiratory flow rate signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy\nsubjects. Results showed that SCG events tended to have two slightly different\nmorphologies.

Although respiratory flow information could\nseparate similar SCG events into two different groups, the lung volume\ninformation provided better grouping of similar SCGs. This suggests that\nvariations in SCG morphology may be due, at least in part, to changes in the\nintrathoracic pressure or heart location since those parameters correlates more\nwith lung volume than respiratory flow. Categorizing SCG events into different\ngroups containing similar events allows more accurate estimation of SCG\nfeatures, and better signal characterization, and classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

A\ncomplete analytical characterization is given when the central subsystem is a\nqubit.

In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for\nvideo action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which\nenables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust\napproach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is\northogonal to the optical flow. The derivation also provides theoretical\nsupport for using the difference between two frames. By directly calculating\npixel-wise spatiotemporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be\nembedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only\na slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatiotemporal\ninformation, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously.\nThis simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network\nwith OFF fed only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93.3% on\nUCF-101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and\noptical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed.

First of all, a suitable Ansatz is made for the Lagrangian of the\nspin-degenerate operators $\\hat{a}$, $\\hat{c}$, $\\hat{e}$, and $\\hat{f}$ at\nleading order in Lorentz violation. The latter is shown to satisfy the set of\nfive nonlinear equations that govern the map from the field theory to the\nclassical description.

Although these are more involved than the Lagrangians for the\nspin-degenerate ones, an analytical proof of their validity is viable,\nnevertheless. The final step is to combine both findings to produce a generic\nLagrangian for the complete set of Lorentz-violating operators that is\nconsistent with the known minimal and nonminimal Lagrangians found in the\nliterature so far. The outcome reveals the leading-order structure of the\nclassical SME analog.

Most previous attempts made a one-time\ninjection of logic rules, ignoring the interactive nature between embedding\nlearning and logical inference. And they focused only on hard rules, which\nalways hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort to\ncreate or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), a\nnovel paradigm of KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGE\nenables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples that\nhave been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labels\nare going to be predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with various\nconfidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process,\nRUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, and\nintegrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Through\nthis iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be better\ntransferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction on\nFreebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledge\ninjected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties,\nautomatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, even\nthose with moderate confidence levels. The code and data used for this paper\ncan be obtained from https://github.com/iieir-km/RUGE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 05:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

It\nis often the case that exposure to multiple pollutants interact with each other\nto affect an outcome. Further, the exposure-response relationship between an\noutcome and some exposures, such as some metals, can exhibit complex, nonlinear\nforms, since some exposures can be beneficial and detrimental at different\nranges of exposure.

Subsequently, we incorporate a pyramid pooling module\ninto the Single Shot MultiBox Detector framework, in order to simultaneously\nexplore the local and global visual information, which can, therefore, generate\nmore confidential detection results. Experiments on established scene-text\ndatasets, such as the ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500 datasets, have demonstrated the\nsupe rior performance of the proposed method, compared to the state-of-the-art\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 06:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

The latter are the simplest models of fluid\ncelestial bodies with internal rotation and subjected to tidal forces. The\nclassical problem is the stability of Roche--Riemann ellipsoids moving on\ncircular Kepler orbits. However, previous stability studies have to be\nreassessed. Indeed, they only consider global perturbations of large wavelength\nor local perturbations of short wavelength. Moreover many planets and stars\nundergo orbital motions on eccentric Kepler orbits, implying time-dependent\nellipsoidal semi-axes. This time dependence has never been taken into account\nin hydrodynamic stability studies. In this work we overcome these stringent\nassumptions. We extend the hydrodynamic stability analysis of rotating\nellipsoids to the case of eccentric orbits. We have developed two open-source\nand versatile numerical codes to perform global and local inviscid stability\nanalyses. They give sufficient conditions for instability. The global method,\nbased on an exact and closed Galerkin basis, handles rigorously global\nellipsoidal perturbations of unprecedented complexity. Tidally driven and\nlibration-driven elliptical instabilities are first recovered and unified\nwithin a single framework. Then we show that new global fluid instabilities can\nbe triggered in ellipsoids by tidal effects due to eccentric Kepler orbits.\nTheir existence is confirmed by a local analysis and direct numerical\nsimulations of the fully nonlinear and viscous problem. Thus a non-zero orbital\neccentricity may have a strong destabilising effect in celestial fluid bodies,\nwhich may lead to space-filling turbulence in most of the parameters range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

We\nperform the linear stability analysis of the flow in a domain which is periodic\nin the stream-wise and vertical directions and confined in the cross-stream\ndirection. The stability diagram is constructed as a function of the Reynolds\nnumber Re and the Froude number Fr, which compares the importance of shear and\nstratification. We find that the flow becomes unstable when shear and\nstratification are of the same order (i.e. Fr $\\sim$ 1) and above a moderate\nvalue of the Reynolds number Re$\\gtrsim$700.

(ii) A\nlong-term effect of the quench is that density fluctuations are modified,\nmanifested as transient (long-ranged) (pair-)correlations that relax\ndiffusively to their (short-ranged) steady-state limit. As a result, transient\n{\\it fluctuation-induced forces} emerge. We discuss the properties of\nfluctuation-induced and density-induced forces as regards universality,\nrelaxation as a function of time, and scaling with distance between objects.\nTheir distinct signatures allow us to distinguish the two types of forces in\nsimulation data.

The proposed solvers are used in a \\RANSAC-based\nestimator, which gives accurate rectifications after few iterations. The\nproposed solvers are evaluated against the state-of-the-art and demonstrate\nsignificantly better rectifications on noisy measurements. Qualitative results\non diverse imagery demonstrate high-accuracy undistortions and rectifications.\nThe source code is publicly available at https://github.com/prittjam/repeats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 14:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 12:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

Dealing with this high-dimensional data is challenging\nfor every classifier for at least two aspects: First, an MTS is not only\ncharacterized by individual feature values, but also by the interplay of\nfeatures in different dimensions. Second, this typically adds large amounts of\nirrelevant data and noise. We present our novel MTS classifier WEASEL+MUSE\nwhich addresses both challenges. WEASEL+MUSE builds a multivariate feature\nvector, first using a sliding-window approach applied to each dimension of the\nMTS, then extracts discrete features per window and dimension. The feature\nvector is subsequently fed through feature selection, removing\nnon-discriminative features, and analysed by a machine learning classifier. The\nnovelty of WEASEL+MUSE lies in its specific way of extracting and filtering\nmultivariate features from MTS by encoding context information into each\nfeature. Still the resulting feature set is small, yet very discriminative and\nuseful for MTS classification. Based on a popular benchmark of 20 MTS datasets,\nwe found that WEASEL+MUSE is among the most accurate classifiers, when compared\nto the state of the art. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL+MUSE is further\nconfirmed based on motion gesture recognition data, where it out-of-the-box\nachieved similar accuracies as domain-specific methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 20:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 13:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 14:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-20"}

In other words, the game in\nnormal form obtained from a positional game with perfect information is\ndominance-solvable (DS) and also Nash-solvable (NS). Yet, an arbitrary game in\nnormal form may be not DS. We strengthen Gale's results as follows.

Prescriptive notations offer generic\nguidelines for a raga rendition and do not include information about the\nornamentations or the gamakas, which are considered to be critical for\ncharacterizing a raga. In this paper, we show that prescriptive notations\ncontain raga attributes and can reliably identify a raga of Carnatic music from\nits octave-folded prescriptive notations. We restrict the notations to 7 notes\nand suppress the finer note position information. A dictionary based approach\ncaptures the statistics of repetitive note patterns within a raga notation. The\nproposed stochastic models of repetitive note patterns (or SMRNP in short)\nobtained from raga notations of known compositions, outperforms the state of\nthe art melody based raga identification technique on an equivalent melodic\ndata corresponding to the same compositions. This in turn shows that for\nCarnatic music, the note transitions and movements have a greater role in\ndefining the raga structure than the exact note positions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

A proper uncertainty analysis of\nthe output of a mathematical model needs to map what the model does when the\ninput factors are left free to vary over their range of existence. A fortiori,\nthis is true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, most UA and SA still\nexplore the input space; moving along mono-dimensional corridors which leave\nthe space of variation of the input factors mostly unscathed. We use results\nfrom a bibliometric analysis to show that many published SA fail the elementary\nrequirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results,\nwhile discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and of\nrecognized good practices. The misuse of sensitivity analysis in mathematical\nmodelling is at least as serious as the misuse of the p-test in statistical\nmodelling.

Subject to these constraints, the goal of the platform is to maximize\nthe social surplus (or gains from trade) subject to weak budget balance, i.e.,\nprofit being non-negative.\n  We present an approximation algorithm for this problem that yields a $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$ approximation to surplus for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, while\nrelaxing the match quality (i.e., maximum distance of any match) by a constant\nfactor. We use an LP rounding framework that easily extends to other objectives\nsuch as maximizing volume of trade or profit.\n  We justify our models by considering a dynamic marketplace setting where\nagents arrive according to a stochastic process and have finite patience (or\ndeadlines) for being matched. We perform queueing analysis to show that for\npolicies that route agents to facilities and match them, ensuring a low\nabandonment probability of agents reduces to ensuring sufficient flow arrives\nat each facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 22:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

In the coming years, the ESA satellite\nGaia will provide the most complete and accurate catalogue of the Milky Way,\nwith full astrometric parameters for more than $1$ billion stars. In this\npaper, we present the expected sample size and properties (mass, magnitude,\nspatial, velocity distributions) of HVSs in the Gaia stellar catalogue.

For stars with a relative\nerror in total proper motion below $10 \\%$, the mass range extends to ~$10\nM_{\\odot}$ but peaks at ~$1$ $M_\\odot$. The majority of Gaia HVSs will\ntherefore probe a different mass and distance range compared to the current\nnon-Gaia sample. In addition, a subset of a few hundreds to a few thousands of\nHVSs with $M$ ~ $3$ $M_\\odot$ will be bright enough to have a precise\nmeasurement of the three-dimensional velocity from Gaia alone. Finally, we show\nthat Gaia will provide more precise proper motion measurements for the current\nsample of HVS candidates. This will help identifying their birthplace narrowing\ndown their ejection location, and confirming or rejecting their nature as HVSs.\nOverall, our forecasts are extremely encouraging in terms of quantity and\nquality of HVS data that can be exploited to constrain both the Milky Way\npotential and the GC properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 09:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Roughly\nspeaking, to prove SOS lower bounds with our machinery it is sufficient to\nverify that the answer to the following three questions is yes:\n  1. Are there natural pseudo-expectation values for the problem?\n  2. Are these pseudo-expectation values rational functions of the problem\nparameters?\n  3. Are there sufficiently many values of the parameters for which these\npseudo-expectation values correspond to the actual expected values over a\ndistribution of solutions which is the uniform distribution over permutations\nof a single solution?\n  We demonstrate our machinery on three problems, the knapsack problem analyzed\nby Grigoriev, the MOD 2 principle (which says that the complete graph $K_n$ has\nno perfect matching when $n$ is odd), and the following Turan type problem:\nMinimize the number of triangles in a graph $G$ with a given edge density. For\nknapsack, we recover Grigoriev's lower bound exactly. For the MOD 2 principle,\nwe tighten Grigoriev's linear degree sum of squares lower bound, making it\nexact. Finally, for the triangle problem, we prove a sum of squares lower bound\nfor finding the minimum triangle density. This lower bound is completely new\nand gives a simple example where constant degree sum of squares methods have a\nconstant factor error in estimating graph densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 14:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

However, this free surface\nassumption leads to an inability to realistically treat bubbles: submerged gaps\nin the liquid are interpreted as empty voids that immediately collapse. To\naddress this shortcoming, we present an efficient, practical, and conceptually\nsimple approach to augment free surface flows with negligible density bubbles.\nOur method adds a new constraint to each disconnected air region that\nguarantees zero net flux across its entire surface, and requires neither\nsimulating both phases nor reformulating into stream function variables.\nImplementation of the method requires only minor modifications to the pressure\nsolve of a standard grid-based fluid solver, and yields linear systems that\nremain sparse and symmetric positive definite. In our evaluations, solving the\nmodified pressure projection system took no more than 10% longer than the\ncorresponding free surface solve. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and\nflexibility by incorporating it into commercial fluid animation software and\nusing it to generate a variety of dynamic bubble scenarios showcasing glugging\neffects, viscous and inviscid bubbles, interactions with irregularly-shaped and\nmoving solid boundaries, and surface tension effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow\nexcess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a\nnarrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the\ncontinuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this\nscenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy,\nwhich can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include\nmini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\\chi_{s}$ which\nannihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) \"Phase-space shrinking\" for burst-like\nsources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after\npropagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp\nspectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent\ndiffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power\nindex and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and\nfind that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and\nthe annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the\nburst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection\nspectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the\ndistance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr.

As a result, an ILM cannot split down from the optical\nphonon band, in contradiction with the commonly accepted point of view. But it\ncan spit up from the top of the acoustic phonon band making possible the\nexistence of the ILM with the frequencies above the top of this band. It is\npredicted that analogous reduction of cubic anharmonicity should exist\ngenerally for even ILMs with the middle atom being at rest; it may allow the\nexistence of ILMs with the frequencies above the top of the phonon spectrum in\ndifferent lattices with realistic atomic pair-potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

Departments of Transportation (DOTs) continually collect\ntraffic count using both permanent count stations (i.e., Automatic Traffic\nRecorders or ATRs) and temporary short-term count stations. In South Carolina,\n87% of the ATRs are located on interstates and arterial highways. For most\nsecondary highways (i.e., collectors and local roads), AADT is estimated based\non short-term counts. This paper develops AADT estimation models for different\nroadway functional classes with two machine learning techniques: Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models aim to\npredict AADT from short-term counts. The results are first compared against\neach other to identify the best model. Then, the results of the best model are\ncompared against a regression method and factor-based method. The comparison\nreveals the superiority of SVR for AADT estimation for different roadway\nfunctional classes over all other methods. Among all developed models for\ndifferent functional roadway classes, the SVR-based model shows a minimum root\nmean square error (RMSE) of 0.22 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of\n11.3% for the interstate/expressway functional class. This model also shows a\nhigher R-squared value compared to the traditional factor-based model and\nregression model. SVR models are validated for each roadway functional class\nusing the 2016 ATR data and selected short-term count data collected by the\nSouth Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT). The validation results\nshow that the SVR-based AADT estimation models can be used by the SCDOT as a\nreliable option to predict AADT from the short-term counts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 04:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The automatic image segmentation of the\nspine obtained from a computed tomography (CT) image is important for\ndiagnosing spine conditions and for performing surgery with computer-assisted\nsurgery systems. The spine has a complex anatomy that consists of 33 vertebrae,\n23 intervertebral disks, the spinal cord, and connecting ribs. As a result, the\nspinal surgeon is faced with the challenge of needing a robust algorithm to\nsegment and create a model of the spine. In this study, we developed an\nautomatic segmentation method to segment the spine, and we compared our\nsegmentation results with reference segmentations obtained by experts. We\ndeveloped a fully automatic approach for spine segmentation from CT based on a\nhybrid method. This method combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and\nfully convolutional network (FCN), and utilizes class redundancy as a soft\nconstraint to greatly improve the segmentation results. The proposed method was\nfound to significantly enhance the accuracy of the segmentation results and the\nsystem processing time. Our comparison was based on 12 measurements: the Dice\ncoefficient (94%), Jaccard index (93%), volumetric similarity (96%),\nsensitivity (97%), specificity (99%), precision (over segmentation; 8.3 and\nunder segmentation 2.6), accuracy (99%), Matthews correlation coefficient\n(0.93), mean surface distance (0.16 mm), Hausdorff distance (7.4 mm), and\nglobal consistency error (0.02).

Although diversity of individual perspectives typically leads to\nsuperior team performance on complex tasks, strong political perspectives have\nbeen associated with conflict, misinformation and a reluctance to engage with\npeople and perspectives beyond one's echo chamber. It is unclear whether\nself-selected teams of politically diverse individuals will create higher or\nlower quality outcomes. In this paper, we explore the effect of team political\ncomposition on performance through analysis of millions of edits to Wikipedia's\nPolitical, Social Issues, and Science articles. We measure editors' political\nalignments by their contributions to conservative versus liberal articles. A\nsurvey of editors validates that those who primarily edit liberal articles\nidentify more strongly with the Democratic party and those who edit\nconservative ones with the Republican party. Our analysis then reveals that\npolarized teams---those consisting of a balanced set of politically diverse\neditors---create articles of higher quality than politically homogeneous teams.\nThe effect appears most strongly in Wikipedia's Political articles, but is also\nobserved in Social Issues and even Science articles. Analysis of article \"talk\npages\" reveals that politically polarized teams engage in longer, more\nconstructive, competitive, and substantively focused but linguistically diverse\ndebates than political moderates. More intense use of Wikipedia policies by\npolitically diverse teams suggests institutional design principles to help\nunleash the power of politically polarized teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}
