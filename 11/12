For example,\ngeneticists have discovered that some clusters of phenotypes are more\nco-expressed than others. Hence, a joint analysis that can utilize such\nrelatedness information in a heterogeneous data set is crucial for genetic\nmodeling.\n  We proposed the sparse graph-structured linear mixed model (sGLMM) that can\nincorporate the relatedness information from traits in a dataset with\nconfounding correction. Our method is capable of uncovering the genetic\nassociations of a large number of phenotypes together while considering the\nrelatedness of these phenotypes. Through extensive simulation experiments, we\nshow that the proposed model outperforms other existing approaches and can\nmodel correlation from both population structure and shared signals. Further,\nwe validate the effectiveness of sGLMM in the real-world genomic dataset on two\ndifferent species from plants and humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana data, sGLMM\nbehaves better than all other baseline models for 63.4% traits. We also discuss\nthe potential causal genetic variation of Human Alzheimer's disease discovered\nby our model and justify some of the most important genetic loci.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 16:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 16:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

In order to use the WRF model several schemes should\nbe configured, one of them is the microphysics scheme. Microphysics is the\nprocess by which moisture is removed from the air, based on other thermodynamic\nand kinematic fields represented within the numerical models. Sensitivity of\nten microphysics schemes were tested (Kessler, Lin, WRF single moment 3 and 5\nclass, Eta (Ferrier), WRF single Scheme 6 Class, Goddard, Thompson,\nMilbrandt-Yau Double Moment and Morrison double moment). The output temperature\nand precipitation from the model were compared to the satellite data obtained\nfrom Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical\nRainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), respectively.

We here use data\nextracted from real magnetoelastic samples as input for coarse-grained\ndipole-spring modeling and calculations to investigate magnetostriction,\nstiffening, and changes in the normal modes spectrum. More precisely, we assign\nto each particle a dipole moment proportional to its volume and set a\nrandomized network of springs between them that mimics the behavior of the\npolymeric elastic matrix. Extending our previously developed methods, we\ncompute the resulting structural changes in the systems, their overall\ndistortions, as well as the frequency-dependent elastic moduli when magnetic\ninteractions are turned on. Particularly, with increasing magnetization, we\nobserve the formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in significant\noverall deformations. Interestingly, the static elastic moduli can first show a\nslight decrease with growing amplitude of the magnetic interactions, before a\npronounced increase appears upon the chain formation. The change of the dynamic\nmoduli with increasing magnetization depends on the frequency and can even show\nnonmonotonic behavior. Overall, we demonstrate how theory and experiments can\ncomplement each other to learn more about the dynamic behavior of this\ninteresting class of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 16:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

Finally, we point out how the presence of\nLorentz-invariant classical zero-point radiation and the use of relativistic\nparticle interactions transform the previous historical arguments so as now to\ngive the Planck spectrum including classical zero-point radiation. Within\nrelativistic classical electromagnetic theory, Planck's constant h appears as\nthe scale of source-free zero-point radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 18:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

This process can be characterized by its difficulty\nbecause of the need to reconstruct a high number of degrees of freedom (DOFs)\nfrom a very low number of DOFs. To solve such a complex problem, the presented\nmethod is divided into several steps. The user's full-body locomotion and the\nIMU's data are recorded simultaneously. Then, the data is preprocessed in such\na way that would be handled more efficiently. By developing a hierarchical\nmultivariate hidden Markov model with reactive interpolation functionality the\nsystem learns the structure of the motion sequences. Specifically, the phases\nof the locomotion sequence are assigned in the higher hierarchical level, and\nthe frame structure of the motion sequences are assigned at the lower\nhierarchical level. During the runtime of the method, the forward algorithm is\nused for reconstructing the full-body motion of a virtual character.

In this paper we focus on the looser interpersonal structures we\ncall active support networks (ASNs), and on technology that meets their needs.\nWe describe two needfinding investigations focused on social support, which\nexamined (a) four application areas for improving coordination in ASNs: (i)\nacademic coaching, (ii) vocational training, (iii) early learning intervention,\nand (iv) volunteer coordination; and (b) existing technology relevant to ASNs.\nWe find a thus-far unmet need for personal task management software that allows\nsmooth integration with an individual's active support network. Based on\nidentified needs, we then describe an open architecture for coordination that\nhas been developed into working software. The design includes a set of\ncapabilities we call \"social prompting,\" as well as templates for accomplishing\nmulti-task goals, and an engine that controls coordination in the network. The\nresulting tool is currently available and in continuing development. We explain\nits use in ASNs with an example. Follow-up studies are underway in which the\ntechnology is being applied in existing support networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2017 01:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

We then demonstrate how the inversion leads to a reformulation of\nthe fully non-linear and self-interactive Einstein-Cartan-Dirac field equations\nin terms of Dirac bilinears. It has been known for some decades that the Dirac\nequation for charged fermions interacting with an electromagnetic field can be\nalgebraically inverted, so as to obtain an explicit rational expression of the\nfour-vector potential of the gauge field in terms of the spinors. Substitution\nof this expression into Maxwell's equations yields the bilinear form of the\nself-interactive Maxwell-Dirac equations.

When taking the torsion field equation into account, the\nresidual term can be written as a function of the object of anholonomity. Using\nthe local tetrad frame associated with observers co-moving with the Dirac\nmatter, a generic vierbein frame can described in terms of four Dirac bilinear\nvector fields, normalized by a scalar and pseudoscalar field.

Most traditional\nspectral clustering algorithms work in three separate steps: similarity graph\nconstruction; continuous labels learning; discretizing the learned labels by\nk-means clustering. Such common practice has two potential flaws, which may\nlead to severe information loss and performance degradation. First, predefined\nsimilarity graph might not be optimal for subsequent clustering. It is\nwell-accepted that similarity graph highly affects the clustering results. To\nthis end, we propose to automatically learn similarity information from data\nand simultaneously consider the constraint that the similarity matrix has exact\nc connected components if there are c clusters. Second, the discrete solution\nmay deviate from the spectral solution since k-means method is well-known as\nsensitive to the initialization of cluster centers. In this work, we transform\nthe candidate solution into a new one that better approximates the discrete\none. Finally, those three subtasks are integrated into a unified framework,\nwith each subtask iteratively boosted by using the results of the others\ntowards an overall optimal solution. It is known that the performance of a\nkernel method is largely determined by the choice of kernels. To tackle this\npractical problem of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular\ndata set, we further extend our model to incorporate multiple kernel learning\nability.

Compared to tracking with a still camera, the\nimages captured with a PTZ camera are highly dynamic in nature because the\ncamera can perform large motion resulting in quickly changing capture\nconditions. Furthermore, tracking with a PTZ camera involves camera control to\nposition the camera on the target. For successful tracking and camera control,\nthe tracker must be fast enough, or has to be able to predict accurately the\nnext position of the target. Therefore, standard benchmarks do not allow to\nassess properly the quality of a tracker for the PTZ scenario. In this work, we\nuse a virtual PTZ framework to evaluate different tracking algorithms and\ncompare their performances. We also extend the framework to add target position\nprediction for the next frame, accounting for camera motion and processing\ndelays. By doing this, we can assess if predicting can make long-term tracking\nmore robust as it may help slower algorithms for keeping the target in the\nfield of view of the camera. Results confirm that both speed and robustness are\nrequired for tracking under the PTZ scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2017 09:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

We consider the question \"can the cell's perception of\ntime be expressed through the length of the shortest telomere?\" The answer is\nthat the absolute time before senescence cannot be expressed by the telomere's\nlength and that a cell can survive many more divisions than intuitively\nexpected. This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the\ntelomere, which suggests a random walk model of the telomere's length. The\nmodel indicates two phases, first, a determinist drift of the length toward a\nquasi-equilibrium state, and second, persistence of the length near an\nattracting state for the majority of divisions prior to senescence. The measure\nof stability of the latter phase is the expected number of divisions at the\nattractor (\"lifetime\") prior to crossing a threshold to senescence. The\ntelomerase regulates stability by creating an effective potential barrier that\nseparates statistically the shortest lifetime from the next shortest. The\nrandom walk has to overcome the barrier in order to extend the range of the\nfirst regime.

The core element of\nan optimal decision process is a rule for selecting and sampling the random\nvariables over time.

Our theory gives a highly\naccurate description of these modifications by including the contribution from\nthe most significant viscous term in a correctional perturbation expansion\nabout an inviscid base state. We derive the boundary layer equation for the\nflow and deduce a similarity transformation that leads to a set of infinite,\nshear-free-condition-incompatible, self-similar solutions. By suitably\ncombining members from this set, we construct an\nall-boundary-condition-compatible solution to the boundary layer equation.

In the plasma, consisting of the loss-cone\ntype distribution of hot electrons and much denser and colder background\nplasma, this instability generates the upper-hybrid waves, which are then\ntransformed into the electromagnetic waves and observed as radio zebras. In the\npresent paper we numerically study the double plasma resonance instability from\nthe point of view of the zebra interpretation. We use a 3-dimensional\nelectromagnetic particle-in-cell (3-D PIC) relativistic model. First using the\nmulti-mode model, we study details of the double plasma resonance instability.\nWe show how the distribution function of hot electrons changes during this\ninstability. Then we show that there is a very good agreement between results\nobtained by the multi-mode and specific-mode models, which is caused by a\ndominance of the wave with the maximal growth rate. Therefore, for computations\nin a broad range of model parameters, we use the specific-mode model. We\ncompute the maximal growth rates of the double plasma resonance instability.\nThe results are compared with the analytical ones.

Three main\ncomponents are used in the proposed network: an encoder which maps 2D input\nimage to a representation space, a 3D decoder which decodes a representation to\na 3D structure and a mapping component in order to map 2D to 3D representation.\nThe only part that needs label for training is the mapping part with not too\nmany parameters.
