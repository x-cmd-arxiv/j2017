The\nfirst weakness of this approach is the presence of perspective distortion in\nthe 2D depth map. While the depth map is intrinsically 3D data, many previous\nmethods treat depth maps as 2D images that can distort the shape of the actual\nobject through projection from 3D to 2D space. This compels the network to\nperform perspective distortion-invariant estimation. The second weakness of the\nconventional approach is that directly regressing 3D coordinates from a 2D\nimage is a highly non-linear mapping, which causes difficulty in the learning\nprocedure. To overcome these weaknesses, we firstly cast the 3D hand and human\npose estimation problem from a single depth map into a voxel-to-voxel\nprediction that uses a 3D voxelized grid and estimates the per-voxel likelihood\nfor each keypoint.

The Tf exhibits a\ndoping dependence similar to Tc, and the interval between Tf and Tc is about\n5-30 K across the underdoped regime, showing agreement with a variety of other\nmeasurements to probe a restricted temperature range of superconducting\nfluctuations. Above Tf, the d\\{rho}ab/dT increases linearly as T increases up\nto a value denoted as T2, which is about half the T* and falls roughly in\nparallel with T* as p rises up to about 0.13, indicating a prominent\nT^2-dependent \\{rho}ab in this T-p region.

In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations.

These systems are typically made from hundreds to thousands of turns\nof conductors. Due to the large number of turns, the simulations of a whole\nsystem can become prohibitive in terms of computing time and load. Therefore,\nan efficient strategy which does not compromise the accuracy of calculations is\nneeded. Recently, a method, based on a multi-scale approach, showed that the\ncomputational load can be lowered by simulating, in detail, only several\nsignificant tapes from the system. The main limitation of this approach is the\ninaccuracy of the estimation of the background magnetic field. To address this\nissue, we consider the following two complementary strategies. The first\nstrategy consists in the iterative implementation of the multi-scale method.\nThe multi-scale method solves itself a dynamic problem, the iterative\nimplementation proposed here is the iterative application of the multi-scale\nmethod, and a dynamic solution is obtained at each iteration. The second\nstrategy is a new interpolation method for current distributions, based on the\ninverse cumulative density function interpolation technique. With respect to\nconventional interpolation methods, a more realistic current density\ndistribution is then obtained, which allows for a better estimation of the\nbackground magnetic field, and consequently, a better estimation of the\nhysteresis losses. In contrast with previous works, here we do not focus only\non the estimation of the hysteresis losses, but also the estimation of\nbackground field and the current density distribution is addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 18:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 21:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 19:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

We bypass this issue by using RR Lyrae stars, which are standard\ncandles with a very low field-volume density at the distance of Hercules. We\nuse wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera on CTIO to identify\ncandidate RR Lyrae stars, supplemented with observations taken in coordination\nwith the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey on the Bok Telescope.

All three of these new RR Lyrae stars lie outside its\npublished tidal radius. When considered with the nine RR Lyrae stars already\nknown within the tidal radius, these results suggest that a substantial\nfraction of Hercules' stellar content has been stripped. With this degree of\ntidal disruption, Hercules is an interesting case between a visibly disrupted\ndwarf (such as the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy) and one in dynamic\nequilibrium. The degree of disruption also shows that we must be more careful\nwith the ways we determine object membership when estimating dwarf masses in\nthe future.

Moreover, when approaching cryogenic\ntemperatures, quantum phenomena in spin-wave systems pave the path towards\nquantum information processing. In view of these applications, the lifetime of\nmagnons$-$spin-wave quanta$-$is of high relevance for the fields of magnonics,\nmagnon spintronics and quantum computing. Here, the relaxation behavior of\nparametrically excited magnons having wavenumbers from zero up to $6\\cdot 10^5\n\\mathrm{rad~cm}^{-1}$ was experimentally investigated in the temperature range\nfrom 20 K to 340 K in single crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films\nepitaxially grown on gallium gadolinium garnet (GGG) substrates as well as in a\nbulk YIG crystal$-$the magnonic materials featuring the lowest magnetic damping\nknown so far. As opposed to the bulk YIG crystal in YIG films we have found a\nsignificant increase in the magnon relaxation rate below 150 K$-$up to 10.5\ntimes the reference value at 340 K$-$in the entire range of probed wavenumbers.\nThis increase is associated with rare-earth impurities contaminating the YIG\nsamples with a slight contribution caused by coupling of spin waves to the spin\nsystem of the paramagnetic GGG substrate at the lowest temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 19:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In\naddition to this, there is also a security risk of leaking these data during\nthe data transmission from user to the model (especially when it's through\nInternet). Targeting at these issues, in this paper we proposed a new\narchitecture for deep network in which users don't reveal their original data\nto the model.

We\npresent an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere which is\nderived from OMNI and Helios data. The sunspot number (SSN) and its predictions\nare used to derive dependencies of solar-wind parameters on solar activity and\nto forecast them for the PSP mission. The frequency distributions for the\nsolar-wind key parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density,\nand temperature, are represented by lognormal functions, considering the\nvelocity distribution's bi-componental shape. Functional relations to the SSN\nare compiled using OMNI data and based on data from both Helios probes, the\nparameters' frequency distributions are fitted with respect to solar distance.\nThus, an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere is derived,\naccounting for solar activity and solar distance.

The\ngoal of this paper is to demarcate which partition functions should be\ninvariant under T-reflection, and why. Our main claim is that\nfinite-temperature path integrals for quantum field theories (QFTs) should be\nT-reflection invariant. Because multi-particle partition functions are equal to\nEuclidean path integrals for QFTs, we expect them to be T-reflection invariant.\nSingle-particle partition functions though are often not invariant under\nT-reflection. Several exactly solvable systems are non-invariant under naive\nT-reflection, but are likely invariant under an extended T-reflection. We give\nexample systems that are T-reflection invariant but are (1) non-unitary, (2)\nchiral, (3) interacting, (4) non-supersymmetric, or (5) non-conformal, and (6)\nargue that T-reflection is unrelated to time-reversal.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) built using bio-plausible\nneuron and synaptic models have emerged as the power-efficient choice for\ndesigning cognitive applications. These algorithms involve several lookup-table\n(LUT) based function evaluations such as high-order polynomials and\ntranscendental functions for solving complex neuro-synaptic models, that\ntypically require additional storage. To that effect, we propose `SPARE' - an\nin-memory, distributed processing architecture built on ROM-embedded RAM\ntechnology, for accelerating SNNs. ROM-embedded RAMs allow storage of LUTs,\nembedded within a typical memory array, without additional area overhead. Our\nproposed architecture consists of a 2-D array of Processing Elements (PEs).\nSince most of the computations are done locally within each PE, unnecessary\ndata transfers are restricted, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck.\nWe evaluate SPARE for two different ROM-Embedded RAM structures - CMOS based\nROM-Embedded SRAMs (R-SRAMs) and STT-MRAM based ROM-Embedded MRAMs (R-MRAMs).\nMoreover, we analyze trade-offs in terms of energy, area and performance, for\nusing the two technologies on a range of image classification benchmarks.\nFurthermore, we leverage the additional storage density to implement complex\nneuro-synaptic functionalities.

However, the clinimetric accuracy achievable with such technology is\nhighly reliant on separating the useful from irrelevant or confounded sensor\ndata. Monitoring patient symptoms using digital sensors outside of controlled,\nclinical lab settings creates a variety of practical challenges, such as\nunavoidable and unexpected user behaviours. These behaviours often violate the\nassumptions of clinimetric testing protocols, where these protocols are\ndesigned to probe for specific symptoms. Such violations are frequent outside\nthe lab, and can affect the accuracy of the subsequent data analysis and\nscientific conclusions. At the same time, curating sensor data by hand after\nthe collection process is inherently subjective, laborious and error-prone. To\naddress these problems, we report on a unified algorithmic framework for\nautomated sensor data quality control, which can identify those parts of the\nsensor data which are sufficiently reliable for further analysis.

In many applications, e.g., ions in biological tissues, the presence\nof thin boundary layers poses both modelling and computational challenges. In\nthis paper, we derive simplified electro-neutral (EN) models where the thin\nboundary layers are replaced by effective boundary conditions. There are two\nmajor advantages of EN models. First of all, it is much cheaper to solve them\nnumerically. Secondly, EN models are easier to deal with compared with the\noriginal PNP, therefore it is also easier to derive macroscopic models for\ncellular structures using EN models.\n  Even though the approach is applicable to higher dimensional cases, this\npaper mainly focuses on the one-dimensional system, including the general\nmulti-ion case. Using systematic asymptotic analysis, we derive a variety of\neffective boundary conditions directly applicable to EN system for the bulk\nregion. This EN system can be solved directly and efficiently without computing\nthe solution in the boundary layer. The derivation is based on matched\nasymptotics, and the key idea is to bring back higher order contributions into\neffective boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the higher\norder terms can be neglected and classical results (continuity of\nelectrochemical potential) are recovered. For flux boundary conditions,\nhowever, neglecting higher contribution leads to physically incorrect solutions\nsince they account for accumulation of ions in boundary layer. The validity of\nour EN model is verified by several examples and numerical computation. In\nparticular, our EN model is much more efficient than the original PNP model\nwhen applied to the computation of membrane potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 21:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 00:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

A novel application of these ideas\nis for analyzing group-level differences, i.e., in identifying if trends of\nestimated objects (e.g., covariance or precision matrices) are different across\ndisparate conditions (e.g., gender or disease). Often, poor effect sizes make\ndetecting the differential signal over the full set of features difficult: for\nexample, dependencies between only a subset of features may manifest\ndifferently across groups. In this work, we first give a parametric model for\nestimating trends in the space of SPD matrices as a function of one or more\ncovariates. We then generalize scan statistics to graph structures, to search\nover distinct subsets of features (graph partitions) whose temporal dependency\nstructure may show statistically significant group-wise differences.

One of the ways to query these KGs is to\nuse SPARQL queries over a database engine. Since SPARQL follows exact match\nsemantics, the queries may return too few or no results. Recent works have\nproposed query relaxation where the query engine judiciously replaces a query\npredicate with similar predicates using weighted relaxation rules mined from\nthe KG. The space of possible relaxations is potentially too large to fully\nexplore and users are typically interested in only top-k results, so such query\nengines use top-k algorithms for query processing. However, they may still\nprocess all the relaxations, many of whose answers do not contribute towards\ntop-k answers. This leads to computation overheads and delayed response times.\n  We propose Spec-QP, a query planning framework that speculatively determines\nwhich relaxations will have their results in the top-k answers. Only these\nrelaxations are processed using the top-k operators. We, therefore, reduce the\ncomputation overheads and achieve faster response times without adversely\naffecting the quality of results. We tested Spec-QP over two datasets - XKG and\nTwitter, to demonstrate the efficiency of our planning framework at reducing\nruntimes with reasonable accuracy for query engines supporting relaxations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 23:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

Recommendation service is one\nof the most widely adopted technologies for alleviating this problem, these\nservices intend to provide people with referrals of items they will appreciate\nbased on their preferences. IPTV users must ensure their sensitive preferences\ncollected by any recommendation service are properly secured. In this work, we\nintroduce a framework for private recommender service based on Enhanced\nMiddleware for Collaborative Privacy (EMCP). EMCP executes a two-stage\nconcealment process that gives the user a complete control on the privacy level\nof his/her profile. We utilize trust mechanism to augment the accuracy and\nprivacy of the recommendations. Trust heuristic spot users who are trustworthy\nwith respect to the user requesting the recommendation. Later, the neighborhood\nformation is calculated using proximity metrics based on these trustworthy\nusers. Finally, Users submit their profiles in an obfuscated form without\nrevealing any information about their data, and the computation of\nrecommendations proceeds over the obfuscated data using secure multiparty\ncomputation protocol. We expand the obfuscation scope from single obfuscation\nlevel for all users to arbitrary obfuscation levels based on trustworthy\nbetween users. In other words, we correlate the obfuscation level with\ndifferent trust levels, so the more trusted a target user is the less\nobfuscation copy of profile he can access. We also provide an IPTV network\nscenario and experimentation results. Our results and analysis show that our\ntwo-stage concealment process not only protects the privacy of users but also\ncan maintain the recommendations accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 01:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

In a positional voting rule, each candidate receives a\nscore from each ballot based on the ballot's rank order; the candidate with the\nhighest total score wins the election. The cost of a candidate is his sum of\ndistances to all voters, and the distortion of an election is the ratio between\nthe cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate. We\nconsider the case when candidates are representative of the population, in the\nsense that they are drawn i.i.d. from the population of the voters, and analyze\nthe expected distortion of positional voting rules.\n  Our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting\nrules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of\ncandidates and the metric space). Our characterization result immediately\nimplies constant expected distortion for Borda Count and elections in which\neach voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates.

These results contrast with previous results\non voting with metric preferences: When the candidates are chosen\nadversarially, all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the\nnumber of candidates or voters.

We show that coding and\nverification are the biggest obstacle to the wide adoption of spatial\narchitectures. We propose a new programming methodology, T2S (Temporal to\nSpatial), to remove this obstacle. A programmer specifies a temporal definition\nand a spatial mapping. The temporal definition defines the functionality to\ncompute, while the spatial mapping defines how to decompose the functionality\nand map the decomposed pieces onto a spatial architecture. The specification\nprecisely controls a compiler to actually implement the loop and data\ntransformations specified in the mapping. The specification is loop-nest- and\nmatrix-oriented, and thus lends itself to the compiler for automatic, static\nverification. Many generic, strategic loop and data optimizations can be\nsystematically expressed. Consequently, high performance is expected with\nsubstantially higher productivity: compared with high-performance programming\nin today's high-level synthesis (HLS) languages or hardware description\nlanguages (HDLs), the engineering effort on coding and verification is expected\nto be reduced from months to hours, a reduction of 2 or 3 orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 02:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

For this problem, maximin share (MMS) is a well-studied solution\nconcept which provides a fairness threshold. Specifically, maximin share is\ndefined as the minimum utility that an agent can guarantee for herself when\nasked to partition the set of goods into n bundles such that the remaining\n(n-1) agents pick their bundles adversarially. An allocation is deemed to be\nfair if every agent gets a bundle whose valuation is at least her maximin\nshare.\n  Even though maximin shares provide a natural benchmark for fairness, it has\nits own drawbacks and, in particular, it is not sufficient to rule out\nunsatisfactory allocations. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we\ndefine a stronger notion of fairness, called groupwise maximin share guarantee\n(GMMS). In GMMS, we require that the maximin share guarantee is achieved not\njust with respect to the grand bundle, but also among all the subgroups of\nagents. Hence, this solution concept strengthens MMS and provides an ex-post\nfairness guarantee. We show that in specific settings, GMMS allocations always\nexist. We also establish the existence of approximate GMMS allocations under\nadditive valuations, and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to find such\nallocations. Moreover, we establish a scale of fairness wherein we show that\nGMMS implies approximate envy freeness.\n  Finally, we empirically demonstrate the existence of GMMS allocations in a\nlarge set of randomly generated instances.

Owing to a long term development for reducing the sizes\nof devices, the preparation of ferroelectric materials and devices are entering\nnanometer-scale regime. Accordingly, to evaluate the ferroelectricity, there is\na need to investigate the polarization charge at the nanoscale. Nonetheless, it\nhas been generally accepted that the detection of polarization charges using a\nconventional conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) without a top electrode\nis not feasible because the nanometer-scale radius of an atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) tip yields a very low signal-to-noise ratio.

In this work, we demonstrate the direct probing of the\npolarization charge at the nanoscale using the Positive-Up-Negative-Down method\nbased on the conventional CAFM approach without additional corrections or\ncircuits to reduce the parasitic capacitance. We successfully probed the\npolarization charge densities of 73.7 and 119.0 uC/cm2 in ferroelectric\nnanocapacitors and thin films, respectively.

However, these\nremote sensing data, specifically~Level 2 retrievals, tend to be irregular in\nspace and time, and hence, spatio-temporal prediction is required to infer\nvalues at any location and time point. Such inferences are not only required to\nanswer important questions about our climate, but they are also needed for\nvalidating the satellite instrument, since Level 2 retrievals are generally not\nco-located with ground-based remote sensing instruments. Here, we discuss\nstatistical approaches to construct Level 3 products from Level 2 retrievals,\nplacing particular emphasis on the strengths and potential pitfalls when using\nstatistical prediction in this context. Following this discussion, we use a\nspatio-temporal statistical modelling framework known as fixed rank kriging\n(FRK) to obtain global predictions and prediction standard errors of\ncolumn-averaged carbon dioxide based on Version 7r and Version 8r retrievals\nfrom the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite.

Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer\nnetworks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In\nthis representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately\ncapture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these\ndependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on\nsimplistic assumptions that do not capture node-level layer dependencies.

However, several\nexperiments have revealed an apparent discrepancy between damping enhancement\nand damping-like SOT regarding their dependence on NM thickness. Here, using\nlinewidth and phase-resolved amplitude analysis of vector network analyzer\nferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) measurements, we simultaneously extract\ndamping enhancement and both field-like and damping-like inverse SOT in\nNi$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt bilayers as a function of Pt thickness. By enforcing an\ninterpretation of the data which satisfies Onsager reciprocity, we find that\nboth the damping enhancement and damping-like inverse SOT can be described by a\nsingle spin diffusion length ($\\approx$ 4 nm), and that we can separate the\nspin pumping and spin memory loss (SML) contributions to the total damping.\nThis analysis indicates that less than 40% of the angular momentum pumped by\nFMR through the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt interface is transported as spin current\ninto the Pt. On account of the SML and corresponding reduction in total spin\ncurrent available for spin-charge transduction in the Pt, we determine the Pt\nspin Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{SH} = (2.36 \\pm 0.04)\\times10^6\n\\Omega^{-1} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and bulk spin Hall angle\n($\\theta_\\mathrm{SH}=0.387 \\pm0.008$) to be larger than commonly-cited values.\nThese results suggest that Pt can be an extremely useful source of SOT if the\nFM/NM interface can be engineered to minimize SML.

We use a finite-difference code for simulation of\nneutron-star thermal evolution on timescales from hours to megayears with an\nupdated microphysics input. The consideration of short timescales ($\\lesssim1$\nyr) is made possible by a treatment of the heat-blanketing envelope without the\nquasistationary approximation inherent to its treatment in traditional\nneutron-star cooling codes. For the strongly magnetized neutron stars, we take\ninto account the effects of Landau quantization on thermodynamic functions and\nthermal conductivities. We simulate cooling of ordinary neutron stars and\nmagnetars with non-accreted and accreted crusts and compare the results with\nobservations. Suppression of radiative and conductive opacities in strongly\nquantizing magnetic fields and formation of a condensed radiating surface\nsubstantially enhance the photon luminosity at early ages, making the life of\nmagnetars brighter but shorter. These effects together with the effect of\nstrong proton superfluidity, which slows down the cooling of kiloyear-aged\nneutron stars, can explain thermal luminosities of about a half of magnetars\nwithout invoking heating mechanisms. Observed thermal luminosities of other\nmagnetars are still higher than theoretical predictions, which implies heating,\nbut the effects of quantizing magnetic fields and baryon superfluidity help to\nreduce the discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 07:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 13:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 07:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 11:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In\na recent paper [Phys. Rev.

Here, we first\nreformulate the theory in terms of fermionic modes, to render its connection\nwith resonance valence bond (RVB) fluctuations more transparent. Secondly, by\nusing a large-U expansion, where U is the Coulomb interaction, we relate the\nfluctuations to real space correlations. Therefore, it becomes possible to\nstudy how electron spectra are related to charge, spin, superconductivity and\nRVB-like real space correlations, broadening the analysis of an earlier work\n[Phys. Rev. B 89, 245130 (2014)]. This formalism is applied to the pseudogap\nphysics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, studied in the dynamical cluster\napproximation. We perform calculations for embedded clusters with up to 32\nsites, having three inequivalent K-points at the Fermi surface. We find that as\nU is increased, correlation functions gradually attain values consistent with\nan RVB state. This first happens for correlation functions involving the\nantinodal point and gradually spreads to the nodal point along the Fermi\nsurface. Simultaneously a pseudogap opens up along the Fermi surface. We relate\nthis to a crossover from a Kondo-like state to an RVB-like localized cluster\nstate and to the presence of RVB and spin fluctuations. These changes are\ncaused by a strong momentum dependence in the cluster bath-couplings along the\nFermi surface. We also show, from a more algorithmic perspective, how the\ntime-consuming calculations in fluctuation diagnostics can be drastically\nsimplified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Built upon this vision, fractional\ntopological insulators (FTIs) have been proposed as being composed of two\nindependent copies of the FCI with opposite Chern numbers for different spins,\npreserving the time-reversal symmetry as a whole. An important question is if\nthe correlation between electrons with different spins can be really ignored.\nTo address this question, we investigate the effects of correlation in the\npresence of spin-dependent holomorphicity, i.e., electrons of one spin species\nreside in the holomorphic lowest Landau level, while those of the other in the\nantiholomorphic counterpart. By constructing and performing exact\ndiagonalization of an appropriate model Hamiltonian, here, we show that\ngeneric, strongly correlated, fractionally filled states with spin-dependent\nholomorphicity cannot be described as two independent copies of the FQHS,\nsuggesting that FTIs in the lattice cannot be described as those of the FCI\neither. Fractionally filled states in this system are generally compressible\nexcept at half filling, where an insulating state called the half-filled\nspin-holomorphic FTI occurs. It is predicted that the half-filled\nspin-holomorphic FTI is susceptible to an inherent spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, leading to the spatial separation of spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 09:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Morphological study of images of the nebula obtained at an angular\nresolution of about 1.3\" in four UVIT filter bands that include C IV 1550 {\\AA}\nand C II] 2326 {\\AA} lines and UV continuum. Comparisons with X-ray, optical,\nand IR images from literature.\n  Results. The C II] 2326 {\\AA} images show the core of the nebula with two\nlobes on either side of CS similar to [N II]. The C IV emission in the core\nshows similar morphology and extant as that of diffuse X-ray emission\nconcentrated in nebular condensations. A surprising UVIT discovery is the\npresence of a large faint FUV halo in FUV Filter with {\\lambda}eff of 1608\n{\\AA}. The UV halo is not present in any other UV filter. FUV halo is most\nlikely due to UV fluorescence emission from the Lyman bands of H2 molecules.\nUnlike the optical and IR halo, FUV halo trails predominantly towards\nsouth-east side of the nebular core, opposite to the CS's proper motion\ndirection.\n  Conclusions. Morphological similarity of C IV 1550 {\\AA} and X-ray emission\nin the core suggests that it results mostly from interaction of strong CS wind\nwith the nebula. The FUV halo in NGC 40 highlights the existence of H2\nmolecules extensively in the regions even beyond the optical and IR halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The final, long-term goal is the\nexploitation of open clusters as age calibrators. We perform a homogeneous\nanalysis of eight open clusters using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright\nmembers, and information from the Gaia-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster\nmembership probabilities for the Gaia-ESO Survey targets are derived based on\nseveral spectroscopic tracers. The Gaia-ESO Survey also provides the cluster\nchemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first\none relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while\nthe other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS\nsources. Ages and reddening values are recovered through a Bayesian analysis\nusing the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of standard models. Lithium depletion\nboundary (LDB) ages are also determined using literature observations and the\nsame models employed for the Bayesian analysis. For all but one cluster,\nparallaxes derived by us agree with those presented in Gaia Collaboration et\nal. (2017), while a discrepancy is found for NGC 2516; we provide evidence\nsupporting our own determination. Inferred cluster ages are robust against\nmodels and are generally consistent with literature values. The systematic\nparallax errors inherent in the Gaia DR1 data presently limit the precision of\nour results. Nevertheless, we have been able to place these eight clusters onto\nthe same age scale for the first time, with good agreement between isochronal\nand LDB ages where there is overlap. Our approach appears promising and\ndemonstrates the potential of combining Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

We demonstrate that our approach yields\nhigher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods without undue complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

Previous\nX-ray studies revealed that its spectrum is dominated by strong fluorescence\nlines of Fe as well as continuum emission. For physical and geometrical insight\ninto the nature of the reprocessing material, we utilize the high spectroscopic\nresolving power of the X-ray microcalorimeter (the soft X-ray spectrometer;\nSXS) and the wide-band sensitivity by the soft and hard X-ray imager (SXI and\nHXI) aboard Hitomi. Even though photon counts are limited due to unintended\noff-axis pointing, the SXS spectrum resolves Fe K{\\alpha_1} and K{\\alpha_2}\nlines and puts strong constraints on the line centroid and width. The line\nwidth corresponds to the velocity of 160^{+300}_{-70} km s^{-1}. This\nrepresents the most accurate, and smallest, width measurement of this line made\nso far from any X-ray binary, much less than the Doppler broadening and shift\nexpected from speeds which are characteristic of similar systems. Combined with\nthe K-shell edge energy measured by the SXI and HXI spectra, the ionization\nstate of Fe is estimated to be in the range of Fe I--IV. Considering the\nestimated ionization parameter and the distance between the X-ray source and\nthe absorber, the density and thickness of the materials are estimated. The\nextraordinarily strong absorption and the absence of a Compton shoulder\ncomponent is confirmed. These characteristics suggest reprocessing materials\nwhich are distributed in a narrow solid angle or scattering primarily with warm\nfree electrons or neutral hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

In particular, curtailable block orders and the\nuniform purchase price (UPP) pose serious difficulties. A block is an order\nthat spans over multiple hours, and can be either fully accepted or fully\nrejected. The UPP prescribes that all consumers pay a common price, i.e., the\nUPP, in all the zones, while producers receive zonal prices, which can differ\nfrom one zone to another.\n  The market clearing problem in the presence of both the UPP and block orders\nis a major open issue in the European context. The UPP scheme leads to a\nnon-linear optimization problem involving both primal and dual variables,\nwhereas block orders introduce multi-temporal constraints and binary variables\ninto the problem. As a consequence, the market clearing problem in the presence\nof both blocks and the UPP can be regarded as a non-linear integer programming\nproblem involving both primal and dual variables with complementary and\nmulti-temporal constraints.\n  The aim of this paper is to present a non-iterative and heuristic-free\napproach for solving the market clearing problem in the presence of both\ncurtailable block orders and the UPP. The solution is exact, with no\napproximation up to the level of resolution of current market data. By\nresorting to an equivalent UPP formulation, the proposed approach results in a\nmixed-integer linear program, which is built starting from a non-linear integer\nbilevel programming problem. Numerical results using real market data are\nreported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The model has been\nimplemented in Python, and the code is freely available on a public repository.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 11:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 18:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 12:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 16:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

However, in many practical applications, the\nduration of the forcing is not long enough for the bubble to attain a constant\ntranslational velocity, mainly due to the effect of the history force. Here, we\ndevelop a formulation, valid in the limit of very viscous flow and\nsmall-amplitude acoustic forcing, that allows us to describe the transient\ndynamics of bubbles driven by acoustic pulses consisting of a finite number of\ncycles. We also present an asymptotic solution to this theory for the case of a\nfinite-duration sinusoidal pressure pulse.

Nevertheless, since the number of model parameters scales\nquadratically with the number of variables, these models can be easily\nover-parameterized. For this reason, parsimonious models have been developed\nvia covariance matrix decompositions or assuming local independence. However,\nthese remedies do not allow for direct estimation of sparse covariance matrices\nnor do they take into account that the structure of association among the\nvariables can vary from one cluster to the other. To this end, we introduce\nmixtures of Gaussian covariance graph models for model-based clustering with\nsparse covariance matrices. A penalized likelihood approach is employed for\nestimation and a general penalty term on the graph configurations can be used\nto induce different levels of sparsity and incorporate prior knowledge. Model\nestimation is carried out using a structural-EM algorithm for parameters and\ngraph structure estimation, where two alternative strategies based on a genetic\nalgorithm and an efficient stepwise search are proposed for inference. With\nthis approach, sparse component covariance matrices are directly obtained.

Quantum correlations exhibit periodic revivals with the driving\ncycles in the finite-size chain. The time of first revival is proportional to\nthe system size and is inversely proportional to the maximum group velocity of\nFloquet quasi-particles. On the other hand, the local quantum correlations in\nthe infinite chain may get saturated to non-zero values after a sufficiently\nlarge number of driving cycles. Moreover, we investigate the convergence of\nlocal density matrices, from which the quantum correlations under study\noriginate, towards the final steady-state density matrices as a function of\ndriving cycles. We find that the geometric distance, $d$, between the reduced\ndensity matrices of non-equilibrium state and steady-state obeys a power-law\nscaling of the form $d \\sim n^{-B}$, where $n$ is the number of driving cycles\nand $B$ is the scaling exponent. The steady-state quantum correlations are\nstudied as a function of time period of the driving field and are marked by the\npresence of prominent peaks in frequency domain. The steady-state features can\nbe further understood by probing band structures of Floquet Hamiltonian and\npurity of the bipartite state between nearest neighbor sites. Finally, we\ncompare the steady-state values of the local quantum correlations with that of\nthe canonical Gibbs ensemble and infer about their canonical ergodic\nproperties. Moreover, we identify generic features in the ergodic properties\ndepending upon the quantum phases of the initial state and the pathway of\nrepeated driving that may be within the same quantum phase or across two\ndifferent equilibrium phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 13:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 09:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

Dust radiative transfer models\nare presented for 225 carbon stars and 171 oxygen-rich evolved stars for which\nspectra from the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer are available.

New deep K-band\nphotometry from the VMC survey and multi-epoch data from IRAC and\nAllWISE/NEOWISE have allowed us to derive pulsation periods longer than 1000\ndays for some of the most heavily obscured and reddened objects.

One such systematic limitation is 1/f noise, which largely\noriginates within the instrumentation and manifests as multiplicative gain\nfluctuations.

Determination\nof the energy decay time-constant in the time domain by linear fitting the\npower delay profile, rather than using the frequency domain quality-factor, has\nthe advantage of being independent of the radiation efficiency of antennas used\nin the measurement. However, determination of chamber time constant by linear\nregression suffers from several practical problems, including a requirement for\nlong measurement times.

We show the flexibility of our proposal, its\nproperty of closure under marginalization and how to quantify multivariate\ndependence. Due to a non-identifiability issue that our proposal inherits from\nthe projected normal, a compu- tational problem arises. We overcome it in a\nBayesian framework, adding suitable latent variables and showing that posterior\nsamples can be obtained with a post-processing of the estimation algo- rithm\noutput. Under specific prior choices, this approach enables us to implement a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm relying only on Gibbs steps, where the\nupdates of the parameters are done as if we were working with a multivariate\nnormal likelihood. The proposed approach can be also used with the projected\nnormal. As a proof of concept, on simulated examples we show the ability of our\nalgorithm in recovering the parameters values and to solve the identification\nproblem. Then the proposal is used in a real data example, where the\nturning-angles (circular variables) and the logarithm of the step-lengths\n(linear variables) of four zebras are jointly modelled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 09:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}
