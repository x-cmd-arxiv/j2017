In real graphs, virus may\ninfect a node which in turn infects its neighbor nodes and this may trigger an\nepidemic in the whole graph. The goal thus is to select the best k nodes\n(budget constraint) that are immunized (vaccinated, screened, filtered) so as\nthe remaining graph is less prone to the epidemic. It is known that the problem\nis, in all practical models, computationally intractable even for moderate\nsized graphs. In this paper we employ ideas from spectral graph theory to\ndefine relevance and importance of nodes. Using novel graph theoretic\ntechniques, we then design an efficient approximation algorithm to immunize the\ngraph. Theoretical guarantees on the running time of our algorithm show that it\nis more efficient than any other known solution in the literature. We test the\nperformance of our algorithm on several real world graphs. Experiments show\nthat our algorithm scales well for large graphs and outperforms state of the\nart algorithms both in quality (containment of epidemic) and efficiency\n(runtime and space complexity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

One way to mitigate this window of vulnerability is to\nuse a configuration workaround, which prevents the vulnerable code from being\nexecuted at the cost of some lost functionality -- but only if one is\navailable. Since program configurations are not specifically designed to\nmitigate software vulnerabilities, we find that they only cover 25.2% of\nvulnerabilities.\n  To minimize patch delay vulnerabilities and address the limitations of\nconfiguration workarounds, we propose Security Workarounds for Rapid Response\n(SWRRs), which are designed to neutralize security vulnerabilities in a timely,\nsecure, and unobtrusive manner. Similar to configuration workarounds, SWRRs\nneutralize vulnerabilities by preventing vulnerable code from being executed at\nthe cost of some lost functionality. However, the key difference is that SWRRs\nuse existing error-handling code within programs, which enables them to be\nmechanically inserted with minimal knowledge of the program and minimal\ndeveloper effort. This allows SWRRs to achieve high coverage while still being\nfast and easy to deploy.\n  We have designed and implemented Talos, a system that mechanically\ninstruments SWRRs into a given program, and evaluate it on five popular Linux\nserver programs. We run exploits against 11 real-world software vulnerabilities\nand show that SWRRs neutralize the vulnerabilities in all cases. Quantitative\nmeasurements on 320 SWRRs indicate that SWRRs instrumented by Talos can\nneutralize 75.1% of all potential vulnerabilities and incur a loss of\nfunctionality similar to configuration workarounds in 71.3% of those cases.

With the advent of ALMA\nand NOEMA, capable of detecting [CII]-line emission in high-redshift galaxies,\nthere has been a growing interest in using the [CII] line as a probe of the\nphysical conditions of the gas in galaxies, and as a SFR indicator at z>4. In\nthis paper, we use a semi-analytical model of galaxy evolution (G.A.S.)\ncombined with the code CLOUDY to predict the [CII] luminosity of a large number\nof galaxies at 4< z<8. At such high redshift, the CMB represents a strong\nbackground and we discuss its effects on the luminosity of the [CII] line. We\nstudy the LCII-SFR and LCII-Zg relations and show that they do not strongly\nevolve with redshift from z=4 and to z=8. Galaxies with higher [CII]\nluminosities tend to have higher metallicities and higher star formation rates\nbut the correlations are very broad, with a scatter of about 0.5 dex for\nLCII-SFR. Our model reproduces the LCII-SFR relations observed in high-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies, with [CII] luminosities lower than expected from local\nLCII-SFR relations. Accordingly, the local observed LCII-SFR relation does not\napply at high-z. Our model naturally produces the [CII] deficit, which appears\nto be strongly correlated with the intensity of the radiation field in our\nsimulated galaxies. We then predict the [CII] luminosity function, and show\nthat it has a power law form in the range of LCII probed by the model with a\nslope alpha=1. The slope is not evolving from z=4 to z=8 but the number density\nof [CII]-emitters decreases by a factor of 20x. We discuss our predictions in\nthe context of current observational estimates on both the differential and\ncumulative luminosity functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 16:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Emission was seen over a\nrange of 80 kms-1 in velocity and 50~mas (corresponding to 60~AU for a distance\nof 1200 pc). The emission at each frequency has two distinct components, one\nfrom gas in a nearly edge-on annular disk structure in Keplerian motion, and\nanother from gas lifted off the disk at distances of up to about 25~AU from the\nstar. The slopes of the position-velocity (PV) curves for the disk emission\nshow a monotonic progression of the emission radius with frequency with\nrelative radii of $0.85\\pm0.04$, 1, and $1.02\\pm0.01$ for the H26$\\alpha$,\nH30$\\alpha$, and H31$\\alpha$ transitions, respectively. This trend is\nconsistent with theoretical excitation models of maser emission from a region\nwhere the density decreases with radius and the lower transitions are\npreferentially excited at higher densities.

The mass estimate is constrained to be only in the range of 10--30\nsolar masses. The distribution of the wind emission among the transitions is\nsurprisingly different, which reflects its sensitivity to excitation\nconditions.

Moreover, no\nadditive or multiplicative polynomia are employed to adjust the spectral shape.\nThis fitting freedom is envisaged in order to map out the effect of intrinsic\nspectral energy distribution (SED) degeneracies, such as age, metallicity, dust\nreddening on galaxy properties, and to quantify the effect of varying input\nmodel components on such properties. Dust attenuation is included using a new\nprocedure, which was tested on Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) data in a\nprevious paper. The fitting method is extensively tested with a comprehensive\nsuite of mock galaxies, real galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nMilky Way globular clusters. We also assess the robustness of the derived\nproperties as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and adopted wavelength range.\nWe show that \\FF\\ is able to recover age, metallicity, stellar mass and even\nthe star formation history remarkably well down to a $S/N\\sim5$, for moderately\ndusty systems.

One solely relies on\nbase pair specific patterns of helix distortion being the same on the two\nmolecules, discussed extensively in the past. The other mechanism proposes that\nthere are preferential interactions between base pairs of the same composition.\nWe introduce a model, built on this second mechanism, where both thermal\nstretching and twisting fluctuations are included, as well as the base pair\nspecific helix distortions. Firstly, we consider an approximation for weak\npairing interactions, or short molecules. This yields a dependence of the\nenergy on the square root of the molecular length, which could explain recent\nexperimental data. However, analysis suggests that this approximation is\nno-longer valid at large DNA lengths. In a second approximation, for long\nmolecules, we define two adaptation lengths for twisting and stretching, over\nwhich the pairing interaction can limit the accumulation of helix disorder.\nWhen the pairing interaction is sufficiently strong, both adaptation lengths\nare finite; however, as we reduce pairing strength, the stretching adaptation\nlength remains finite but the torsional one becomes infinite. This second state\npersists to arbitrarily weak values of the pairing strength; suggesting that,\nif the molecules are long enough, the pairing energy scales as length. To probe\ndifferences between the two pairing mechanisms, we also construct a model of\nsimilar form. However, now, pairing between identical sequences solely relies\non the intrinsic helix distortion patterns. Between the two models, we see\ninteresting qualitative differences.

One\nmotivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be\ncaptured from images, from which similarities between different drug compounds\napplied at different doses can be quantified. The general approach is to find a\nfunction mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality\nwhose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important\nknown issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from\nnuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more\ncorrelated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than\nfor those from different weeks, despite having identical drug compounds applied\nin both cases. In this case, the particular batch in which a set of experiments\nwere conducted constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image\nembeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug\neffects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in\norder to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant\nbiological information. To achieve this, we minimize a loss function based on\ndistances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of\nembeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset we\npresent results with, the only replicated treatment happens to be the negative\ncontrol treatment, for which we do not expect any treatment-induced cell\nmorphology changes.

To ensure disentangled semantics in y\nand z, SGAN builds two collaborative games in the hidden space to minimize the\nreconstruction error of y and z, respectively.

To reduce the\nradiation dose, one can reduce the number of projection views (sparse-view CT);\nhowever, it becomes difficult to achieve high-quality image reconstruction as\nthe number of projection views decreases. Researchers have applied the concept\nof learning sparse representations from (high-quality) CT image dataset to the\nsparse-view CT reconstruction.

Yet determining this time is important for precision tests of the\ngeneral theory of relativity that compare an observed signal with quasinormal\nmode descriptions of the ringdown, such as tests of the no-hair theorem. We\npresent an algorithmic method to analyze the choice of ringdown start time in\nthe observed waveform. This method is based on determining how close the strong\nfield is to a Kerr black hole (Kerrness). Using numerical relativity\nsimulations, we characterize the Kerrness of the strong-field region close to\nthe black hole using a set of local, gauge-invariant geometric and algebraic\nconditions that measure local isometry to Kerr. We produce a map that\nassociates each time in the gravitational waveform with a value of each of\nthese Kerrness measures; this map is produced by following outgoing null\ncharacteristics from the strong and near-field regions to the wave zone. We\nperform this analysis on a numerical relativity simulation with parameters\nconsistent with GW150914- the first gravitational wave detection.

In this\npaper, we investigated the dependence of physiological tremor during tonic,\nisometric plantarflextion torque at 30% of maximum at three ankle angles. The\namplitude of physiological tremor increased as calf muscles shortened in\ncontrast to the stretch reflex whose amplitude decreases as muscle shortens. We\nused a closed-loop simulation model of afferented muscle to explore the\nmechanisms responsible for this behavior. We demonstrate that changing muscle\nlengths does not suffice to explain our experimental findings. Rather, the\nmodel consistently required the modulation of gamme-static fusimotor drive to\nproduce increases in physiological tremor with muscle shortening--while\nsuccessfully replicating the concomitant reduction in stretch reflex amplitude.\nThis need to control gamma-static fusimotor drive explicitly as a function of\nmuscle length has important implication. First, it permits the amplitudes of\nphysiological tremor and stretch reflex to be decoupled. Second, it postulates\nneuromechanical interaction that require length-dependent gamma drive\nmodulation to be independent from alpha drive to the parent muscle. Lastly, it\nsuggests that physiological tremor can be used as a simple, non-invasive\nmeasure of the afferent mechanisms underlying healthy motor function, and their\ndisruption in neurological conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 20:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

We determine the mean walklength of\nthe diffusing reactant until irreversible reaction occurs. We use generating\nfunctions and the theory of finite Markov processes, as well as MC simulations.\nTo investigate the dependence of walklength on lattice size we compute the\nfirst, finite size corrections to the Green function of the sc lattice, and\nprovide a Pad\\'e approximation for this quantity. Finally, we consider the case\nwhere both reactant and co-reactant undergo synchronous nearest-neighbor\ndisplacements [\"two-walker (2W) problem\"]. In this case, reactant and\nco-reactant can individually be trapped with probability $s$ at any vacant\nlattice site, or can undergo an irreversible reaction on first encounter at any\nsite.

However, previous theoretical analyses of EAs mainly focused on\nnoise-free optimization, which makes the theoretical understanding largely\ninsufficient for the noisy case. Meanwhile, the few existing theoretical\nstudies under noise often considered the one-bit noise model, which flips a\nrandomly chosen bit of a solution before evaluation; while in many realistic\napplications, several bits of a solution can be changed simultaneously.

This approach has the drawback of\nrequiring very high energy, up to the multi-GeV-scale, electron beams, to\nobtain the required photon energy. Due to the limit in accelerating gradients\nin conventional particle accelerators, reaching high energy typically demands\nuse of instruments exceeding 100's of meters in length. Compact, less costly,\nmonochromatic X-ray sources based on very high field acceleration and very\nshort period undulators, however, may revolutionize diverse advanced X-ray\napplications ranging from novel X-ray therapy techniques to active\ninterrogation of sensitive materials, by making them accessible in cost and\nsize. Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach, which\nemploys a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron\nlaser (IFEL), followed by a collision point for inverse Compton scattering\n(ICS), a scheme where a laser is used to provide undulator fields. We present\nan experimental proof-of-principle of this approach, where a TW-class CO2 laser\npulse is split in two, with half used to accelerate a high quality electron\nbeam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction, and the other half acts as an\nelectromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS. These\nresults demonstrate the feasibility of this scheme, which can be joined with\nother techniques such as laser recirculation to yield very compact, high\nbrilliance photon sources, extending from the keV to MeV scale. Furthermore,\nuse of the IFEL acceleration with the ICS interaction produces a train of very\nhigh intensity X-ray pulses, thus also permitting a unique tool that can be\nphase-locked to a laser pulse in frontier pump-probe experimental scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 23:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

Effective computational prediction of the most stable polymorph\ncould save significant time and effort in the design of novel molecular\ncrystalline solids or predict their behavior under new conditions.\n  In this study, we introduce a new approach using multistate reweighting to\naddress the problem of determining solid-solid phase diagrams, and apply this\napproach to the phase diagram of solid benzene.

Most practical\nsystems today route information from the source to the destination using the\nbest path that connects them. In this paper, we show that routing can in the\nworst case result in an unbounded gap from the network capacity - or reversely,\nphysical layer cooperation can offer unbounded gains over routing. More\nspecifically, we show that for $N$-relay Gaussian networks with an arbitrary\ntopology, routing can in the worst case guarantee an approximate fraction\n$\\frac{1}{\\left\\lfloor N/2 \\right\\rfloor + 1}$ of the capacity of the full\nnetwork, independently of the SNR regime. We prove that this guarantee is\nfundamental, i.e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that we can provide\nfor routing in relay networks. Next, we consider how these guarantees are\nrefined for Gaussian layered relay networks with $L$ layers and $N_L$ relays\nper layer. We prove that for arbitrary $L$ and $N_L$, there always exists a\nroute in the network that approximately achieves at least $\\frac{2}{(L-1)N_L +\n4}$ $\\left(\\mbox{resp.}\\frac{2}{LN_L+2}\\right)$ of the network capacity for odd\n$L$ (resp. even $L$), and there exist networks where the best routes exactly\nachieve these fractions. These results are formulated within the network\nsimplification framework, that asks what fraction of the capacity we can\nachieve by using a subnetwork (in our case, a single path). A fundamental step\nin our proof is a simplification result for MIMO antenna selection that may\nalso be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst result that characterizes, for general wireless network topologies, what\nis the performance of routing with respect to physical layer cooperation\ntechniques that approximately achieve the network capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 03:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

In this\nwork, we present novel methods for Trojan protection and detection on field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) without the need for golden chips.

The machine\npipeline is two-staged consisting of a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and an\nExtractor that converts an RNN to symbolic rules.\n  To evaluate the quality of the learned symbolic rules, we propose a\nsampling-based similarity measurement between two infinite regular languages.\nWe conduct a case study using real-world data. In this work, we discuss the\nlimitations of existing techniques and possible improvements in the future. The\nresults show that with sufficient training data and a fair distribution of\nprogram paths it is feasible to deducing symbolic security rules for the\nOpenJDK library with millions lines of code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 04:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

In particular, energy transport in the nanoscale\nregime has attracted significant attention within the physical science\ncommunity due to its potential to explain complex phenomena like the electronic\nenergy transfer in molecular crystals or the Fenna-Matthews-Olson / light\nharvesting complexes in photosynthetic bacteria with long time coherences.\nEnergy transport in these systems is highly affected by environmental noise but\nsurprisingly not always in a detrimental way. It was recently found that\nsituations exist where noise actually enhances the transport phenomena. Such\nnoise can take many forms, but can be characterised in three basic behaviours:\nquantum, coloured or nonlocal. All have been shown potential to offer an energy\ntransport enhancement. The focus of this work is on quantum transport caused by\nstochastic environment with spatio-temporal correlation. We consider a\nmulti-site nearest neighbour interaction model with pure dephasing\nenvironmental noise with coloured and nonlocal character and show how an\naccelerated rate for the energy transfer results especially under\nanti-correlation. Negative spatial correlations provide another control\nparameter to help one establish the most efficient transfer of energy and may\nprovide new insights into the working of exciton transport in photosynthetic\ncomplexes.

Existing systems achieve elasticity\nfollowing a resource-centric approach that uses dynamic key partitioning across\nthe parallel instances, i.e. executors, to balance the workload and scale\noperators. However, such operator-level key repartitioning needs global\nsynchronization and prohibits rapid elasticity. To address this problem, we\npropose an executor-centric approach, whose core idea is to avoid\noperator-level key repartitioning while implementing each executor as the\nbuilding block of elasticity. Following this new approach, we design the\nElasticutor framework with two level of optimizations: i) a novel\nimplementation of executors, i.e., elastic executors, that perform elastic\nmulti-core execution via efficient intra-executor load balancing and executor\nscaling and ii) a global model-based scheduler that dynamically allocates CPU\ncores to executors based on the instantaneous workloads.

Here, we perform three-dimensional numerical experiments\nto examine the role of vortex shedding and the vortex-vortex interaction on the\nLAF response at Reynolds number Re=30,000. Here we investigate the dynamics of\nthe inverted foil for a novel configuration wherein we introduce a fixed\nsplitter plate at the trailing edge to suppress the vortex shedding from\ntrailing edge and inhibit the interaction between the counter-rotating\nvortices. We find that the inhibition of the interaction has an insignificant\neffect on the transverse flapping amplitudes, due to a relatively weaker\ncoupling between the counter-rotating vortices emanating from the leading edge\nand trailing edge. However, the inhibition of the trailing edge vortex reduces\nthe streamwise flapping amplitude, the flapping frequency and the net strain\nenergy of foil. To further generalize our understanding of the LAF, we next\nperform low-Reynolds number (Re$\\in[0.1,50]$) simulations for the identical\nfoil properties to realize the impact of vortex shedding on the large amplitude\nflapping. Due to the absence of vortex shedding process in the low-$Re$ regime,\nthe inverted foil no longer exhibits the periodic flapping. However, the\nflexible foil still loses its stability through divergence instability to\nundergo a large static deformation. Finally, we introduce an analogous\nanalytical model for the LAF based on the dynamics of an elastically mounted\nflat plate undergoing flow-induced pitching oscillations in a uniform stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 09:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The common features of these mechanisms, as well as the\ndifferences between them, are analyzed in the paper. In particular, it is shown\nthat the stabilization of quantum systems is possible without involvement of\nsuch concept as the collapse of wave function. For stabilization it is\nsufficient to have a stabilizing radiation flow with the Rabi frequency of\ntransitions exceeding some frequency. This frequency is inversely proportional\nto the lifetime of the state under stabilization. It is shown that the Top\nprinciple allows stabilizing unstable systems using affecting only those states\nto which these systems must go over.\n  It is shown that stabilization of unstable states by impact of rapidly\noscillating forces occurs by non-self-consistent exposure, i.e. the dynamics of\nstabilizing field is independent on the dynamics of the stabilized state.\nStabilization using the spinning top principle involves self-consistent forces,\nand thus, in many cases can be the most effective mechanism of stabilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 09:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

Owing to the\nnonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power\ntransfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In\nthis paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the\noptimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of\nthe ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In\nparticular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints\nat the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite\npolynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacity-achieving input\ndistribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with\na finite number of mass points. Furthermore, we show that the optimal input\ndistribution for the same problem without PP constraint is discrete whenever\nthe EH constraint is active and continuous zero-mean Gaussian, otherwise. Our\nnumerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP\nconstraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to\nthe AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 09:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

Previous studies have shown that\nstorage devices provide an opportunity to balance fluctuations in the power\ngrid. An economical operation of these devices is linked to solutions of\nprobabilistic optimization problems, due to the fact that future generation is\nnot deterministic in general. For this reason, reliable forecast methods as\nwell as appropriate robust optimization algorithms take an increasingly\nimportant role in future power operation systems. Taking an uncertain\navailability of electricity into account, we present a method to calculate\ncost-optimal charging strategies for energy storage units. The proposed method\nsolves subproblems which result from a sliding window approach applied on a\nlinear program by utilizing statistical measures. The prerequisite of this\nmethod is a recently developed fast algorithm for storage-related optimization\nproblems. To present the potential of the proposed method, a Power-To-Heat\nstorage system is investigated as an example using today's available forecast\ndata and a robust statistical measure. Second, the novel approach proposed here\nis compared with a common robust optimization method for stochastic scenario\nproblems.

For instance, if you are a skilled violinist, you will likely have\nan easier time learning to play cello. Similarly, when learning a new language\nyou take advantage of the languages you already speak. For instance, if your\nnative language is Norwegian and you decide to learn Dutch, the lexical overlap\nbetween these two languages will likely benefit your rate of language\nacquisition. This thesis deals with the intersection of learning multiple tasks\nand learning multiple languages in the context of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP), which can be defined as the study of computational processing of human\nlanguage. Although these two types of learning may seem different on the\nsurface, we will see that they share many similarities.\n  The traditional approach in NLP is to consider a single task for a single\nlanguage at a time. However, recent advances allow for broadening this\napproach, by considering data for multiple tasks and languages simultaneously.\nThis is an important approach to explore further as the key to improving the\nreliability of NLP, especially for low-resource languages, is to take advantage\nof all relevant data whenever possible. In doing so, the hope is that in the\nlong term, low-resource languages can benefit from the advances made in NLP\nwhich are currently to a large extent reserved for high-resource languages.\nThis, in turn, may then have positive consequences for, e.g., language\npreservation, as speakers of minority languages will have a lower degree of\npressure to using high-resource languages. In the short term, answering the\nspecific research questions posed should be of use to NLP researchers working\ntowards the same goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 10:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

Simulations\nwith varying parameters are generated to provide better estimates of the\nInstrument Response Functions (IRFs) of different observations. However, a\nlarge fraction of the simulation configuration remains preserved, leading to\ncomplete negligence of all related influences. Additionally, the simulation\nscheme relies on interpolations between different array configurations, which\nare never fully reproducing the actual configuration for a given observation.\nInterpolations are usually performed on zenith angles, off-axis angles, array\nmultiplicity, and the optical response of the instrument. With the advent of\nhybrid systems consisting of a large number of IACTs with different sizes,\ntypes, and camera configurations, the complexity of the interpolation and the\nsize of the phase space becomes increasingly prohibitive. Going beyond the\nexisting approaches, we introduce a new simulation and analysis concept which\ntakes into account the actual observation conditions as well as individual\ntelescope configurations of each observation run of a given data set. These\nrun-wise simulations (RWS) thus exhibit considerably reduced systematic\nuncertainties compared to the existing approach, and are also more\ncomputationally efficient and simple. The RWS framework has been implemented in\nthe H.E.S.S. software and tested, and is already being exploited in science\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 12:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

In this\nwork, we review contexts in which explanation is currently required under the\nlaw, and then list the technical considerations that must be considered if we\ndesired AI systems that could provide kinds of explanations that are currently\nrequired of humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 12:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 02:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 20:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The HHO method is\nformulated using cell and face unknowns which are polynomials of some degree\n$k\\geq0$. The key idea for the discrete eigenvalue problem is to introduce a\ndiscrete operator where the face unknowns have been eliminated. Using the\nabstract theory of spectral approximation of compact operators in Hilbert\nspaces, we prove that the eigenvalues converge as $h^{2t}$ and the\neigenfunctions as $h^{t}$ in the $H^1$-seminorm, where $h$ is the mesh-size,\n$t\\in [s,k+1]$ depends on the smoothness of the eigenfunctions, and $s>\\frac12$\nresults from the elliptic regularity theory. The convergence rates for smooth\neigenfunctions are thus $h^{2k+2}$ for the eigenvalues and $h^{k+1}$ for the\neigenfunctions. Our theoretical findings, which improve recent error estimates\nfor Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, are verified on various\nnumerical examples including smooth and non-smooth eigenfunctions. Moreover, we\nobserve numerically in one dimension for smooth eigenfunctions that the\neigenvalues superconverge as $h^{2k+4}$ for a specific value of the\nstabilization parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 13:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 02:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

The PLIAG method includes many existing algorithms in the\nliterature as special cases such as the proximal gradient method, the Bregman\nproximal gradient method (also called NoLips algorithm), the incremental\naggregated gradient method, the incremental aggregated proximal method, and the\nproximal incremental aggregated gradient method. It also includes some novel\ninteresting iteration schemes. First we show the PLIAG method is globally\nsublinearly convergent without requiring a growth condition, which extends the\nsublinear convergence result for the proximal gradient algorithm to incremental\naggregated type first order methods. Then by embedding a so-called Bregman\ndistance growth condition into a descent-type lemma to construct a special\nLyapunov function, we show that the PLIAG method is globally linearly\nconvergent in terms of both function values and Bregman distances to the\noptimal solution set, provided that the step size is not greater than some\npositive constant. These convergence results derived in this paper are all\nestablished beyond the standard assumptions in the literature (i.e., without\nrequiring the strong convexity and the Lipschitz gradient continuity of the\nsmooth part of the objective). When specialized to many existing algorithms,\nour results recover or supplement their convergence results under strictly\nweaker conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 13:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 06:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 08:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

The objective is to study the precipitation\nof high energy electrons and protons from Van-Allen radiation belts to lower\naltitude of 600-900 km due to resonance interaction with low frequency EM\nwaves. The unique communications system design of IITMSAT evolves from the\nchallenging downlink data requirement of 1 MB per day in the UHF band posed by\nthe mission and the satellite's payload, SPEED (Space based Proton and Electron\nEnergy Detector). To ensure continuous downlink data stream in the short Low\nearth Orbit passes, a robust physical layer protocol was designed to counter\ntime-varying aspects of a Space-Earth telecom link. For the on-board\ncommunications system, two types of design alternatives exist for each module.\nThe first option is a custom design wherein a module is developed from scratch\nusing discrete components.The other option is an integrated design wherein an\nelectronics COTS module can be directly plugged into the subsystem. This module\nis evaluated by carrying out vibration and thermal tests. If an integrated\nmodule is low-cost and meets the design requirements, it is preferred over a\ncustom design. In order to carry out performance tests under simulated link\nconditions, an RF attenuation test setup was designed that can work at extreme\ntemperatures. Burn-In tests for 72 hours at ambient and extreme temperatures\nwere carried out. Integrated tests indicate all IITMSAT design requirements\nhave been met. Hence a robust communications system has been validated. The\ntime taken for development of on-board telecom and GS was less than a year and\nwas achieved at a low cost which agrees to a LeanSat approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 13:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

A seed location filter comes into play before alignment,\ndiscarding seed locations that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal\nseed location filter would discard all poor match locations prior to alignment\nsuch that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments.\n  Results: We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter,\noptimized to exploit 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation\nwithin a logic layer stacked under memory layers, to perform\nprocessing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by 1)\nintroducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference\ngenome, and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read\npresence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for a\nsequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter 1) reduces the false\nnegative rate of filtering by 5.59x--6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read\nmapper speedup of 1.81x--3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper\nemploying the best previous seed location filtering algorithm.\n  Availability: The code is available online at:\nhttps://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/GRIM\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 16:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Here we explore its role in the\ncombined charge-photon dynamics of cavity-coupled double quantum dots. Previous\nwork on these systems has shown that strong electron-phonon coupling leads to a\nlarge contribution to photoemission and gain from phonon-assisted emission and\nabsorption processes. We compare the effects of this phonon sideband in three\ncommonly investigated gate-defined quantum dot material systems: InAs nanowires\nand GaAs and Si two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). We compare our theory\nwith existing experimental data from cavity-coupled InAs nanowire and GaAs 2DEG\ndouble quantum dots and find quantitative agreement only when the phonon\nsideband and photoemission processes during lead tunneling are taken into\naccount. Finally we show that the phonon sideband also leads to a sizable\nrenormalization of the cavity frequency, which allows for direct spectroscopic\nprobes of the electron-phonon coupling in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 14:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We find precise relations between the optimal rate at\nwhich interconversion can take place and the desired infidelity of the final\nstate when the system size is sufficiently large. These so-called second-order\nasymptotics provide a bridge between the extreme cases of single-shot\nthermodynamics and the asymptotic limit of infinitely large systems.

By supplying a theoretical basis and recipe for generating the\nperformance map, we hope to encourage the widespread adoption of this new\nmetric across subfields in exoplanet imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 15:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Our results show that the best performance is\nachieved by single-carrier modulation with time-domain equalization, which\nexhibits the smallest loss due to the non-linear distortion, and whose\nperformance can be further improved by using advanced equalization schemes.\nResults also confirm that performance gets severely degraded when the link\nlength exceeds 90-100 meters and the transmit power falls below 0 dBW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 21:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 15:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

The existing analysis\nfor algorithms using noise in the first-order information is quite involved and\nhides the essence of added noise, which hinder further improvements of these\nalgorithms. In this paper, we present a novel perspective of noise-adding\ntechnique, i.e., adding the noise into the first-order information can help\nextract the negative curvature from the Hessian matrix, and provide a formal\nreasoning of this perspective by analyzing a simple first-order procedure. More\nimportantly, the proposed procedure enables one to design purely first-order\nstochastic algorithms for escaping from non-degenerate saddle points with a\nmuch better time complexity (almost linear time in terms of the problem's\ndimensionality). In particular, we develop a {\\bf first-order stochastic\nalgorithm} based on our new technique and an existing algorithm that only\nconverges to a first-order stationary point to enjoy a time complexity of\n{$\\widetilde O(d/\\epsilon^{3.5})$ for finding a nearly second-order stationary\npoint $\\bf{x}$ such that $\\|\\nabla F(bf{x})\\|\\leq \\epsilon$ and $\\nabla^2\nF(bf{x})\\geq -\\sqrt{\\epsilon}I$ (in high probability), where $F(\\cdot)$ denotes\nthe objective function and $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem.

One of these applications\nis the process of making strong continuous filaments through hydrodynamic\nalignment and assembly of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) demonstrated by\nH{\\aa}kansson et al. [Nature communications 5, 2014]. In this process it is\nvital to study the alignment of the nanofibrils in the flow, as this in turn\naffects the final material properties of the dried filament. Small angle X-ray\nscattering (SAXS) is a well-suited characterization technique for this, which\ntypically provides the alignment in a projected plane perpendicular to the beam\ndirection. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to reconstruct the full\nthree-dimensional (3D) orientation distribution function (ODF) from a\nSAXS-experiment through the assumption that the azimuthal angle of the\nnanofibril around the flow direction is distributed uniformly; an assumption\nthat is approximately valid in the flow-focusing process. For demonstrational\npurposes, the experimental results from H{\\aa}kansson et al. (2014) have been\nrevised, resulting in a small correction to the presented order parameters. The\nresults are then directly compared with simple numerical models to describe the\nincreased alignment of CNF both in the flowing system and during the drying\nprocess. The proposed reconstruction method will allow for further improvements\nof theoretical or numerical simulations and consequently open up new\npossibilities for optimizing assembly processes, which include flow-alignment\nof elongated nanoparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 14:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}
