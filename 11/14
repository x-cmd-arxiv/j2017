Such near duplicates decrease documentation\nquality and thus hamper its further utilization. At the same time, they are\nhard to detect manually due to their fuzzy nature. In this paper we give a\nformal definition of near duplicates and present an algorithm for their\ndetection in software documents. This algorithm is based on the exact software\nclone detection approach: the software clone detection tool Clone Miner was\nadapted to detect exact duplicates in documents. Then, our algorithm uses these\nexact duplicates to construct near ones. We evaluate the proposed algorithm\nusing the documentation of 19 open source and commercial projects. Our\nevaluation is very comprehensive - it covers various documentation types:\ndesign and requirement specifications, programming guides and API\ndocumentation, user manuals. Overall, the evaluation shows that all kinds of\nsoftware documentation contain a significant number of both exact and near\nduplicates. Next, we report on the performed manual analysis of the detected\nnear duplicates for the Linux Kernel Documentation. We present both quantative\nand qualitative results of this analysis, demonstrate algorithm strengths and\nweaknesses, and discuss the benefits of duplicate management in software\ndocuments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 17:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

By\ncoadding hundreds of Ulysses He beam maps together to maximize signal-to-noise,\nwe identify a weak signal that is credibly associated with the secondary\ncomponent. Assuming a laminar flow from infinity, we infer the following He\nflow parameters: V=12.8+/-1.9 km/s, lambda=74.4+/-1.8 deg, beta=-10.5+/-4.1\ndeg, and T=3000+/-1100 K; where lambda and beta are the ecliptic longitude and\nlatitude direction in J2000 coordinates.

In addition, there is an obvious interest in both communities in\nobtaining risk bounds that require weak moment assumptions or\n``heavier-tails''. In this work we use a localization toolbox to derive risk\nbounds in two specific applications. The first is in portfolio risk\nminimization with conditional value-at-risk constraints. We consider a setting\nwhere, among all assets with high returns, there is a portion of dimension $g$,\nunknown to the investor, that has significant less risk than the other\nremaining portion. Our rates for the SAA problem show that ``risk inflation'',\ncaused by a multiplicative factor, affects the statistical rate only via a term\nproportional to $g$. As the ``normalized risk'' increases, the contribution in\nthe rate from the extrinsic dimension diminishes while the dependence on $g$ is\nkept fixed. Localization is a key tool to show this property. As a second\napplication of our localization toolbox, we obtain sharp oracle inequalities\nfor least-squares estimators with a Lasso-type constraint under weak moment\nassumptions.

The\nstronger condition that all singular values of the Jacobian concentrate near\n$1$ is a property known as dynamical isometry. For deep linear networks,\ndynamical isometry can be achieved through orthogonal weight initialization and\nhas been shown to dramatically speed up learning; however, it has remained\nunclear how to extend these results to the nonlinear setting. We address this\nquestion by employing powerful tools from free probability theory to compute\nanalytically the entire singular value distribution of a deep network's\ninput-output Jacobian.

This is the first partitioned algorithm that remains\nstable and second-order accurate, without sub-time-step iterations, for very\nlight, and even zero-mass, bodies in three dimensions. This new added-mass\npartitioned (AMP) algorithm extends the previous developments in [1, 2] by\ngeneralizing the added-damping tensors to account for arbitrary\nthree-dimensional rotations, and by employing a general quadrature for the\nsurface integral over a rigid body to derive the discrete AMP interface\ncondition for the fluid pressure. Stability analyses for two three-dimensional\nmodel problems show that the algorithm remains stable for bodies of any mass\nwhen applied to the relevant model problems. The resulting AMP algorithm is\nimplemented in parallel using a moving composite grid framework to treat one or\nmore rigid bodies in complex three-dimensional configurations. The new\nthree-dimensional algorithm is verified and validated though several benchmark\nproblems, including the motion of a sphere in a viscous incompressible fluid\nand the interaction of a bi-leaflet mechanical heart valve and a pulsating\nfluid. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the stability analysis\neven for complex problems, and show that the AMP algorithm remains stable,\nwithout sub-iterations, for light and even zero-mass three-dimensional rigid\nbodies of general shape. These benchmark problems are further used to examine\nthe parallel performance of the algorithm and to investigate the conditioning\nof the linear system for the pressure including the newly derived AMP interface\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 18:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 11:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

For the data collected from subjects in different unknown groups, a\nGaussian process functional regression model with time warping is used as the\nfirst level model; an allocation model depending on scalar variables is used as\nthe second level model providing further information over the groups. The\nformer carries out registration and modeling for the multi-dimensional\nfunctional data (2D or 3D curves) at the same time. This methodology is\nimplemented using an EM algorithm, and is examined on both simulated data and\nreal data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 18:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

These observations have generally been\ninterpreted to be consistent with a large-scale laminar magnetic wind driving\naccretion. Here, we carry out local, shearing box simulations with varying\nionization levels and background magnetic field strengths in order to determine\nwhich parameters produce results consistent with observations.

Key to\nthe DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an\nAnderson impurity model, the ground state of which is computed using an\nimpurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited by the complexity of\nthe impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems\ngenerally requires many correlated sites.

The\nkey feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant\nHilbert space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state. This reduces the\nnumerical complexity of the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future\nDMFT simulations with more correlated impurity sites than in previous works.\nHere we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the\none-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient\nconvergence and timing properties.

We establish a\nframework for answering. Additionally, we construct applications of biological\nqubits to quantum error correction, quantum communication, and quantum\ncomputation. First, we posit how the QI encoded by the spins transforms as\nPosner molecules form. The transformation points to a natural computational\nbasis for qubits in Posner molecules. From the basis, we construct a quantum\ncode that detects arbitrary single-qubit errors. Each molecule encodes one\nqutrit. Shifting from information storage to computation, we define the model\nof Posner quantum computation. To illustrate the model's quantum-communication\nability, we show how it can teleport information incoherently: A state's\nweights are teleported. Dephasing results from the entangling operation's\nsimulation of a coarse-grained Bell measurement. Whether Posner quantum\ncomputation is universal remains an open question. However, the model's\noperations can efficiently prepare a Posner state usable as a resource in\nuniversal measurement-based quantum computation.

Our evaluation uses a representative real-time control\nsystem (along with synthetic task sets for a broader exploration) to illustrate\nthe efficacy of HYDRA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 19:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Observational studies in\ninfectious disease research present the additional challenge that one\nparticipant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there\nmay be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects\nin the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands\ndesigned specifically for use with observational studies are proposed.\nPreviously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which\nindividuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in\nsettings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it\nmay be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in\nthe same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual\nscenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as\nin the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in\nthe individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for\npolicy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of\nincreasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse\nprobability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The\nlarge-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study\ndemonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented.

However, most of the previous studies only focus on\nsingle-value prediction. Considering the uncertain and chaotic nature of the\ntransportation system, an accurate and reliable prediction interval with upper\nand lower bounds may be better than a single point value for transportation\nmanagement. In this paper, we introduce a neural network model called Extreme\nLearning Machine (ELM) for interval prediction of short-term traffic volume and\nimprove it with the heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The\nhybrid PSO-ELM model can generate the prediction intervals under different\nconfidence levels and guarantee the quality by minimizing a multi-objective\nfunction which considers two criteria reliability and interval sharpness. The\nPSO-ELM models are built based on an hourly traffic dataset and compared with\nARMA and Kalman Filter models. The results show that ARMA models are the worst\nfor all confidence levels, and the PSO-ELM models are comparable with Kalman\nFilter from the aspects of reliability and narrowness of the intervals,\nalthough the parameters of PSO-ELM are fixed once the training is done while\nKalman Filter is updated in an online approach. Additionally, only the PSO-ELMs\nare able to produce intervals with coverage probabilities higher than or equal\nto the confidence levels. For the points outside of the prediction levels given\nby PSO-ELMs, they lie very close to the bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

The resulting system for the\ncargo position is consequently an SDE that randomly switches according to a\nMarkov jump process governing motor dynamics. To study this system we (1) cast\nthe cargo position in a renewal theory framework and generalize the renewal\nreward theorem and (2) decompose the continuous and discrete sources of\nstochasticity and exploit a resulting pair of disparate timescales. With these\nmathematical tools, we obtain explicit formulas for experimentally measurable\nquantities, such as cargo velocity and run length. Analyzing these formulas\nthen yields some predictions regarding so-called non-processive clustering, the\nphenomenon that a single motor cannot transport cargo, but that two or more\nmotors can.

In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the\nstochastic binding of signaling molecules at low concentrations. Using\nchemotaxis of sperm cells as application example, we address the classic\nproblem of chemotaxis towards a single target. We reveal a fundamental\nrelationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of\ndirectional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in the\nchemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between slow, but\nreliable, and fast, but less reliable, steering.\n  By formulating the problem of optimal navigation in the presence of noise as\na Markov decision process, we show that dynamic switching between reliable and\nfast steering substantially increases the probability to find a target, such as\nthe egg. Intriguingly, this decision making would provide no benefit in the\nabsence of noise. Instead, decision making is most beneficial, if chemical\nsignals are above detection threshold, yet signal-to-noise ratios of gradient\nmeasurements are low. This situation generically arises at intermediate\ndistances from a target, where signaling molecules emitted by the target are\ndiluted, thus defining a `noise zone' that cells have to cross.\n  Our work addresses the intermediate case between well-studied perfect\nchemotaxis at high signal-to-noise ratios close to a target, and random search\nstrategies in the absence of navigation cues, e.g. far away from a target. Our\nspecific results provide a rational for the surprising observation of decision\nmaking in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. The general theory\ndemonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high\nlevels of noise in gradient measurements by dynamically adjusting the\npersistence length of a biased persistent random walk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 21:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In future power electronic-based power\nsystems, the same role can be played by strategically located virtual inertia\ndevices. However, the question looms large as to how the system operators would\nprocure and pay for these devices.

An important case, especially in quantum physics, is the\ncomputation of the spectrum of a Schr\\\"odinger operator with a disordered\npotential. Unlike plane waves or Bloch waves that arise as Schr\\\"odinger\neigenfunctions for periodic and other ordered potentials, for many forms of\ndisordered potentials the eigenfunctions remain essentially localized in a very\nsmall subset of the initial domain. A celebrated example is Anderson\nlocalization, for which, in a continuous version, the potential is a piecewise\nconstant function on a uniform grid whose values are sampled independently from\na uniform random distribution. We present here a new method for approximating\nthe eigenvalues and the subregions which support such localized eigenfunctions.\nThis approach is based on the recent theoretical tools of the localization\nlandscape and effective potential. The approach is deterministic, predicting\nquantities that depend sensitively on the particular realization, rather than\nfurnishing statistical or probabilistic results about the spectrum associated\nto a family of potentials with a certain distribution. These methods, which\nhave only been partially justified theoretically, enable the calculation of the\nlocations and shapes of the approximate supports of the eigenfunctions, the\napproximate values of many of the eigenvalues, and of the eigenvalue counting\nfunction and density of states, all at the cost of solving a single source\nproblem for the same elliptic operator.

The existing secure biometric\nauthentication schemes feature a server-centric model, where a service provider\nmaintains a biometric database and is fully responsible for the security of the\ntemplates. The end-users have to fully trust the server in storing, processing\nand managing their private templates. As a result, the end-users' templates\ncould be compromised by outside attackers or even the service provider itself.\nIn this paper, we propose a user-centric biometric authentication scheme\n(PassBio) that enables end-users to encrypt their own templates with our\nproposed light-weighted encryption scheme. During authentication, all the\ntemplates remain encrypted such that the server will never see them directly.\nHowever, the server is able to determine whether the distance of two encrypted\ntemplates is within a pre-defined threshold. Our security analysis shows that\nno critical information of the templates can be revealed under both passive and\nactive attacks. PassBio follows a \"compute-then-compare\" computational model\nover encrypted data. More specifically, our proposed Threshold Predicate\nEncryption (TPE) scheme can encrypt two vectors x and y in such a manner that\nthe inner product of x and y can be evaluated and compared to a pre-defined\nthreshold. TPE guarantees that only the comparison result is revealed and no\nkey information about x and y can be learned. Furthermore, we show that TPE can\nbe utilized as a flexible building block to evaluate different distance metrics\nsuch as Hamming distance and Euclidean distance over encrypted data. Such a\ncompute-then-compare computational model, enabled by TPE, can be widely applied\nin many interesting applications such as searching over encrypted data while\nensuring data security and privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 01:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

During the filament eruption, an EUV wave at a speed of 182 {\n317 km/s was formed ahead of an expanding coronal loop, which propagated faster\nthan the expanding loop and showed obvious deceleration and refection during\nthe propagation. In addition, the EUV wave further resulted in the transverse\noscillation of a remote filament whose period and damping time are 15 and 60\nminutes, respectively.

In GSK, the secret messages are generated by a cover image using a\ngenerator rather than embedded into the cover, thus resulting in no\nmodifications in the cover. To ensure the security, the generators are trained\nto meet Kerckhoffs' principle based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).\nEverything about the GSK system, except the extraction key, is public knowledge\nfor the receivers. The secret messages can be outputted by the generator if and\nonly if the extraction key and the cover image are both inputted.

Thus some image-based\nsmall-data applications first train their framework on a collection of patches\n(instead of the entire image) to better learn the representation of localized\nartifacts.

This paradoxical effect may be exploited in psychophysical\nexperiments, to provide additional insights into how the sensory system deals\nwith noise. Here, I develop a model for stochastic resonance to study the\ninfluence of noise on human perception, in which the biological parameter of\n`lapse rate' was included. I show that the inclusion of lapse rate allows for\nthe occurrence of stochastic resonance in terms of the performance metric d'.\nAt the same time, I show that high levels of lapse rate cause stochastic\nresonance to disappear. It is also shown that noise generated in the brain\n(i.e., internal noise) may obscure any effect of stochastic resonance in\nexperimental settings. I further relate the model to a standard equivalent\nnoise model, the linear amplifier model, and show that the lapse rate can\nfunction to scale the threshold versus noise (TvN) curve, similar to the\nefficiency parameter in equivalent noise (EN) models. Therefore, lapse rate\nprovides a psychophysical explanation for reduced efficiency in EN paradigms.\nFurthermore, I note that ignoring lapse rate may lead to an overestimation of\ninternal noise in equivalent noise paradigms. Overall, describing stochastic\nresonance in terms of signal detection theory, with the inclusion of lapse\nrate, may provide valuable new insights into how human performance depends on\ninternal and external noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 04:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

The latter game is played with two piles of stones, and\ntwo players take turns removing stones from one or both piles; when removing\nstones from both piles, the numbers of stones removed from each pile must be\nequal. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. An\nequivalent description of the game is that a single chess queen is placed\nsomewhere on a large grid of squares, and each player can move the queen\ntowards the upper left corner of the grid: leftward, upward, or to the upper\nleft, any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into\nthe upper left corner. In Wythoff's game with a pass, we modify the standard\nrules of the game so as to allow for a one-time pass, i.e., a pass move which\nmay be used at most once in a game, and not from a terminal position. Once the\npass has been used by either player, it is no longer available. The author\ndiscovered that, when a pass move is available, the set of\n$\\mathcal{P}$-positions (previsous player's position) of the Wythoff's game\nwith a pass is equal to $ T_0 \\cup T_1\\cup B -A$, where $T_0 = \\{(x,y):\n\\mathcal{G}(x,y)=0 \\}$, $T_0 = \\{(x,y): \\mathcal{G}(x,y)=1 \\}$, $B$ is a finite\nsubset of $\\{(x,y): \\mathcal{G}(x,y)=4 \\}$, $A$ is a finite subset of $T_0$ and\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is the Grundy number of the classical Wythoff game.

A key concern in such pervasive computing environment is the need to\nreveal the user's exact location which may allow an adversary to infer private\ninformation about the user. To address the privacy concerns of LBS users, a\nlarge number of security approaches have been proposed based on the concept of\nk-anonymity. The central idea in location k-anonymity is to find a set of k-1\nusers confined in a given geographical area of the actual user, such that the\nlocation of these k users are indistinguishable from one another, thus\nprotecting the identity of the user. Although a number of performance\nparameters like success rate, amount of privacy achieved are used to measure\nthe performance of the k-anonymity approaches, they make the implicit,\nunrealistic assumption that the k-1 users are readily available. As such these\napproaches ignore the turnaround time to process a user request, which is\ncrucial for a real-time application like LBS. In this work, we model the\nk-anonymity approaches using queuing theory to compute the average sojourn time\nof users and queue length of the system. To demonstrate that queuing theory can\nbe used to model all k-anonymity approaches, we consider graph-based\nk-anonymity approaches.

Each job takes one slot to be processed, and multiple jobs can\nbe processed by the server in each slot with energy cost $g(k)$ for processing\n$k$ jobs in one slot. The payoff is accrued by the algorithm only if the job is\nprocessed by its deadline. We consider a robust version of this speed scaling\nproblem, where a job on its arrival reveals its payoff $v$, however, the\ndeadline is hidden to the online algorithm, which could potentially be chosen\nadversarially and known to the optimal offline algorithm. The objective is to\nderive a robust (to deadlines) and optimal online algorithm that achieves the\nbest competitive ratio.

These characteristics are\nestimated quantitatively through statistical treatment of the non-equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulation results for the system under steady shear at\nvarious (fixed) values of the shear rate $\\dot\\gamma$ and at different\ntemperatures. It is found that the sheared glassy system is crystallized\nthrough nucleation mechanism.

It is shown that the critically-sized nuclei in\nthe system are oriented within the shear-gradient $xy$-plane at moderate and\nhigh shear rates; and a tilt angle of the oriented nuclei depends on the shear\nrate. At extremely high shear rates and at shear deformation of the system more\nthan $60$\\%, the tilt angle of the nuclei tends to take the value\n$\\simeq45^\\circ$ respective to the shear direction.

Firstly, it is shown that a\nnetworked Kalman filter with optimal gain parameter is actually a centralized\nfilter, since it requires each sensor to have global information which is\nusually forbidden in large networks. Then, a sub-optimal distributed Kalman\nfilter (DKF) is proposed by employing the covariance intersection (CI) fusion\nstrategy. It is proven that the proposed DKF is of consistency, that is, the\nupper bound of error covariance matrix can be provided by the filter in real\ntime. The consistency also enables the design of adaptive CI weights for better\nfilter precision. Furthermore, the boundedness of covariance matrix and the\nconvergence of the proposed filter are proven based on the strong connectivity\nof directed network topology and the global observability which permits the\nsub-system with local sensor's measurements to be unobservable. Meanwhile, to\nkeep the covariance of the estimation error bounded, the proposed DKF does not\nrequire the system matrix to be nonsingular at each moment, which seems to be a\nnecessary condition in the main DKF designs under global observability.\nFinally, simulation results of two examples show the effectiveness of the\nalgorithm in the considered scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is\nlimited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial\nresolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular\nprotein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately,\nrecent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' far-field\noptical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion\n(STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical\n(fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy\n(PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured\nillumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy\n(SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial\nresolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold\nimprovement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy,\nSTED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of\noptical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all\nsuper-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because\nthe field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution\nmicroscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain\nwhen considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the\nroad to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist.

It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a\ncollection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a\nthorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical\nmicroscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label\noptimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in\nwhich these methods will have a significant impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Convective regions in stellar models are always associated with\nuncertainties, for example due to extra-mixing or the possible inaccurate\nposition of the transition from convective to radiative transport of energy.\nThese have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters.\nThe most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use\nasteroseismology to derive diagnostics probing the structural characteristics\nof these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made integrated quantities to\nimprove the capabilities of seismology to probe convective regions in stellar\ninteriors. We hope to increase the number of indicators obtained with\nstructural seismic inversions to provide additional constraints on stellar\nmodels and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical modeling.\nMethods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy\nin stellar interiors.

There is however a caveat in this approach. There are\nsystematic experimental discrepancies on the electronic structure of the most\npristine surfaces of TI single crystals as determined by Shubnikov de Haas\n(SdH) oscillations and by Angle Resolved PhotoElectron Spectroscopy (ARPES). We\nidentify intense ultraviolet illumination -that is inherent to an ARPES\nexperiment- as the source for these experimental differences. We explicitly\nshow that illumination is the key parameter, or in other words the trigger, for\nenergetic shifts of electronic bands near the surface of a TI crystal. This\nfinding revisits the common belief that surface decoration is the principal\ncause of surface band bending and explains why band bending is not a prime\nissue in the illumination-free magneto-transport studies. Our study further\nclarifies the role of illumination on the electronic band structure of TIs by\nrevealing its dual effect: downward band bending on very small timescales\nfollowed by band flattening at large timescales. Our results therefore allow us\nto present and predict the complete evolution of the band structure of TIs in a\ntypical ARPES experiment.

Our first contribution is a quantitative study\ndemonstrating that the harmful effects of spurious transitions on heuristic\nfunctions can be substantial, in terms of both the increase in the number of\nabstract states and the decrease in the heuristic values, which may slow down\nsearch.

Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are getting more and\nmore popular and has demonstrated its effectiveness in many tasks. The last\nhidden state is usually applied as the sequence's representation to make\nrecommendation. Benefit from the natural characteristics of RNN, the hidden\nstate is a combination of long-term dependency and short-term interest to some\ndegrees. However, the monotonic temporal dependency of RNN impairs the user's\nshort-term interest. Consequently, the hidden state is not sufficient to\nreflect the user's final interest. In this work, to deal with this problem, we\npropose a Hierarchical Contextual Attention-based GRU (HCA-GRU) network. The\nfirst level of HCA-GRU is conducted on the input. We construct a contextual\ninput by using several recent inputs based on the attention mechanism. This can\nmodel the complicated correlations among recent items and strengthen the hidden\nstate. The second level is executed on the hidden state. We fuse the current\nhidden state and a contextual hidden state built by the attention mechanism,\nwhich leads to a more suitable user's overall interest. Experiments on two\nreal-world datasets show that HCA-GRU can effectively generate the personalized\nranking list and achieve significant improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 14:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 03:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 05:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

At the same time, evidence\nis accumulating on a millisecond pulsar (MSPs) origin for the GCE.

It is remarkable that without free fitting\nparameters, this model can account for both the energetics and the morphology\nof the GCE within uncertainties. For M31, the estimated luminosity due to\nprimordial MSPs is expected to contribute only about a quarter of the detected\nemission, although a dominant contribution cannot be excluded given the large\nuncertainties. If correct, the model predicts that the M31 disk emission due to\nMSP is not far below the present upper bound. We also discuss a few refinements\nof this simple model.

Prior nearly-linear-time\nspectral sparsification methods first extract low-stretch spanning tree from\nthe original graph to form the backbone of the sparsifier, and then recover\nsmall portions of spectrally-critical off-tree edges to the spanning tree to\nsignificantly improve the approximation quality. However, it is not clear how\nmany off-tree edges should be recovered for achieving a desired spectral\nsimilarity level within the sparsifier. Motivated by recent graph signal\nprocessing techniques, this paper proposes a similarity-aware spectral graph\nsparsification framework that leverages efficient spectral off-tree edge\nembedding and filtering schemes to construct spectral sparsifiers with\nguaranteed spectral similarity (relative condition number) level. An iterative\ngraph densification scheme is introduced to facilitate efficient and effective\nfiltering of off-tree edges for highly ill-conditioned problems. The proposed\nmethod has been validated using various kinds of graphs obtained from public\ndomain sparse matrix collections relevant to VLSI CAD, finite element analysis,\nas well as social and data networks frequently studied in many machine learning\nand data mining applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 14:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 06:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2018 23:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

In this paper, we aim to measure the strength of the surface magnetic\nfields for a sample of five intermediate mass T Tauri stars and one low mass T\nTauri star from late-F to mid-K spectral types. While magnetic fields of T\nTauri stars at the low mass range have been extensively characterized, our work\ncomplements previous studies towards the intermediate mass range; this\ncomplementary study is key to evaluate how magnetic fields evolve during the\ntransition from a convective to a radiative core.\n  Methods. We studied the Zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive spectral\nlines in the H-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES high-resolution\nnear-infrared spectrometer. These data are modelled using magnetic spectral\nsynthesis and model atmospheres. Additional constraints on non-magnetic line\nbroadening mechanisms are obtained from modelling molecular lines in the K band\nor atomic lines in the optical wavelength region.\n  Results.

We propose instead to demand\nstatistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many\nsubgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected\nattributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and\nrecently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several\ncomputational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier\nto see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness.

In order to deal with high-dimensional\nproblems, efficient sparse fast Fourier transform algorithms are essential\ntools. The second and third authors have recently proposed a\ndimension-incremental approach, which only scales almost linear in the number\nof required sampling values and almost quadratic in the arithmetic complexity\nwith respect to the spatial dimension $d$. Using reconstructing rank-1 lattices\nas sampling scheme, the method showed reliable reconstruction results in\nnumerical tests but suffers from relatively large numbers of samples and\narithmetic operations. Combining the preferable properties of reconstructing\nrank-1 lattices with small sample and arithmetic complexities, the first author\ndeveloped the concept of multiple rank-1 lattices. In this paper, both concepts\n- dimension-incremental reconstruction and multiple rank-1 lattices - are\ncoupled, which yields a distinctly improved high-dimensional sparse fast\nFourier transform. Moreover, the resulting algorithm is analyzed in detail with\nrespect to success probability, number of required samples, and arithmetic\ncomplexity. In comparison to single rank-1 lattices, the utilization of\nmultiple rank-1 lattices results in a reduction in the complexities by an\nalmost linear factor with respect to the sparsity.

However, their modelling is still\nchallenging. Therefore, a finite element setting is proposed to better\ninvestigate this complex issue. The variational formulation of a liquid-air\nStokes system is established, while the solid substrate is described through\nboundary conditions. Expressing the weak form of Laplace's law over liquid-air,\nliquid-solid and air-solid interfaces, leads to a natural enforcement of the\nmechanical equilibrium over the wetting line, without imposing explicitly the\ncontact angle itself. The mechanical problem is discretized by using finite\nelements, linear both in velocity and pressure, stabilized with a variational\nmultiscale method, including the possibility of enrichment of the pressure\nspace. The moving interface is captured by a Level-Set methodology, combined\nwith a mesh adaptation technique with respect to both pressure and level-set\nfields.

The\ngoals of this paper are to figure out whether the distributions of bi-national\nwait times for commercial and passenger vehicles are evenly distributed among\nthe three ports and uncover the hidden significant influential factors that\nresult in the possible insufficient utilization. The historical border wait\ntime data from 7:00 to 21:00 between 08/22/2016 and 06/20/2017 are archived, as\nwell as the corresponding temporal and weather data. For each vehicle type\ntowards each direction, a Decision Tree is built to identify the various border\ndelay patterns over the three bridges.

For the passenger vehicles in the\nother bound, RB is much more congested than LQ and PB in some cases, and the\nvisitors to Niagara Falls in the USA in summer may be a reason. For the\ncommercial trucks to the USA, the various delay patterns show PB is always more\ncongested than LQ.

While DG\nunits tend to increase their profit from the energy purchase contract, DisCo\nminimizes the demand supply cost. Multi-leader follower game theory concept is\nused to analyze the situation in which competing DG units offer the energy\nprice to DisCo and DisCo determines the DG generation. A bi-level approach is\nused to formulate the competition in which each DG problem is the upper-level\nproblem and the DisCo problem is considered as the lower-level one. Combining\nthe optimality conditions ofall upper-level problems with the lower level\nproblem results in a multi-DG equilibrium problem formulated as an equilibrium\nproblem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Using a nonlinear approach, the\nEPEC problem is reformulated as a single nonlinear optimization model which is\nsimultaneously solved for all independent DG units.
