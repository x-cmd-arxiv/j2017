In turn, the stellar rotation\nperiod evolves as a result of magnetised stellar winds that carry away angular\nmomentum. Understanding the interplay between magnetic activity and stellar\nrotation is therefore a central task for stellar astrophysics. Angular momentum\nevolution models typically employ spin-down torques that are formulated in\nterms of the surface magnetic field strength. However, these formulations fail\nto account for the magnetic field geometry, unlike those that are expressed in\nterms of the open flux, i.e. the magnetic flux along which stellar winds flow.\n  In this work, we model the angular momentum evolution of main sequence\nsolar-mass stars using a torque law formulated in terms of the open flux. This\nis done using a potential field source surface model in conjunction with the\nZeeman-Doppler magnetograms of a sample of roughly solar-mass stars. We explore\nhow the open flux of these stars varies with stellar rotation and choice of\nsource surface radii. We also explore the effect of field geometry by using two\nmethods of determining the open flux. The first method only accounts for the\ndipole component while the second accounts for the full set of spherical\nharmonics available in the Zeeman-Doppler magnetogram. We find only a small\ndifference between the two methods, demonstrating that the open flux, and\nindeed the spin-down, of main sequence solar-mass stars is likely dominated by\nthe dipolar component of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 16:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Given an authenticated public feedback\nchannel, the transmitter's (Alice) parity-check matrix can also be synchronized\nwith the receiver's. As a result, once an eavesdropper (Eve) erroneously\ndecodes a message block, she may not be able to follow the update of subsequent\nparity-check matrices. Thus, the average BER of Eve will be very close to $0.5$\nif the transmitted number of message blocks is large enough.

This small-x regime of QCD\nis well described by an effective theory known as the Color Glass Condensate\n(CGC). In this thesis, we introduce the CGC and apply it to two different\nproblems.\n  First, we use the CGC to study forward heavy-quark production in pA\ncollisions. When the quarks are nearly back-to-back, the CGC result coincides\nwith the one in the TMD factorization approach. This allows us to extract the\nsmall-x limit of the Weizs\\\"acker-Williams gluon distribution, as well as the\ndipole distribution and one extra gluon TMD. Each of these gluon TMDs is\naccompanied by a partner, which couples via the quark mass and which describes\nthe linearly polarized gluon content of the unpolarized nucleus. We calculate\nthe six resulting gluon TMDs analytically in the MV model, and evolve them in\nrapidity using a numerical implementation of JIMWLK.\n  The second problem is situated within heavy-ion physics. Jets, produced in\nthe scattering of two nuclei, travel through the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nbefore reaching the detector, and are attenuated as a result of their\ninteraction with this medium. This phenomenon, known as jet quenching, is one\nof the main probes to investigate the QGP. We focus on the transverse momentum\nbroadening of a hard particle traveling through a nuclear medium, and employ\nsmall-x techniques to attempt to resum the leading logarithmic corrections due\nto soft gluon radiation. Although, ultimately, we can only solve the resulting\nin-medium evolution equation to DLA accuracy, we do present a concise framework\nfor the problem, and draw a detailed comparison with the CGC and with the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 17:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

While Gaussian models have been widely employed as\nmeans to approximate climate simulations, the Gaussianity assumption is not\nsuitable for winds at policy-relevant time scales, i.e., sub-annual.

To fully exploit these functionalities,\nmultiple degrees of freedom are highly desirable: in this respect, nanoscale\nsystems that coherently couple to light and possess spins, allow for storage of\nphotonic qubits or light-matter entanglement together with processing\ncapabilities. In addition, all-optical control of spins can be possible for\nfaster gate operations and higher spatial selectivity compared to direct RF\nexcitation. Such systems are therefore of high interest for quantum\ncommunications and processing. However, an outstanding challenge is to preserve\nproperties, and especially optical and spin coherence lifetimes, at the\nnanoscale.

In this paper, we tackle these two issues by\nproposing a new stochastic composition optimization method for composition\nproblem with nonsmooth regularization penalty. In our method, we apply variance\nreduction technique to accelerate the speed of convergence. To the best of our\nknowledge, our method admits the fastest convergence rate for stochastic\ncomposition optimization: for strongly convex composition problem, our\nalgorithm is proved to admit linear convergence; for general composition\nproblem, our algorithm significantly improves the state-of-the-art convergence\nrate from $O(T^{-1/2})$ to $O((n_1+n_2)^{{2}/{3}}T^{-1})$. Finally, we apply\nour proposed algorithm to portfolio management and policy evaluation in\nreinforcement learning. Experimental results verify our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 17:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 00:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

Behavior can be recorded as\na sequence of actions performed by an individual over a given time period. This\nsequence of actions can often be modeled as a stationary time-homogeneous\nMarkov chain and the predictability of the individual's behavior can be\nquantified by the entropy rate of the process. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive investigation of three estimators of the entropy rate of finite\nMarkov processes and a bootstrap procedure for providing standard errors. The\nfirst two methods directly estimate the entropy rate through estimates of the\ntransition matrix and stationary distribution of the process; the methods\ndiffer in the technique used to estimate the stationary distribution. The third\nmethod is related to the sliding-window Lempel-Ziv (SWLZ) compression\nalgorithm. The first two methods achieve consistent estimates of the true\nentropy rate for reasonably short observed sequences, but are limited by\nrequiring a priori specification of the order of the process. The method based\non the SWLZ algorithm does not require specifying the order of the process and\nis optimal in the limit of an infinite sequence, but is biased for short\nsequences. When used together, the methods can provide a clear picture of the\nentropy rate of an individual's behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 18:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

The study is based on the recognition that dust-gas mixtures are\ngenerically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas,\nabsent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the \"streaming\ninstability\" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides\nsimple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for\nits growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to\nmore general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and\nmagnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most\nimportantly, we identify the disk \"settling instability,\" which occurs as dust\nsettles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this\ninstability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming\ninstability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth\ntimescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital\nperiod, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate\nlarger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band\ninto rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps,\nhigh-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even\noverdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 19:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 22:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Effectively, the coupling imposes constraints and interactions between\nthe fermion spin and the local boson density. This grants the bosons the\nmeaning as the Schwinger boson of the magnetic order and allows us to probe a\nlarger phase space, rather than around the quantum critical point. We design\nthe initial model so that after the boson and gauge fields are integrated out\nexactly, the resulting fermion-only effective theory only consists of several\nlocal interactions, allowing controlled weak-coupling interpretation for\ncertain parameter regions. Consequently, we find a non-Fermi liquid whose\ndegrees of freedom in the effective theory take the form of an \\emph{emergent}\nFermi surface that has a different Luttinger volume from the original fermions,\ntherefore explicitly violates the Luttinger theorem. Further, this allows a\n$d$-wave superconducting instability if the effective interacting induced by\nboson coupling is in the relevant pairing channel.

We distinguish two\ntypes of Higgs mechanisms: (i) a standard one in which the Higgs scale is\nconstant before and after inflation, where the particles observable in\nnon-Gaussianities are far heavier than can be accessed by laboratory\nexperiments, perhaps associated with gauge unification, and (ii) a\n\"heavy-lifting\" mechanism in which couplings to curvature can result in Higgs\nscales of order the Hubble scale during inflation while reducing to far lower\nscales in the current era, where they may now be accessible to collider and\nother laboratory experiments. In the heavy-lifting option,\nrenormalization-group running of terrestrial measurements yield predictions for\ncosmological non-Gaussianities. If the heavy-lifted gauge theory suffers a\nhierarchy problem, such as does the Standard Model, confirming such predictions\nwould demonstrate a striking violation of the Naturalness Principle. While\nobserving gauge-Higgs sectors in non-Gaussianities will be challenging given\nthe constraints of cosmic variance, we show that it may be possible with\nreasonable precision given favorable couplings to the inflationary dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 19:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

In the case where the number of particle species is one,\nour algorithm can prepare particle states using $O\\left(\n\\epsilon^{-3.23\\ldots}\\right)$ gates, which is much faster than previous known\nresults, namely $O\\left(\\epsilon^{-8-o\\left(1\\right)}\\right)$. Furthermore,\nunlike previous methods which were based on adiabatic state preparation, the\nmethod given here should be able to simulate quantum phases unconnected to the\nfree theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 20:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 21:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 21:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

We present and\ninvestigate a scenario in which the second generation of polluted low-mass\nstars can form in shells around cool supergiant stars within a young globular\ncluster. Simulations of low-Z massive stars (M$_{\\rm i}\\sim$ 150$-$600\nM$_{\\odot}$) show that both core-hydrogen-burning cool supergiants and hot\nionizing stellar sources are expected to be present simulaneously in young\nglobular clusters. Under these conditions, photoionization-confined shells form\naround the supergiants. We find that the shell is gravitationally unstable on a\ntimescale that is shorter than the lifetime of the supergiant, and the\nBonnor-Ebert mass of the overdense regions is low enough to allow star\nformation. Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made\nup of the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily\nreflects the composition of the supergiant wind. We show that the wind contains\nhot-hydrogen-burning products, and that the shell-stars therefore have very\nsimilar abundance anomalies that are observed in the second generation stars of\nglobular clusters. Considering the mass-budget required for the second\ngeneration star-formation, we offer two solutions. Either a top-heavy initial\nmass function is needed with an index of $-$1.71..$-$2.07. Alternatively, we\nsuggest the shell-stars to have a truncated mass distribution, and solve the\nmass budget problem by justifiably accounting for only a fraction of the first\ngeneration. Even without forming a photoionizaton-confined shell, the cool\nsupergiant stars predicted at low-Z could contribute to the pollution of the\ninterstellar medium of the cluster from which the second generation was born.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 20:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Detailed numerical investigations of the two-stage\nignition process in different temperature regimes of DME have been created\nthrough a high-fidelity one-dimensional, multi-timescale plasma-discharge\nmodel. Two different initial temperatures are set for comparison: 550K, the\nnegative temperature coefficient regime, where LTC plays a dominate role; 800K,\nthe intermediate temperature regime, where LTC normally does not play an\nimportant role. The results have shown that, in NTC regime, non-equilibrium\nplasma discharge improves the overall ignition delay time by 15 times with a\nsignificant improvement of approximately 250 times for the first-stage\nignition. In Intermediate temperature regime, the two-stage ignition property\nis reactivated by the addition of plasma, and the overall ignition delay is\nshortened by approximately 75 times. This observation suggests that, in the\nintermediate temperature regime, the plasma discharges can not only enhance DME\nignition characteristics but also alter the reaction pathways to a reactive LTC\nreaction pathway; therefore, the two-stage ignition behavior occurred again.\nFurther investigation suggests that the plasma enhancement on ignition and LTC\nin the intermediate temperature regime is non-linear. As the accumulative\nenergy input to the system increases, the enhancement from the non-equilibrium\nplasma discharge reaches a limit.

A large dense roadmap (graph)\ncan typically ensure the existence of high quality solutions for most\nmotion-planning problems, but the size of the roadmap, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional spaces, makes existing search-based planning algorithms\ncomputationally expensive. We deal with the challenges of expensive search and\ncollision checking in two ways. First, we frame the problem of anytime motion\nplanning on roadmaps as searching for the shortest path over a sequence of\nsubgraphs of the entire roadmap graph, generated by some densification\nstrategy. This lets us achieve bounded sub-optimality with bounded worst-case\nplanning effort. Second, for searching each subgraph, we develop an anytime\nplanning algorithm which uses a belief model to compute the collision\nprobability of unknown configurations and searches for paths that are\nPareto-optimal in path length and collision probability. This algorithm is\nefficient with respect to collision checks as it searches for successively\nshorter paths. We theoretically analyze both our ideas and evaluate them\nindividually on high-dimensional motion-planning problems. Finally, we apply\nboth of these ideas together in our algorithmic framework for anytime motion\nplanning, and show that it outperforms BIT* on high-dimensional hypercube\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 23:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

We focus, in particular, on the case where the electrons are fully\ndegenerate. For such systems, perturbation methods using the distribution\nfunction can be problematic. Instead we present a model that considers the\ndynamics of the Fermi surface. The advantage of this model is that, even though\nthe value of the distribution function can be greatly perturbed outside the\nequilibrium Fermi surface, deformation of Fermi surface is small up very large\namplitudes. Next, we investigate the short-scale dynamics for which the\nWigner-Moyal equation replaces the Vlasov equation. In particular, we study\nwave-particle interaction, and deduce that new types of wave damping can occur\ndue to the simultaneous absorption (or emission) of multiple wave quanta.\nFinally, we consider exchange effects within a quantum kinetic formalism to\nfind a model more accurate than ones using exchange potentials from density\nfunctional theory. We deduce the exchange corrections to the dispersion\nrelations for Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves. Comparing with results based on\nexchange potentials deduced from density functional theory we find that the\nlatter models are reasonably accurate for Langmuir waves, but rather inaccurate\nfor ion acoustic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 01:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

Thermodynamically infeasible cy-cles (TICs) causing unbounded\nmetabolic flux ranges are often encountered. TICs satisfy the mass balance and\ndirectionality constraints but violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nCurrent prac-tices involve implementing additional constraints to ensure not\nonly optimal but also loopless flux distributions. However, the mixed integer\nlinear programming problems required to solve become computationally\nintractable for genome-scale metabolic models. Results: We aimed to identify\nthe fewest needed constraints sufficient for optimality under the loop-less\nrequirement. We found that loopless constraints are required only for the\nreactions that share elementary flux modes representing TICs with reactions\nthat are part of the objective function.

This assumption, if erroneous, can adversely\naffect model predictions and statistical inference. Nowadays many applications\nconsider data over the entire globe and hence it is necessary to check the\nassumption of isotropy on a sphere. In this paper, a test for spatial isotropy\non a sphere is proposed. The data are first projected onto the set of spherical\nharmonic functions. Under isotropy, the spherical harmonic coefficients are\nuncorrelated whereas they are correlated if the underlying fields are not\nisotropic. This motivates a test based on the sample correlation matrix of the\nspherical harmonic coefficients. In particular, we use the largest eigenvalue\nof the sample correlation matrix as the test statistic. Extensive simulations\nare conducted to assess the Type I errors of the test under different\nscenarios. We show how temporal correlation affects the test and provide a\nmethod for handling temporal correlation. We also gauge the power of the test\nas we move away from isotropy. The method is applied to the near-surface air\ntemperature data which is part of the HadCM3 model output. Although we do not\nexpect global temperature fields to be isotropic, we propose several\nanisotropic models with increasing complexity, each of which has an isotropic\nprocess as model component and we apply the test to the isotropic component in\na sequence of such models as a method of determining how well the models\ncapture the anisotropy in the fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 07:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 03:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Like in the CP-conserving\n(real) 2HDM (R2HDM) we find that a strong EWPT favours mass gaps between the\nnon-SM-like Higgs bosons. These lead to prominent final states comprised of\ngauge+Higgs bosons or pairs of Higgs bosons. In contrast to the R2HDM, the\nCP-mixing of the C2HDM also favours approximately mass degenerate spectra with\ndominant decays into SM particles. The requirement of a strong EWPT further\nallows us to distinguish the C2HDM from the R2HDM using the signal strengths of\nthe SM-like Higgs boson. We additionally find that a strong EWPT requires an\nenhancement of the SM-like trilinear Higgs coupling at next-to-leading order\n(NLO) by up to a factor of 2.4 compared to the NLO SM coupling, establishing\nanother link between cosmology and collider phenomenology.

Natural language, however\npossess a temporal hierarchy structure, with complex dependencies between each\nsubsequence. In this paper, we propose a phrase-based hierarchical Long\nShort-Term Memory (phi-LSTM) model to generate image description. In contrast\nto the conventional solutions that generate caption in a pure sequential\nmanner, our proposed model decodes image caption from phrase to sentence. It\nconsists of a phrase decoder at the bottom hierarchy to decode noun phrases of\nvariable length, and an abbreviated sentence decoder at the upper hierarchy to\ndecode an abbreviated form of the image description. A complete image caption\nis formed by combining the generated phrases with sentence during the inference\nstage.

Our\neffective equations are derived by eliminating resonator degrees of freedom\nwhile encoding their effect in the Green's function of the electromagnetic\nbackground. We account for the openness of the resonator exactly by employing a\nspectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of\nnon-Hermitian modes. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived\nto systematically account for the nonlinearity of weakly nonlinear qubits like\ntransmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission,\ncapturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid\nfor any qubit-resonator coupling strength. Any discrete-level quantum system\ncoupled to the electromagnetic continuum is subject to radiative decay and\nrenormalization of its energy levels. When inside a cavity, these quantities\ncan be strongly modified with respect to vacuum. Generally, this modification\ncan be captured by including only the closest resonant cavity mode. In\ncircuit-QED architecture, with substantial coupling strengths, it is however\nfound that such rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes. A\nmultimode calculation over the infinite set of cavity modes leads to\ndivergences unless an artificial cutoff is imposed. Previous studies have not\npointed out what the source of this divergence is. We show that unless the\neffect of $A^2$ is accounted for up to all orders exactly, any multimode\ncalculations of circuit-QED quantities is bound to diverge. Subsequently, we\npresent the calculation of finite radiative corrections to qubit properties\nthat is free of an artificially introduced high frequency cut-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 01:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}
