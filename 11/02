The objective function typically contains several terms specifically\ndesigned for different purposes. Parameters in front of these terms are used to\ncontrol the relative weights among them. It is of critical importance to tune\nthese parameters, as quality of the solution depends on their values. Tuning\nparameter is a relatively straightforward task for a human, as one can\nintelligently determine the direction of parameter adjustment based on the\nsolution quality. Yet manual parameter tuning is not only tedious in many\ncases, but becomes impractical when a number of parameters exist in a problem.\nAiming at solving this problem, this paper proposes an approach that employs\ndeep reinforcement learning to train a system that can automatically adjust\nparameters in a human-like manner. We demonstrate our idea in an example\nproblem of optimization-based iterative CT reconstruction with a pixel-wise\ntotal-variation regularization term. We set up a parameter tuning policy\nnetwork (PTPN), which maps an CT image patch to an output that specifies the\ndirection and amplitude by which the parameter at the patch center is adjusted.\nWe train the PTPN via an end-to-end reinforcement learning procedure. We\ndemonstrate that under the guidance of the trained PTPN for parameter tuning at\neach pixel, reconstructed CT images attain quality similar or better than in\nthose reconstructed with manually tuned parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 16:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

It is therefore critical to understand the\nphysics which connects the two: how does the time scale of reconnection produce\nan observed GOES light curve? In this work, we model the formation and\nexpansion of an arcade of loops with a hydrodynamic model, which we then use to\nsynthesize GOES light curves. We calculate the FWHM and the e-folding decay\ntime of the light curves and compare them to the separation of the centroids of\nthe two ribbons which the arcade spans, which is representative of the size\nscale of the loops. We reproduce a linear relation between the two, as found\nobservationally in previous work.

We also show that the cooling processes of individual loops\ncomprising the flare arcade directly affect the measured time scales. From the\nclear consistency between the observed and modeled linearity, we conclude that\nthe primary factors that control the flare time scales are the duration of\nreconnection and the loop lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 16:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Those models are expensive to train and difficult to\nparameterize. Objective: We investigate methodological issues for designing and\nevaluating deep learning models for skin lesion analysis. We explore 10 choices\nfaced by researchers: use of transfer learning, model architecture, train\ndataset, image resolution, type of data augmentation, input normalization, use\nof segmentation, duration of training, additional use of SVMs, and test data\naugmentation. Methods: We perform two full factorial experiments, for five\ndifferent test datasets, resulting in 2560 exhaustive trials in our main\nexperiment, and 1280 trials in our assessment of transfer learning. We analyze\nboth with multi-way ANOVA. We use the exhaustive trials to simulate sequential\ndecisions and ensembles, with and without the use of privileged information\nfrom the test set. Results -- main experiment: Amount of train data has\ndisproportionate influence, explaining almost half the variation in\nperformance. Of the other factors, test data augmentation and input resolution\nare the most influential. Deeper models, when combined, with extra data, also\nhelp. -- transfer experiment: Transfer learning is critical, its absence brings\nhuge performance penalties. -- simulations: Ensembles of models are the best\noption to provide reliable results with limited resources, without using\nprivileged information and sacrificing methodological rigor. Conclusions and\nSignificance: Advancing research on automated skin lesion analysis requires\ncurating larger public datasets. Indirect use of privileged information from\nthe test set to design the models is a subtle, but frequent methodological\nmistake that leads to overoptimistic results.

We show that, in many standard market\nmodels, product design aimed at utility maximization is not constrained at all\nby VaR or ES bounds: the maximized utility corresponding to the optimal payoff\nis the same with or without ES constraints. By contrast we show that, in\nreasonable markets, risk management constraints based on a second more\nconventional concave utility function can reduce the maximum S-shaped utility\nthat can be achieved by the investor, even if the constraining utility function\nis only rather modestly concave. It follows that product designs leading to\nunbounded S-shaped utilities will lead to unbounded negative expected\nconstraining utilities when measured with such conventional utility functions.\nTo prove these latter results we solve a general problem of optimizing an\ninvestor expected utility under risk management constraints where both investor\nand risk manager have conventional concave utility functions, but the investor\nhas limited liability.

However,\ncorrelated enhancements of merger-induced star formation and AGN triggering may\nbe hidden by the variable conditions and timescales during which they occur. In\nPaper I, we presented evidence of merger-triggered AGN in a sample of six\nlate-stage galaxy mergers (2-8 kpc nuclear separations). In this follow-up\nwork, we use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope imaging and additional\narchival data to examine their star-forming properties to test for\nmerger-triggered star formation, and if it is correlated with SMBH growth. We\nfind that the morphological asymmetries are correlated with enhanced specific\nstar formation rates, indicating the presence of merger-triggered star\nformation. Additionally, the stellar populations become younger with increasing\nradius from the nucleus, indicating that the merger-induced star formation\nprimarily occurs on global scales. However, we also find that the star\nformation rate enhancements are consistent with or lower than those of larger\nseparation galaxy pair samples. This result is consistent with simulations\npredicting a decline of the global star formation rates in late-stage galaxy\nmergers with <10 kpc nuclear separations. Finally, we find that enhancements in\nspecific star formation rate and AGN luminosity are positively correlated, but\nthat an average temporal delay of >10^8 yrs likely exists between the peak of\nglobal star formation and the onset of AGN triggering in 80% of the systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The fundamental reason for\nthis analytical treatment is that it offers useful insight into the\npsychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For\ninstance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (discrimination regions)\nand the adaptation of the receptive fields can be seen in the expression of the\nJacobian wrt the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the\nstimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The\nJacobian wrt the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact\nin the response, and hence bigger relevance. The analytic inverse implies\nconditions for the response and the model to ensure decoding. From an applied\nperspective, (a) the Jacobian wrt the stimulus is necessary in new experimental\nmethods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometry, (b)\nthe Jacobian matrices wrt the parameters are convenient to learn the model from\nclassical experiments or alternative optimization goals, and (c) the inverse is\na model-based alternative to blind machine-learning neural decoding that does\nnot include meaningful biological information.\n  The theory is checked by building a derivable and invertible vision model\nthat actually follows the modular program suggested by Carandini&Heeger.

This paper proposes\na new formulation for the multi-school homogeneous fleet routing problem that\nmaximizes trip compatibility while minimizing total travel time.

To compare the performance of the model with\ntraditional routing problems, we generate eight mid-size data sets. Through\nimporting the generated trips of the routing problems into the bus scheduling\n(blocking) problem, it is shown that the proposed model uses up to 13% fewer\nbuses than the common traditional routing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 20:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 22:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Recent deep learning systems have made significant progress\ntoward solving this problem, yet it remains challenging particularly in\nreal-time, short latency applications. Most methods attempt to construct a mask\nfor each source in time-frequency representation of the mixture signal which is\nnot necessarily an optimal representation for speech separation. In addition,\ntime-frequency decomposition results in inherent problems such as\nphase/magnitude decoupling and long time window which is required to achieve\nsufficient frequency resolution. We propose Time-domain Audio Separation\nNetwork (TasNet) to overcome these limitations. We directly model the signal in\nthe time-domain using an encoder-decoder framework and perform the source\nseparation on nonnegative encoder outputs. This method removes the frequency\ndecomposition step and reduces the separation problem to estimation of source\nmasks on encoder outputs which is then synthesized by the decoder. Our system\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art causal and noncausal speech separation\nalgorithms, reduces the computational cost of speech separation, and\nsignificantly reduces the minimum required latency of the output. This makes\nTasNet suitable for applications where low-power, real-time implementation is\ndesirable such as in hearable and telecommunication devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 21:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 02:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

We explore, first, how well commercial off-the-shelf\nsmartphone cameras can learn texture to distinguish among paving materials in\nuncontrolled outdoor urban settings. Second, we aim at identifying when a\ndistracted user is about to enter the street, which can be used to support\nsafety functions such as warning the user to be cautious. To this end, we\ngather a unique dataset of street/sidewalk imagery from a pedestrian's\nperspective, that spans major cities like New York, Paris, and London. We\ndemonstrate that modern phone cameras can be enabled to distinguish materials\nof walking surfaces in urban areas with more than 90% accuracy, and accurately\nidentify when pedestrians transition from sidewalk to street.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 23:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

The\nestimated total mass, including dust and bodies up to 50 km in size, is of the\norder of 0.01 Earth masses, which is similar to that of the solar Kuiper belt.\nOur data also show a hint of warmer dust closer to the star.

However, the label noise among the datasets severely\ndegenerates the \\mbox{performance of deep} learning approaches. Recently, one\nmainstream is to introduce the latent label to handle label noise, which has\nshown promising improvement in the network designs. Nevertheless, the mismatch\nbetween latent labels and noisy labels still affects the predictions in such\nmethods. To address this issue, we propose a quality embedding model, which\nexplicitly introduces a quality variable to represent the trustworthiness of\nnoisy labels. Our key idea is to identify the mismatch between the latent and\nnoisy labels by embedding the quality variables into different subspaces, which\neffectively minimizes the noise effect. At the same time, the high-quality\nlabels is still able to be applied for training. To instantiate the model, we\nfurther propose a Contrastive-Additive Noise network (CAN), which consists of\ntwo important layers: (1) the contrastive layer estimates the quality variable\nin the embedding space to reduce noise effect; and (2) the additive layer\naggregates the prior predictions and noisy labels as the posterior to train the\nclassifier. Moreover, to tackle the optimization difficulty, we deduce an SGD\nalgorithm with the reparameterization tricks, which makes our method scalable\nto big data. We conduct the experimental evaluation of the proposed method over\na range of noisy image datasets. Comprehensive results have demonstrated CAN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 01:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$. If $\\nu_{\\rm turb}>\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet\nwould become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant. We find that even a small\nvalue of turbulent diffusion has influential effects on evolutions of\nsuper-Earths. $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$ increases with the core mass. We further\nascertain that, within the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), $\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical}$ increases with the semi-major axis. This may explain the feature\nthat super-Earths are common in inner PPD regions, while gas giants are common\nin the outer PPD regions. The predicted envelope mass fraction (EMF) is not\nfully consistent with observations.

In small simulation domains, the\nelectrostatic effect from the boundaries is known to influence the calculated\napex field enhancement factor (FEF) of the emitter, but no established\ndependence has been reported at present. In this work, we report the dependence\nof the lateral size, $L$, and the height, $H$, of the simulation domain on the\napex-FEF of a single conducting ellipsoidal emitter. Firstly, we analyze the\nerror, $\\varepsilon$, in the calculation of the apex-FEF as a function of $H$\nand $L$. Importantly, our results show that the effects of $H$ and $L$ on\n$\\varepsilon$ are scale invariant, allowing one to predict $\\varepsilon$ for\nratios $L/h$ and $H/h$, where $h$ is the height of the emitter. Next, we\nanalyze the fractional change of the apex-FEF, $\\delta$, from a single emitter,\n$\\gamma_1$, and a pair, $\\gamma_2$. We show that small relative errors in\n$\\gamma_1$ (i.e., $\\varepsilon\\approx0.5\\%$), due to the finite domain size,\nare sufficient to alter the functional dependence $\\delta(c)$, where $c$ is the\ndistance from the emitters in the pair.

Most existing\nliteratures concern one dimensional arrays with single turbine in the vertical\ndirection, while the arrays in this work are two dimensional (with turbines in\nboth the vertical and lateral directions) and also partially block the channel\nwhich width is far larger than height. The vertical mixing of array scale flow\nis assumed to take place much faster than lateral one. This assumption has been\nverified by numerical simulations. Fixing the total turbine area and utilized\nwidth, the comparison between two-dimensional and traditional one-dimensional\narrays is investigated. The results suggest that the two dimensional\narrangements of smaller turbines are preferred to one dimensional arrays from\nboth the power coefficient and efficiency perspectives.

Finally, the scenario of arranging turbines in infinite flow, which is\nthe limiting condition of small blockages, is analysed.

Since sleep staging is a sequential problem with\nlong-term dependencies, we take advantage of RNNs with Bidirectional Long\nShort-Term Memory (BLSTM) architectures for sequence data learning. To simulate\nthe actual situation of daily sleep, experiments are conducted with a resting\ngroup in which sleep is recorded in resting state, and a comprehensive group in\nwhich both resting sleep and non-resting sleep are included.We evaluate the\nalgorithm based on an eight-fold cross validation to classify five sleep stages\n(W, N1, N2, N3, and REM).

For relatively\nweak elastic interactions, the phase diagram is characterized by tricritical\npoints, at which antiferromagnetic (AF) -like and ferromagnetic (F) -like\nspinodal lines and a critical line merge. On the other hand, for relatively\nstrong elastic interactions, unusual \"horn structures,\" which are surrounded by\nthe F-like spinodal lines, disorder (D) spinodal lines, and the critical line,\nare realized at higher temperatures.

By a careful measurement of the\nsuperconducting upper critical fields as a function of the magnetic field angle\nat a pressure as high as 98.5 kbar, we provide the first detailed examination\nof the dimensionality of the superconducting condensate in WTe$_2$. Despite the\nlayered crystal structure, the upper critical field exhibits a negligible field\nanisotropy. The angular dependence of the upper critical field can be\nsatisfactorily described by the anisotropic mass model from 2.2 K\n($T/T_c\\sim0.67$) to 0.03 K ($T/T_c\\sim0.01$), with a practically identical\nanisotropy factor $\\gamma\\sim1.7$. The temperature dependence of the upper\ncritical field, determined for both $H\\perp ab$ and $H\\parallel ab$, can be\nunderstood by a conventional orbital depairing mechanism. Comparison of the\nupper critical fields along the two orthogonal field directions results in the\nsame value of $\\gamma\\sim1.7$, leading to a temperature independent anisotropy\nfactor from near $T_c$ to $<0.01T_c$.

However, this approach has limitations and requires,\ne.g., that the initial state is (i) mixed and (ii) close to equilibrium. In\nthis paper, we discuss these limitations and study the nonequilibrium dynamics\nfor a certain class of properly prepared initial states. Specifically, we\nconsider thermal states of the quantum system in the presence of an additional\nstatic force which, however, become nonequilibrium states when this static\nforce is eventually removed. While for weak forces the relaxation dynamics is\nwell captured by LRT, much less is known in the case of strong forces, i.e.,\ninitial states far away from equilibrium. Summarizing our main results, we\nunveil that, for high temperatures, the nonequilibrium dynamics of so-called\nbinary operators is always generated by an equilibrium correlation function. In\nparticular, this statement holds true for states in the far-from-equilibrium\nlimit, i.e., outside the linear response regime. In addition, we confirm our\nanalytical results by numerically studying the dynamics of local fermionic\noccupation numbers and local energy densities in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.\nRemarkably, these simulations also provide evidence that our results\nqualitatively apply in a more general setting, e.g., in the anisotropic XXZ\nmodel where the local energy is a non-binary operator, as well as for a wider\nrange of temperature.

Previous studies have\ntypically utilised an internal trigger to initiate reconnection, e.g. initial\nconditions centred on the current sheet. Numerical simulations solving the\ncompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations were performed to\ninvestigate the reconnection onset within different atmospheric layers of the\nSun, namely the corona, chromosphere and photosphere. A reconnecting state is\nreached for all atmospheric heights considered, with the dominant physics being\nhighly dependent on atmospheric conditions. The coronal case achieves a sharp\nrise in electric field for a range of velocity drivers. For the chromosphere,\nwe find a larger velocity amplitude is required to trigger reconnection. For\nthe photospheric environment, the electric field is highly dependent on the\ninflow speed; a sharp increase in electric field is obtained only as the\nvelocity entering the reconnection region approaches the Alfven speed.\nAdditionally, the role of ambipolar diffusion is investigated for the\nchromospheric case and we find that the ambipolar diffusion alters the\nstructure of the current density in the inflow region. The rate at which flux\nenters the reconnection region is controlled by the inflow velocity. This\ndetermines all aspects of the reconnection start-up process, i.e. the early\nonset of reconnection is dominated by the advection term in Ohms law in all\natmospheric layers. A lower plasma-$\\beta$ enhances reconnection and creates a\nlarge change in the electric field. A high plasma-$\\beta$ hinders the\nreconnection, yielding a sharp rise in the electric field only when the\nvelocity flowing into the reconnection region approaches the local Alfven\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 11:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

We further\nanalyzed different variants of the tested models to open a discussion on how\nthe long pretraining in these tasks may have favored particular coordination\ndynamics between RL and WM. This points towards either inter-species\ndifferences or protocol differences which could be further tested in humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 11:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

While monitoring\nthe occupation of the dot, we apply conditional control operations by changing\nthe tunneling rates between the dots and its reservoirs, which can be\ninterpreted as the action of a Maxwell demon opening or closing a shutter. This\ncan generate a current at equilibrium or even against a potential bias,\nproducing electric power from information. While this interpretation is\nwell-explored in the weak-coupling limit, we can address the strong-coupling\nregime with a fermionic reaction-coordinate mapping, which maps the system into\na serial triple quantum dot coupled to two leads. There, we find that a\ncontinuous projective measurement of the central dot would lead to a complete\nsuppression of electronic transport due to the quantum Zeno effect. In\ncontrast, a microscopic model for the quantum point contact detector implements\na weak measurement, which allows for closure of the control loop without\ninducing transport blockade. In the weak-coupling regime between the central\ndot and its leads, the energy flows associated with the feedback loop are\nnegligible, and the information gained in the measurement induces a bound for\nthe generated electric power. In contrast, in the strong coupling limit, the\nprotocol may require more energy for opening and closing the shutter than\nelectric power produced, such that the device is no longer\ninformation-dominated and can thus not be interpreted as a Maxwell demon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 12:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

It is shown that tilting the head in\nthe centripetal direction reduces the estimated motion sickness incidence\n(MSI), defined as the percentage of subjects who vomited. In addition, the head\nmovements of both drivers and passengers were measured in a real car. It is\nalso shown that the estimated MSI of the drivers is smaller than that of the\npassengers. Experimental results presented in previous studies demonstrated\nthat the severity of motion sickness was reduced when passengers imitated the\nhead tilt of the driver. These results strongly suggest that the driver's head\ntilt reduces motion sickness, and this can be understood as a subjective\nvertical conflict.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 14:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

This practice allows maximum localization of the volume elements, but\ncan also induce a bias due to a poor description of the local geometry of the\nunderlying probability measure. We introduce a new class of knn estimators that\nwe call geometric knn estimators (g-knn), which use more complex local volume\nelements to better model the local geometry of the probability measures. As an\nexample of this class of estimators, we develop a g-knn estimator of entropy\nand mutual information based on elliptical volume elements, capturing the local\nstretching and compression common to a wide range of dynamical systems\nattractors. A series of numerical examples in which the thickness of the\nunderlying distribution and the sample sizes are varied suggest that local\ngeometry is a source of problems for knn methods such as the\nKraskov-St\\\"{o}gbauer-Grassberger (KSG) estimator when local geometric effects\ncannot be removed by global preprocessing of the data.

Most\nprevious studies on co-design of incentive mechanism and privacy preservation\nassume a trustworthy fusion center (FC). Very recent work has taken steps to\nrelax the assumption on trustworthy FC and allows participatory users (PUs) to\nadd well calibrated noise to their raw sensing data before reporting them,\nwhereas the focus is on the equilibrium behavior of data subjects with binary\ndata. Making a paradigm shift, this paper aim to quantify the privacy\ncompensation for continuous data sensing while allowing FC to directly control\nPUs. There are two conflicting objectives in such scenario: FC desires better\nquality data in order to achieve higher aggregation accuracy whereas PUs prefer\nadding larger noise for higher privacy-preserving levels (PPLs). To achieve a\ngood balance therein, we design an efficient incentive mechanism to REconcile\nFC's Aggregation accuracy and individual PU's data Privacy (REAP).\nSpecifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to measure\nPUs' PPLs and quantify their impacts on FC's aggregation accuracy. Then,\nappealing to Contract Theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC's\naggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism\noffers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which\nFC can directly control PUs. It can further overcome the information asymmetry,\ni.e., the FC typically does not know each PU's precise privacy preference. We\nderive closed-form solutions for the optimal contracts in both complete\ninformation and incomplete information scenarios. Further, the results are\ngeneralized to the continuous case where PUs' privacy preferences take values\nin a continuous domain. Extensive simulations are provided to validate the\nfeasibility and advantages of our proposed incentive mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 14:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

The well-posedness is based on a fixed point argument, and the\nregularity on Schauder estimates. The first a priori estimates yield H\\\"older\nregularity of the non-local order parameter, which is improved by an iteration\nargument.\n  The asymptotic behavior of solutions depends on some order parameter $\\rho$\ndepending on the initial data.

In our previous\nresearch, a method for generating a timed knee trajectory close to able-bodied\nindividuals, which leads to sufficient clearance between the foot and the floor\nand the knee extension, was proposed using the inertial motion. Limb motions\nare known to correlate with each other during walking. This phenomenon is\ncalled kinematic synergy. In the present study, we measure gaits in level\nwalking of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of walking velocities. We\nshow that this kinematic synergy also exists between the motions of the intact\nlimbs and those of the knee as determined by the inertial motion technique. We\nthen propose a new method for generating the motion of the knee joint using its\ninertial motion close to the able-bodied individuals in mid-swing based on its\nkinematic synergy, such that the method can adapt to the changes in the motion\nvelocity. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method\nachieves prosthetic walking similar to that of able-bodied individuals with a\nwide range of constant walking velocities and termination of walking from\nsteady-state walking. Further investigations have found that a kinematic\nsynergy also exists at the start of walking. Overall, our method successfully\nachieves knee motion generation from the initiation of walking through\nsteady-state walking with different velocities until termination of walking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 15:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

I am\nespecially interested in the mathematical aspects of research on homosexuality.\nCertain studies show that male homosexuality may have a genetic component that\nis correlated with female fertility. Other studies show the existence of the\nfraternal birth order effect, that is the correlation of homosexuality with the\nnumber of older brothers.\n  This paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of how these two phenomena\nare interconnected. In particular, I show that the fraternal birth order effect\nproduces a correlation between homosexuality and maternal fecundity. Vice\nversa, I show that the correlation between homosexuality and female fecundity\nimplies the increase of the probability of the younger brothers being\nhomosexual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 19:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

FPS-SFT extracts\nsamples along lines (1-dimensional slices from an M-D data cube), which are\nparameterized by random slopes and offsets. The discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) along those lines represents projections of M-D DFT of the M-D data onto\nthose lines. The M-D sinusoids that are contained in the signal can be\nreconstructed from the DFT along lines with a low sample and computational\ncomplexity provided that the signal is sparse in the frequency domain and the\nlines are appropriately designed. The performance of FPS-SFT is demonstrated\nboth theoretically and numerically. A sparse image reconstruction application\nis illustrated, which shows the capability of the FPS-SFT in solving practical\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 03:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}
