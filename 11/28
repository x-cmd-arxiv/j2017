A stochastic\nmulti-agent model for opinion dynamics is proposed, that accounts for a\ncentralized tuning of the strength of interaction between individuals. The\nevolution of each individual opinion is described by a Markov chain, whose\ntransition rates are affected by the opinions of the neighbors through\ninfluence parameters. The properties of this model are studied in a general\nsetting as well as in interesting special cases. A general result is that the\noverall model of the social network behaves like a high-dimensional Markov\nchain, which is viable to Monte Carlo simulation.

For instance, hashtags have\nthe potential to significantly reduce the problem of manual supervision and\nannotation when learning vision models for a large number of concepts. However,\na key challenge when learning from hashtags is that they are inherently\nsubjective because they are provided by users as a form of self-expression. As\na consequence, hashtags may have synonyms (different hashtags referring to the\nsame visual content) and may be ambiguous (the same hashtag referring to\ndifferent visual content). These challenges limit the effectiveness of\napproaches that simply treat hashtags as image-label pairs. This paper presents\nan approach that extends upon modeling simple image-label pairs by modeling the\njoint distribution of images, hashtags, and users. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof such approaches in image tagging and retrieval experiments, and show how the\njoint model can be used to perform user-conditional retrieval and tagging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

We focus on the case\nwhen the indicated $3d$ metallic adatoms form a perfect, close-packed\nsingle-atomic layer above the graphene surface. The two configurations are\nexamined, namely the adatoms in the on-top, and the hollow positions on\ngraphene. First, we verify that the metallic adatoms in the close-packed\nstructure do not form a covalent bonds with the graphene substrate. However,\ndue to the proximity of the metallic adatoms to the graphene, the charge\ntransfer from the adatom layer to the graphene takes place, and in consequence\nthe graphene becomes $n$-doped. The observed charge transfer results from the\narising hybridization between the graphene $2p$ and transition metal $3d$\norbitals. The proximity of metallic adatoms modifies the magnetic state of the\ngraphene. This effect is especially pronounced for the decoration with magnetic\natoms, when the magnetic moments on the graphene sublattices are induced. The\nanalysis of the band structure demonstrates that the charge transfer, as well\nas the induced magnetism on graphene, modify the graphene electronic properties\nnear high symmetry points, especially the Dirac cones. The presence of the\nmetallic adatoms breaks graphene $K-K^{'}$ symmetry and splits the bands due to\nthe exchange coupling. We show that for the hollow configuration the gap\nopening arises at the $K(K^{'})$-point due to the Rashba-like spin-orbit\ninteraction, while in the case of the on-top configuration the energy gap opens\nmainly due to the staggered potential. We also mapped the parameters of an\neffective Hamiltonian on the results obtained with the density functional\ntheory approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

In the partially\nionised plasma, the dominant dissipative effect is the Cowling resistivity. The\nregions outside the slab (modelling the solar corona) are fully ionised, and\nthe dominant mechanism of dissipation is viscosity. Analytical solutions to the\nextended magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are found inside and outside of\nthe slab and solutions are matched at the boundaries of the slab. The\ndispersion relation is derived and solutions are found analytically in the\nslender slab limit, while the conditions necessary for the appearance of the\ninstability is investigated numerically for the entire parameter space. Our\nstudy is focussed on the effect of the compressibility on the generation and\nevolution of instabilities. We find that compressibility reduces the threshold\nof the equilibrium flow, where waves can be unstable, to a level that is\ncomparable to the internal cusp speed, which is of the same order of flow\nspeeds that are currently observed in solar prominences. Our study addresses\nonly the slow waves, as these are the most likely perturbations to become\nunstable, however the time-scales of the instability are found to be rather\nlarge ranging from $10^5$-$10^7$ seconds. It is determined that the instability\nthreshold is further influenced by the concentration of neutrals and the\nstrength of the viscosity of the corona. Interestingly, these two latter\naspects have opposite effects. Our numerical analysis shows that the interplay\nbetween the equilibrium flow, neutrals and dispersion can change considerably\nthe nature of waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 17:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

One of the classical results on the ROM\nmodel is that any sorting algorithm that uses O(s) words of extra space\nrequires $\\Omega (n^2/s)$ comparisons for $ \\lg n \\leq s \\leq n/\\lg n$ and the\nbound has also been recently matched by an algorithm. However, if we relax the\nmodel (from ROM), we do have sorting algorithms (say Heapsort) that can sort\nusing $O(n \\lg n)$ comparisons using $O(\\lg n)$ bits of extra space, even\nkeeping a permutation of the given input sequence at any point of time during\nthe algorithm.\n  We address similar questions for graph algorithms. We show that a simple\nnatural relaxation of ROM model allows us to implement fundamental graph search\nmethods like BFS and DFS more space efficiently than in ROM. By simply allowing\nelements in the adjacency list of a vertex to be permuted, we show that, on an\nundirected or directed connected graph $G$ having $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,\nthe vertices of $G$ can be output in a DFS or BFS order using $O(\\lg n)$ bits\nof extra space and $O(n^3 \\lg n)$ time. Thus we obtain similar bounds for\nreachability and shortest path distance (both for undirected and directed\ngraphs). With a little more (but still polynomial) time, we can also output\nvertices in the lex-DFS order. As reachability in directed graphs and shortest\npath distance are NL-complete, and lex-DFS is P-complete, our results show that\nour model is more powerful than ROM if L $\\neq$ P. En route, we also introduce\nand develop algorithms for another relaxation of ROM where the adjacency lists\nof the vertices are circular lists and we can modify only the heads of the\nlists. All our algorithms are simple but quite subtle, and we believe that\nthese models are practical enough to spur interest for other graph problems in\nthese models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 18:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Decays of such a\nvector into a pair of SM particles, either fermions or EW bosons, are well\nstudied. Many of these models have an additional scalar, which can lead to (and\neven dominate in certain parameter regions) a novel decay channel for the heavy\nvector particles instead - into a SM EW boson and the scalar, which\nsubsequently decays into a SM EW boson pair. In this work, we focus on the\nscalar being relatively heavy, roughly factor of two lighter than the vector\nparticles, rendering its decay products well separated. Such a cascade decay\nresults in a final state with three isolated bosons. We argue that for this\n\"triboson\" signal the existing diboson searches are not quite optimal due to\ncombinatorial ambiguity for three identical bosons, and in addition, due to a\nrelatively small signal cross-section determined by the heaviness of the\ndecaying vector particle. In order to isolate the signal, we demonstrate that\ntagging all three bosons, followed by use of the full triboson invariant mass\ndistribution as well as that of appropriate subsets of dibosons, is well\nmotivated. We develop these general strategies in detail within the context of\na specific class of models that are based on extensions of the standard warped\nextra-dimensional scenario. We also point out that a similar analysis would\napply to models with an enlarged EW gauge sector in four dimensions, even if\nthey involve a different Lorentz structure for the relevant couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

When\nworking with noisy or corrupt data, however, such nominal prescriptive methods\ncan be prone to adverse overfitting phenomena and fail to generalize on\nout-of-sample data. In this paper we combine ideas from robust optimization and\nthe statistical bootstrap to propose novel prescriptive methods which safeguard\nagainst overfitting. We show indeed that a particular entropic robust\ncounterpart to such nominal formulations guarantees good performance on\nsynthetic bootstrap data. As bootstrap data is often a sensible proxy to actual\nout-of-sample data, our robust counterpart can be interpreted to directly\nencourage good out-of-sample performance. The associated robust prescriptive\nmethods furthermore reduce to convenient tractable convex optimization problems\nin the context of local learning methods such as nearest neighbors and\nNadaraya-Watson learning. We illustrate our data-driven decision-making\nframework and our novel robustness notion on a small newsvendor problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 20:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 14:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster medium provides\nan opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated\nover cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements\n(chromium, manganese, iron and nickel) is key to understanding how the\nprogenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray\nstudies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these\nelements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting\ndifferences between the nature of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the\nMilky Way. However, because the K-shell transition lines of chromium and\nmanganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon\nenergy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination\nof the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus\ncluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance emission\nfrom chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the latest\natomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with\nrespect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results\nand modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia\nsupernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below the\nChandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed\nabundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into\naccount a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova\nsystems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a\nsubstantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 23:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The model agrees in perturbation theory with\nexpectations from a previously proposed dS-CFT description in terms of a\nfermionic Sp(N) model, but it goes beyond this, both in its conceptual scope\nand in its computational power. In particular it resolves the apparent\npathologies affecting the Sp(N) model, and it provides an exact formula for\nlate time vacuum correlation functions.

In the absence of gravity, we show that the time evolution of the\nshape of the droplet-size distribution due to turbulence-induced collisions\ndepends strongly on the turbulent energy-dissipation rate, but only weakly on\nthe Reynolds number. This can be explained through the energy dissipation rate\ndependence of the mean collision rate described by the Saffman-Turner collision\nmodel. Consistent with the Saffman-Turner collision model and its extensions,\nthe collision rate increases as the square root of the energy dissipation rate\neven when coalescence is invoked. The size distribution exhibits power law\nbehavior with a slope of -3.7 between a maximum at approximately 10 um up to\nabout 40 um. When gravity is invoked, turbulence is found to dominate the time\nevolution of an initially monodisperse droplet distribution at early times. At\nlater times, however, gravity takes over and dominates the collisional growth.\nWe find that the formation of large droplets is very sensitive to the turbulent\nenergy dissipation rate. This is due to the fact that turbulence enhances the\ncollisional growth between similar sized droplets at the early stage of\nraindrop formation. The mean collision rate grows exponentially, which is\nconsistent with the theoretical prediction of the continuous collisional growth\neven when turbulence-generated collisions are invoked.

Therefore, vegetation patches can be interpreted as\nlocalized structures. Previous findings have shown that such localized\nstructures can self-replicate in a binary fashion, where a single vegetation\npatch elongates and divides into two new patches. Here, we extend these\nprevious results by considering the more general case, where the plants\ninteract non-locally, this extension adds an extra level of complexity and\nshrinks the gap between the model and real ecosystems, where it is known that\nthe plant-to-plant competition through roots and above-ground facilitating\ninteractions have non-local effects, i.e. they extend further away than the\nnearest neighbor distance.

The evolution of the biomass of\nvegetation patches can be used as an indicator of the state of an ecosystem,\nthis allows to distinguish if a system is in a self-replicating or decaying\ndynamics.

Recently, the Belle collaboration reported their\nmeasurements on the $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ differential cross\nsection, so that it became possible to find the GDAs from their measurements.\nHere, we report our analysis of the Belle data for determining the pion GDAs.\nFrom the GDAs, the timelike gravitational form factors $\\Theta_1 (s)$ and\n$\\Theta_2 (s)$ can be calculated, which are mechanical (pressure, shear force)\nand mass (energy) form factors, respectively. They are converted to the\nspacelike form factors by using the dispersion relation, and then gravitational\nradii are evaluated for the pion. The mass and mechanical radii are obtained\nfrom $\\Theta_2$ and $\\Theta_1$ as $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2 \\rangle_{\\text{mass}}}\n=0.56 \\sim 0.69$ fm and $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2 \\rangle_{\\text{mech}}} =1.45 \\sim\n1.56$ fm, whereas the experimental charge radius is $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2\n\\rangle_{\\text{charge}}} =0.672 \\pm 0.008$ fm for the charged pion. Future\ndevelopments are expected in this new field to explore gravitational physics in\nthe quark and gluon level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 02:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

These code words\n(which can be both created and adopted words) are designed to evade automatic\ndetection and often have benign meanings in regular discourse. As an example,\n\"skypes\", \"googles\", and \"yahoos\" are all instances of words which have an\nalternate meaning that can be used for hate speech. This overlap introduces\nadditional challenges when relying on keywords for both the collection of data\nthat is specific to hate speech, and downstream classification. In this work,\nwe develop a community detection approach for finding extremist hate speech\ncommunities and collecting data from their members.

Discrete-time algorithms are presented for timing and carrier\nsynchronization, as well as channel estimation, for turbo coded multiple input\nmultiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM)\nsystems. Simulation results show that it is possible to achieve a bit error\nrate of $10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of 5.5 dB, using two transmit and\ntwo receive antennas. We then propose a near-capacity signaling method in which\neach transmit antenna uses a different carrier frequency. Using the\nnear-capacity approach, we show that it is possible to achieve a BER of\n$2\\times 10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of just 2.5 dB, with one receive\nantenna for each transmit antenna. When the number of receive antennas for each\ntransmit antenna is increased to 128, then a BER of $2\\times 10^{-5}$ is\nattained at an average SNR per bit of 1.25 dB. In all cases, the number of\ntransmit antennas is two and the spectral efficiency is 1 bit/transmission or 1\nbit/sec/Hz. In other words, each transmit antenna sends 0.5 bit/transmission.\nIt is possible to obtain higher spectral efficiency by increasing the number of\ntransmit antennas, with no loss in BER performance, as long as each transmit\nantenna uses a different carrier frequency. The transmitted signal spectrum for\nthe near-capacity approach can be restricted by pulse-shaping. In all the\nsimulations, a four-state turbo code is used. The corresponding turbo decoder\nuses eight iterations. The algorithms can be implemented on programmable\nhardware and there is a large scope for parallel processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 03:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

However, the\ncomputational intractability of direct application of 3D convolutional nets to\n3D volumetric data severely limits the efficiency (i.e. slow processing) and\neffectiveness (i.e. unsatisfied accuracy) in processing 3D geometric data. In\nthis paper, powered with a novel design of adversarial networks (3D-A-Nets), we\nhave developed a novel 3D deep dense shape descriptor (3D-DDSD) to address the\nchallenging issues of efficient and effective 3D volumetric data processing. We\ndeveloped new definition of 2D multilayer dense representation (MDR) of 3D\nvolumetric data to extract concise but geometrically informative shape\ndescription and a novel design of adversarial networks that jointly train a set\nof convolution neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and an\nadversarial discriminator. More specifically, the generator network produces 3D\nshape features that encourages the clustering of samples from the same category\nwith correct class label, whereas the discriminator network discourages the\nclustering by assigning them misleading adversarial class labels. By addressing\nthe challenges posed by the computational inefficiency of direct application of\nCNN to 3D volumetric data, 3D-A-Nets can learn high-quality 3D-DSDD which\ndemonstrates superior performance on 3D shape classification and retrieval over\nother state-of-the-art techniques by a great margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 04:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

To\nensure a stable and reliable performance in stochastic environments, parameter\ntuning can be a time-consuming and interaction-costing procedure in the field\nof LA. Especially, it is a fatal limitation for LA-based applications where the\ninteractions with environments are expensive.\n  In this paper, we propose a parameter-free learning automaton scheme to avoid\nparameter tuning by a Bayesian inference method. In contrast to existing\nschemes where the parameters should be carefully tuned according to the\nenvironment, the performance of this scheme is not sensitive to external\nenvironments because a set of parameters can be consistently applied to various\nenvironments, which dramatically reduce the difficulty of applying a learning\nautomaton to an unknown stochastic environment. A rigorous proof of\n$\\epsilon$-optimality for the proposed scheme is provided and numeric\nexperiments are carried out on benchmark environments to verify its\neffectiveness. The results show that, without any parameter tuning cost, the\nproposed parameter-free learning automaton (PFLA) can achieve a competitive\nperformance compared with other well-tuned schemes and outperform untuned\nschemes on consistency of performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 04:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The key\ninsight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity\ninformation and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and\nclustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer\nlearning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints,\nwhich only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not.\nThis similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source\ndomain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for\nperforming transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for\nunsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize\nclassification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering\nnetwork with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs.\nSecond, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen\ncategories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of\nsemantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity\nnetwork is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show\nthat our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and\nunconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of\nthe art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and\nImageNet.

Because the spatial profile of transfer entropy and intrinsic\ntransfer entropy is identical, there are no synergistic effects in the system.\nWe also find that inter-scale information flow significantly decreases as the\ndescription of the system becomes more macroscopic. The downward information\nflow is significantly smaller than the upward information flow.

These\nhyper-networks pose great challenges to existing network embedding methods when\nthe hyperedges are indecomposable, that is to say, any subset of nodes in a\nhyperedge cannot form another hyperedge.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nDeep Hyper-Network Embedding (DHNE) model to embed hyper-networks with\nindecomposable hyperedges.

The absolute value of quantum coherence decreases in the\npresence of additional atom-bath interaction channels. Our work sheds new light\non the mechanism of steady-state coherence in microscopic quantum systems in\nnon-equilibrium environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 07:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The governing equations are discretised in two ways\nin order to suppress aliasing errors introduced into the discrete variational\nforms due to the under-integration of non-linear terms. The first, more\nstraightforward way relies on consistent/over-integration, where quadrature\naccuracy is improved by using a larger number of integration points, consistent\nwith the degree of the non-linearities. The second strategy, originally applied\nin the high-order finite difference community, relies on a split (or\nskew-symmetric) form of the governing equations. Different split forms are\navailable depending on how the variables in the non-linear terms are grouped.\nThe desired split form is then built by averaging conservative and\nnon-conservative forms of the governing equations, although conservativity of\nthe DG scheme is fully preserved. A preliminary analysis based on Burgers'\nturbulence in one spatial dimension is conducted and shows the potential of\nsplit forms in keeping the energy of higher-order polynomial modes close to the\nexpected levels. This indicates that the favourable dealiasing properties\nobserved from split-form approaches in more classical schemes seem to hold for\nDG.

Recently,\nthis has included methodology for the design of two-stage multi-arm studies\nutilising exact binomial tests. These designs were demonstrated to carry\nsubstantial efficiency advantages over a fixed sample design, but generally\nsuffered from strong conservatism. An alternative classical means of small\nsample inference with dichotomous data is Fisher's exact test.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach to object ranking based on principles of\nanalogical reasoning.

Our method applies this pattern as a main building block and combines it\nwith ideas and techniques from instance-based learning and rank aggregation.\nBased on first experimental results for data sets from various domains (sports,\neducation, tourism, etc.), we conclude that our approach is highly competitive.\nIt appears to be specifically interesting in situations in which the objects\nare coming from different subdomains, and which hence require a kind of\nknowledge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 09:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

Simultaneous source acquisition\npresents an opportunity to decrease costs by reducing the survey time. Source\ntime delays are typically long enough for seismic reflection energy to decay to\nnegligible levels before firing another source. Simultaneous source acquisition\nabandons this minimum time restriction and allows interference between seismic\nsources to compress the survey time. Seismic data processing methods must\naddress the interference introduced by simultaneous overlapping sources.\nSimultaneous source data are characterized by high amplitude interference\nartefacts that may be stronger than the primary signal. These large amplitudes\nare due to the time delay between sources and the rapid decay of seismic energy\nwith arrival time. Therefore, source interference will appear as outliers in\ndenoising algorithms that make use of a Radon transform. This will reduce the\naccuracy of Radon transform de-noising especially for weak signals. Formulating\nthe Radon transform as an inverse problem with an L1 misfit makes it robust to\noutliers caused by source interference. This provides the ability to attenuate\nstrong source interference while preserving weak underlying signal. In order to\nimprove coherent signal focusing, an apex shifted hyperbolic Radon transform\n(ASHRT) is used to remove source interferences. ASHRT transform basis functions\nare tailored to match the travel time hyperbolas of reflections in common\nreceiver gathers. However, the ASHRT transform has a high computational cost\ndue to the extension of the model dimensions by scanning for apex locations. By\nreformulating the ASHRT operator using a Stolt migration/demigration kernel\nthat exploits the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the computational efficiency of\nthe operator is drastically improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 10:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The two parts of the graph\nare partitioned into subsets called types and blocks; we seek a matching with\nthe largest sum of weights under the constraint that there is a pre-specified\ncap on the number of vertices matched in every type-block pair. Our primary\nmotivation stems from the public housing program of Singapore, accounting for\nover 70% of its residential real estate. To promote ethnic diversity within its\nhousing projects, Singapore imposes ethnicity quotas: each new housing\ndevelopment comprises blocks of flats and each ethnicity-based group in the\npopulation must not own more than a certain percentage of flats in a block.\nOther domains using similar hard capacity constraints include matching\nprospective students to schools or medical residents to hospitals. Limiting\nagents' choices for ensuring diversity in this manner naturally entails some\nwelfare loss. One of our goals is to study the trade-off between diversity and\nsocial welfare in such settings.

We find that reconnection of\nsheared fieldlines, along the polarity inversion line of an emerging bipolar\nregion, leads to the formation of a new magnetic structure, which adopts the\nshape of a magnetic flux rope during its rising motion. Initially, the flux\nrope undergoes a slow-rise phase and, eventually, it experiences a fast-rise\nphase and ejective eruption towards the outer solar atmosphere. In total, four\neruptions occur during the evolution of the system. For the first eruption, our\nanalysis indicates that the torus instability initiates the eruption and that\ntether-cutting reconnection of the fieldlines, which envelope the flux rope,\ntriggers the rapid acceleration of the eruptive field. For the following\neruptions, we conjecture that it is the interplay between tether-cutting\nreconnection and torus instability, which causes the onset of the various\nphases. We show the 3D shape of the erupting fields, focusing more on how\nmagnetic fieldlines reconnect during the eruptions. We find that when the\nenvelope fieldlines reconnect mainly with themselves, hot and dense plasma is\ntransferred closer to the core of the erupting flux rope. The same area appears\nto be cooler and less dense when the envelope fieldlines reconnect with\nneighboring sheared fieldlines. The plasma density and temperature\ndistribution, together with the rising speeds, the energies and the size of the\nerupting fields indicate that they may account for small-scale (mini) Coronal\nMass Ejections (CMEs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The He-3 crisis together with\nthe forthcoming establishment of the European Spallation Source have\nnecessitated the development of new technologies for neutron detection. Today,\nseveral promising He-3-free candidates are under detailed study and need to be\nvalidated. This validation process is in general long and expensive. The study\nof detector prototypes using neutron-emitting radioactive sources is a\ncost-effective solution, especially for preliminary investigations. That said,\nneutron-emitting sources have the general disadvantage of broad, structured,\nemitted-neutron energy ranges. Further, the emitted neutrons often compete with\nunwanted backgrounds of gamma-rays, alpha-particles, and fission-fragments. By\nblending experimental infrastructure such as shielding to provide particle\nbeams with neutron-detection techniques such as tagging, disadvantages may be\nconverted into advantages. In particular, a technique known as tagging involves\nexploiting the mixed-field generally associated with a neutron-emitting source\nto determine neutron time-of-flight and thus energy on an event-by-event basis.\nThis allows for the definition of low-cost, precision neutron beams. The\nSource-Testing Facility, located at Lund University in Sweden and operated by\nthe SONNIG Group of the Division of Nuclear Physics, was developed for just\nsuch low-cost studies. Precision tagged-neutron beams derived from radioactive\nsources are available around-the-clock for advanced detector diagnostic\nstudies. Neutron measurements performed at the Source Testing Facility are thus\ncost-effective and have a very low barrier for entry. In this paper, we present\nan overview of the project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 13:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

In this paper, we devise multiple\nvariants of bottleneck building blocks in a residual learning framework by\nsimulating $3\\times3\\times3$ convolutions with $1\\times3\\times3$ convolutional\nfilters on spatial domain (equivalent to 2D CNN) plus $3\\times1\\times1$\nconvolutions to construct temporal connections on adjacent feature maps in\ntime. Furthermore, we propose a new architecture, named Pseudo-3D Residual Net\n(P3D ResNet), that exploits all the variants of blocks but composes each in\ndifferent placement of ResNet, following the philosophy that enhancing\nstructural diversity with going deep could improve the power of neural\nnetworks. Our P3D ResNet achieves clear improvements on Sports-1M video\nclassification dataset against 3D CNN and frame-based 2D CNN by 5.3% and 1.8%,\nrespectively. We further examine the generalization performance of video\nrepresentation produced by our pre-trained P3D ResNet on five different\nbenchmarks and three different tasks, demonstrating superior performances over\nseveral state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which\nno assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard\ntools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of\nbreakdown point. We modify the original definition by studying the number of\noutliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation\nproperties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that\ntakes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is\nnon-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved\nthat the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number of\nobservations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our\nestimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise\nvariance sigma^2 is sigma^2d and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector\nhas only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the\nrate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided\nby (number of observation).\n  Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought by these\nnew estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact,\nbasically any algorithm used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk\nMinimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust version approximating our\nestimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical\nLASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of\ndata that can be used to detect outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 14:28:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

Based on these results, a class of\nasymmetric states, namely, one-way steerable states, are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

It\nfollowed that all other source fields---such as vector fields representing\nmassive and non-massive spin-$1$ particles---need careful scrutiny of the\nappropriate source tensor. This is the subject of our actual paper: we discuss\nin detail the coupling of the gravitational field with (i) a massive complex\nscalar field, (ii) a massive real vector field, and (iii) a massless vector\nfield. We show that different couplings emerge for massive and non-massive\nvector fields. The \\emph{massive} vector field has the \\emph{canonical}\nenergy-momentum tensor as the appropriate source term---which embraces also the\nenergy density furnished by the internal spin. In this case, the vector fields\nare shown to generate a torsion of spacetime. In contrast, the system of a\n\\emph{massless} and charged vector field is associated with the \\emph{metric}\n(Hilbert) energy-momentum tensor due to its additional $\\mathrm{U}(1)$\nsymmetry. Moreover, such vector fields do not generate a torsion of spacetime.\nThe respective sources of gravitation apply for all models of the dynamics of\nthe `free' (uncoupled) gravitational field---which do not follow from the gauge\nformalism but must be specified based on separate physical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 14:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 15:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 10:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 09:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 08:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 14:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Both previous literature in various systems and our calculations in\nLaMnO3, La0.75Sr0.25MnO3, LaFeO3, and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3, show mixed results for\nthe direction and magnitude of the change in vacancy formation energy with\nstrain. This paper develops a model to make sense of the different trend shapes\nin vacancy formation energy versus strain. We model strain effects using a set\nof consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated\nresults may be simply explained in terms of vacancy formation volume and\nchanges in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive\nvacancy formation volume contributes to decreased vacancy formation energy\nunder tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to\nincreases in vacancy formation energy with compressive and tensile strains, and\nvice versa. The vacancy formation volume dominates the linear portion of the\nvacancy formation energy strain response, while its curvature is governed by\nthe vacancy-induced change in elastic constants. We show results sensitive to\nB-site cation, A-site doping, tilt system, and vacancy placement, which\ncontributions may be averaged under thermally averaged conditions. In general,\nvacancy formation energies for most systems calculated here decreased with\ntensile strain, with about a 30-100 meV/% strain decrease with biaxial strain\nfor those systems which showed a decrease in vacancy formation energy.\nExperimental verification is necessary to confirm the model outside of\ncalculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Single atoms and atom-like defects in\nsolids are ideal quantum light sources and quantum memories to store\nentanglement. However, a major obstacle to developing long-range quantum\nnetworks is the mismatch between typical atomic transition energies in the\nultraviolet and visible spectrum, and the low-loss propagation band of optical\nfibers in the infrared, around 1.5 $\\mu$m. A notable exception is the Er$^{3+}$\nion, whose 1.5 $\\mu$m transition is exploited in fiber amplifiers that drive\nmodern communications networks. However, an optical interface to single\nEr$^{3+}$ ions has not yet been achieved because of the low photon emission\nrate, less than 100 Hz, that results from the electric dipole-forbidden nature\nof this transition. Here, we demonstrate that the emission rate of single\nEr$^{3+}$ ions in a solid-state host can be enhanced by a factor of more than\n300 using a small mode-volume, low-loss silicon nanophotonic cavity. This\nenhancement enables the fluorescence from single Er$^{3+}$ ions to be clearly\nobserved for the first time. Tuning the excitation laser over a small frequency\nrange allows dozens of distinct ions to be addressed, and the splitting of the\nlines in a magnetic field confirms that the optical transitions are coupled to\nthe Er$^{3+}$ ions' spins. These results are a significant step towards\nlong-distance quantum networks and deterministic quantum logic for photons,\nbased on a scalable silicon nanophotonics architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

In\n[4] the radiation process in a crystalline undulator with large bending\namplitude of the crystal planes was considered. In this case the trajectories\nof particles that are crossing the crystal planes are close to rectilinear.\nThis allowed consider the radiation process in the first approximation in the\ninteraction of particles with the crystal field analytically. In that paper the\npossibility of manifesting coherent and interference effects in radiation\nleading to high radiation intensity was demonstrated. Taking into account the\nincoherent effects in the particle scattering leads to particle mutual\ntransitions from the sub-barrier to the above-barrier states and vice versa.\nAnalysis of the radiation process in this case can be carried out on the basis\nof numerical simulation method for this process. In this paper such method is\ndeveloped on the basis of the proposed in [5] method of the radiation process\nsimulation in a direct crystal. We present some results of simulation of 1 and\n10 GeV electron radiation in crystalline undulator at different values of the\nplane bending amplitudes. The calculations are performed in the dipole\napproximation of radiation theory with taking into account the recoil effect in\nradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 15:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

A\nrecent approach to engineer artificial cartilage involves seeding cells within\na scaffold consisting of an interconnected 3D-printed lattice of polymer fibres\ncombined with a cast or printed hydrogel, and subjecting the construct\n(cell-seeded scaffold) to an applied load in a bioreactor. A key question is to\nunderstand how the applied load is distributed throughout the construct. To\naddress this, we employ homogenisation theory to derive equations governing the\neffective macroscale material properties of a periodic, elastic-poroelastic\ncomposite. We treat the fibres as a linear elastic material and the hydrogel as\na poroelastic material, and exploit the disparate length scales (small\ninter-fibre spacing compared with construct dimensions) to derive macroscale\nequations governing the response of the composite to an applied load. This\nhomogenised description reflects the orthotropic nature of the composite. To\nvalidate the model, solutions from finite element simulations of the\nmacroscale, homogenised equations are compared to experimental data describing\nthe unconfined compression of the fibre-reinforced hydrogels. The model is used\nto derive the bulk mechanical properties of a cylindrical construct of the\ncomposite material for a range of fibre spacings, and to determine the local\nmechanical environment experienced by cells embedded within the construct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

A hypothesis to explain this failure might be that\nit is difficult to obtain true perceptual integration of a tactile signal with\ninformation from auditory speech: exploitation of tactile cues from a tactile\naid might require cognitive effort and so prevent speech understanding at the\nhigh rates typical of everyday speech. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to\ncreate true perceptual integration of tactile with auditory information in what\nmight be considered the simplest situation encountered by a hearing-impaired\nlistener. We created an auditory continuum between the syllables BA and VA, and\ntrained participants to associate BA to one tactile stimulus VA to another\ntactile stimulus. After training, we tested if auditory discrimination along\nthe continuum between the two syllables could be biased by incongruent tactile\nstimulation. We found that such a bias occurred only when the tactile stimulus\nwas above its previously measured tactile discrimination threshold. Such a\npattern is compatible with the idea that the effect is due to a cognitive or\ndecisional strategy, rather than to truly perceptual integration. We therefore\nran a further study, where we created a tactile version of the McGurk effect.\nWe extensively trained two Subjects over six days to associate four recorded\nauditory syllables with four corresponding apparent motion tactile patterns. In\na subsequent test, we presented stimulation that was either congruent or\nincongruent with the learnt association, and asked Subjects to report the\nsyllable they perceived. We found no analog to the McGurk effect. These\nfindings strengthen our hypothesis according to which tactile aids failed\nbecause integration of tactile cues with auditory speech occurred at a\ncognitive or decisional level, rather than truly at a perceptual level\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 09:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}
