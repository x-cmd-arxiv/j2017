In spherical\ngeometry, such structures consist of intense zonal flows that are invariant\nalong the rotation axis. In planar geometry, long-lived, depth-invariant\nstructures also form at large scales, but, in the absence of horizontal\nanisotropy, they consist of vortices that grow to the domain size. In this\nwork, through the introduction of horizontal anisotropy into a numerical model\nof planar rotating convection by the adoption of unequal horizontal box sizes\n(i.e. $L_x \\le L_y$, where the $xy$-plane is horizontal), we investigate\nwhether unidirectional flows and large-scale vortices can coexist. We find that\nonly a small degree of anisotropy is required to bring about a transition from\ndynamics dominated by persistent large-scale vortices to dynamics dominated by\npersistent unidirectional flows parallel to the shortest horizontal direction.\nWhen the anisotropy is sufficiently large, the unidirectional flow consists of\nmultiple jets, generated on a timescale smaller than a global viscous\ntimescale, thus signifying that the upscale energy transfer does not\nspontaneously feed the largest available mode in the system. That said, the\nmultiple jets merge on much longer timescales. Large-scale vortices of size\ncomparable with $L_x$ systematically form in the flanks of the jets and can be\npersistent or intermittent. This indicates that large-scale vortices, either\ncoexisting with jets or not, are a robust dynamical feature of planar rotating\nconvection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 16:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

First, action spectroscopy under VUV photons was\nperformed using synchrotron radiation in the 8-20 eV range. We observed lower\ndissociation thresholds for the non-planar molecule (AL+) than for the planar\none (AE+) for the main dissociation pathways: H and 2H/H2 loss. In order to\nrationalize the experimental results, dissociation paths were investigated by\nmeans of density functional theory calculations. In the case of H loss, which\nis the dominant channel at the lowest energies, the observed difference between\nthe two isomers can be explained by the presence in AL+ of two C-H bonds with\nconsiderably lower adiabatic dissociation energies. In both isomers the 2H/H2\nloss channels are observed only at about 1 eV higher than H loss. We suggest\nthat this is due to the propensity of bay H atoms to easily form H2. In\naddition, in the case of AL+, we cannot exclude a competition between 2H and H2\nchannels. In particular, the formation of a stable dissociation product with a\nfive-membered ring could account for the low energy sequential loss of 2\nhydrogens.

Venn and Euler diagrams are the best known visual representations of\nsets and their relationships (intersections, containment or subsets, exclusion\nor disjointness). In recent years, alternative forms of visualisation have been\nproposed. Among them, linear diagrams have been shown to compare favourably to\nVenn and Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of set\nrelationships. Recent studies that compared several variants of linear diagrams\nhave demonstrated that users perform best at tasks involving identification of\nintersections, disjointness and subsets when using a horizontally drawn linear\ndiagram with thin lines representing sets, and employing vertical lines as\nguide lines. The essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to\ninterpret this kind of diagram is vertical alignment of parallel lines and\ndetection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic diagrams which support this same\nvisual task have been used in other applications, such as the visualization of\nschedules of activities, where they have been shown to be superior to linear\nGantt charts. In this paper, we present an application of mosaic diagrams for\nvisualization of set relationships, and compare it to linear diagrams in terms\nof accuracy, time-to-answer, and subjective ratings of perceived task\ndifficulty. The study participants exhibited similar performance on both\nvisualisations, suggesting that mosaic diagrams are a good alternative to Venn\nand Euler diagrams, and that the choice between linear diagrams and mosaics may\nbe solely guided by visual design considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 17:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

The ICM is an astrophysical example of a weakly collisional plasma where\nthe Larmor frequencies of charged particles greatly exceed their collision\nfrequencies. This permits formation of pressure anisotropies, driven by\nevolving magnetic fields via adiabatic invariance, or by heat fluxes. SZ\npolarization arises in the process of Compton scattering of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons off the thermal ICM electrons due to the\ndifference in the characteristic thermal velocities of the electrons along two\nmutually orthogonal directions in the sky plane. The signal scales linearly\nwith the optical depth of the region containing large-scale correlated\nanisotropy, and with the degree of anisotropy itself. It has the same spectral\ndependence as the polarization induced by cluster motion with respect to the\nCMB frame (kinematic SZ effect polarization), but can be distinguished by its\nspatial pattern. { For the illustrative case of a galaxy cluster with a cold\nfront, where electron transport is mediated by Coulomb collisions, we estimate\nthe CMB polarization degree at the level of 10$^{-8}$ ($\\sim 10$ nK).

This correlation may be biased by a possible dependence of\n$r_{h}$ on [Fe/H], although studies have shown that $r_{h}$ is correlated with\nGalactocentric distance and independent of [Fe/H]. The dynamical origin of the\n$r_{h}$-metallicity correlation (tidal stripping) suggests that metal-rich GCs\nmay have had more active dynamical histories, which would promote LMXB\nformation. No correlation between the RGB star number density and metallicity\nwas found when using only the GCs that hosted quiescent LMXBs. A complete\ncensus of quiescent LMXBs in our Galaxy is needed to further probe the\nmetallicity effect, which will be possible with the upcoming launch of eROSITA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 18:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

However, even when the Fermi energy exactly lies at the Dirac point,\nthe vacuum polarization of electron-hole pair fluctuation can still screen the\nCoulomb interaction, which leads to derivation from this scaling symmetry and\neventually breakdown of the Efimov effect.

This\nintroduces challenges for learning-based approaches, as 3D object annotations\nare scarce in real images. Previous work chose to train on synthetic data with\nground truth 3D information, but suffered from domain adaptation when tested on\nreal data. In this work, we propose MarrNet, an end-to-end trainable model that\nsequentially estimates 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape. Our disentangled,\ntwo-step formulation has three advantages. First, compared to full 3D shape,\n2.5D sketches are much easier to be recovered from a 2D image; models that\nrecover 2.5D sketches are also more likely to transfer from synthetic to real\ndata. Second, for 3D reconstruction from 2.5D sketches, systems can learn\npurely from synthetic data. This is because we can easily render realistic 2.5D\nsketches without modeling object appearance variations in real images,\nincluding lighting, texture, etc. This further relieves the domain adaptation\nproblem. Third, we derive differentiable projective functions from 3D shape to\n2.5D sketches; the framework is therefore end-to-end trainable on real images,\nrequiring no human annotations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance\non 3D shape reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 19:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Such analyses predict the\npresence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)\ncorrelations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,\nisovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all\nplay a role.

This, in turn, allows to boost\nthe number of examples and thus the robustness of the statistics and its\napplicability.

The\nscheme takes advantage of sampling diversity by inducing intentional timing\nmismatch. Then, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and the\nzero-forcing (ZF) estimator are designed. Moreover, we derive the minimum\nsquare error (MSE) upper bound of the ZF estimator. In addition, we propose the\nequally-divided delay scheme which under certain conditions is the optimal\nsolution to minimize the MSE of the ZF estimator employing the identity matrix\nas pilot matrix. We calculate the uplink achievable rate using maximum ratio\ncombining (MRC) to compare asynchronous and synchronous channel training\nschemes. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the asynchronous channel\nestimation scheme can greatly reduce the harmful effect of pilot contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 22:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Sophisticated inference algorithms are often explained in terms of\ncomposition of smaller parts. However, neither their theoretical justification\nnor their implementation reflects this modularity. We show how to conceptualise\nand analyse such inference algorithms as manipulating intermediate\nrepresentations of probabilistic programs using higher-order functions and\ninductive types, and their denotational semantics. Semantic accounts of\ncontinuous distributions use measurable spaces. However, our use of\nhigher-order functions presents a substantial technical difficulty: it is\nimpossible to define a measurable space structure over the collection of\nmeasurable functions between arbitrary measurable spaces that is compatible\nwith standard operations on those functions, such as function application. We\novercome this difficulty using quasi-Borel spaces, a recently proposed\nmathematical structure that supports both function spaces and continuous\ndistributions. We define a class of semantic structures for representing\nprobabilistic programs, and semantic validity criteria for transformations of\nthese representations in terms of distribution preservation. We develop a\ncollection of building blocks for composing representations. We use these\nbuilding blocks to validate common inference algorithms such as Sequential\nMonte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To emphasize the connection between\nthe semantic manipulation and its traditional measure theoretic origins, we use\nKock's synthetic measure theory. We demonstrate its usefulness by proving a\nquasi-Borel counterpart to the Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 00:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

The exact solution is generally\nnot possible to obtain, but good approximations are provided in many situations\nlike Roe and HLLC Riemann solvers in fluids.

However, a recurring problem\nin such proofs is that data structure abstractions that work well in the\nsequential setting are much harder to reason about in a concurrent setting due\nto complex sharing and overlays. To solve this problem, we propose a novel\napproach to abstracting regions in the heap by encoding the data structure\ninvariant into a local condition on each individual node. This condition may\ndepend on a quantity associated with the node that is computed as a fixpoint\nover the entire heap graph. We refer to this quantity as a flow. Flows can\nencode both structural properties of the heap (e.g. the reachable nodes from\nthe root form a tree) as well as data invariants (e.g. sortedness). We then\nintroduce the notion of a flow interface, which expresses the relies and\nguarantees that a heap region imposes on its context to maintain the local flow\ninvariant with respect to the global heap. Our main technical result is that\nthis notion leads to a new semantic model of separation logic. In this model,\nflow interfaces provide a general abstraction mechanism for describing complex\ndata structures. This abstraction mechanism admits proof rules that generalize\nover a wide variety of data structures. To demonstrate the versatility of our\napproach, we show how to extend the logic RGSep with flow interfaces. We have\nused this new logic to prove linearizability and memory safety of nontrivial\nconcurrent data structures. In particular, we obtain parametric linearizability\nproofs for concurrent dictionary algorithms that abstract from the details of\nthe underlying data structure representation.

Video naturally consists of static\nand motion information, which can be represented by frame and optical flow.\nRecently, researchers generally adopt the deep networks to capture the static\nand motion information \\textbf{\\emph{separately}}, which mainly has two\nlimitations: (1) Ignoring the coexistence relationship between spatial and\ntemporal attention, while they should be jointly modelled as the spatial and\ntemporal evolutions of video, thus discriminative video features can be\nextracted.(2) Ignoring the strong complementarity between static and motion\ninformation coexisted in video, while they should be collaboratively learned to\nboost each other. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes\nthe approach of two-stream collaborative learning with spatial-temporal\nattention (TCLSTA), which consists of two models: (1) Spatial-temporal\nattention model: The spatial-level attention emphasizes the salient regions in\nframe, and the temporal-level attention exploits the discriminative frames in\nvideo. They are jointly learned and mutually boosted to learn the\ndiscriminative static and motion features for better classification\nperformance. (2) Static-motion collaborative model: It not only achieves mutual\nguidance on static and motion information to boost the feature learning, but\nalso adaptively learns the fusion weights of static and motion streams, so as\nto exploit the strong complementarity between static and motion information to\npromote video classification. Experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show that\nour TCLSTA approach achieves the best performance compared with more than 10\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 06:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

We follow a kinetic approach\nsimilar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean\nfield limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is\nthat the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate\nand solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC\napproach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic\nconcepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.\nFurthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which\nconsiders a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our\nkinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a\nmesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law.\nFor the stock price distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in\nthe case of long-term investors or a power-law in the case of high-frequency\ntrader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail, which is a well\nknown characteristic of real financial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 08:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 23:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

Changes in synaptic efficacy between neurons constitute one of the\nmajor mechanisms of plasticity. Therefore, estimation of neural connections is\ncrucial for investigating information processing in the brain. Although many\nanalysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, most of them suffer from\none or all the following mathematical difficulties: (1) only partially observed\nneural activity is available; (2) correlations can include both direct and\nindirect pseudo-interactions; and (3) biological evidence that a neuron\ntypically has only one type of connection (excitatory or inhibitory) should be\nconsidered. To overcome these difficulties, a novel probabilistic framework for\nestimating neural connections from partially observed spikes is proposed in\nthis paper. First, based on the property of a sum of random variables, the\nproposed method estimates the influence of unobserved neurons on observed\nneurons and extracts only the correlations among observed neurons. Second, the\nrelationship between pseudo-correlations and target connections is modeled by\nneural propagation in a multiplicative manner.

The\nfamily of weak flip codes is presented and shown to contain many beautiful\nproperties. In particular the subfamily fair weak flip codes, which goes back\nto Berlekamp, Gallager, and Shannon and which was shown to achieve the error\nexponent with a fixed number of codewords $M$, can be seen as a generalization\nof linear codes to an arbitrary number of codewords. Based on the column-wise\napproach, the $r$-wise Hamming distance is introduced as a generalization to\nthe widely used (pairwise) Hamming distance. It is shown that the minimum\n$r$-wise Hamming distance satisfies a generalized $r$-wise Plotkin bound. The\n$r$-wise Hamming distance structure of the nonlinear fair weak flip codes is\nanalyzed and shown to be superior to many codes. In particular, it is proven\nthat the fair weak flip codes achieve the $r$-wise Plotkin bound with equality\nfor all $r$. In the second part of the paper, these insights are applied to a\nbinary erasure channel (BEC) with an arbitrary erasure probability. An exact\nformula for the average error probability of an arbitrary code using maximum\nlikelihood decoding is derived and shown to be expressible using only the\n$r$-wise Hamming distance structure of the code.

As such, it is a crucial part of the water exchange\nbetween the Arabian Sea (AS) and BoB. The processes that determine the\nevolution, intensification and meandering of the SMC are only partly\nunderstood. They involve both local and remote forcing by the wind, as well as\ninteractions with westward-propagating Rossby waves and eddies. In this study,\nwe investigate these processes using an Indian-Ocean general circulation model\n(MOM4p1) that is capable of simulating the SMC realistcally. Because eddies and\nmeanders are smoothed out in the climatology, our analyses focus on a single\nyear of 2009, a period when a strong anticyclonic bend in the SMC was observed.\nAn eddy-kinetic-energy budget analysis shows the region to be a zone of\nsignificant eddy activity, where both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities\nare active. Based on the analysis, we classify the evolution of SMC into stages\nof onset, intensification, anticyclonic bend, anticyclonic vortex formation,\nmeandering and termination. In addition, analysis of eddy-potential-vorticity\nflux and eddy-enstrophy decay reveal when, where, and how the eddies tend to\ndrive the mean flow. Rossby waves and westward-propagating eddies arriving from\nthe east energize the SMC in June and accelerate the mean flow through an\nup-gradient eddy-potential-vorticity flux. At the same time, local winds also\nstrengthen the flow, by increasing its mean, near-surface, kinetic energy and\nraising isopycnals, the latter building up available potential energy (APE).\nThe baroclinic instability that takes place in late--July and early--August\nreleases APE, thereby generating the SMC meanders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 10:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 11:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 10:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

Results We propose a new method to\ncorrect short reads using de Bruijn graphs, and implement it as a tool called\nBcool.

The\nperformance of stepwise SVM was more stable than that of PCA and RF-RFE, but\nthe performance difference with respect to PCCs was minimal. It is necessary to\nreduce the dimensions of large p small n datasets.

Despite this, the straight-line restriction is still practically\nsensible since this condition is typically met by string constraints that are\ngenerated by symbolic execution. In this paper, we provide the first systematic\nstudy of straight-line string constraints with the string-replace function and\nthe regular constraints as the basic operations. We show that a large class of\nsuch constraints (i.e. when only a constant string or a regular expression is\npermitted in the pattern) is decidable. We note that the string-replace\nfunction, even under this restriction, is sufficiently powerful for expressing\nthe concatenation operator and much more (e.g. extensions of regular\nexpressions with string variables). This gives us the most expressive decidable\nlogic containing concatenation, replace, and regular constraints under the same\numbrella. Our decision procedure for the straight-line fragment follows an\nautomata-theoretic approach, and is modular in the sense that the\nstring-replace terms are removed one by one to generate more and more regular\nconstraints, which can then be discharged by the state-of-the-art string\nconstraint solvers. We also show that this fragment is, in a way, a maximal\ndecidable subclass of the straight-line fragment with string-replace and\nregular constraints. To this end, we show undecidability results for the\nfollowing two extensions: (1) variables are permitted in the pattern parameter\nof the replace function, (2) length constraints are permitted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 13:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

A joint design of coded\ncaching (CC) and multigroup multicast beamforming is proposed to benefit from\nspatial multiplexing gain, improved interference management and the global CC\ngain, simultaneously. The developed general content delivery strategies utilize\nthe multiantenna multicasting opportunities provided by the CC technique while\noptimally balancing the detrimental impact of both noise and inter-stream\ninterference from coded messages transmitted in parallel. Flexible resource\nallocation schemes for CC are introduced where the multicast beamformer design\nand the receiver complexity are controlled by varying the size of the subset of\nusers served during a given time interval, and the overlap among the multicast\nmessages transmitted in parallel, indicated by parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$,\nrespectively. Degrees of freedom (DoF) analysis is provided showing that the\nDoF only depends on $\\alpha$ while it is independent of $\\beta$. The proposed\nschemes are shown to provide the same degrees-of-freedom at high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the state-of-art methods and, in general, to\nperform significantly better, especially in the finite SNR regime, than several\nbaseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 13:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 15:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 18:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

(1) The dialog state can contain\nonly a single value for a slot, and (2) can contain only users' affirmative\npreference over the values for a slot. (3) Current task-based dialog systems\nmainly focus on the searching task, while the enquiring task is also very\ncommon in practice. The above observations motivate us to enrich current\nrepresentation of dialog states and collect a brand new dialog dataset about\nmovies, based upon which we build a new DST, called enriched DST (EDST), for\nflexible accessing movie information. The EDST supports the searching task, the\nenquiring task and their mixed task. We show that the new EDST method not only\nachieves good results on Iqiyi dataset, but also outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art DST methods on the traditional dialog datasets, WOZ2.0 and\nDSTC2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 14:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 16:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

In order to estimate the seismic\nvulnerability of a densely populated urban area, it would in principle be\nnecessary to develop in-depth analyses for predicting the dynamic behaviour of\nthe individual buildings and their structural aggregation. Such analyses,\nhowever, are extremely cost-intensive, require great processing time and above\nall expertise judgement. It is therefore very useful to define simplified rules\nfor estimating the seismic vulnerability of whole urban areas. In the last\ndecades, the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) scenario has gained increasing\ncredibility as a mathematical framework for explaining a large number of\nnaturally occurring extreme events, from avalanches to earthquakes dynamics,\nfrom bubbles and crises in financial markets to the extinction of species in\nthe evolution or the behaviour of human brain activity. All these examples show\nthe intrinsic tendency common to many phenomena to spontaneously organize into\na dynamical critical state, whose signature is the presence of a power law\nbehaviour in the frequency distribution of events. In this context, the\nOlami-Feder- Christensen (OFC) model, introduced in 1992, has played a key role\nin modelling earthquakes phenomenology. The aim of the present paper is\nproposing an agent-based model of earthquake dynamics, based on the OFC self-\norganized criticality framework, in order to evaluate the effects of a critical\nsequence of seismic events on a given large urban area during a given interval\nof time. The further integration of a GIS database within a software\nenvironment for agent-based simulations, will allow to perform a preliminary\nparametric study of these effects on real datasets. The model could be useful\nfor defining planning strategies for seismic risk reduction\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 14:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

RV Tauri-type variables are pulsating post-AGB stars that evolve\nrapidly through the instability strip after leaving the Asymptotic Giant\nBranch. Their light variability is dominated by radial pulsations. Members of\nthe RVb subclass show an additional variability in form of a long-term\nmodulation of the mean brightness, for which the most popular theories all\nassume binarity and some kind of circumstellar dust. Here we address if the\namplitude modulations are consistent with the dust obscuration model. Aims. We\nmeasure and interpret the overall changes of the mean amplitude of the\npulsations along the RVb variability. Methods. We compiled long-term\nphotometric data for RVb-type stars, including visual observations of the\nAmerican Association of Variable Star Observers, ground-based CCD photometry\nfrom the OGLE and ASAS projects and ultra-precise space photometry of one star,\nDF Cygni, from the Kepler space telescope. After converting all the\nobservations to flux units, we measure the cycle-to-cycle variations of the\npulsation amplitude and correlate them to the actual mean fluxes. Results. We\nfind a surprisingly uniform correlation between the pulsation amplitude and the\nmean flux: they scale linearly with each other for a wide range of fluxes and\namplitudes. It means that the pulsation amplitude actually remains constant\nwhen measured relative to the system flux level.

We show that on the average, we can compute one approximate root of a\nrandom Gaussian polynomial system of~$n$ equations of degree at most $D$ in\n$n+1$ homogeneous variables with $O(n^5 D^2)$ continuation steps. This is a\ndecisive improvement over previous bounds that prove no better than\n$\\sqrt{2}^{\\min(n, D)}$ continuation steps on the average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 15:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 09:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

In this study, we explore\nwhether one iteration of $k$-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with\n$C$ at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective.\nThe tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is\ntypically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many\nhidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated\nvariational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The\nbasic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ required for a full E-step to a sublinear\ncomplexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on $C$ can be\nreduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter $G$ which relates to\ncluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational\nEM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NG^2D)$, and\nvariational $k$-means, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NGD)$ per iteration. Empirical\nresults show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of\niterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as $k$-means.

This investigation is motivated by the discovery of exocomets\nin various systems, especially $\\beta$ Pictoris, as well as in at least ten\nother systems. Detailed theoretical studies about the formation and evolution\nof star--planet systems indicate that exocomets should be quite common. Further\nobservational results are expected in the foreseeable future, in part due to\nthe availability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Nonetheless, the Solar\nSystem represents the best studied example for comets, thus serving as a prime\nmotivation for investigating comets in HD 10180 as well. HD 10180 is strikingly\nsimilar to the Sun. This system contains six confirmed planets and (at least)\ntwo additional planets subject to final verification. In our studies, we\nconsider comets of different inclinations and eccentricities and find an array\nof different outcomes such as encounters with planets, captures, and escapes.\nComets with relatively large eccentricities are able to enter the inner region\nof the system facing early planetary encounters. Stable comets experience\nlong-term evolution of orbital elements, as expected. We also tried to\ndistinguish cometary families akin to our Solar System but no clear distinction\nbetween possible families was found. Generally, theoretical and observational\nstudies of exoplanets have a large range of ramifications, involving the\norigin, structure and evolution of systems as well as the proliferation of\nwater and prebiotic compounds to terrestrial planets, which will increase their\nchances of being habitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 23:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

The working\nrange of this module includes multiple bands i.e. GSM, ISM, WLAN, and UWB band.\nTo enhance the capturing RF power capability an array arrangement of coplanar\nmonopole antenna has been proposed. Wilkinson power combiner has also been\nimplemented to combine the powers of this antenna array. The RF DC converter\ncircuit having seven stages has also been integrated with this structure. This\nmodule produces the DC voltage of 1.8V with respect to +40dB RF input. It is\nthe unique module because it has no need of port connectors. The impedance\nmatching of antenna and converter has been fulfilled by incorporating the\npassive component at the combiners branch. The value of this passive component\nis kept equal to the existing value of impedance at input port of converter\ncircuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 09:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}
