For this purpose, a\nplethora of complex architectures (including multi-phase materials) and\nmulti-physics approaches have been proposed in the past, often involving\ndifficulties in their practical realization.\n  To address this issue, in this work we propose an easy-to-manufacture design\nable to open large, low frequency complete Lamb band gaps exploiting a suitable\narrangement of masses and stiffnesses produced by cavities in a monolithic\nmaterial. The performance of the designed structure is evaluated by numerical\nsimulations and confirmed by Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV)\nmeasurements on an isotropic polyvinyl chloride plate in which a square ring\nregion of cross-like cavities is fabricated. The full wave field reconstruction\nclearly confirms the ability of even a limited number of unit cell rows of the\nproposed design to efficiently attenuate Lamb waves. In addition, numerical\nsimulations show that the structure allows to shift of the central frequency of\nthe BG through geometrical modifications. The design may be of interest for\napplications in which large BGs at low frequencies are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

We\ndescribe two extensions to the standard tree boosting algorithm designed to\nincrease this advantage. The first improvement extends the boosting formalism\nfrom scalar-valued trees to vector-valued trees. This allows individual trees\nto be used as multiclass classifiers, rather than requiring one tree per class,\nand drastically reduces the model size required for multiclass problems. We\nalso show that some other popular vector-valued gradient boosted trees\nmodifications fit into this formulation and can be easily obtained in our\nimplementation. The second extension, layer-by-layer boosting, takes smaller\nsteps in function space, which is empirically shown to lead to a faster\nconvergence and to a more compact ensemble. We have added both improvements to\nthe open-source TensorFlow Boosted trees (TFBT) package, and we demonstrate\ntheir efficacy on a variety of multiclass datasets.

Our technique allows us to estimate both\nthe vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed\nwithout specifying any extra parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the\nwave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave\npaths of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different\nheights and guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path\ndepends upon the distance between the layers and the inclination angle of the\nmagnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the\ndistance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local\nmagnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at\ndifferent heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated\nthe vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum\n(1600 {\\AA}) and transition region (304 {\\AA}), as well as the average phase\nspeed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions.

The refrigerator is composed of a\nparametrically driven system (which we also consider to be a single oscillator\nin the simplest case) which is coupled to a reservoir where the energy is\ndumped. We show that the cooling of the oscillator (that can be achieved due to\nthe resonant transport of its phonon excitations into the environment) is\nalways stopped by a fundamental heating process that is always dominant at\nsufficiently low temperatures. This process can be described as the non\nresonant production of excitation pairs. This result is in close analogy with\nthe recent study that showed that pair production is responsible for enforcing\nthe validity of the dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics (Phys.\nRev.

Interestingly, we relate our model to the usual ones used\nto describe laser cooling of a single trapped ion and reobtaining the correct\nlimiting temperatures for the limits of resolved and non-resolved sidebands.\nOur findings (that also serve to estimate the lowest temperatures that can be\nachieved in a variety of other situations) indicate that the limit for laser\ncooling can also be associated with non resonant pair production.

Moreover, we observe\nthat the spin lifetime varies over one order of magnitude depending on the spin\norientation, indicating that the strong spin-valley coupling in WS$_2$ is\nimprinted in the bilayer and felt by the propagating spins. These findings\nprovide a rich platform to explore coupled spin-valley phenomena and offer\nnovel spin manipulation strategies based on spin relaxation anisotropy in\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 15:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 08:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

One of the species of particles\n($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication\nforks. Motivated by the biological phenomena that this model is intended to\ncapture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles are allowed to enter the lattice\nfrom two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles\nconstitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment\nin the middle of the lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three\nsegments; the encounters of the $P$ particles with the $R$ particles are\nconfined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$ particles\ncan occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three\ndistinct pathways for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision\nbetween the $P$ and $R$ particles.

This problem is called virtual network\nembedding (\"VNE\"). Many researches have been proposed in an attempt to solve\nthis problem, which have many optimization aspects, such as improving embedding\nstrategies in a way that preserves energy, reducing embedding cost and\nincreasing embedding revenue. Moreover, some researchers have extended their\nalgorithms to be more compatible with the distributed clouds instead of a\nsingle infrastructure provider (\"ISP\"). This paper proposes energy aware\nparticle swarm optimization algorithm for distributed clouds. This algorithm\naims to partition each virtual network request (\"VNR\") to subgraphs, using the\nHeavy Clique Matching technique (\"HCM\") to generate a coarsened graph. Each\ncoarsened node in the coarsened graph is assigned to a suitable data center\n(\"DC\"). Inside each DC, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is\ninitiated to find the near optimal solution for the VNE problem.

The best known algorithm due to\nVempala and Wang [JCSS 2004] requires a separation of roughly\n$\\min\\{k,d\\}^{1/4}$.

This phase is dominated by in-situ star formation, partly triggered by\nmergers. In the mass range 10^{9.5} M_sun < M_star < 10^{10.5} M_sun galaxies\nevolve towards a disk-dominated morphology, driven by in-situ star formation.\nThe central spheroid (i.e. the bulge) at z = 0 consists mostly of stars that\nformed in-situ, yet the formation of the bulge is to a large degree associated\nwith mergers. Finally, at M_star > 10^{10.5} M_sun growth through in-situ star\nformation slows down considerably and galaxies transform towards a more\nspheroidal morphology. This transformation is driven more by the buildup of\nspheroids than by the destruction of disks. Spheroid formation in these\ngalaxies happens mostly by accretion at large radii of stars formed ex-situ\n(i.e. the halo rather than the bulge).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 18:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 13:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

To account for smoothness in the\nquantile functions, we introduce custom basis functions we call\n\\textit{quantlets} that are sparse, regularized, near-lossless, and empirically\ndefined, adapting to the features of a given data set and containing a Gaussian\nsubspace so {non-Gaussianness} can be assessed. While these quantlets could be\nused within various functional regression frameworks, we build a Bayesian\nframework that uses nonlinear shrinkage of quantlet coefficients to regularize\nthe functional regression coefficients and allows fully Bayesian inferences\nafter fitting a Markov chain Monte Carlo. Specifically, we apply global tests\nto assess which covariates have any effect on the distribution at all, followed\nby local tests to identify at which specific quantiles the differences lie\nwhile adjusting for multiple testing, and to assess whether the covariate\naffects certain major aspects of the distribution, including location, scale,\nskewness, Gaussianness, or tails. If the difference lies in these commonly-used\nsummaries, our approach can still detect them, but our systematic modeling\nstrategy can also detect effects on other aspects of the distribution that\nmight be missed if one restricted attention to pre-chosen summaries.

Much of this paper focuses on a specific set of\nexamples of GLSMs for intersections of Grassmannians G(2,N) with themselves\nafter a linear rotation, including the Calabi-Yau case N=5. One phase of the\nGLSM realizes an intersection of two Grassmannians, the other phase realizes an\nintersection of two Pfaffians. The GLSM has two nonabelian factors in its gauge\ngroup, and we consider dualities in those factors. In both the original GLSM\nand a double-dual, one geometric phase is realized perturbatively (as the\ncritical locus of a superpotential), and the other via quantum effects.\nDualizing on a single gauge group factor yields a model in which each geometry\nis realized through a simultaneous combination of perturbative and quantum\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 18:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 15:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

We perform\nthe analysis in a large $N_{\\mathrm{f}}$ expansion, addressing the convergence\nof the obtained results by taking $1/N_{\\mathrm{f}}$ corrections into account\nas well. In addition, we investigate the renormalization group flow of the\nscalar potential on a nonperturbative level. Within these approximations, we\nare able to identify bare potentials that lead to Higgs masses below stability\nmass bounds obtained from finite-order polynomial bare interactions without\nintroducing a metastability in the effective potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 19:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 21:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Using observational data to answer causal\nquestions is risky: subjects who receive different treatments also differ in\nother ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been\ndeveloped to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which\nmethod might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study.\nIn analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of\npredictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a\nprocedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods\napplied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to\nestimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each\ncausal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and\ncompare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using\nsimulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference\nmethod for each study lowers the expected estimation error relative to\nconsistently using any single method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 20:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

This implies very diverse jet production\nefficiencies which can result from the spread of the black hole spins and\nmagnetic fluxes. Magnetic fluxes can be developed stochastically in the\ninnermost zones of accretion discs, or can be advected to the central regions\nprior to the AGN phase.

In the former case the differences should be negligible\nfor objects having the same Eddington ratio. To study the problem we decided to\nconduct a comparison study of host galaxy properties of RL and RQ AGNs. In this\nstudy we selected type II AGNs from SDSS spectroscopic catalogues. Our RL AGN\nsample consists of the AGNs appearing in the Best & Heckman (2012) catalogue of\nradio galaxies.

We found that in the studied group RL AGNs are\npreferentially hosted by elliptical galaxies while RQ ones are hosted by\ngalaxies of later type.

The simplest neutral\nconfinement model is analyzed for hard spheres where there is no change of the\nequilibrium pair structure upon particle pinning. As the pinned fraction grows,\ncage scale dynamical constraints are intensified in a manner that increases\nwith density. This results in the mobile particles becoming more transiently\nlocalized, with increases of the jump distance, cage scale barrier and NLE\ntheory mean hopping time; subtle changes of the dynamic shear modulus are\npredicted. The results are contrasted with recent simulations. Similarities in\nrelaxation behavior are identified in the dynamic precursor regime, including a\nroughly exponential, or weakly supra-exponential, growth of the alpha time with\npinning fraction and a reduction of dynamic fragility. However, the increase of\nthe alpha time with pinning predicted by the local NLE theory is too small, and\nseverely so at very high volume fractions. The strong deviations are argued to\nbe due to the longer range collective elasticity aspect of the problem which is\nexpected to be modified by random pinning in a complex manner. A qualitative\nphysical scenario is offered for how the three distinct aspects that quantify\nthe elastic barrier may change with pinning. ECNLE theory calculations of the\nalpha time are then presented based on the simplest effective-medium-like\ntreatment for how random pinning modifies the elastic barrier.

This provides an incremental method requiring $O(Kn^2)$ time and\n$O(n^2)$ memory in the worst case to update all pairs of similarities for $K$\niterations.

The first algorithm utilizes the\nredundancy of visibilities inside a UV cell in the visibility plane to identify\ncorrupted data, while varying the detection threshold in accordance with the\nobserved reduction in noise with radial UV distance. In the second algorithm,\nwe propose a scheme to detect faint RFI in the visibility time-channel plane of\nbaselines. The efficacy of identifying RFI in the residual visibilities is\nreduced by the presence of ripples due to inaccurate subtraction of the\nstrongest sources. This can be due to several reasons including primary beam\nasymmetries and other direction dependent calibration errors. We eliminated\nthese ripples by clipping the corresponding peaks in the associated Fourier\nplane. RFI was detected in the ripple-free time-channel plane but was flagged\nin the original visibilities. Application of these two algorithms to 5\ndifferent 150 MHz datasets from the GMRT resulted in a reduction in image noise\nof 20-50% throughout the field along with a reduction in systematics and a\ncorresponding increase in the number of detected sources.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize\nthe concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads\nto favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and\navoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules\ninto the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector\nfor a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption\nthat the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this\ngenie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any\npractical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different\ncomplexity are proposed. The proposed ML detector as well as one of the\nsuboptimal detectors require the channel response (CR) of the considered MC\nsystem. Moreover, the CR is needed for the performance evaluation of all\nproposed detectors. However, analyzing MC with reactive signaling is\nchallenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe\nthe reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, an\nalgorithm is developed in this paper for efficient computation of the CR to any\narbitrary transmit symbol sequence. The accuracy of this algorithm is validated\nvia particle-based simulation. Simulation results using the developed CR\nalgorithm show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal detectors can\napproach that of the genie- aided ML detector. Moreover, these results show\nthat MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to\nthose with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the\nchemical reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 22:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

Recent theoretical results have shown that\noptimistic mirror decent (OMD) can enjoy faster regret rates in the context of\nzero-sum games. WGANs is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with\nsimultaneous no-regret dynamics. Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror\ndecent addresses the limit cycling problem in training WGANs. We formally show\nthat in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of OMD dynamics\nconverges to an equilibrium, in contrast to GD dynamics which are bound to\ncycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between GD and OMD\ndynamics with toy examples, even when GD is modified with many adaptations\nproposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We\napply OMD WGAN training to a bioinformatics problem of generating DNA\nsequences. We observe that models trained with OMD achieve consistently smaller\nKL divergence with respect to the true underlying distribution, than models\ntrained with GD variants.

One popular method of drug repositioning is network-based DTI\nprediction, which uses complex network theory to predict DTIs from a\ndrug-target network. Currently, most network-based DTI prediction is based on\nmachine learning methods such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) or Support\nVector Machines (SVM). These methods require additional information about the\ncharacteristics of drugs, targets and DTIs, such as chemical structure, genome\nsequence, binding types, causes of interactions, etc., and do not perform\nsatisfactorily when such information is unavailable. We propose a new,\nalternative method for DTI prediction that makes use of only network topology\ninformation attempting to solve this problem.\n  Results: We compare our method for DTI prediction against the well-known RBM\napproach. We show that when applied to the MATADOR database, our approach based\non node neighborhoods yield higher precision for high-ranking predictions than\nRBM when no information regarding DTI types is available.\n  Conclusion: This demonstrates that approaches purely based on network\ntopology provide a more suitable approach to DTI prediction in the many\nreal-life situations where little or no prior knowledge is available about the\ncharacteristics of drugs, targets, or their interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 00:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

It is well\nknown that microbes live in diverse communities in which they interact\nsynergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating microbial associations\nwith clinical covariates, multivariate statistical models are preferred.\nMultivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex interdependencies\namong multiple taxa, yielding more powerful tests of exposure or treatment\neffects than application of taxon-specific univariate analyses. In addition,\nthe analysis of microbial count data requires special attention because data\ncommonly exhibit zero inflation. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian\nvariable selection model for multivariate count data with excess zeros that\nincorporates information on the covariance structure of the outcomes (counts\nfor multiple taxa), while estimating associations with the mean levels of these\noutcomes. Although there has been a great deal of effort in zero-inflated\nmodels for longitudinal data, little attention has been given to\nhigh-dimensional multivariate zero-inflated data modeled via a general\ncorrelation structure. Through simulation, we compared performance of the\nproposed method to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary\nand count parts of the model.

This magnetic stress has long been observed as the phenomenon of\n\"filament channels:\" strongly sheared magnetic field localized around\nphotospheric polarity inversion lines. However, the mechanism for the stress\nbuildup - the formation of filament channels - is still debated. We present\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal volume that is driven by\ntransient, cellular boundary flows designed to model the processes by which the\nphotosphere drives the corona. The key feature of our simulations is that they\naccurately preserve magnetic helicity, the topological quantity that is\nconserved even in the presence of ubiquitous magnetic reconnection. Although\nsmall-scale random stress is injected everywhere at the photosphere, driving\nstochastic reconnection throughout the corona, the net result of the magnetic\nevolution is a coherent shearing of the lowest-lying field lines. This highly\ncounter-intuitive result - magnetic stress builds up locally rather than\nspreading out to attain a minimum energy state - explains the formation of\nfilament channels and is the fundamental mechanism underlying SEEs.\nFurthermore, this mechanism may be relevant to other astrophysical or\nlaboratory plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 02:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

The instability is\ncharacterized by the appearance of sidebands separated by tens of free spectral\nranges (FSR) from the first lasing mode, at a pump current not much higher than\nthe lasing threshold. As the current is increased, higher-order sidebands\nappear that preserve the initial spacing, and the spectra are suggestive of\nharmonically phase-locked waveforms. We present a theory of the instability\nthat applies to all homogeneously broadened standing-wave lasers. The low\ninstability threshold and the large sideband spacing can be explained by the\ncombination of an unclamped, incoherent Lorentzian gain due to the population\ngrating, and a coherent parametric gain caused by temporal population\npulsations that changes the spectral gain line shape. The parametric term\nsuppresses the gain of sidebands whose separation is much smaller than the\nreciprocal gain recovery time, while enhancing the gain of more distant\nsidebands. The large gain recovery frequency of the QCL compared to the FSR is\nessential to observe this parametric effect, which is responsible for the\nmultiple-FSR sideband separation. We predict that by tuning the strength of the\nincoherent gain contribution, for example by engineering the modal overlap\nfactors and the carrier diffusion, both amplitude-modulated (AM) or\nfrequency-modulated emission can be achieved from QCLs. We provide initial\nevidence of an AM waveform emitted by a QCL with highly asymmetric facet\nreflectivities, thereby opening a promising route to ultrashort pulse\ngeneration in the mid-infrared. Together, the experiments and theory clarify a\ndeep connection between parametric oscillation in optically pumped\nmicroresonators and the single-mode instability of lasers, tying together\nliterature from the last 60 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 03:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

The benefit of using a PGM as the\nfunctional connectome is that posterior inference can be done efficiently and\ncircumvent the complexities in direct inference of response pathways in dynamic\nneuronal networks. In particular, posterior inference reveals the relations\nbetween known stimuli and downstream neurons or allows to query which stimuli\nare associated with downstream neurons. For validation and as an example for\nour approach we apply our methodology to a model of Caenorhabiditis elegans\nnervous system which structure and dynamics are well-studied.

The problem is challenging due to the variety of objects\nas well as the complexity of a scene caused by clutter and occlusions between\nobjects. In this work, we introduce PoseCNN, a new Convolutional Neural Network\nfor 6D object pose estimation. PoseCNN estimates the 3D translation of an\nobject by localizing its center in the image and predicting its distance from\nthe camera. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by regressing to a\nquaternion representation. We also introduce a novel loss function that enables\nPoseCNN to handle symmetric objects. In addition, we contribute a large scale\nvideo dataset for 6D object pose estimation named the YCB-Video dataset. Our\ndataset provides accurate 6D poses of 21 objects from the YCB dataset observed\nin 92 videos with 133,827 frames. We conduct extensive experiments on our\nYCB-Video dataset and the OccludedLINEMOD dataset to show that PoseCNN is\nhighly robust to occlusions, can handle symmetric objects, and provide accurate\npose estimation using only color images as input. When using depth data to\nfurther refine the poses, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nchallenging OccludedLINEMOD dataset.

The goal\nis to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in an information\nnetwork and simultaneously capture and preserve the network structure. Critical\nto the performance of a network embedding method is how the edges/vertexes of\nthe network is sampled for the learning process. Many existing methods adopt a\nuniform sampling method to reduce learning complexity, but when the network is\nnon-uniform (i.e. a weighted network) such uniform sampling incurs information\nloss.

We calculate a grid of 1D\nhydrostatic plane-parallel models covering the ranges in effective temperature\nand gravity encountered during the evolution of a two-dimensional\ntime-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid computed with the\nradiation-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD. We perform 1D spectral syntheses for\nartificial iron lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium varying the\nmicroturbulent velocity and abundance. We fit the resulting equivalent widths\nto corresponding values obtained from our dynamical model. For the\nfour-parametric case, the stellar parameters are typically underestimated\nexhibiting a bias in the iron abundance of $\\approx-0.2\\,\\mbox{dex}$. To avoid\nbiases of this kind it is favourable to restrict the spectroscopic analysis to\nphotometric phases $\\phi_\\mathrm{ph}\\approx0.3\\ldots 0.65$ using additional\ninformation to fix effective temperature and surface gravity. Hydrostatic 1D\nmodel atmospheres can provide unbiased estimates of stellar parameters and\nabundances of Cepheid variables for particular phases of their pulsations. We\nidentified convective inhomogeneities as the main driver behind potential\nbiases. For obtaining a complete view on the effects when determining stellar\nparameters with 1D models, multi-dimensional Cepheid atmosphere models are\nnecessary for variables of longer period than investigated here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 07:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 15:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

The network, named 3D-SSD,\ncomposed of two parts: hierarchical feature fusion and multi-layer prediction.\nThe hierarchical feature fusion combines appearance and geometric features from\nRGB-D images while the multi-layer prediction utilizes multi-scale features for\nobject detection. As a result, the network can exploit 2.5D representations in\na synergetic way to improve the accuracy and efficiency. The issue of object\nsizes is addressed by attaching a set of 3D anchor boxes with varying sizes to\nevery location of the prediction layers.

Previous studies show that\nincluding more features does not necessarily bring positive effect. How to\nprevent the augmented features worsening classification performance is crucial\nbut rarely studied. In this paper, we study this challenging problem by\nproposing a secure classification approach, whose accuracy is never degenerated\nwhen exploiting augmented features. We propose two ways to achieve the security\nof our method named as SEcure Classification (SEC). Firstly, to leverage\naugmented features, we learn various types of classifiers and adapt them by\nemploying a specially designed robust loss. It provides various candidate\nclassifiers to meet the following assumption of security operation. Secondly,\nwe integrate all candidate classifiers by approximately maximizing the\nperformance improvement. Under a mild assumption, the integrated classifier has\ntheoretical security guarantee. Several new optimization methods have been\ndeveloped to accommodate the problems with proved convergence. Besides\nevaluating SEC on 16 data sets, we also apply SEC in the application of\ndiagnostic classification of schizophrenia since it has vast application\npotentiality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEC in both\ntackling security problem and discriminating schizophrenic patients from\nhealthy controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 07:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

After correcting for the point spread function of the telescope and\nusing optically thin emission lines, we find that the line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion of the hot gas is remarkably low and mostly uniform. The velocity\ndispersion reaches maxima of approximately 200~km~s$^{-1}$ toward the central\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) and toward the AGN inflated north-western `ghost'\nbubble. Elsewhere within the observed region, the velocity dispersion appears\nconstant around 100~km~s$^{-1}$.

It remains a challenging\ntask when input images severe occlusions caused by, e.g., adverse camera views.\nUnder such circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be\nproduced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting\ngeometric constraints of landmark point inter-connectivity. To address the\nproblem, by incorporating priors about the structure of pose components, we\npropose a novel structure-aware fully convolutional network to implicitly take\nsuch priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning\nof such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, inspired by how human\nidentifies implausible poses, we design discriminators to distinguish the real\nposes from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose\ngenerator G generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from\nreal ones, the network successfully learns the priors.

In this article, a\nglobal spectral description of the oscillations is presented that results in an\nimplicit matrix eigenvalue equation where the eigenvalues are associated\npredominantly with the diagonal terms of the matrix. The off-diagonal terms\nvanish identically if the tube is uniform. A linearized perturbation approach,\napplied with respect to a uniform reference model, is developed that makes the\neigenvalues explicit.

Key to the success of these methods is that the mesh should be\nsufficiently refined (locally) and flexible in order to resolve evolving\nsolution features, but at the same time not introduce errors through skewness\nand lack of regularity. Some state-of-the-art methods are bottom-up in that\nthey attempt to prescribe both the local cell size and the alignment to\nfeatures of the solution. However, the resulting problem is overdetermined,\nnecessitating a compromise between these conflicting requirements. An\nalternative approach, described in this paper, is to prescribe only the local\ncell size and augment this an optimal transport condition to provide global\nregularity. This leads to a robust and flexible algorithm for generating meshes\nfitted to an evolving solution, with minimal need for tuning parameters. Of\nparticular interest for geophysical modelling are meshes constructed on the\nsurface of the sphere. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that meshes\ngenerated on the sphere using this optimal transport approach have good\na-priori regularity and that the meshes produced are naturally aligned to\nvarious simple features. It is further shown that the sphere's intrinsic\ncurvature leads to more regular meshes than the plane.

To understand the nonlinear aspects of this\nphenomenon, a turbulent mixing layer over a deep cavity at Reynolds number 150\n000 is considered and its response to harmonic forcing is analysed with\nlarge-eddy simulations (LES) and linearised Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE). As\na model of incoming acoustic perturbations, spatially uniform time-harmonic\nforcing is applied at the cavity end, with amplitudes in the wide range\n0.045-8.9% of the bulk velocity. Compressible LES provide reference nonlinear\nresponses of the shear layer, and the associated mean flows. Linear responses\nare calculated with the incompressible LNSE around the LES mean flows; they\npredict well the amplification (both measured with kinetic energy and with a\nproxy for vortex sound production) and capture the nonlinear saturation\nobserved as the forcing amplitude increases and the mixing layer thickens.\nPerhaps surprisingly, LNSE calculations based on a monochromatic (single\nfrequency) assumption yield a good agreement even though higher harmonics and\ntheir nonlinear interaction (Reynolds stresses) are not negligible. However,\nthe leading Reynolds stresses do not force the mixing layer efficiently, as\nshown by a comparison with the optimal volume forcing obtained in a resolvent\nanalysis. Thus, they cannot fully benefit from the potential for amplification\navailable in the flow. Finally, the sensitivity of the optimal harmonic forcing\nat the cavity end is computed with an adjoint method. The sensitivities to mean\nflow modification and to a localised feedback (structural sensitivity) both\nidentify the upstream cavity corner as the region where a small-amplitude\nmodification has the strongest effect.

AS programs employ a fixed schedule of biopsies for all\npatients. Such fixed and frequent schedules, may schedule unnecessary biopsies\nfor the patients. Since biopsies have an associated risk of complications,\npatients do not always comply with the schedule, which increases the risk of\ndelayed detection of cancer progression. Motivated by the world's largest AS\nprogram, Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS), in\nthis paper we present personalized schedules for biopsies to counter these\nproblems. Using joint models for time to event and longitudinal data, our\nmethods combine information from historical prostate-specific antigen (PSA)\nlevels and repeat biopsy results of a patient, to schedule the next biopsy. We\nalso present methods to compare personalized schedules with existing biopsy\nschedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 10:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

It is now understood that the presence of localized coherent\nstructures enhances the dissipation channels and the kinetic features of the\nplasma. However, no formal way of quantifying the relationship between\nscale-to-scale energy transfer and the presence of spatial structures has so\nfar been presented. In this letter we quantify such relationship analyzing the\nresults of a two-dimensional high-resolution Hall-MHD simulation. In\nparticular, we employ the technique of space-filtering to derive a spectral\nenergy flux term which defines, in any point of the computational domain, the\nsigned flux of spectral energy across a given wavenumber. The characterization\nof coherent structures is performed by means of a traditional two-dimensional\nwavelet transformation. By studying the correlation between the spectral energy\nflux and the wavelet amplitude, we demonstrate the strong relationship between\nscale-to-scale transfer and coherent structures. Furthermore, by conditioning\none quantity with respect to the other, we are able for the first time to\nquantify the inhomogeneity of the turbulence cascade induced by topological\nstructures in the magnetic field. Taking into account the low filling-factor of\ncoherent structures (i.e. they cover a small portion of space), it emerges that\n80% of the spectral energy transfer (both in the direct and inverse cascade\ndirections) is localized in about 50% of space, and 50% of the energy transfer\nis localized in only 25% of space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 11:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 19:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The key idea of inference techniques is\nto first define associations between domains based on features extracted from\nDNS data. Then, an inference algorithm is deployed to infer potential malicious\ndomains based on their direct/indirect associations with known malicious ones.\nThe way associations are defined is key to the effectiveness of an inference\ntechnique. It is desirable to be both accurate (i.e., avoid falsely associating\ndomains with no meaningful connections) and with good coverage (i.e., identify\nall associations between domains with meaningful connections). Due to the\nlimited scope of information provided by DNS data, it becomes a challenge to\ndesign an association scheme that achieves both high accuracy and good\ncoverage.\n  In this paper, we propose a new association scheme to identify domains\ncontrolled by the same entity. Our key idea is an in-depth analysis of active\nDNS data to accurately separate public IPs from dedicated ones, which enables\nus to build high-quality associations between domains. Our scheme identifies\nmany meaningful connections between domains that are discarded by existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nassociation scheme not only significantly improves the domain coverage compared\nto existing approaches but also achieves better detection accuracy.\n  Existing path-based inference algorithm is specifically designed for DNS data\nanalysis. It is effective but computationally expensive. As a solution, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of combining our association scheme with the\ngeneric belief propagation algorithm.

We assume that the distribution of the data is driven by two\nindependent latent factors: the content, which represents the intrinsic\nfeatures of an object, and the view, which stands for the settings of a\nparticular observation of that object. Therefore, we propose a generative model\nand a conditional variant built on such a disentangled latent space. This\napproach allows us to generate realistic samples corresponding to various\nobjects in a high variety of views. Unlike many multi-view approaches, our\nmodel doesn't need any supervision on the views but only on the content.\nCompared to other conditional generation approaches that are mostly based on\nbinary or categorical attributes, we make no such assumption about the factors\nof variations. Our model can be used on problems with a huge, potentially\ninfinite, number of categories. We experiment it on four image datasets on\nwhich we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its ability to\ngeneralize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 12:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 11:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

In the past, this property has been\nassociated with the so-called badlands region of the potential, where the\nsemiclassical description of the scattering fails due to a rapid spatial\nvariation of the deBroglie wavelength. This badlands region occurs far from the\nstrong interaction region of the potential and has therefore been used to\n\"explain\" the quantum reflection phenomenon. In this paper, we show that the\nbadlands region of the interaction potential is immaterial. The extremely long\nwavelength of the scattered particle at threshold is much longer than the\nspatial extension of the badlands region which therefore does not affect the\nscattering. For this purpose, we review the general proof for the existence of\nquantum threshold reflection to stress that it is only a consequence of\ncontinuity and boundary conditions. The nonlocal character of the scattering\nimplies that the whole interaction potential is involved in the phenomenon. We\nthen provide a detailed numerical study of the threshold scattering of a\nparticle by a Morse potential especially in the time domain. We compare exact\nquantum computations with incoherent results obtained from a classical Wigner\napproximation. This study shows that close to threshold the time dependent\namplitude of the scattered particle is negligible in the badlands region and\nthat the mean flight time of the particle is not shortened due to a local\nreflection from the badlands region. This study should serve to definitely rule\nout the badlands region as a qualitative guide to the properties of quantum\nthreshold reflection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 12:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Using this decomposition, first we study the\nwell-known low-dimensionality phenomena of the delay space and ask what\nproperties of the end hosts define the dimensions. Second, using the\ndecomposition, we develop a filtering method to detect the paths which\nexperience unexpected latencies and identify routing anomalies. We show that\nour filter successfully identifies an anomalous route even when its observed\nlatency is not obviously high in magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 13:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

In this paper, we\ncombine a two-scale partial array model and a one-dimensional channel model to\ninvestigate the effects of blockage, turbine arrangement, and channel dynamics\non tidal turbines. The power per turbine is obtained as the product of two\nparameters: a power coefficient measuring the power acquired from the\ninstantaneous flow and an environment coefficient showing the response of the\nchannel to added drag. The results suggest that taking account of channel\ndynamics will decrease the predicted power and the optimal induction factor.\nThe model also shows that when the number of turbines in a row is increased,\nthe power per turbine may monotonically increase or decrease or attain a\nmaximum value at a certain global blockage. These different results depend on\ntwo characteristic parameters of the channel: $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda_D$.\nFurthermore, we find that besides turbine density (blockage), the arrangement\nof the turbines should also be considered if we want to obtain an efficient\narray. Appropriate arrangements can enhance the performance of turbines in\ntidal channels, although the beneficial effects will be partly offset by\nreduced velocities. The turbine arrangement also has an effect on the optimal\nglobal blockage at which the power attains its maximum value.

To realize such a device two core methods are\napplied simultaneously; (i) resonance tracking with an Autoresonance feedback\nloop, (ii) generation of controlled structural traveling waves. The purpose of\nthe first method is to achieve near-field acoustic levitation, which can\nlevitate an object of a few kilograms. In this research, this is accomplished\nthrough high amplitude vibration of an aluminum annulus at ultrasonic\nfrequencies (~30kHz). For high efficiency, the annulus is designed to have a\nvery high Q value, and operating even slightly off resonance ceases levitation.\nCompounding this is the fact that the natural frequency constantly drifts as\nambient conditions and loading change. To accommodate such a drift, and produce\nstable levitation automatically, a resonance tracking feedback loop is employed\nhere. Simultaneously, the purpose of the second method is to achieve propulsion\nforces on the levitated object by propagating and controlling traveling waves\nin the aluminum annulus to create a thin layer of rotating air beneath the\nlevitated body. Even though a single vibration mode can produce only standing\nwaves, an axisymmetric structure possesses two modes per natural frequency, and\nexcitation of a doublet mode pair can generate effective travelling waves. The\npresent paper develops the theory behind the use of the Autoresonance feedback\nmethod for achieving constant levitation and propagating travelling waves in\nco- and counter rotating directions. It will be shown that all this can be\naccomplished with only single sensor. The result is a stable, repeatable and a\nhighly controllable contactless acoustic levitation motor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 14:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

The disk angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic\neffects in the outflow and jet driving regions where the magnetic field is well\ncoupled with neutral gas. On the other hand, in a high density gas region of\nthe disk (or intermediate region), the magnetic field dissipates and is\ndecoupled from neutral gas.

Therefore, in the disk intermediate region,\nthe disk surface density continues to increase and gravitational instability\noccurs and produce a non-axisymmetric (or spiral) structure.

Nature features transport networks that are adaptive\nover a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of\nrobustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that\nreal-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When\nthe network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may\nhelp to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more\nrobust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization\nprinciples, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model\nof a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a\nspatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks\nand investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network\nconverges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both\ncyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a\ntranscritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is\nincreased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two\ndistinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the\nboundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the\nfluctuations. These findings may explain why natural transport networks display\ncyclic structures in the micro-vascular regions near terminal nodes, but\ntree-like features in the regions with larger veins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 15:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

To learn the precise cost of any edge, we\nhave to conduct a study that incurs a price. Our goal is to find a spanning\ntree while minimizing the disutility, which is the sum of the tree cost and the\ntotal price that we spend on the studies. In a different application, each edge\ngives a stochastic reward value. Our goal is to find a spanning tree while\nmaximizing the utility, which is the tree reward minus the prices that we pay.\n  Situations such as the above two often arise in practice where we wish to\nfind a good solution to an optimization problem, but we start with only some\npartial knowledge about the parameters of the problem. The missing information\ncan be found only after paying a probing price, which we call the price of\ninformation. What strategy should we adopt to optimize our expected\nutility/disutility?\n  A classical example of the above setting is Weitzman's \"Pandora's box\"\nproblem where we are given probability distributions on values of $n$\nindependent random variables.

Our\nwork is a generalization of this model to other combinatorial optimization\nproblems such as matching, set cover, facility location, and prize-collecting\nSteiner tree. We give a technique that reduces such problems to their non-price\ncounterparts, and use it to design exact/approximation algorithms to optimize\nour utility/disutility.

We\nreport low unobscured SFR ~1 Msun/yr given the large reservoir of molecular\ngas, and also modest obscured SFR=4.5(+4.4,-2.6) Msun/yr based on far-IR and\nsub-mm data. We determine mass components of the galaxy: log[M*/Msun] =\n10.80(+0.07,-0.14), log[M mol-gas/Msun] = 10.37 +/-0.04, and log[M dust/Msun] =\n8.45(+0.10,-0.30). Surprisingly, this HI absorption-selected galaxy has no\nequivalent objects in CO surveys of flux-selected samples. The galaxy falls off\ncurrent scaling relations for the SFR to molecular gas mass and CO Tully-Fisher\nrelation. Detailed comparison of kinematical components of the absorbing,\nionized and molecular gas, combined with their spatial distribution, suggests\nthat part of the CO gas is both kinematically and spatially de-coupled from the\nmain galaxy. It is thus possible that a major star burst in the past could\nexplain the wide CO profile as well as the low SFR. Support for this also comes\nfrom the SED favouring an instantaneous burst of age ~0.5 Gyr. Our survey will\nestablish whether flux-selected surveys of molecular gas are missing a key\nstage in the evolution of galaxies and their conversion of gas to stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 15:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

We revisit the\nspectrum of these gluonic particles by solving the classical Yang-Mills\nequations semi-analytically with the solutions having the form of power series\nexpansions in the proper time. We propose a different formula for the gluon\nspectrum which is consistent with energy density during the whole time\nevolution. We find that the chromo-electric fields have larger contributions to\nthe gluon spectrum than the chromo-magnetic fields do. Furthermore, the large\nmomentum modes take less time to reach the weak-field regime while smaller\nmomentum modes take more time.

While total loss of thrust trajectories to\nnearby airports can be pre-computed for all initial points in a 3D flight plan,\ndynamic aspects such as partial power and airplane surface damage must be\nconsidered for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Data-Driven\nAvionics Software (DDDAS) approach which during flight updates a damaged\naircraft performance model, used in turn to generate plausible flight\ntrajectories to a safe landing site. Our damaged aircraft model is\nparameterized on a baseline glide ratio for a clean aircraft configuration\nassuming best gliding airspeed on straight flight. The model predicts purely\ngeometric criteria for flight trajectory generation, namely, glide ratio and\nturn radius for different bank angles and drag configurations. Given actual\naircraft performance data, we dynamically infer the baseline glide ratio to\nupdate the damaged aircraft model. Our new flight trajectory generation\nalgorithm thus can significantly improve upon prior Dubins based trajectory\ngeneration work by considering these data-driven geometric criteria. We further\nintroduce a trajectory utility function to rank trajectories for safety. As a\nuse case, we consider the Hudson River ditching of US Airways 1549 in January\n2009 using a flight simulator to evaluate our trajectories and to get sensor\ndata. In this case, a baseline glide ratio of 17.25:1 enabled us to generate\ntrajectories up to 28 seconds after the birds strike, whereas, a 19:1 baseline\nglide ratio enabled us to generate trajectories up to 36 seconds after the\nbirds strike. DDDAS can significantly improve the accuracy of generated flight\ntrajectories thereby enabling better decision support systems for pilots in\nemergency conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 23:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

The\nmethodology is analogous to work published relatively recently by G. H. Hiary,\nalthough the details are very different. Initially the Hardy function is\nformulated into sub-sequences of generalised quadratic Gaussian sums of ever\nincreasing length N. Adapting a theoretical framework formulated by R. B.\nParis, an algorithm for the computation of quadratic Gaussian sums using just\nO(log(N)) operations is developed and tested. This algorithmic methodology is\nitself incorporated (as a sub-program) into a somewhat larger algorithm\n(algorithm ZT13) designed for the computation of Z(t), which is considerably\nmore efficient than classical O(sqrt(t)) methods, as exemplified by variants of\nthe Riemann-Siegel formula. Sample computations using algorithm ZT13 are\npresented, the results of which conform to technical theoretical predictions\nmade regarding the limits of its performance (both in terms of its operational\ncount and degree of precision). Speculative ideas briefly floated in the\nconclusions suggest that adaptations to this methodology have the potential to\ndeliver significant further computational savings in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 08:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

In this context, the\npairing arises naturally from the energy model of RNA secondary structures.\nFixing the sequence in the pairing produces the RNA energy landscape, whose\npartition function was discovered by McCaskill. Dually, fixing the structure\ninduces the energy landscape of sequences. The latter has been considered for\ndesigning more efficient inverse folding algorithms. We present here the\nHamming distance filtered, dual partition function, together with a Boltzmann\nsampler using novel dynamic programming routines for the loop-based energy\nmodel. The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(h^2n)$, where $h,n$ are\nHamming distance and sequence length, respectively, reducing the time\ncomplexity of samplers, reported in the literature by $O(n^2)$. We then present\ntwo applications, the first being in the context of the evolution of natural\nsequence-structure pairs of microRNAs and the second constructing neutral\npaths. The former studies the inverse fold rate (IFR) of sequence-structure\npairs, filtered by Hamming distance, observing that such pairs evolve towards\nhigher levels of robustness, i.e.,~increasing IFR. The latter is an algorithm\nthat constructs neutral paths: given two sequences in a neutral network, we\nemploy the sampler in order to construct short paths connecting them,\nconsisting of sequences all contained in the neutral network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}
