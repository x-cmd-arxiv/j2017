In particular,\nowing to their inherent deep subwavelength light confinement, they support a\nvariety of light-matter interactions phenomena such as plasmons, excitons and\nphonons conveyed as polaritonic modes. Specifically, semiconductor vdW\nmaterials such as WSe_2 are particularly attractive for photonic and quantum\nintegrated technologies since they sustain VIS-NIR exciton-polariton modes at\nroom temperature. In the quest to unravel the underlying physics of these\nintriguing phenomena, advanced subdiffraction imaging techniques such as SNOM\nhas provided valuable insights on the nature of the EP coupling mechanism to\nthe waveguide modes sustained in vdW materials. While most of these works\nfocused on the steady state of the EP, the spatio-temporal dynamics of EP\nformation, happening in the sub-picosecond regime, remains largely unexplored.\nHence, a direct imaging at the femtosecond-nanoscale of the EP evolution is\ncritical to the understanding of these coupled light-matter states. Here we\nreport for the first time the ultrafast and deep-subwavelength imaging of EP\nformation and propagation in WSe2 waveguides. Our method, based on a novel\nultrafast pump-probe near-field imaging, allows to directly visualize the EP\ntime evolution at room temperature. More specifically, and in agreement with\nour time dependent model, we directly observe a significantly slow EP wave\npacket group velocity of v_g~0.017c which is attributed to the bandgap\nrenormalization originating in the light coupling near the exciton transition.\nThese findings suggest that vdW materials could be used for slow light with\napplications in light storage for memory, enhanced optical nonlinearity,\nsensing and more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 16:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Indeed, both\nnumerics and experiments show the formation of large-scale anisotropic vortices\ntogether with the development of small-scale dissipative structures. However\nthe organization of interactions leading to this complex dynamics remains\nunclear. Two different mechanisms are known to be able to transfer energy\nupscale in a turbulent flow. The first is characterized by two-dimensional\ninteractions among triads lying on the two-dimensional, three-component (2D3C)\nmanifold, namely on the Fourier plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. The\nsecond mechanism is three-dimensional and consists of interactions between\ntriads with the same sign of helicity (homochiral). Here, we present a detailed\nnumerical study of rotating flows using a suite of high Reynolds number direct\nnumerical simulations within different parameter regimes to analyze both\nupscale and downscale cascade ranges. We find that the upscale cascade at wave\nnumbers close to the forcing scale is generated by increasingly dominant\nhomochiral interactions which couple the three-dimensional bulk and the 2D3C\nplane. This coupling produces an accumulation of energy in the 2D3C plane,\nwhich then transfers energy to smaller wave numbers thanks to the\ntwo-dimensional mechanism. In the forward cascade range, we find that the\nenergy transfer is dominated by heterochiral triads and is dominated primarily\nby interaction within the fast manifold where $k_z\\ne0$. We further analyze the\nenergy transfer in different regions in the real-space domain. In particular,\nwe distinguish high-strain from high-vorticity regions and we uncover that\nwhile the mean transfer is produced inside regions of strain, the rare but\nextreme events of energy transfer occur primarily inside the large-scale column\nvortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 17:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 21:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Voltage\npulses are applied to a series connection of the ferroelectric capacitor and a\nresistor to directly measure the ferroelectric negative capacitance during\nswitching. A time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach is used to investigate the\nunderlying domain dynamics. The transient negative capacitance is shown to\noriginate from reverse domain nucleation and unrestricted domain growth.\nHowever, with the onset of domain coalescence, the capacitance becomes positive\nagain. The persistence of the negative capacitance state is therefore limited\nby the speed of domain wall motion. By changing the applied electric field,\ncapacitor area or external resistance, this domain wall velocity can be varied\npredictably over several orders of magnitude. Additionally, detailed insights\ninto the intrinsic material properties of the ferroelectric are obtainable\nthrough these measurements. A new method for reliable extraction of the average\nnegative capacitance of the ferroelectric is presented.

Thus if nuclear densities obtained from {\\it ab initio}\nno-core-shell-model (NCSM) calculations are to be used in reaction\ncalculations, translationally invariant nonlocal densities must be available.\n[Purpose:] Though it is standard to extract translationally invariant one-body\nlocal densities from NCSM calculations to calculate local nuclear observables\nlike radii and transition amplitudes, the corresponding nonlocal one-body\ndensities have not been considered so far. A major reason for this is that the\nprocedure for removing the center-of-mass component from NCSM wavefunctions up\nto now has only been developed for local densities.

This activity consists of bursty, but\ndamped energetic interchange modes (EICs, X Du et al., Phys. Rev.

Nevertheless, the accuracy of CT scanning\ntechnology is limited, which is 1mm. In this situation, the collected data is\nnot exactly the same as the real structure and there might be some errors\ncausing the print to fail. This study presents a common and practical way to\nprocess the skull data to make the structures correctly. And then we make a\nskull model through 3D printing technology, which is useful for medical\nstudents to understand the complex structure of skull. Materials and Methods\nThe skull data is collected by the CT scan. To get a corrected medical model,\nthe computer-assisted image processing goes with the combination of five 3D\nmanipulation tools: Mimics, 3ds Max, Geomagic, Mudbox and Meshmixer, to\nreconstruct the digital model and repair it. Subsequently, we utilize a\nlow-cost desktop 3D printer, Ultimaker2, with polylactide filament (PLA)\nmaterial to print the model and paint it based on the atlas. Result After the\nrestoration and repairing, we eliminate the errors and repair the model by\nadding the missing parts of the uploaded data within 6 hours. Then we print it\nand compare the model with the cadaveric skull from frontal, left, right and\nanterior views respectively. The printed model can show the same structures and\nalso the details of the skull clearly and is a good alternative of the\ncadaveric skull.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 23:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we present a deep\nlearning based framework to yield pDECT images from SECT images, utilizing the\nintrinsic characteristics underlying DECT images, i.e., global correlation and\nhigh similarity. To demonstrate the performance of the deep learning based\nframework, a cascade deep ConvNet (CD-ConvNet) approach is specifically\npresented in the deep learning framework.

The n-type Rashba parameter can be tuned\nmonotonically to the maximum of 0.88 eV $\\AA$ at EEF of 1.35 V/nm at which the\nsequence of top valence bands recover to the bulk style. During this process\nthe p-type spins will not survive in this 2D CsPbBr$_3$, that indeed hints a\nnew way for making advanced functional spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 02:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 03:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Since the laser at 1.5 um shows the highest\nmaximum permissible exposure in the wavelength ranging from 0.3 um to 10 um,\nthe eye-safe 1.5 um lidar can be deployed in urban areas. In such a case, the\nmeasured extinction coefficient at 1.5 um should be converted to that at 0.55\num for visibility retrieval. Although several models have been established\nsince 1962, the accurate wavelength conversion remains a challenge. An adaptive\ninversion algorithm for 1.5 um visibility lidar is proposed and demonstrated by\nusing the in situ Angstrom wavelength exponent, which is derived from either a\nsun photometer or an aerosol spectrometer. The impact of the particle size\ndistribution of atmospheric aerosols and the Rayleigh backscattering of\natmospheric molecules are taken into account. In comparison, the Angstrom\nwavelength exponent derived from the sun photometer is 7.7% higher than that\nderived from the aerosol spectrometer. Then, using 1.5 um visibility lidar, the\nvisibility with a temporal resolution of 5 min is detected over 48 hours in\nHefei (31.83 N, 117.25 E). The average visibility error between the new method\nand a visibility sensor (Vaisala, PWD52) is 5.2% with the R-square value of\n0.96, while the relative error between another reference visibility lidar at\n532 nm and the visibility sensor is 6.7% with the R-square value of 0.91. All\nresults agree with each other well, demonstrating the accuracy and stability of\nthe algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 02:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

And the few\nexceptions are all limited by their underlying reasoning processes for\nsupporting auxiliary constructions. This paper tackles these weaknesses of\nprior systems by introducing an interactive geometry tutor, the Advanced\nGeometry Proof Tutor (AGPT). It leverages a recent automated geometry prover to\nprovide combined benefits that any geometry theorem prover or intelligent\ntutoring system alone cannot accomplish. In particular, AGPT not only can\nautomatically process images of geometry problems directly, but also can\ninteractively train and guide students toward discovering auxiliary\nconstructions on their own. We have evaluated AGPT via a pilot study with 78\nhigh school students.

While real wounds have different shapes, standard wound healing assays\noften deal with just one simple wound shape, and it is unclear whether varying\nthe wound shape might impact how we interpret results from these experiments.\nIn this work, we describe a new kind of wound healing assay, called a sticker\nassay, that allows us to examine the role of wound shape in a series of wound\nhealing assays performed with fibroblast cells. In particular, we show how to\nuse the sticker assay to examine wound healing with square, circular and\ntriangular shaped wounds. We take a standard approach and report measurements\nof the size of the wound as a function of time. This shows that the rate of\nwound closure depends on the initial wound shape. This result is interesting\nbecause the only aspect of the assay that we change is the initial wound shape,\nand the reason for the different rate of wound closure is unclear. To provide\nmore insight into the experimental observations we describe our results\nquantitatively by calibrating a mathematical model, describing the relevant\ntransport phenomena, to match our experimental data. Overall, our results\nsuggest that the rates of cell motility and cell proliferation from different\ninitial wound shapes are approximately the same, implying that the differences\nwe observe in the wound closure rate are consistent with a fairly typical\nmathematical model of wound healing. Our results imply that parameter estimates\nobtained from an experiment performed with one particular wound shape could be\nused to describe an experiment performed with a different shape. This\nfundamental result is important because this assumption is often invoked, but\nnever tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 05:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

Due to modifications in weather patterns, its geographical\nrange is continuously evolving. Temperature is a key factor for its expansion\ninto regions with cool winters, but rainfall can also have a strong impact on\nthe colonization of these regions, since larvae emerging after a rainfall are\nlikely to die at temperatures below $10^{\\circ}$C. As climate change is\nexpected to affect rainfall regimes, with a higher frequency of heavy storms\nand an increase in drought-affected areas, it is important to understand how\ndifferent rainfall scenarios may shape Ae. aegypti's range. We develop a model\nfor the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti, coupled with a rainfall model to\nstudy the effect of the temporal distribution of rainfall on mosquito\nabundance. Using a fracturing process, we then investigate the effect of a\nhigher variability in the daily rainfall. As an example, we show that rainfall\ndistribution is necessary to explain the geographic range of Ae. aegypti in\nTaiwan, an island characterized by rainy winters in the north and dry winters\nin the south. We also predict that a higher variability in the rainfall time\ndistribution will decrease the maximum abundance of Ae. aegypti during the\nsummer. An increase in daily rainfall variability will likewise enhance its\nextinction probability. Finally, we obtain a nonlinear relationship between dry\nseason duration and extinction probability. These findings can have a\nsignificant impact on our ability to predict disease outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 06:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

However, collecting large-scale data is not always possible,\nespecially for the supervised labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims\nto utilize labeled data from a source domain to learn a model that generalizes\nto a target domain of unlabeled data. A large amount of existing work uses\nSiamese network-based models, where two streams of neural networks process the\nsource and the target domain data respectively. Nevertheless, most of these\napproaches focus on minimizing the domain discrepancy, overlooking the\nimportance of preserving the discriminative ability for target domain features.\nAnother important problem in UDA research is how to evaluate the methods\nproperly. Common evaluation procedures require target domain labels for\nhyper-parameter tuning and model selection, contradicting the definition of the\nUDA task. Hence we propose a more reasonable evaluation principle that avoids\nthis contradiction by simply adopting the latest snapshot of a model for\nevaluation. This adds an extra requirement for UDA methods besides the main\nperformance criteria: the stability during training. We design a novel method\nthat connects the target domain stream to the source domain stream with a\nParameter Reference Loss (PRL) to solve these problems simultaneously.\nExperiments on various datasets show that the proposed PRL not only improves\nthe performance on the target domain, but also stabilizes the training\nprocedure.

To alleviate these limitations, in this paper we have developed a unique\nhierarchical Bayesian framework for modelling composite stellar populations\n(CSPs).

We use this new framework to determine the number\nof SSPs that is required to fit a set of realistic CSP mock spectra.

Our results\nsuggest that using a single SSP biases the determination of the IMF slope to a\nhigher value than the true slope, although the trend with stellar velocity\ndispersion is overall recovered. If we include more SSPs in the fit, the\nBayesian evidence increases significantly and the inferred IMF slopes of our\nmock spectra converge, within the errors, to their true values.

While much progress has been made to understand their\nelastic (small strain) and flow (infinite strain) properties, such\nunderstanding is lacking for the softening and yielding phenomena that connect\nthese asymptotic regimes. Here we present a comprehensive framework for\nsoftening and yielding of soft glassy materials, based on extensive numerical\nsimulations of oscillatory rheological tests, and show that two distinct\nscenarios unfold depending on the material's packing density. For dense\nsystems, there is a single, pressure-independent strain where the elastic\nmodulus drops and the particle motion becomes diffusive. In contrast, for\nweakly jammed systems, a two-step process arises: at an intermediate softening\nstrain, the elastic and loss moduli both drop down and then reach a new plateau\nvalue, whereas the particle motion becomes diffusive at the distinctly larger\nyield strain. We show that softening is associated with an extensive number of\nmicroscopic contact changes leading to a non-analytic rheological signature.\nMoreover, the scaling of the softening strain with pressure suggest the\nexistence of a novel pressure scale above which softening and yielding\ncoincide, and we verify the existence of this crossover scale numerically. Our\nfindings thus evidence the existence of two distinct classes of soft glassy\nmaterials -- jamming dominated and dense -- and show how these can be\ndistinguished by their rheological fingerprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 08:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

The length scale of the plasma can be larger than the de-Broglie\nlength so that the quantum effects relevance to the spin can be significant.

Track-like events allow for an increase of the effective\nvolume of the detector thanks to the long path traveled by muons in rock and/or\nsea water. Shower-like events are well reconstructed only when the neutrino\ninteraction vertex is close to, or inside, the instrumented volume. A mild\nexcess of high-energy events over the expected background is observed in 9\nyears of ANTARES data in both samples. The best fit for a single power-law\ncosmic neutrino spectrum, in terms of per-flavor flux at 100 TeV, is\n$\\Phi_0^{1f}(100\\ \\textrm{TeV}) = \\left(1.7\\pm 1.0\\right)\n\\times$10$^{-18}$\\,GeV$^{-1}$\\,cm$^{-2}$\\,s$^{-1}$\\,sr$^{-1}$ with spectral\nindex $\\Gamma = 2.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. The null cosmic flux assumption is rejected\nwith a significance of 1.6$\\sigma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 09:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The presented high probability upper bounds are optimal up\nto logarithmic factors. The non-asymptotic analysis of this work requires very\nmild assumptions; (i) stabilizability of the system's dynamics, and (ii)\nlimiting the degree of heaviness of the noise distribution. To establish such\nbounds, certain novel techniques are developed to comprehensively address the\nprobabilistic behavior of dependent random matrices with heavy-tailed\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 09:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 15:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 01:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

In the metamorphosis of images, the Lie group of\ndiffeomorphisms deforms a template image that is undergoing its own internal\ndynamics as it deforms. This type of deformation allows more freedom for image\nmatching and has analogies with complex fluids when the template properties are\nregarded as order parameters (coset spaces of broken symmetries). The first\nstochastic perturbation we consider corresponds to uncertainty due to random\nerrors in the reconstruction of the deformation map from its vector field. We\nalso consider a second stochastic perturbation, which compounds the uncertainty\nin of the deformation map with the uncertainty in the reconstruction of the\ntemplate position from its velocity field. We apply this general geometric\ntheory to several classical examples, including landmarks, images, and closed\ncurves, and we discuss its use for functional data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 09:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Recently, adaptive multi-modal hyperspectral sensors have\nattracted growing interest due to their ability to record extended data quickly\nfrom aerial platforms. In this study, we apply popular concepts from\ntraditional object tracking, namely (1) Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF)\nand (2) Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features to aerial tracking in\nhyperspectral domain. We propose the Deep Hyperspectral Kernelized Correlation\nFilter based tracker (DeepHKCF) to efficiently track aerial vehicles using an\nadaptive multi-modal hyperspectral sensor. We address low temporal resolution\nby designing a single KCF-in-multiple Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) approach to\ncover a reasonably large area. To increase the speed of deep convolutional\nfeatures extraction from multiple ROIs, we design an effective ROI mapping\nstrategy. The proposed tracker also provides flexibility to couple with the\nmore advanced correlation filter trackers. The DeepHKCF tracker performs\nexceptionally well with deep features set up in a synthetic hyperspectral video\ngenerated by the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG)\nsoftware. Additionally, we generate a large, synthetic, single-channel dataset\nusing DIRSIG to perform vehicle classification in the Wide Area Motion Imagery\n(WAMI) platform.

For the X-ray radiative\ntransfer, we consider irradiation by the star and by X-ray background fields.\nTo study the impact of X-rays on the chemical structure of disks we use the\nwell-established disk ionization tracers N2H+ and HCO+.\n  For evolved dust populations, X-ray opacities are mostly dominated by the\ngas; only for photon energies $E\\gtrsim5-10\\,$keV, dust opacities become\nrelevant. Consequently, the local disk X-ray radiation field is only affected\nin dense regions close to the disk midplane. X-ray background fields can\ndominate the local X-ray disk ionization rate for disk radii $r\\gtrsim20\\,$au.\nHowever, the N2H+ and HCO+ column densities are only significantly affected in\ncase of low cosmic-ray ionization rates, or if the background flux is at least\na factor of ten higher than the flux level expected for clusters typical for\nthe solar vicinity. Observable signatures of X-ray background fields in\nlow-mass star-formation regions, like Taurus, are only expected for cluster\nmembers experiencing a strong X-ray background field. For the majority of the\ncluster members, the X-ray background field has only little impact on the disk\nchemical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 10:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Calculations based both on molecular models and with periodic\nboundary conditions have been performed. The two-carbon vacancy was constructed\nfrom pyrene (pyrene-2C) which was then expanded to circumpyrene-2C. The\nstructural characterization of these cases revealed that the ground state is\nslightly non-planar, with the bonding carbons displaced from the plane by up to\n$\\pm$0.2 {\\AA}.

In\nthis context, we use the ECs to probe any alternative theory whose extra term\nacts as a cosmological constant. For this purpose, we apply a model-independent\napproach to reconstruct the recent expansion of the universe. Using Type Ia\nsupernova, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic-chronometer data, we perform\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to put constraints on the effective\ncosmological constant $\\Omega^0_{\\rm eff}$.

In several\ncompounds, neutron inelastic scattering experiments have produced quantitative\nestimates of the anharmonicity of phonons over a range of low energies, and\nthereby explained the observed thermal expansion quantitatively. The\nanharmonicity is found to be an order of magnitude larger than that in usual\nmaterials. Lattice dynamical calculations have correctly predicted the observed\nanharmonicity in the neutron experiments and revealed the overall nature of\nphonons involved. In compounds showing negative thermal expansion, the phonons\nresponsible have rather low energies up to 10 meV. In most compounds, the\nanharmonic phonons span all over the Brillouin zone, while in some cases the\nspecific phonons are limited to certain wave-vectors. The nature of specific\nphonons responsible for anomalous behavior is found to be different in all\nthese compounds. These phonons generally involve transverse vibrations,\nlibrations and internal distortions of the polyhedral units. The paper reviews\nrecent advances in the understanding of anomalous thermal expansion behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 11:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

In\nparticular, Kingman's representation theorem implies that the size of the\nclusters necessarily grows linearly with the sample size; this feature may be\nundesirable for some applications, as recently pointed out by Miller et al.\n(2015).

The naive approach verifies all pairs\nof sets and it is often considered impractical due the high number of\ncombinations. So, Exact Set Similarity Join algorithms are usually based on the\nFilter-Verification Framework, that applies a series of filters to reduce the\nnumber of verified pairs. This paper presents a new filtering technique called\nBitmap Filter, which is able to accelerate state-of-the-art algorithms for the\nexact Set Similarity Join problem. The Bitmap Filter uses hash functions to\ncreate bitmaps of fixed b bits, representing characteristics of the sets. Then,\nit applies bitwise operations (such as xor and population count) on the bitmaps\nin order to infer a similarity upper bound for each pair of sets. If the upper\nbound is below a given similarity threshold, the pair of sets is pruned. The\nBitmap Filter benefits from the fact that bitwise operations are efficiently\nimplemented by many modern general-purpose processors and it was easily applied\nto four state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in CPU: AllPairs, PPJoin,\nAdaptJoin and GroupJoin. Furthermore, we propose a Graphic Processor Unit (GPU)\nalgorithm based on the naive approach but using the Bitmap Filter to speedup\nthe computation.

Two different control formulations are presented.\nThe first controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path\nplanner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The\nsecond controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem\n(NLP) following the ideas of contouring control. Linear time varying models\nobtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control\nNLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time.

As a validation, we performed an\nindependent measurement of the drift velocity of the electrons in the\nconsidered gas mixture, correlating in time the cathode signal with the measure\nof the arrival times of the electrons on the anode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 13:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Recently, structure-transfer based methods are\nproposed to implement ZSL by transferring structural knowledge from the\nsemantic embedding space to image feature space to classify testing images.\nHowever, we observe that such a knowledge transfer framework may suffer from\nthe problem of the geometric inconsistency between the data in the training and\ntesting spaces. We call this problem as the space shift problem. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel graph based method to alleviate this space shift problem.\nSpecifically, a Shared Reconstruction Graph (SRG) is pursued to capture the\ncommon structure of data in the two spaces. With the learned SRG, each unseen\nclass prototype (cluster center) in the image feature space can be synthesized\nby the linear combination of other class prototypes, so that testing instances\ncan be classified based on the distance to these synthesized prototypes. The\nSRG bridges the image feature space and semantic embedding space. By applying\nspectral clustering on the learned SRG, many meaningful clusters can be\ndiscovered, which interprets ZSL performance on the datasets.

Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been\nproposed and achieved state-of-the-art performances on detecting steganography.\nIn this paper, we explore an important technique in deep learning, the batch\nnormalization, for the task of image steganalysis. Different from natural image\nclassification, steganalysis is to discriminate cover images and stego images\nwhich are the result of adding weak stego signals into covers. This\ncharacteristic makes a cover image is more statistically similar to its stego\nthan other cover images, requiring steganalytic methods to use paired learning\nto extract effective features for image steganalysis. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that a CNN model with multiple normalization layers is hard to be\ngeneralized to new data in the test set when it is well trained with paired\nlearning. To hand this difficulty, we propose a novel normalization technique\ncalled Shared Normalization (SN) in this paper. Unlike the batch normalization\nlayer utilizing the mini-batch mean and standard deviation to normalize each\ninput batch, SN shares same statistics for all training and test batches.

For instance,\na helicopter flying over terrain encounters a very different arrangement of\nobstacles than a robotic arm manipulating objects on a cluttered table top.\nState-of-the-art motion planning systems do not exploit this structure, thereby\nexpending valuable planning effort searching for implausible solutions. We are\ninterested in planning algorithms that actively infer the underlying structure\nof the valid configuration space during planning in order to find solutions\nwith minimal effort. Consider the problem of evaluating edges on a graph to\nquickly discover collision-free paths. Evaluating edges is expensive, both for\nrobots with complex geometries like robot arms, and for robots with limited\nonboard computation like UAVs. Until now, this challenge has been addressed via\nlaziness i.e. deferring edge evaluation until absolutely necessary, with the\nhope that edges turn out to be valid. However, all edges are not alike in value\n- some have a lot of potentially good paths flowing through them, and some\nothers encode the likelihood of neighbouring edges being valid. This leads to\nour key insight - instead of passive laziness, we can actively choose edges\nthat reduce the uncertainty about the validity of paths. We show that this is\nequivalent to the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region\ndetermination (DRD). However, the DRD problem is not only combinatorially hard,\nbut also requires explicit enumeration of all possible worlds. We propose a\nnovel framework that combines two DRD algorithms, DIRECT and BISECT, to\novercome both issues.

I carried out an exact and\nexhaustive derivation of all tree-level terms of the non-Gaussian covariance of\nthe galaxy $C_\\ell$, with the computation developed up to the third order in\nperturbation theory and local halo bias, including the non-local tidal tensor\neffect.

This means that fitting models\nof single protostars to observations may be inappropriate. We produce synthetic\nobservations of protostellar multiple systems undergoing realistic,\nnon-continuous accretion. These systems consist of multiple protostars with\nepisodic luminosities, embedded self-consistently in discs and envelopes. We\nmodel the gas dynamics of these systems using smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nand we generate synthetic observations by post-processing the snapshots using\nthe \\textsc{spamcart} Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.

One such interaction is that between development and evolution. Models\nhave shown that development sweeps over several traits in a single agent,\nsometimes exposing promising static traits. Subsequent evolution can then\ncanalize these rare traits. Thus, development can, under the right conditions,\nincrease evolvability. Here, we report on a previously unknown phenomenon when\nembodied agents are allowed to develop and evolve: Evolution discovers body\nplans robust to control changes, these body plans become genetically\nassimilated, yet controllers for these agents are not assimilated. This allows\nevolution to continue climbing fitness gradients by tinkering with the\ndevelopmental programs for controllers within these permissive body plans. This\nexposes a previously unknown detail about the Baldwin effect: instead of all\nuseful traits becoming genetically assimilated, only traits that render the\nagent robust to changes in other traits become assimilated. We refer to this as\ndifferential canalization.

Since CNN feed forward propagation involves highly regular\nparallel computation, it benefits from a significant speed-up when running on\nfine grain parallel programmable logic devices. As a consequence, several\nstudies have proposed FPGA-based accelerators for CNNs. However, because of the\nlarge computationalpower required by CNNs, none of the previous studies has\nproposed a direct mapping of the CNN onto the physical resources of an FPGA,\nallocating each processing actor to its own hardware instance.In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the so called direct hardware mapping (DHM) and\ndiscuss several tactics we explore to make DHM usable in practice. As a proof\nof concept, we introduce the HADDOC2 open source tool, that automatically\ntransforms a CNN description into a synthesizable hardware description with\nplatform-independent direct hardware mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 08:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}
