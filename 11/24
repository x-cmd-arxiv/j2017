They essentially increased the connectivity,\nallowing efficient information flow across layers. Inspired by these\ntechniques, we propose to model connections between filters of a CNN using\ngraphs which are simultaneously sparse and well connected. Sparsity results in\nefficiency while well connectedness can preserve the expressive power of the\nCNNs. We use a well-studied class of graphs from theoretical computer science\nthat satisfies these properties known as Expander graphs. Expander graphs are\nused to model connections between filters in CNNs to design networks called\nX-Nets. We present two guarantees on the connectivity of X-Nets: Each node\ninfluences every node in a layer in logarithmic steps, and the number of paths\nbetween two sets of nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. We\nalso propose efficient training and inference algorithms, making it possible to\ntrain deeper and wider X-Nets effectively.\n  Expander based models give a 4% improvement in accuracy on MobileNet over\ngrouped convolutions, a popular technique, which has the same sparsity but\nworse connectivity. X-Nets give better performance trade-offs than the original\nResNet and DenseNet-BC architectures.

For a number-conserving system, there have been a\nfew proposals, using either coupled-chain models or multi-component system with\nspin-orbit coupling, to create number fluctuation of fermion pairs in achieving\nMajorana fermion. In this work, we show that Majorana edge states can occur in\na spinless Fermi gas in 1D lattices with tunable $p$-wave interaction. This is\nfacilitated by the conversion between a pair of (open-channel) fermions and a\n(close-channel) boson, thereby allowing the number fluctuation of fermion pairs\nin a single chain. This scheme requires neither spin-orbit coupling nor\nmulti-chain setup and can be implemented easily. Using the\ndensity-matrix-renormalization-group method, we have identified the Majorana\nphase in a wide range of parameter regime as well as its associated phase\ntransitions. The topological nature of the Majorana phase manifests itself in a\nstrong edge-edge correlation in an open chain that is robust against disorder,\nas well as in a non-trivial winding number in the bulk generated by using\ntwisted boundary condition. It is also shown that the Majorana phase in this\nsystem can be stable against atom losses due to few-body collisions on the same\nsite, and can be easily identified from the fermion momentum distribution.\nThese results pave the way for probing the intriguing Majorana physics in a\nsimple and stable cold atoms system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 16:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

Most existing studies fall into a frequentist-style regularization\nframework, where the components are learned via point estimation. In this\npaper, we investigate how to \"diversify\" LVMs in the paradigm of Bayesian\nlearning. We propose two approaches that have complementary advantages. One is\nto define a diversity-promoting mutual angular prior which assigns larger\ndensity to components with larger mutual angles and use this prior to affect\nthe posterior via Bayes' rule. We develop two efficient approximate posterior\ninference algorithms based on variational inference and MCMC sampling. The\nother approach is to impose diversity-promoting regularization directly over\nthe post-data distribution of components. We also extend our approach to\n\"diversify\" Bayesian nonparametric models where the number of components is\ninfinite. A sampling algorithm based on slice sampling and Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo is developed. We apply these methods to \"diversify\" Bayesian mixture of\nexperts model and infinite latent feature model. Experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 16:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

However, the perfomance analysis is often carried\nout under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function\nis used, without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The\nconcrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question\nis if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured\ninput.\n  In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing, namely\nsimilarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et\nal. [NIPS'12] and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. [ICML'09], both of\nwhich have found numerous applications, i.e. in approximate near-neighbour\nsearch with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM.\n  We consider mixed tabulation hashing of Dahlgaard et al.[FOCS'15] which was\nproved to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications,\nincluding OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with\ntruly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar for\nsparse input. Our main contribution, however, is an experimental comparison of\ndifferent hashing schemes when used inside FH, OPH, and LSH.\n  We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the\nmultiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work\nwell on sufficiently random data, but we demonstrate that in the above\napplications, it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and\nsynthetic data. We also compare with the popular MurmurHash3, which has no\nproven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to\ntruly random hashing in our experiments. However, mixed tabulation is 40%\nfaster than MurmurHash3, and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on\nall possible input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 18:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

An investigation of the\ndependence of the photometric calibration on interstellar reddening leads to\nthese conclusions: (1) For all broadband filters, a linear colour-dependent\ncorrection compensates the gross effects of reddening where $E(B-V)<5.0$. (2)\nFor $Z$ and $Y$, there is a significantly larger scatter above E(B-V)=5.0, and\ninsufficient measurements to adequately constrain the relation beyond this\nvalue. (3) The $JHK\\!s$ filters can be corrected to a few percent up to\nE(B-V)=10.0. We analyse spatial systematics over month-long timescales, both\ninter- and intra-detector and show that these are present only at very low\nlevels in VISTA. We monitor and remove residual detector-to-detector offsets.\nWe compare the calibration of the main pipeline products: pawprints and tiles.\nWe show how variable seeing and transparency affect the final calibration\naccuracy of VISTA tiles, and discuss a technique, {\\it grouting}, for\nmitigating these effects. Comparison between repeated reference fields is used\nto demonstrate that the VISTA photometry is precise to better than $\\simeq2\\%$\nfor the $Y$$J$$H$$Ks$ bands and $3\\%$ for the $Z$ bands. Finally we present\nempirically determined offsets to transform VISTA magnitudes into a true Vega\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Filter output truncation\n(FOT) can reduce the overhead by discarding the filter tails but may also\nsignificantly destroy the orthogonality of FBMC system, by introducing inter\ncarrier interference (ICI) and inter symbol interference (ISI) terms in the\nreceived signal. As a result, the signal to interference ratio (SIR) is\ndegraded. In addition, the presence of intrinsic interference terms in FBMC\nalso proves to be an obstacle in combining multiple input multiple output\n(MIMO) with FBMC.

The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and\nlength of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the\nneural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as\nvertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can\nbe overcome with further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we use\nthe Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity\nbetween layers of a network during training. Counterintuitively, information\nrises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing\nredistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss\nof \"Information Plasticity\". Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs\nare critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative\nto the input data distribution.

These shims are\nnecessary to eliminate gaps, maintain structural performance, and minimize\npull-down forces required to bring the aircraft into engineering nominal\nconfiguration for peak aerodynamic efficiency. Gap filling is a time-consuming\nprocess, involving either expensive by-hand inspection or computations on vast\nquantities of measurement data from increasingly sophisticated metrology\nequipment. Either case amounts to significant delays in production, with much\nof the time spent in the critical path of aircraft assembly. This work presents\nan alternative strategy for predictive shimming, based on machine learning and\nsparse sensing to first learn gap distributions from historical data, and then\ndesign optimized sparse sensing strategies to streamline data collection and\nprocessing. This new approach is based on the assumption that patterns exist in\nshim distributions across aircraft, which may be mined and used to reduce the\nburden of data collection and processing in future aircraft. Specifically,\nrobust principal component analysis is used to extract low-dimensional patterns\nin the gap measurements while rejecting outliers. Next, optimized sparse\nsensors are obtained that are most informative about the dimensions of a new\naircraft in these low-dimensional principal components. We demonstrate the\nsuccess of the proposed approach, called PIXel Identification Despite\nUncertainty in Sensor Technology (PIXI-DUST), on historical production data\nfrom 54 representative Boeing commercial aircraft.

For the moment, $R+R^2$, or shortly $R^2$,\ninflation is the most successful in accounting for the latest CMB data from the\nPLANCK satellite and other experiments. Moreover, recently it was shown to be\nultra-violet (UV) complete via an embedding into an analytic infinite\nderivative (AID) non-local gravity. In this paper, we derive a most general\ntheory of gravity that contributes to perturbed linear equations of motion\naround maximally symmetric space-times. We show that such a theory is quadratic\nin the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor with AID operators along with the\nEinstein-Hilbert term and possibly a cosmological constant. We explicitly\ndemonstrate that introduction of the Ricci tensor squared term is redundant.\nWorking in this quadratic AID gravity framework without a cosmological term we\nprove that for a specified class of space homogeneous space-times, a space of\nsolutions to the equations of motion is identical to the space of backgrounds\nin a local $R^2$ model. We further compute the full second order perturbed\naction around any background belonging to that class. We proceed by extracting\nthe key inflationary parameters of our model such as a spectral index ($n_s$),\na tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and a tensor tilt ($n_t$). It appears that $n_s$\nremains the same as in the local $R^2$ inflation in the leading slow-roll\napproximation, while $r$ and $n_t$ get modified due to modification of the\ntensor power spectrum. This class of models allows for any value of $r<0.07$\nwith a modified consistency relation which can be fixed by future observations\nof primordial $B$-modes of the CMB polarization. This makes the UV complete\n$R^2$ gravity a natural target for future CMB probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 03:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

Their nanometric size\nand ability to be displaced in response to an electrical current density\nseveral orders of magnitude lower than required to induce motion of magnetic\ndomain walls suggest their potential for high-density memory devices that can\nbe operated at low power. However, to achieve this, skyrmion movement needs to\nbe controlled, where a key question concerns the coupling of skyrmions with the\nunderlying atomic lattice and disorder (pinning). Here, we use Resonant\nUltrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), a probe highly sensitive to changes in the\nelastic properties, to shed new light on skyrmion elasticity and depinning in\nthe archetypal skyrmion material MnSi. In MnSi, skyrmions form a lattice that\nleads to pronounced changes in the elastic properties of the atomic lattice as\na result of magneto-crystalline coupling. Without an applied current, the shear\nand compressional moduli of the underlying crystal lattice exhibit an abrupt\nchange in the field-temperature range where skyrmions form. For current\ndensities exceeding $j_c^*$ the changes of elastic properties vanish, signaling\nthe decoupling of skyrmion and atomic lattices. Interestingly, $j_c^*$, which\nwe identify as the onset of skyrmion depinning, is about 20 times smaller than\n$j_c$ previously measured via non-linear Hall effect.

A\nrotational drive magnetic field is equivalent to two magnetic-field components,\n{\\Theta} and Z, that alternate in time, referred to as an alternate\nTheta-Z-pinch configuration. We consider the finitely thick cylindrical liner\nconfiguration in this paper. We numerically integrate the perturbation equation\nto stagnation time based on the optimal background unperturbed trajectories. We\nassess the cumulative growth of the dominant mode selected by some mechanism at\nthe beginning of an implosion. The maximum e-folding number at stagnation of\nthe dominant mode of an optimized alternate Theta-Z-pinch is significantly\nlower than that of the standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The directional rotation of\nthe magnetic field contributes to suppress the instabilities, independent of\nthe finite thickness. The finite thickness effect plays a role only when the\norientation of the magnetic field varies in time whereas it does not appear in\nthe standard Theta- or Z-pinch. The rotating frequency of the magnetic field\nand the thickness of liner are both having a monotonic effect on suppression.\nTheir synergistic effect can enhance the suppression on MRT instability.\nBecause the MRT instability can be well suppressed in this way, the alternate\nTheta-Z-pinch configuration has potential applications in liner inertial\nfusion.

The direct contribution lies in improving the linear\nconfidentiality levels of recurrence-type entanglement distillation protocols\nto exponential levels for hashing protocols.

The\nproof also holds for situations where Eve has full control over the input\nstates, and obtains all information about the operations and noise applied by\nthe parties. The resulting state after hashing is private, i.e., disentangled\nfrom the eavesdropper.

Uplink resource\nallocation for such systems is more complicated compared to the downlink ones\ndue to the individual users' power constraints and discrete nature of\nsubchannel assignment. In this paper, we propose an uplink subchannel and power\nallocation scheme for such systems. Due to the NP-hard and non-convex nature of\nthe problem, the complete solution, that optimizes both subchannel assignment\nand power allocation jointly, is intractable. Consequently, we solve the\nproblem in two steps. First, based on the assumption that the maximal power\nlevel of a user is subdivided equally among its allocated subchannels, we apply\nmany-to-many matching model to solve the subchannel-user mapping problem. Then,\nin order to enhance the performance of the system further, we apply iterative\nwater-filling and geometric programming two power allocation techniques to\nallocate power in each allocated subchannel-user slot optimally. Extensive\nsimulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme.

Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptor which is one of the best studied\nsystems and inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated, there are\nconflicting reports on its mean motion around the Milky Way and the 3D internal\nmotions of its stars have never been measured. Here we report, based on data\nfrom the Gaia space mission and the Hubble Space Telescope, a new precise\nmeasurement of Sculptor's mean proper motion. From this we deduce that Sculptor\nis currently at its closest approach to the Milky Way and moving on an\nelongated high-inclination orbit that takes it much farther away than\npreviously thought. For the first time we are also able to measure the internal\nmotions of stars in Sculptor. We find $\\sigma_{R}=11.5 \\pm 4.3$ km/s and\n$\\sigma_{T}=8.5\\pm3.2$ km/s along the projected radial and tangential\ndirections, implying that the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial\norbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be\n$\\beta\\sim 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.83}$ at a location beyond the core radius.

The chapter begins by describing two\npopular detection methods for univariate time series data: the EARS algorithm\nof the CDC, and the Farrington algorithm more popular at European public health\ninstitutions. This is followed by a discussion of methods that extend some of\nthe univariate methods to a multivariate setting. This may enable the detection\nof outbreaks whose signal is only weakly present in any single data stream\nconsidered on its own. The chapter ends with a longer discussion of methods for\noutbreak detection in spatio-temporal data. These methods are not only tasked\nwith determining if and when an outbreak started to emerge, but also where. In\nparticular, the scan statistics methodology for outbreak cluster detection in\ndiscrete-time area-referenced data is discussed, as well as similar methods for\ncontinuous-time, continuous-space data. As a running example to illustrate the\nmethods covered in the chapter, a dataset on invasive meningococcal disease in\nGermany in the years 2002-2008 is used.

We use the MUSE\ndata to derive the star-formation history (SFH) and accurately measure the\nstellar and ionized-gas kinematics of NGC7742 in its nuclear, bulge, ring, and\ndisk regions. We map the previously known gas counter-rotation well outside the\nring region and deduce the presence of a slightly warped inner disk, which is\ninclined ~6 degrees compared to the outer disk. The gas-disk inclination is\nwell constrained from the kinematics; the derived inclination 13.7 $\\pm$ 0.4\ndegrees agrees well with that derived from photometry and from what one expects\nusing the inverse Tully-Fisher relation. We find a prolonged SFH in the ring\nwith stellar populations as old as 2-3 Gyr and an indication that the star\nformation triggered by the minor merger event was delayed in the disk compared\nto the ring. There are two separate stellar components: an old population that\ncounter-rotates with the gas, and a young one, concentrated to the ring, that\nco-rotates with the gas. We recover the kinematics of the old stars from a\ntwo-component fit, and show that combining the old and young stellar\npopulations results in the erroneous average velocity of nearly zero found from\na one-component fit. The superior spatial resolution and large field of view of\nMUSE allow us to establish the kinematics and SFH of the nuclear ring in NGC\n7742.

The proposed\nmethod learns a pairwise similarity function in which classification can be\nperformed by computing similarity between prototype representations of each\ncategory. The domain-invariant features and the categorical prototype\nrepresentations are learned jointly and in an end-to-end fashion. At inference\ntime, images from the target domain are compared to the prototypes and the\nlabel associated with the one that best matches the image is outputed. The\napproach is simple, scalable and effective. We show that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in different unsupervised domain adaptation\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 14:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 01:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

As opposed to previous state-of-the-art methods based on\nholistic 3D regression, our method works on dense pixel-wise estimation. This\nis achieved by careful design choices in pose parameterization, which leverages\nboth 2D and 3D properties of depth map. Specifically, we decompose the pose\nparameters into a set of per-pixel estimations, i.e., 2D heat maps, 3D heat\nmaps and unit 3D directional vector fields. The 2D/3D joint heat maps and 3D\njoint offsets are estimated via multi-task network cascades, which is trained\nend-to-end. The pixel-wise estimations can be directly translated into a vote\ncasting scheme. A variant of mean shift is then used to aggregate local votes\nwhile enforcing consensus between the the estimated 3D pose and the pixel-wise\n2D and 3D estimations by design. Our method is efficient and highly accurate.\nOn MSRA and NYU hand dataset, our method outperforms all previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. On the ICVL hand dataset, our\nmethod achieves similar accuracy compared to the currently proposed nearly\nsaturated result and outperforms various other proposed methods.

Our results indicate that both a fully\nconductive (thin) shell and a conductive-convective (thick) shell can reproduce\nthe observed crater depth-diameter and morphologies. For the conductive ice\nshell over ocean, the best fit is an approximately 8 km thick conductive ice\nshell. Depending on the temperature (255 - 265 K) and therefore strength of\nwarm convective ice, the thickness of the conductive ice lid is estimated at 5\n- 7 km. If central features within the crater, such as pits and domes, form\nduring crater collapse, our simulations are in better agreement with the fully\nconductive shell (thin shell). If central features form well after the impact,\nhowever, our simulations suggest a conductive-convective shell (thick shell) is\nmore likely.

The\nvisualized image shall convey as much information as possible from the original\nHSI and meanwhile facilitate image interpretation. However, most existing\nmethods display HSIs in false color, which contradicts with user experience and\nexpectation. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach based on\nconstrained manifold learning, whose goal is to learn a visualized image that\nnot only preserves the manifold structure of the HSI but also has natural\ncolors. Manifold learning preserves the image structure by forcing pixels with\nsimilar signatures to be displayed with similar colors. A composite kernel is\napplied in manifold learning to incorporate both the spatial and spectral\ninformation of HSI in the embedded space. The colors of the output image are\nconstrained by a corresponding natural-looking RGB image, which can either be\ngenerated from the HSI itself (e.g., band selection from the visible\nwavelength) or be captured by a separate device. Our method can be done at\ninstance-level and feature-level. Instance-level learning directly obtains the\nRGB coordinates for the pixels in the HSI while feature-level learning learns\nan explicit mapping function from the high dimensional spectral space to the\nRGB space. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed\nmethod in information preservation and natural color visualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2017 07:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

These results are representative of studies\nconcerning solar system objects exposed to cosmic rays. In the Kuiper Belt,\nregion of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), acetone, molecular nitrogen and other\nsmall molecules were detected and may be present on icy surfaces. Bombardment\nby cosmic rays triggers chemical reactions leading to synthesis of larger\nmolecules. In this work, destruction cross sections of acetone and nitrogen in\nsolid phase are determined from a sequence of infrared spectra obtained at\nincreasing ion beam fluence. The results are analyzed and compared with those\nof previous experiments performed with pure acetone. It is observed that the\nmolecular nitrogen column density decrease very fast, suggesting that nitrogen\nquickly leaves a porous sample under irradiation. The behavior of acetone in\nthe mixture confirms that the ice formed by deposition of vapor mixture is more\nporous than that of pure acetone ice. The most abundant molecular species\nformed from the mixture during irradiation are: C$_3$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_6$, N$_3$,\nCO, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. Some N-bearing species are also formed, but with low\nproduction yield. Comparing with pure acetone results, it is seen that\ndissolving acetone in nitrogen affects the formation cross sections of the new\nspecies: CH$_4$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$CO, for example, have formation cross section\nsmaller than the respective values for irradiated pure acetone, while those for\nCO and C$_2$H$_6$ species are higher. This fact can explain the presence of\nC$_2$H$_6$ even in regions on Pluto where CH$_4$ is not pure, but diluted in a\nN$_2$ matrix together with less abundant species. These results also show the\nformation of more complex molecules, such as HNCO, acetic acid and,\npossibility, glycine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 20:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}
