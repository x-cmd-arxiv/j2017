Namely, a control unit broadcasts\na one-bit signal to agents whenever one of the allocated resources exceeds\ncapacity. Agents then respond to this signal in a probabilistic manner. In the\nproposed algorithm, each agent is unaware of the resource allocation of other\nagents. We also propose a version of the AIMD algorithm for multiple binary\nresources (e.g., parking spaces). Binary resources are indivisible unit-demand\nresources, and each agent either allocated one unit of the resource or none. In\nempirical results, we observe that in both cases, the average allocations\nconverge over time to optimal allocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 16:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

As only a limited spectrum resource has been allocated to\nradio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in\nthe radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable\nradio frequency interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from\nterrestrial human activity and are becoming stronger with time. RFIs degrade\nthe quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The impact of RFIs\non scientific outcome is becoming progressively difficult to manage. In this\narticle, we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI\ncharacteristics, mitigation techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies\nadopted at some representative observatories, telescopes and arrays are also\nintroduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings of the four\nclasses of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal\nstages: preventive, pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The\nproper identification and flagging of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss\nand improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate goal of developing\nRFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving a\ncombination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high\nspeed digital signal processing and high performance computing allow for\nperforming RFI excision of large data volumes generated from large telescopes\nor arrays in both real time and offline modes, aiding the proposed strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 16:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

We overcome this difficulty by constructing a multiple\nHyper-Interaction Graph to treat each individual in an image as a node and\ninferring the most active node referring to interactions estimated by various\ntypes of clews. We model pairwise interactions between persons as the edge\nmessage communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional\npairwise-interaction graph. To enrich the personperson interaction estimation,\nwe further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction graph that models the\nconsensus of interaction between a focal person and any person in a local\nregion around.

We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be\nmultiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable\nfeatures of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by\none partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics,\nwhile another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional\ndynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking\ninspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a\nconvenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a\ncoarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers\ncertain information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows\nacross time steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy\nrate, as well as a measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how\nwell the dynamics can be approximated by a first order Markov process.

The focus of this article is\nmainly on broken ultraweak variational formulations of stationary boundary\nvalue problems, however, many of the ideas presented within are general enough\nthat they be extended to any such well-posed variational formulation. The\nproposed goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement procedures require the\nconstruction of refinement indicators for both a primal problem and a dual\nproblem. In the DPG context, the primal problem is simply the system of linear\nequations coming from a standard DPG method and the dual problem is a similar\nsystem of equations, coming from a new method which is dual to DPG. This new\nmethod has the same coefficient matrix as the associated DPG method but has a\ndifferent load. We refer to this new finite element method as a DPG* method. A\nthorough analysis of DPG* methods, as stand-alone finite element methods, is\nnot given here but will be provided in subsequent articles. For DPG methods,\nthe current theory of a posteriori error estimation is reviewed and the\nreliability estimate in [13, Theorem 2.1] is improved on. For DPG* methods,\nthree different classes of refinement indicators are derived and several\ncontributions are made towards rigorous a posteriori error estimation.

When a search reports no detections,\nthe estimated sensitivity is then used to place upper limits on the coalescence\nrate of the target source. In order to obtain correct sensitivity and rate\nestimates, the injected waveforms must be faithful representations of the real\nsignals. Up to date, however, injected waveforms have neglected radiation modes\nof order higher than the quadrupole, potentially biasing sensitivity and\ncoalescence rate estimates. In particular, higher-order modes are known to have\na large impact in the gravitational waves emitted by intermediate mass black\nholes binaries. In this work we evaluate the impact of this approximation in\nthe context of two search algorithms run by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nin their search for intermediate mass black hole binaries in the O1 LIGO\nScience Run data: a matched-filter based pipeline and a coherent un-modeled\none. To this end we estimate the sensitivity of both searches to simulated\nsignals including and omitting higher-order modes. We find that omission of\nhigher-order modes leads to biases in the sensitivity estimates which depend on\nthe masses of the binary, the search algorithm and the required level of\nsignificance for detection. In addition, we compare the sensitivity of the two\nsearch algorithms across the studied parameter space. We conclude that the most\nrecent LIGO-Virgo upper limits on the rate of coalescence of intermediate mass\nblack hole binaries are conservative for the case of highly asymmetric\nbinaries. However, the tightest upper limits, placed for nearly-equal-mass\nsources, remain unchanged due to the small contribution of higher modes to the\ncorresponding sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 16:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We propose a DNN synthesis tool (NeST) that combines both\nmethods to automate the generation of compact and accurate DNNs.

Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard\nallowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in\nboth directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern\nand searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can\nyield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a\ndifficult combinatorial optimization problem.\n  Here for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to\nsolve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of\npieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP\nsignificantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon\nprevious ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina\nreads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking.\nMoreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of\nsearch using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the\nbest state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index\nwith in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate\na full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the\nbidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text\nverification using dynamic programming outperforms today's best aligners.

In this model, the\nvibrational density of states (VDoS) of a liquid is decomposed into a diffusive\ngas-like component and a vibrational solid-like component. By treating the\ndiffusive component as hard sphere (HS) gas and the vibrational component as\nharmonic oscillators, the ionic entropy of the liquid is determined. Here we\nexamine three issues crucial for practical implementations of the 2PT model:\n(i) the mismatch between the VDoS of the liquid system and that of the HS gas;\n(ii) the excess entropy of the HS gas; (iii) the partition of the gas-like and\nsolid-like components. Some of these issues have not been addressed before, yet\nthey profoundly change the entropy predicted from the model. Based on these\nfindings, a revised 2PT formalism is proposed and successfully tested in\nsystems with Lennard-Jones potentials as well as many-atom potentials of liquid\nmetals.

Ignoring the dynamic aspect of social networks, neither\nallows us to capture evolutionary behavior of the network nor to predict the\nfuture status of individuals.

To address these,\nwe envision a novel framework, named wirelessly powered crowd sensing (WPCS),\nwhich integrates MCS with wireless power transfer (WPT) for supplying the\ninvolved devices with extra energy and thus facilitating user incentivization.\nThis paper considers a multiuser WPCS system where an access point (AP)\ntransfers energy to multiple mobile sensors (MSs), each of which performs data\nsensing, compression, and transmission. Assuming lossless (data) compression,\nan optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize data utility\nand minimize energy consumption at the operator side, by jointly controlling\nwireless-power allocation at the AP as well as sensing-data sizes, compression\nratios, and sensor-transmission durations at the MSs. Given fixed compression\nratios, the proposed optimal power allocation policy has the threshold-based\nstructure with respect to a defined crowd-sensing priority function for each MS\ndepending on both the operator configuration and the MS information. Further,\nfor fixed sensing-data sizes, the optimal compression policy suggests that\ncompression can reduce the total energy consumption at each MS only if the\nsensing-data size is sufficiently large.

Our focus lies on structural parameterizations for the\nproblem that allow for efficient (polynomial-time or fpt) algorithms. As our\nfirst result, we answer an open question stated in Fleszar, Mnich, and\nSpoerhase (2016), by showing that the problem can be solved in polynomial time\nif the input graph has a feedback vertex set of size one. We also show that EDP\nparameterized by the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph is\nfixed-parameter tractable.\n  Having developed two novel algorithms for EDP using structural restrictions\non the input graph, we then turn our attention towards the augmented graph,\ni.e., the graph obtained from the input graph after adding one edge between\nevery terminal pair. In constrast to the input graph, where EDP is known to\nremain NP-hard even for treewidth two, a result by Zhou et al.

The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant\nevolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the\nfirst $t\\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to\na rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently\nbecomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation\nof the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS.

In particular, luminous AGN are often heavily obscured\nin late-stage mergers. Mid-infrared (IR) color selection of dust-enshrouded AGN\nwith, e.g., the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has uncovered large\nnew populations of obscured AGN. However, this method is sensitive mainly to\nAGN that dominate emission from the host. To understand how these selection\nbiases affect mid-IR studies of the merger/AGN connection, we simulate the\nevolution of obscured AGN throughout galaxy mergers. Although mid-IR colors\nclosely trace luminous, obscured AGN, we show that nearly half of\nmerger-triggered AGN are missed with common mid-IR selection criteria, even in\nlate-stage, gas-rich major mergers. At z < 0.5, where merger signatures and\ndual nuclei can most easily be detected, we find that a more lenient W1-W2 >\n0.5 cut greatly improves completeness without significantly decreasing\nreliability. Extreme nuclear starbursts are briefly able to mimic this AGN\nsignature, but this is largely irrelevant in mergers, where such starbursts are\naccompanied by AGN. We propose a two-color cut that yields high completeness\nand reliability even in starbursting systems. Further, we show that mid-IR\ncolor selection very effectively identifies dual AGN hosts, with the highest\nfraction at the smallest separations (< 3 kpc). Thus, many merger hosts of\nmid-IR AGN should contain unresolved dual AGN; these are ideal targets for\nhigh-resolution follow-up, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

So far, an astrophysically\nconsistent chondrule formation scenario, explaining major chemical, isotopic\nand textural features, remains elusive. Here, we examine the prospect of\nforming chondrules from planetesimal collisions. We show that intensely melted\nbodies with interior magma oceans became rapidly chemically equilibrated and\nphysically differentiated. Therefore, collisional interactions among such\nbodies would have resulted in chondrule-like but basaltic spherules, which are\nnot observed in the meteoritic record. This inconsistency with the expected\ndynamical interactions hints at an incomplete understanding of the planetary\ngrowth regime during the protoplanetary disk phase. To resolve this conundrum,\nwe examine how the observed chemical and isotopic features of chondrules\nconstrain the dynamical environment of accreting chondrite parent bodies by\ninterpreting the meteoritic record as an impact-generated proxy of\nplanetesimals that underwent repeated collision and reaccretion cycles. Using a\ncoupled evolution-collision model we demonstrate that the vast majority of\ncollisional debris feeding the asteroid main belt must be derived from\nplanetesimals which were partially molten at maximum. Therefore, the precursors\nof chondrite parent bodies either formed primarily small, from sub-canonical\naluminum-26 reservoirs, or collisional destruction mechanisms were efficient\nenough to shatter planetesimals before they reached the magma ocean phase.\nFinally, we outline the window in parameter space for which chondrule formation\nfrom planetesimal collisions can be reconciled with the meteoritic record and\nhow our results can be used to further constrain early solar system dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

In the present paper we use {\\it analytical}\ntechniques in order to explore the physical properties of the polytropic\nhydrodynamic vortex in the $N_{\\text{p}}>0$ regime. In particular, we prove\nthat in this physical regime, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized\nby a {\\it finite} discrete set of reflecting surface radii,\n$\\{r_{\\text{c}}(N_{\\text{p}},m;n)\\}^{n=N_{\\text{max}}}_{n=1}$, that can support\nthe marginally-stable static sound modes (here $m$ is the azimuthal harmonic\nindex of the acoustic perturbation field). Interestingly, it is proved\nanalytically that the dimensionless outermost supporting radius\n$r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}/r_{\\text{e}}$, which marks the onset of superradiant\ninstabilities in the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex, increases monotonically\nwith increasing values of the integer harmonic index $m$ and decreasing values\nof the dimensionless polytropic index $N_{\\text{p}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

We perform high-resolution\nspectroscopic measurements of r-process abundances for twelve metal-poor stars\nin the Draco dwarf galaxy in the metallicity range of -2.5<[Fe/H]<-2. We found\nthat these stars are separated into two groups with r-process abundances\ndiffering by one order of magnitude. A group of stars with high abundances of\nr-process elements was formed by a single r-process event that corresponds to\nthe event evidenced in Ret II. On the other hand, the low r-process abundance\ngroup was formed by another sporadic enrichment channel producing a far fewer\nr-process elements, which is clearly identified for the first time.\nAccordingly, we identified two populations of stars with different r-process\nabundances, which are built by two r-process events that enriched gases at\nlevels that differ by more than one order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Along with a novel stochastic sampler based on Nos\\'{e}-Poincar\\'{e}\ndynamics, we use this framework with standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as\nwell as newer stochastic algorithms such as SGHMC and SGNHT, and show strong\nperformance on synthetic and real high-dimensional sampling scenarios; we\nachieve sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being\nsignificantly faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 20:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

In this study, we report measurements of hydrodynamic\nmobility of confined polymeric particles, vesicles and cancer cells in a linear\nmicrochannel with square cross-section. Our operating conditions are such that\nthe mobility is measured as a function of geometric confinement over the range\n0.3 < l < 1.5 and at specified particle Reynolds numbers that are within 0.1 <\nRep < 2.5. The experimental mobility data of each of these systems is compared\nwith the circular-tube theory of Hestroni, Haber and Wacholder (J. of Fluid\nMech., 1970) with modifications made for a square cross-section. For polymeric\nparticles, we find that the mobility data agrees well over a large confinement\nrange with the theory but under predicts for vesicles. The mobility of vesicles\nis higher in a square channel than in a circular tube, and does not depend\nsignificantly on membrane mechanical properties. The mobility of cancer cells\nis in good agreement with the theory up to l approaches 0.8, after which it\ndeviates. Comparison of the mobility data of the three systems reveals that\ncancer cells have higher mobility than rigid particles but lower than vesicles,\nsuggesting that the cell membrane frictional properties are in between a\nsolid-like interface and a fluid bilayer.

However, distinct spectral responses have been observed for Bi absorbers\ndeposited via evaporation versus electroplating.

A drawback of\ntrajectories is that they provide little information on how to respond to a\ndisturbance.

To efficiently cover\na broader range of frequencies, many CMB experiments have begun to deploy\nmultichroic pixels. For a given cryogenic and optical design, the pixel size\nthat optimizes the mapping speed is frequency-dependent and increases with\nwavelength. If a multichroic pixel is the same size at all frequencies, then\nthe mapping speed will be optimal in at most one frequency band. To achieve\noptimal mapping speed at all frequencies, a pixel size that varies with\nfrequency is needed. This can be accomplished by creating phased arrays from\nneighboring pixels, where the size of each phased array is chosen independently\nfor each frequency band. As the array unit, we choose a lenslet-coupled sinuous\nantenna on account of its wide bandwidth, dual polarization and constant beam\nwaist. We find that the array factor tends to compensate for beam\nnon-idealities, so that the sinuous antenna can be substantially undersized\nrelative to the single-element case; this frees up valuable focal-plane area\nfor bolometers, bandpass filters, summing networks, readout circuitry, etc. An\nadditional benefit of a hierarchical phased array is the reduced readout\nrequirement: since the low frequencies are arrayed to increase their mapping\nspeeds, the detector count scales approximately logarithmically with the number\nof frequency bands.

The first stage started from the emergence of a small positive\nmagnetic polarity, which cancelled with the nearby negative magnetic field and\ncaused the rising of a mini-filament and its confining loops. This further\nresulted in a small jet due to the magnetic reconnection between the rising\nconfining loops and the overlying open field. The second ejection stage was\nmainly due to the successive removal of the confining field by the\nreconnection. Thus that the filament erupted and the erupting cool filament\nmaterial directly combined with the hot jet originated form the reconnection\nregion and therefore formed the cool and hot components of the blowout jet.\nDuring the two ejection stages, cool H{\\alpha} jets are also observed cospatial\nwith their coronal counterparts, but their appearance times are earlier than\nthe hot coronal jets a few minutes. Therefore, the hot coronal jets are\npossibly caused by the heating of the cool H{\\alpha} jets, or the rising of the\nreconnection height from chromosphere to the corona. The scenario that magnetic\nreconnection occurred between the confining loops and the overlying open loops\nare supported by many observational facts, including the bright patches on the\nboth sides of the mini-filament, hot plasma blobs along the jet body, and\nperiodic metric radio type III bursts at the very beginnings of the two stages.\nThe evolution and characteristics of these features manifest the detailed\nnon-linear process in the magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 03:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

CA has a potential to enhance data rates and network performance in\nthe downlink, uplink, or both, and it can support aggregation of frequency\ndivision duplexing (FDD) as well as time division duplexing (TDD). The\ntechnique enables the MNO to exploit fragmented spectrum allocations and can be\nutilized to aggregate licensed and unlicensed carrier spectrum as well. This\npaper analyzes the performance gains and complexity level that arises from the\naggregation of three inter-band component carriers (3CC) as compared to the\naggregation of 2CC using a Vienna LTE System Level simulator. The results show\na considerable growth in the average cell throughput when 3CC aggregations are\nimplemented over the 2CC aggregation, at the expense of reduction in the\nfairness index. The reduction in the fairness index implies that, the scheduler\nhas an increased task in resource allocations due to the added component\ncarrier. Compensating for such decrease in the fairness index could result into\nscheduler design complexity.

In this technique, by exploiting the concept of NOMA,\nunlike the conventional method of cooperative relaying, the second time slot is\nalso utilized for the realization of information sent from the transmitter end.\nMoreover, as the data symbols are transmitted by nodes with full power, the\ncompulsion of complex power allocation coefficients is precluded. In\nconventional cooperative relaying systems, the receiver is only able to receive\na single bit of information, while the receiver can reliably bring in two data\nsymbols in two-time slots. In this regard, this scheme is able to acquire\nhigher achievable rate performance than existing cooperative relaying schemes\nfor larger channel powers over most of the transmit SNR regime. Furthermore, a\nmathematical expression is also derived for the total achievable rate of\nCRS-NOMA.

We estimate a\ndifferential velocity shift for Fe and Ti lines of different depths and derive\nan absolute convective blueshift using the Sun as a reference for a sample of\n360 F7-K4 stars with different properties (age, Teff, metallicity). We confirm\nthe strong variation in convective blueshift with Teff and its dependence on\n(as shown in the line list in Paper I) activity level.

Recent works have shown that they can accrete within\nan impact-generated inner dense and outer light disk, and that the same impact\npotentially forms the Borealis basin, a large northern hemisphere basin on the\ncurrent Mars. However, there is no a priori reason for the impact to take place\nclose to the north pole (Borealis present location) nor to generate a debris\ndisk in the equatorial plane of Mars (in which Phobos and Deimos orbit). In\nthis paper, we investigate these remaining issues on the giant impact origin of\nthe Martian moons. First, we show that the mass deficit created by the Borealis\nimpact basin induces a global reorientation of the planet to realign its main\nmoment of inertia with the rotation pole (True Polar Wander). This moves the\nlocation of the Borealis basin toward its current location. Next, using\nanalytical arguments, we investigate the detailed dynamical evolution of the\neccentric inclined disk from the equatorial plane of Mars that is formed by the\nMartian-moon-forming impact. We find that, as a result of precession of disk\nparticles due to the Martian dynamical flattening $J_{2}$ term of its gravity\nfield and particle-particle inelastic collisions, eccentricity and inclination\nare damped and an inner dense and outer light equatorial circular disk is\neventually formed. Our results strengthen the giant impact origin of Phobos and\nDeimos that can finally be tested by a future sample return mission such as\nJAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 08:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Even when increasing the level of\nsynchronization in a biological system is considered as the main driving force\nfor adaptation, there is evidence of negative effects induced by excessive\nsynchronization. This indicates that coherence alone can not be enough to\nexplain all the structural features observed in many real-world networks. In\nthis work, we propose an adaptive network model where the dynamical evolution\nof the node states towards synchronization is coupled with an evolution of the\nlink weights based on an anti-Hebbian adaptive rule, which accounts for the\npresence of inhibitory effects in the system. We found that the emergent\nnetworks spontaneously develop the structural conditions to sustain explosive\nsynchronization. Our results can enlighten the shaping mechanisms at the heart\nof the structural and dynamical organization of some relevant biological\nsystems, namely brain networks, for which the emergence of explosive\nsynchronization has been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 09:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

This set of theories has recently\nacquired a special status, due to Namikawa's theorem. As a consequence of this\ntheorem, closures of nilpotent orbits are the simplest non-trivial moduli\nspaces that can be found in three dimensional theories with eight supercharges.\nIn the early 80's mathematicians Hanspeter Kraft and Claudio Procesi\ncharacterized an inclusion relation between nilpotent orbit closures of the\nsame classical Lie algebra. We recently showed a physical realization of their\nwork in terms of the motion of D3-branes on the Type IIB superstring embedding\nof the effective gauge theories. This analysis is restricted to A-type Lie\nalgebras. The present note expands our previous discussion to the remaining\nclassical cases: orthogonal and symplectic algebras. In order to do so we\nintroduce O3-planes in the superstring description. We also find a brane\nrealization for the mathematical map between two partitions of the same integer\nnumber known as \"collapse\". Another result is that basic Kraft-Procesi\ntransitions turn out to be described by the moduli space of orthosymplectic\nquivers with varying boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 10:28:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 12:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Extracting fine-grained patterns involves\nexpensive spatial aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In\nthis paper, we propose a mobile traffic super-resolution technique that\novercomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic consumption\nfrom coarse measurements.

It generalizes the notion of minimal sufficient\nstatistics from classical parametric statistics to a broader\ninformation-theoretic sense. The IB curve defines the optimal trade-off between\nrepresentation complexity and its predictive power. Specifically, it is\nachieved by minimizing the level of mutual information (MI) between the\nrepresentation and the original variables, subject to a minimal level of MI\nbetween the representation and the target. This problem is shown to be in\ngeneral NP hard. One important exception is the multivariate Gaussian case, for\nwhich the Gaussian IB (GIB) is known to obtain an analytical closed form\nsolution, similar to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). In this work we\nintroduce a Gaussian lower bound to the IB curve; we find an embedding of the\ndata which maximizes its \"Gaussian part\", on which we apply the GIB. This\nembedding provides an efficient (and practical) representation of any arbitrary\ndata-set (in the IB sense), which in addition holds the favorable properties of\na Gaussian distribution.

Also,\nthanks to availability of data from a number of apparitions, their spin and\nshape models can often be obtained.\n  Almost half of bright (H<=11 mag) main-belt asteroid population with known\nlightcurve parameters have rotation periods considered long (P>12 hours) and\nare rarely chosen for photometric observations. There is a similar selection\neffect against asteroids with low lightcurve amplitudes (a_max<=0.25 mag). As a\nresult such targets, though numerous in this brightness range, are\nunderrepresented in the sample of spin and shape modelled asteroids. In the\nrange of fainter targets such effects are stronger. These selection effects can\ninfluence what is now known about asteroid spin vs. size distribution, on\nasteroid internal structure and densities and on spatial orientation of\nasteroid spin axes.\n  To reduce both biases at the same time, we started a photometric survey of a\nsubstantial sample of those bright main-belt asteroids that displayed both\nfeatures: periods longer than 12 hours, and amplitudes that did not exceed 0.25\nmagnitude.

For bubbles wide enough to span the\nchannel, the system's behaviour is similar to that of semi-infinite fingers and\na symmetric static solution is stable. Here, we focus on smaller bubbles, in\nwhich case the symmetric static solution is unstable and the static bubble is\ndisplaced towards one of the deeper regions of the channel on either side of\nthe rail. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations of a\ndepth-averaged model, we show that a bubble propagating axially due to a small\nimposed flow rate can be stabilised in a steady symmetric mode centred on the\nrail through a subtle interaction between stabilising viscous forces and\ndestabilising surface tension forces. However, for sufficiently large capillary\nnumbers Ca, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces, viscous forces in\nturn become destabilising thus returning the bubble to an off-centred\npropagation regime. With decreasing bubble size, the range of Ca for which\nsteady centred propagation is stable decreases, and eventually vanishes through\nthe coalescence of two supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. The depth-averaged\nmodel is found to accurately predict all the steady modes of propagation\nobserved experimentally, and provides a comprehensive picture of the underlying\nsteady bifurcation structure. However, for sufficiently large imposed flow\nrates, we find that initially centred bubbles do not converge onto a steady\nmode of propagation. Instead they transiently explore weakly unstable steady\nmodes, an evolution which results in their break-up and eventual settling into\na steady propagating state of changed topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 12:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 12:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In this manuscript, we propose the usage of the nonlinear laser\nlithography technique, which was recently presented as a fast, relatively\nlow-cost method for a large area micro- and nanogrooves fabrication based on\nlaser-induced periodic surface structuring, as a new perspective method of the\nalignment of nematic liquid crystals. 920 nm periodic grooves were formed on a\nTi layer processed by means of the nonlinear laser lithography and studied as\nan aligning layer. Aligning properties of the periodic structures of Ti layers\nwere examined by using a combined twist LC cell. In addition, the layer of the\nmicrostructured Ti was coated with an oxidianiline-polyimide film with\nannealing of the polymer film followed without any further processing. The\ndependence of the twist angle of LC cells on a scanning speed and power of\nlaser beam during processing of the Ti layer was studied.

Inspired by single molecule\npulling experiments on leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1),\nexpressed in T-cells, bound to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM), we\nperformed constant loading rate ($r_f$) and constant force ($F$) simulations\nusing the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model to describe the mechanism of\nligand rupture from CACs. The simulations reproduce the major experimental\nfinding on the kinetics of the rupture process, namely, the dependence of the\nmost probable rupture forces ($f^*$s) on $\\ln r_f$ ($r_f$ is the loading rate)\nexhibits two distinct linear regimes. The first, at low $r_f$, has a shallow\nslope whereas the slope at high $r_f$ is much larger, especially for\nLFA-1/ICAM-1 complex with the transition between the two occurring over a\nnarrow $r_f$ range. Locations of the two transition states (TSs), extracted\nfrom the simulations show an abrupt change from a high value at low $r_f$ or\n$F$ to a low value at high $r_f$ or $F$. The unusual behavior in which the CACs\nswitch from one brittle (TS position is a constant over a range of forces)\nstate to another brittle state is not found in forced-rupture in other protein\ncomplexes. We explain this novel behavior by constructing the free energy\nprofiles, $F(\\Lambda)$s, as a function of a collective reaction coordinate\n($\\Lambda$), involving many key charged residues and a critical metal ion. The\nTS positions in F($\\Lambda) change abruptly at a critical force, demonstrating\nthat it, rather than the molecular extension is a good reaction coordinate. We\nreveal a new mechanism for the two loading regimes observed in the rupture\nkinetics in CACs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 13:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

In order to take into account the\ncorrelation effects with a proper precision, we use the approach based on the\n\\textit{diagrammatic expansion of the Gutzwiller wave function} (DE-GWF), which\ngoes beyond the renormalized mean field theory (RMFT) in a systematic manner.\nAs a starting point of our analysis we discuss the stability region of the SC+N\nphase on the intrasite Coulomb repulsion-hole doping plane for the case of the\nHubbard model. Next, we show that the exchange interaction term enhances\nsuperconductivity while suppresses the nematicity, whereas the intersite\nCoulomb repulsion term acts in the opposite manner. The competing character of\nthe SC and N phases interplay is clearly visible throughout the analysis. A\nuniversal conclusion is that the nematic phase does not survive within the\n$t$-$J$-$U$ model with the value of $J$ integral typical for the high-T$_C$\ncuprates ($J\\approx 0.1$eV). For the sake of completeness, the effect of the\ncorrelated hopping term is also analyzed.

A prototypical example setting\nis that of tweets. A tweet is a set of words, and Twitter emits about half a\nbillion tweets per day. Our solution makes it possible to efficiently maintain\nthe top-$k$ most similar tweets from a pair of rapid Twitter streams, e.g., to\ndiscover similar trends in two cities if the streams concern cities.\n  Using a sliding window model, the top-$k$ result changes as new sets in the\nstream enter the window or existing ones leave the window. Maintaining the\ntop-$k$ result under rapid streams is challenging. First, when a set arrives,\nit may form a new pair for the top-$k$ result with any set already in the\nwindow. Second, when a set leaves the window, all its pairings in the top-$k$\nare invalidated and must be replaced. It is not enough to maintain the $k$ most\nsimilar pairs, as less similar pairs may eventually be promoted to the top-$k$\nresult. A straightforward solution that pairs every new set with all sets in\nthe window and keeps all pairs for maintaining the top-$k$ result is memory\nintensive and too slow. We propose SWOOP, a highly scalable stream join\nalgorithm that solves these issues. Novel indexing techniques and sophisticated\nfilters efficiently prune useless pairs as new sets enter the window. SWOOP\nincrementally maintains a stock of similar pairs to update the top-$k$ result\nat any time, and the stock is shown to be minimal. Our experiments confirm that\nSWOOP can deal with stream rates that are orders of magnitude faster than the\nrates of existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 14:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 20:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

By proactively sharing video data across a subset of base\nstations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul loading, secure cooperative\njoint transmission of several BSs can be dynamically enabled in accordance with\nthe cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul capacity. Assuming\nimperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, we formulate a\ntwo-stage non-convex mixed-integer robust optimization problem for minimizing\nthe total transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and\nguaranteeing communication secrecy during video delivery, where the caching and\nthe cooperative transmission policy are optimized in an offline video caching\nstage and an online video delivery stage, respectively.

How such microscopic anomaly manifests itself in a macroscopic\nmany-body system with chiral fermions, is a highly nontrivial question that has\nrecently attracted significant interest. As it turns out, unusual transport\ncurrents can be induced by chiral anomaly under suitable conditions in such\nsystems, with the notable example of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) where a\nvector current (e.g. electric current) is generated along an external magnetic\nfield. A lot of efforts have been made to search for CME in heavy ion\ncollisions, by measuring the charge separation effect induced by the CME\ntransport. A crucial challenge in such effort, is the quantitative prediction\nfor the CME signal. In this paper, we develop the Anomalous-Viscous Fluid\nDynamics (AVFD) framework, which implements the anomalous fluid dynamics to\ndescribe the evolution of fermion currents in QGP, on top of the neutral bulk\nbackground described by the VISH2+1 hydrodynamic simulations for heavy ion\ncollisions. With this new tool, we quantitatively and systematically\ninvestigate the dependence of the CME signal to a series of theoretical inputs\nand associated uncertainties. With realistic estimates of initial conditions\nand magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively\nconsistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV Au-Au collisions.\nBased on analysis of Au-Au collisions, we further make predictions for the CME\nobservable to be measured in the planned isobaric (Ru-Ru v.s. Zr-Zr ) collision\nexperiment, which could provide a most decisive test of the CME in heavy ion\ncollisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 14:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 04:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Galaxy clusters exhibit a tight correlation between the luminosity\nand temperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. While the luminosity\nmeasurement depends on cosmological parameters through the luminosity distance,\nthe temperature determination is cosmology-independent. We exploit this\nproperty to test the isotropy of the luminosity distance over the full\nextragalactic sky, through the normalization $a$ of the $L_X-T$ scaling\nrelation and the cosmological parameters $\\Omega_m$ and $H_0$. We use two\nalmost independent galaxy cluster samples: the ASCA Cluster Catalog (ACC) and\nthe XMM Cluster Survey (XCS-DR1). Interestingly enough, these two samples\nappear to have the same pattern for $a$ with respect to the Galactic longitude.\nWe also identify one sky region within $l\\sim (-15^o,90^o)$ (Group A) that\nshares very different best-fit values for $a$ for both samples. We find the\ndeviation of Group A to be $2.7\\sigma$ for ACC and $3.1\\sigma$ for XCS-DR1.\nThis tension is not relieved after excluding possible outliers or after a\nredshift conversion to the CMB frame is applied. Using also the HIFLUGCS\nsample, we show that a possible excess of cool-core clusters in this region,\ncannot explain the obtained deviations. Moreover, we tested for a dependence of\nthe $L_X-T$ relation on supercluster environment. We indeed find a trend for\nsupercluster members to be underluminous compared to field clusters. However,\nthe fraction of supercluster members is similar in the different sky regions.\nConstraining $\\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ via the redshift evolution of $L_X-T$ and the\nluminosity distance, we obtain approximately the same deviation amplitudes as\nfor $a$.

This popular stepped surface contains 7 x\n7-reconstructed terraces oriented along the Si(111) direction, separated by a\nstepped region.

When a misconfiguration is discovered, usually the\nfirst order of business is to restore availability, often by undoing the\nmisconfiguration. To simplify this task, we propose the Statistical Analysis\nfor Identifying Configuration Files (SAIC), which analyzes how the contents of\na file changes over time to automatically determine which files contain\nconfiguration state. In this way, SAIC reduces the number of files a user must\nmanually examine during recovery and allows versioning file systems to make\nmore efficient use of their versioning storage.\n  The two key insights that enable SAIC to identify configuration files are\nthat configuration state must persist across executions of an application and\nthat configuration state changes at a slower rate than other types of\napplication state. SAIC applies these insights through a set of filters, which\neliminate non-persistent files from consideration, and a novel similarity\nmetric, which measures how similar a file's versions are to each other.\nTogether, these two mechanisms enable SAIC to identify all 72 configuration\nfiles out of 2363 versioned files from 6 common applications in two user\ntraces, while mistaking only 33 non-configuration files as configuration files,\nwhich allows a versioning file system to eliminate roughly 66% of\nnon-configuration file versions from its logs, thus reducing the number of file\nversions that a user must try to recover from a misconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 18:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

The enormous computational demands\nposed by DNNs have most commonly been addressed through the design of custom\naccelerators. However, these accelerators are prohibitive in many design\nscenarios (e.g., wearable devices and IoT sensors), due to stringent area/cost\nconstraints. Accelerating DNNs on these low-power systems, comprising of mainly\nthe general-purpose processor (GPP) cores, requires new approaches. We improve\nthe performance of DNNs on GPPs by exploiting a key attribute of DNNs, i.e.,\nsparsity.

We dynamically detect zero operands and skip a set\nof future instructions that use it. Our design ensures that the instructions to\nbe skipped are prevented from even being fetched, as squashing instructions\ncomes with a penalty. SparCE consists of 2 key micro-architectural\nenhancements- a Sparsity Register File (SpRF) that tracks zero registers and a\nSparsity aware Skip Address (SASA) table that indicates instructions to be\nskipped. When an instruction is fetched, SparCE dynamically pre-identifies\nwhether the following instruction(s) can be skipped and appropriately modifies\nthe program counter, thereby skipping the redundant instructions and improving\nperformance. We model SparCE using the gem5 architectural simulator, and\nevaluate our approach on 6 image-recognition DNNs in the context of both\ntraining and inference using the Caffe framework. On a scalar microprocessor,\nSparCE achieves 19%-31% reduction in application-level.

The total\nprobabilities for spontaneous -emission by a single excited nucleus or by an\narbitrary number of excited nuclei in the crystal are derived. It is shown that\nthe formation of a nuclear exciton is connected with an increase of the width\nof the emitting level and with the concentration of the radiation in a narrow\nsolid angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 09:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
