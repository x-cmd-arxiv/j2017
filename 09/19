First, the vertices of a tight polygon that contains the convex\nintersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so, the\nintersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the\nintersection region are determined, and a set of points is generated on the\nelliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring intersection points. By finding\nthe tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points, a set of\nhalf-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the\npolygon more efficiently, the points are given an order and the intersection of\nthe half-planes corresponding to every two neighbouring points is calculated.\nIf the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points together with the\ninitially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon\nis non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate\nadditional discrete points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the\nissue, and restart the algorithm to obtain a bounded and convex polygon.\nFinally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the polygon is\nobtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical\nexperiments, it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter\nouter-approximation of the intersection of multiple ellipses, compared to\nconventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 16:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Conventional model\ncompression methods attempt to address this problem by modifying the\narchitecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all\nreduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep\nneural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this\nissue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network\narchitectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach\ntakes a larger `teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed `student'\nnetwork derived from the `teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a\nrecurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large `teacher'\nmodel. In the second stage, another recurrent policy network carefully reduces\nthe size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to\nobtain a reward -- a score based on the accuracy and compression of the\nnetwork. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train\nthe policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show\nthat we can achieve compression rates of more than 10x for models such as\nResNet-34 while maintaining similar performance to the input `teacher' network.\nWe also present a valuable transfer learning result which shows that policies\nwhich are pre-trained on smaller `teacher' networks can be used to rapidly\nspeed up training on larger `teacher' networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 16:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 11:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

The temporal window length, i.e., the number $M$ of\nsequential frames, over which associations are collectively estimated poses a\ntrade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. A larger $M$ improves\nperformance because the increased temporal context enables the use of motion\nmodels and allows occlusions and spurious detections to be handled better. The\nnumber of total hypotheses tracks, on the other hand, grows exponentially with\nincreasing $M$, making larger values of $M$ computationally challenging to\ntackle. In this paper, we introduce SPAAM an iterative approach that\nprogressively grows $M$ with each iteration to improve estimated tracks by\nexploiting the enlarged temporal context while keeping computation manageable\nthrough two novel approaches for pruning association hypotheses. First, guided\nby a road network, accurately co-registered to the WAMI frames, we disregard\nunlikely associations that do not agree with the road network. Second, as $M$\nis progressively enlarged at each iteration, the related increase in\nassociation hypotheses is limited by revisiting only the subset of association\npossibilities rendered open by stochastically determined dis-associations for\nthe previous iteration.

It follows from results of Assmus \\cite{A} that, given any integer\n$t$ with $1 \\leq t \\leq n-1$, there is a code $C_{n,t}$ containing\nrepresentatives of all isomorphism classes of STS$(2^n-1)$ with 2-rank at most\n$2^n -1 -n + t$. Using a mixture of coding theoretic, geometric, design\ntheoretic and combinatorial arguments, we prove a general formula for the\nnumber of distinct STS$(2^n-1)$ with 2-rank at most $2^n -1 -n + t$ contained\nin this code.

This has led to a recent\ninterest in adapting data-efficient learning techniques to robotics. One\npopular method is Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient black-box\noptimization scheme, but its performance typically degrades in higher\ndimensions.

The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower\nStackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this\ngame, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy\nthat maximizes its profits, while the prosumers act as followers who react by\nchoosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as to optimize their current\nand future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective\ndecision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random\nfuture price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect\ntheory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's valuation of its gains and\nlosses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference\npoint changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future\naspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a\nunique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory (CGT)\nwhich is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended\nto account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an\nNE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load\nvaries significantly with the prosumers' reference point and their\nloss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that the power company's profits\nconsiderably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective\nperceptions under PT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 17:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Current data suggest the presence (5-sigma, accounting for\nsystematics) of a Lyman-Alpha nebula that extends for 9 kpc around the QSO.\nThis emission is displaced and redshifted by 155 km/s with respect to the\nlocation of the QSO host galaxy traced by the [CII] emission line. The total\nluminosity is L = 3.0x10$^{42}$ erg/s. Our analysis suggests that this emission\nis unlikely to rise from optically thick clouds illuminated by the ionizing\nradiation of the QSO. It is more plausible that the Lyman-Alpha emission is due\nto fluorescence of the highly ionized optically thin gas. This scenario implies\na high hydrogen volume density of n$_H$ ~ 6 cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we detect a\nLyman-Alpha emitter (LAE) in the immediate vicinity of the QSO: i.e., with a\nprojected separation of 12.5 kpc and a line-of-sight velocity difference of 560\nkm/s. The luminosity of the LAE is L = 2.1x10$^{42}$ erg/s and its inferred\nstar-formation-rate is SFR ~ 1.3 M$_\\odot$/yr. The probability of finding such\na close LAE is one order of magnitude above the expectations based on the\nQSO-galaxy cross-correlation function. This discovery is in agreement with a\nscenario where dissipative interactions favour the rapid build-up of\nsuper-massive black holes at early Cosmic times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Excluding the most heavily-obscured\nsources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z~2.5 star-forming galaxies in\nthe mass range 9.25 <= log(M/Msun) <= 10.75 are fully consistent with the\nIRX-beta relation expected for a relatively grey attenuation curve, similar to\nthe commonly adopted Calzetti law.

Once again, we find that z~2.5\nstar-forming galaxies follow A_1600-mass and IRX-mass relations consistent with\na relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that\nstar-forming galaxies at this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve.

Although the\nsituation at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2<z<3\nstar-forming galaxies with log(M/Msun) >= 9.75, both the IRX-beta and IRX-mass\nrelations are well described by a Calzetti-like attenuation law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 12:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

From these images it is possible to\nmeasure the progenitor's brightness a few years before explosion, and\nultimately estimate its initial mass. Previous work has shown that II-P and\nII-L supernovae (SNe) have Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors, and that the range\nof initial masses for these progenitors seems to be limited to $<$17M$_\\odot$.\nThis is in contrast with the cutoff of 25-30M$_\\odot$ predicted by evolutionary\nmodels, a result which is termed the 'Red Supergiant Problem'. Here we\ninvestigate one particular source of systematic error present in converting\npre-explosion photometry into an initial mass, that of the bolometric\ncorrection (BC) used to convert a single-band flux into a bolometric\nluminosity. We show, using star clusters, that RSGs evolve to later spectral\ntypes as they approach SN, which in turn causes the BC to become larger.\nFailure to account for this results in a systematic underestimate of a star's\nluminosity, and hence its initial mass. Using our empirically motivated BCs we\nreappraise the II-P and II-L SNe that have their progenitors detected in\npre-explosion imaging. Fitting an initial mass function to these updated masses\nresults in an increased upper mass cutoff of $M_{\\rm\nhi}$=$19.0^{+2.5}_{-1.3}$M$_\\odot$, with a 95% upper confidence limit of\n$<$27M$_\\odot$. Accounting for finite sample size effects and systematic\nuncertainties in the mass-luminosity relationship raises the cutoff to $M_{\\rm\nhi}$=25M$_\\odot$ ($<$33M$_\\odot$, 95% confidence). We therefore conclude that\nthere is currently no strong evidence for `missing' high mass progenitors to\ncore-collapse SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 09:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

As stationary solutions of the\nEinstein--Klein-Gordon or the Einstein--Proca theory, bosonic stars may also\nbecome sufficiently compact to develop light rings and hence mimic, in\nprinciple, gravitational-wave observational signatures of black holes (BHs). In\nthis paper, we discuss how these horizonless ultra-compact objects (UCOs) are\nactually distinct from BHs, both phenomenologically and dynamically. In the\nelectromagnetic channel, the light ring associated phenomenology reveals\nremarkable lensing patterns, quite distinct from a standard BH shadow, with an\ninfinite number of Einstein rings accumulating in the vicinity of the light\nring, both inside and outside the latter. The strong lensing region, moreover,\ncan be considerably smaller than the shadow of a BH with a comparable mass.\nDynamically, we investigate the fate of such UCOs under perturbations, via\nfully non-linear numerical simulations and observe that, in all cases, they\ndecay into a Schwarzschild BH within a time scale of $\\mathcal{O}(M)$, where\n$M$ is the mass of the bosonic star.

A visual concept is represented by\nrandomly generated, positive as well as negative, example images. We then test\nthe ability and speed of algorithms (and humans) to learn the concept from\nthese images. The training and testing are performed progressively in multiple\nrounds, with each subsequent round deliberately designed to be more complex and\nconfusing than the previous round(s), especially if the concept was not grasped\nby the learner. However, if the concept was understood, all the deliberate\ntests would become trivially easy. Our experiments show that humans can often\ninfer a semantic concept quickly after looking at only a very small number of\nexamples (this is often referred to as an \"aha moment\": a moment of sudden\nrealization), and performs perfectly during all testing rounds (except for\ncareless mistakes). On the contrary, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN)\ncould approximate some concepts statistically, but only after seeing many\n(x10^4) more examples. And it will still make obvious mistakes, especially\nduring deliberate testing rounds or on samples outside the training\ndistributions. This signals a lack of true \"understanding\", or a failure to\nreach the right \"formula\" for the semantics. We did find that some concepts are\neasier for DCNN than others. For example, simple \"counting\" is more learnable\nthan \"symmetry\", while \"uniformity\" or \"conformance\" are much more difficult\nfor DCNN to learn.

In this\nprocess, known as M\\\"unch pressure flow, the loading of sugars from\nphotosynthetic cells to the export conduit (the phloem) is crucial, as it sets\nthe pressure head necessary to power long-distance transport. Whereas most\nherbaceous plants use active mechanisms to increase phloem concentration above\nthat of the photosynthetic cells, in most tree species, for which transport\ndistances are largest, loading seems to occur via passive symplastic diffusion\nfrom the mesophyll to the phloem. Here, we use a synthetic microfluidic model\nof a passive loader to explore the nonlinear dynamics that arise during export\nand determine the ability of passive loading to drive long-distance transport.\nWe first demonstrate that in our device, phloem concentration is set by the\nbalance between the resistances to diffusive loading from the source and\nconvective export through the phloem. Convection-limited export corresponds to\nclassical models of M\\\"unch transport, where phloem concentration is close to\nthat of the source; in contrast, diffusion-limited export leads to small phloem\nconcentrations and weak scaling of flow rates with the hydraulic resistance. We\nthen show that the effective regime of convection-limited export is predominant\nin plants with large transport resistances and low xylem pressures. Moreover,\nhydrostatic pressures developed in our synthetic passive loader can reach\nbotanically relevant values as high as 10 bars. We conclude that passive\nloading is sufficient to drive long-distance transport in large plants, and\nthat trees are well suited to take full advantage of passive phloem loading\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 20:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Endomorphisms of the trivial bundle gerbe, or higher\nfunctions, carry the structure of a rig-category, which acts on generic\nmorphism categories of bundle gerbes. We continue by presenting a\ncategorification of the hermitean metric on a hermitean line bundle. This is\nachieved by introducing a functorial dual that extends the dual of vector\nbundles to morphisms of bundle gerbes, and constructing a two-variable\nadjunction for the aforementioned rig-module category structure on morphism\ncategories. Its right internal hom is the module action, composed by taking the\ndual of higher functions, while the left internal hom is interpreted as a\nbundle gerbe metric.

Specifically, any\nd-SDNNF (resp., SDNNF) for such a DNF (resp., CNF) must be of exponential size\nin its treewidth; and the same holds for pathwidth when compiling to OBDDs. Our\nlower bounds, in contrast with most previous work, apply to any formula of this\nclass, not just a well-chosen family. Hence, for our language of DNF and CNF,\npathwidth and treewidth respectively characterize the efficiency of compiling\nto OBDDs and (d-)SDNNFs, that is, compilation is singly exponential in the\nwidth parameter.

Therefore, we explored the effects of two types of\nrelevant social interactions on fibroblast PDGF-BB-induced migration in\nmicrofluidic tissue-mimicking mazes: cell sequence and mitosis. Surprisingly,\nit was found that in both cases, the cells display behavior that is\ncontradictory to the chemoattractant gradient established in the maze. In case\nof the sequence, the cells do not like to take the same path through the maze\nas their predecessor, when faced with a bifurcation. To the contrary, they tend\nto alternate - if a leading cell takes the shorter (steeper gradient) path, the\ncell following it chooses the longer (weaker gradient) path, and vice versa.\nAdditionally, we found that when a mother cell divides, its two daughters go in\nopposite directions (even if it means migrating against the chemoattractant\ngradient and overcoming on-going cell traffic). Therefore, it is apparent that\nfibroblasts modify each other's directional decisions in a manner that is\ncounter-intuitive to what is expected from classical chemotaxis theory.\nConsequently, accounting for these effects could lead to a better understanding\nof tissue generation in vivo, and result in more advanced engineered tissue\nproducts in vitro.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 23:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

In the local beeping model, an agent hears a\nbeep in a round if it listens in this round and if the other agent is at the\nsame node and beeps.

Agents are modeled as discs of\ndiameter 1, and meeting occurs when these discs touch. Agents have different\nlabels which are integers from the set of 0 to L-1. Each agent knows L and\nknows its own label, but not the label of the other agent. Agents are equipped\nwith compasses and have synchronized clocks. They make a series of moves. Each\nmove specifies the direction and the duration of moving. This includes a null\nmove which consists in staying inert for some time, or forever. In a non-null\nmove agents travel at the same constant speed, normalized to 1. We assume that\nagents have sensors enabling them to estimate the distance from the other agent\n(defined as the distance between centers of discs), but not the direction\ntowards it. We consider two models of estimation. In both models an agent reads\nits sensor at the moment of its appearance in the plane and then at the end of\neach move. This reading (together with the previous ones) determines the\ndecision concerning the next move. In both models the reading of the sensor\ntells the agent if the other agent is already present. Moreover, in the\nmonotone model, each agent can find out, for any two readings in moments t1 and\nt2, whether the distance from the other agent at time t1 was smaller, equal or\nlarger than at time t2. In the weaker binary model, each agent can find out, at\nany reading, whether it is at distance less than \\r{ho} or at distance at least\n\\r{ho} from the other agent, for some real \\r{ho} > 1 unknown to them. Such\ndistance estimation mechanism can be implemented, e.g., using chemical sensors.\nEach agent emits some chemical substance (scent), and the sensor of the other\nagent detects it, i.e., sniffs. The intensity of the scent decreases with the\ndistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 01:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In particular, a\nmacroscopic continuum model of polymeric fluids is constructed without a\npre-specified constitutive relation, but instead it is actively learned from\nmesoscopic simulations where the dynamics of polymer chains is explicitly\ncomputed. To couple the macroscopic rheology of polymeric fluids and the\nmicroscale dynamics of polymer chains, the continuum approach (based on the\nfinite volume method) provides the transient flow field as inputs for the\n(mesoscopic) dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), and in turn DPD returns an\neffective constitutive relation to close the continuum equations. In this\nmultiscale modeling procedure, we employ an active learning strategy based on\nGaussian process regression (GPR) to minimize the number of expensive DPD\nsimulations, where adaptively selected DPD simulations are performed only as\nnecessary. Numerical experiments are carried out for flow past a circular\ncylinder of a non-Newtonian fluid, modeled at the mesoscopic level by\nbead-spring chains. The results show that only five DPD simulations are\nrequired to achieve an effective closure of the continuum equations at Reynolds\nnumber Re=10. Furthermore, when Re is increased to 100, only one additional DPD\nsimulation is required for constructing an extended GPR-informed model closure.\nCompared to traditional message-passing multiscale approaches, applying an\nactive learning scheme to multiscale modeling of non-Newtonian fluids can\nsignificantly increase the computational efficiency.

Given\na causal structure of unknown classicality, the presence of such correlations\ncertifies the nonclassical nature of the causal structure in a\ndevice-independent fashion. In structures where all parties share a common\nresource, these nonclassical correlations are also known as nonlocal\ncorrelations. Any constraint satisfied by all correlations which are\nclassically compatible with a given causal structure defines a causal\ncompatibility criterion. Such criteria were recently derived for the Triangle\nstructure (E.

Numerical investigation suggests that they\ndo not, and we further conjecture that the set of correlations admitted by the\nclassical Triangle structure is equivalent to the set of correlations admitted\nby its quantum generalization whenever the three observable variables are\nbinary.

The recorded polarization depends on the emission mechanism\nand emission regime (optically thick or thin), the emitting particle\nproperties, and propagation effects. Here, we report an unusual flare,\nSOL2012-07-06T01:37, whose optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission of the main\nsource displays an apparently ordinary mode sense of polarization in contrast\nto the classical theory that favors the extraordinary mode. This flare produced\ncopious nonthermal emission in hard X-rays and in high-frequency microwaves up\nto 80 GHz. It is found that the main flare source corresponds to an interaction\nsite of two loops with greatly different sizes. We have investigated the three\npossible known reasons of the circular polarization sense reversal - mode\ncoupling, positron contribution, and the effect of beamed angular distribution.\nWe excluded polarization reversal due to contribution of positrons because\nthere was no relevant response in the X-ray emission. We find that a beam-like\nelectron distribution can produce the observed polarization behavior, but the\nsource thermal density must be much higher than the estimate from to the X-ray\ndata. We conclude that the apparent ordinary wave emission in the optically\nthin mode is due to radio wave propagation across the quasi-transverse (QT)\nlayer. The abnormally high transition frequency (above 35 GHz) can be achieved\nreasonably low in the corona where the magnetic field value is high and\ntransverse to the line of sight. This places the microwave source below this QT\nlayer, i.e. very low in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 04:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Such a strategy has several\nadvantages. It allows - to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations under the form\nof a system of conservation lawswith source terms, - the easy handling of the\nfree surface, which does not require moving meshes, - the possibility to take\nadvantage of robust and accurate numerical techniques developed in extensive\namount for Shallow Water type systems.

Up to an extent these algorithms have been\nable to provide an alternative to exchange large media files (images and\nvideos) over the networks in a secure way. However, there have been some issues\nwith the implementation of chaos based image ciphers in practice. One of them\nis reduced/small key space due to the fact that chaotic behavior is only\nobserved for certain range of system parameters/initial conditions of the\nchaotic system used in such algorithms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose\na simple, efficient and robust image encryption algorithm based on combined\napplications of quasigroups and chaotic standard map. The proposed image cipher\nis based on the popular substitution-diffusion architecture (Shanon) where a\nquasigroup of order 256 and chaotic standard map have been used for the\nsubstitution and permutation of image pixels respectively. Due to the\nintroduction of quasigroup as part of the secret key along with the parameter\nand initial conditions of the chaotic standard map, the key space has been\nincreased significantly. The proposed image cipher is very fast due to the fact\nthat the substitution based on the quasigroup operations is very simple and can\nbe executed easily through the lookup table operations on Latin squares (which\nare Cayley operation tables of quasigroups) and the permutation is performed\nrow-by-row as well as column-by-column using the pseudo random number sequences\ngener-ated through the chaotic standard map. The security and performance have\nbeen analyzed through the histograms, correlation coefficients, information\nentropy, key sensitivity analysis, differential analysis, key space analysis\netc. and the results prove the efficiency and robustness of the proposed image\ncipher against the possible security threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 06:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

The lightest KK particle (LKP) is one of the good candidates for\ncold dark matter. Annihilation of LKP dark matter in the Galactic halo produces\nhigh-energy gamma-rays. The gamma-ray spectrum shows a characteristic peak\nstructure around the LKP mass. This paper investigates the observability of\nthis peak structure by near-future detectors taking account of their energy\nresolution, and calculates the expected energy spectrum of the gamma-ray\nsignal. Then, by using the HESS data, we set some constraints on the boost\nfactor, which is a product of the annihilation cross section relative to the\nthermal one and an uncertain factor dependent on the substructure of the LKP\ndistribution in the Galactic halo, for each LKP mass. The resulting upper limit\non the boost factor is in the range from 1 to 30. The constraints can be\nregarded as comparable with the results of previous work for gamma-ray and\nelectron-positron observation. However, the observational data for the TeV or\nhigher energy region are still limited, and the possible LKP signal is not\nconclusive. Thus, we expect near-future missions with better sensitivity will\nclarify whether the LKP dark matter should exist or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 08:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Our\ncortical machinery segments the world and associate objects to specific colour\nterms, which is not only convenient for communication but also increases the\nefficiency of visual processing by reducing the dimensionality of input scenes.\nAlthough the neural substrate for this phenomenon is unknown, a recent study of\ncortical colour processing has discovered a set of neurons that are\nisoresponsive to stimuli in the shape of 3D-ellipsoidal surfaces in\ncolour-opponent space. We hypothesise that these neurons might help explain the\nunderlying mechanisms of colour naming in the visual cortex.\n  Following this, we propose a biologically-inspired colour naming model where\neach colour term - e.g. red, green, blue, yellow, etc. - is represented through\nan ellipsoid in 3D colour-opponent space. This paradigm is also supported by\nprevious psychophysical colour categorisation experiments whose results\nresemble such shapes. \"Belongingness\" of each pixel to different colour\ncategories is computed by a non-linear sigmoidal logistic function. The final\ncolour term for a given pixel is calculated by a maximum pooling mechanism. The\nsimplicity of our model allows its parameters to be learnt from a handful of\nsegmented images.

Additionally, ellipsoids of proposed model can adapt to image\ncontents offering a dynamical solution in order to address phenomenon of colour\nconstancy.

Contrary to the dynamics model of legged systems\nwith rigid contact (without impact) which is straightforward to develop, there\nis no consensus among researchers to employ a standard compliant contact model.\nOur main goal in this paper is to study the dynamics model structure of bipedal\nwalking systems with a rigid contact and a \\textit{novel} compliant contact\nmodel and to present experimental validation of both models. For the model with\nrigid contact, after developing the model of the articulated bodies in flight\nphase without any contact with the environment, we apply the holonomic\nconstraints at contact points and develop a constrained dynamics model of the\nrobot in both single and double support phases.

Instead, they can be dominated by the nonlocal\ngeneration of magnon accumulation as a result of the temperature gradient\npresent away from the heater, and decay geometrically as $1/d^2$. We emphasize\nthe importance of looking only into the exponential regime (i.e., the\nintermediate distance regime) to extract $\\lambda_m$. With this principle, we\nstudy $\\lambda_m$ as a function of temperature in two YIG films which are 2.7\nand 50 $\\mu$m in thickness, respectively. We find $\\lambda_m$ to be around 15\n$\\mu$m at room temperature and it increases to 40 $\\mu$m at $T=$ 3.5 K. Finite\nelement modeling results agree with experimental studies qualitatively, showing\nalso a geometrical decay beyond the exponential regime. Based on both\nexperimental and modeling results we put forward a general guideline for\nextracting $\\lambda_m$ from the nonlocal spin Seebeck effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 09:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The quantum Hamiltonian constraint in loop\nquantization turns out to be a finite difference equation whose stability is\nimportant to understand to gain insights on the viability of the underlying\nquantization and resulting physical implications. We take first steps towards\naddressing these issues for a loop quantization of the Schwarzschild interior\nrecently given by Corichi and Singh. Von-Neumann stability analysis is\nperformed using separability of solutions as well as a full two dimensional\nquantum difference equation. This results in a stability condition for black\nholes which have a very large mass compared to the Planck mass. For black holes\nof smaller masses evidence of numerical instability is found. In addition,\nstability analysis for macroscopic black holes leads to a constraint on the\nchoice of the allowed states in numerical evolution. With the caveat of using\nkinematical norm, sharply peaked Gaussian states are evolved using the quantum\ndifference equation and singularity resolution is obtained. A bounce is found\nfor one of the triad variables, but for the other triad variable singularity\nresolution amounts to a non-singular passage through the zero volume. States\nare found to be peaked at the classical trajectory for a long time before and\nafter the singularity resolution, and retain their semi-classical character\nacross the zero volume. Our main result is that quantum bounce occurs in loop\nquantized Schwarzschild interior at least for macroscopic black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 10:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 13:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

In this work, we study self-propulsion of\nhalf-coated spherical colloids in critical binary mixtures and show that the\ncoupling of local body forces, induced by laser illumination, and the wetting\nproperties of the colloid, can be used to finely tune both the colloid's\nswimming speed and its directionality.

Moreover, the\naforementioned features enable the possibility to realize both negative and\npositive phototaxis in light intensity gradients.

The object was also reported to exhibit multiperiodic light\nvariations with periods from 0.83d to 2.50d, on the basis of which it was\nclassified as a slowly pulsating B star. Interest in further investigation of\nthis system was raised by the detection of a variable magnetic field. Analysing\nspectra from four instruments, earlier published radial velocities, and several\nsets of photometric observations, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1)\nThe optical spectrum is dominated by the lines of the B-type primary\n(Teff1~16500(100) K), contributing 70% of the light in the optical region, and\na slightly cooler B tertiary (Teff3~13620(150) K). The lines of the low-mass\nsecondary are below our detection threshold; we estimate that it could be a\nnormal A or F star. (2) We resolved the ambiguity in the value of the inner\nbinary period and arrived at a linear ephemeris of T_super.conj.=HJD\n2443838.78(81)+25.41569(42)xE. (3) The intensity of the magnetic field\nundergoes a~sinusoidal variation in phase with one of the known photometric\nperiods, namely 2.503867(19)d, which we identify with the rotational period of\nthe tertiary. (4) The second photometric 1.0649524(40)d period is identified\nwith the rotational period of the B-type primary, but this interpretation is\nmuch less certain and needs further verification. (5) If our interpretation of\nphotometric periods is confirmed, the classification of the object as a slowly\npulsating B star should be revised. (6) Applying an N-body model to different\ntypes of available observational data, we constrain the orbital inclination of\nthe inner orbit to ~60 deg to 85 deg even in the absence of eclipses, and\nestimate the probable properties of the triple system and its components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 10:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Moreover,\nwe propose two objective VQA methods for encoded omnidirectional video, in\nlight of human perception characteristics of omnidirectional video. One method\nweighs the distortion of pixels with regard to their distances to the center of\nfront regions, which considers human preference in a panorama. The other method\npredicts viewing directions according to video content, and then the predicted\nviewing directions are leveraged to allocate weights to the distortion of each\npixel in our objective VQA method.

This reference medium is a ladder like domain, namely a thin\nperiodic structure (the thickness being characterized by a small parameter\n$\\epsilon > 0$) whose limit (as $\\epsilon$ tends to 0) is a periodic graph. The\nlocalized perturbation consists in changing the geometry of the reference\nmedium by modifying the thickness of one rung of the ladder. Considering the\nscalar Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions in this domain, we\nwonder whether such a geometrical perturbation is able to produce localized\neigenmodes. To address this question, we use a standard approach of asymptotic\nanalysis that consists of three main steps. We first find the formal limit of\nthe eigenvalue problem as the $\\epsilon$ tends to 0. In the present case, it\ncorresponds to an eigenvalue problem for a second order differential operator\ndefined along the periodic graph. Then, we proceed to an explicit calculation\nof the spectrum of the limit operator. Finally, we prove that the spectrum of\nthe initial operator is close to the spectrum of the limit operator. In\nparticular, we prove the existence of localized modes provided that the\ngeometrical perturbation consists in diminishing the width of one rung of the\nperiodic thin structure. Moreover, in that case, it is possible to create as\nmany eigenvalues as one wants, provided that $\\epsilon$ is small enough.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 11:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Compared to state-of-the-art\nPDIP methods, our solver replaces the initial damped Newton phase (usually used\nto compute a medium-accuracy solution) with a dual solver based on Nesterov's\nfast gradient scheme (DFG) that converges with a sublinear convergence rate of\norder O(1/k^2) to a medium-accuracy solution.

As shown, even in pipes several thousand\ndiameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed at the\nend of the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, with no indication\nof an approach to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that\nturbulent puffs do not age, we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting\nthe pipe at the entrance, thus introducing periodic boundary conditions for the\nflow pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow\npatterns for arbitrary long times. We find that after times in excess of $10^7$\nadvective time units, a statistical steady state is reached. Though the\nresulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay\nrates eventually reach a balance so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates\naround a well defined level which only depends on $Re$. We find that at lower\n$Re$ (here 2020), flows eventually always laminarize, while for higher $Re$\n($>=2060$) turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence lies in\nthe interval $2020<Re_c<2060$, which is in good agreement with the recently\nproposed value of $Re_c=2040$. The latter estimate was based on single puff\nstatistics and entirely neglected puff interactions. Unlike typical contact\nprocesses where such interactions strongly affect the critical point, in pipe\nflow it is only marginally influenced. Interactions on the other hand, are\nresponsible for the approach to the statistical steady state. As shown, they\nstrongly affect the resulting flow patterns, where they cause `puff\nclustering', with the clusters traveling across the puff pattern in a wave like\nfashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 12:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

White-light (WL)\ncontinuum enhancements were detected in the \"continuum\" channel of the Fe 6173\nA line during the impulsive phase of the observed flares. In this paper we aim\nto determine which radiation mechanism is responsible for such an enhancement\nbeing seen above the limb, at chromospheric heights around or below 1000 km.\nUsing a simple analytical approach, we compare two candidate mechanisms, the\nhydrogen recombination continuum (Paschen) and the Thomson continuum due to\nscattering of disk radiation on flare electrons. Both mechanisms depend on the\nelectron density, which is typically enhanced during the impulsive phase of a\nflare as the result of collisional ionization (both thermal and also\nnon-thermal due to electron beams). We conclude that for electron densities\nhigher than $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the Paschen recombination continuum\nsignificantly dominates the Thomson scattering continuum and there is some\ncontribution from the hydrogen free-free emission. This is further supported by\ndetailed radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations of the flare chromosphere\nheated by the electron beams. We use the RHD code FLARIX to compute the\ntemporal evolution of the flare heating in a semi-circular loop. The\nsynthesized continuum structure above the limb resembles the off-limb flare\nstructures detected by HMI, namely their height above the limb, as well as the\nradiation intensity.

In the last few years, interest in constraining the\nuncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from\nasteroseismology. Recently, Spruit (2015) proposed a limit for the rate of\ngrowth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of\nmaterial ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the\nimplications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass\nand metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild\nboundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning,\nwhen core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest.\nOrdinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to\nsuch an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster\npopulations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses ($0.83 \\leq\nM/\\text{M}_\\odot \\leq 5$), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core\nhelium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or\ntheir number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore\nhelps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical\npredictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for $R_2$, the observed\nratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular\nclusters; the luminosity difference between these two groups; and in\nasteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in\nthe \\textit{Kepler} field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 12:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the\nstroke set according to structures defined in the grammar and it does not\nimpose constraints present in some previous works (e.g. stroke ordering). By\navoiding such constraints and thanks to the powerful representativeness of\ngraphs, our approach can be adapted to the recognition of different graphic\nnotations. We show applications to the recognition of mathematical expressions\nand flowcharts. Experimentation shows that our method obtains state-of-the-art\naccuracy in both applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 13:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

However, set in this\ncontext, it is easy to see that the cyber attack surface of these systems is\nexpanding, making it more important than ever that innovative solutions for\nsecuring ICS be developed and that the limitations of these solutions are well\nunderstood. The development of anomaly based intrusion detection techniques has\nprovided capability for protecting ICS from the serious physical damage that\ncyber breaches are capable of delivering to them by monitoring sensor and\ncontrol signals for abnormal activity. Recently, the use of so-called stealthy\nattacks has been demonstrated where the injection of false sensor measurements\ncan be used to mimic normal control system signals, thereby defeating anomaly\ndetectors whilst still delivering attack objectives. In this paper we define a\ndeep learning-based framework which allows an attacker to conduct stealthy\nattacks with minimal a-priori knowledge of the target ICS.

The use of\nvariable-pitch propeller for thrust variation instead of RPM regulation\nfacilitates generation of negative thrust, thereby augmenting the rate of\nchange of thrust generation amenable for aggressive maneuvering. Blade element\ntheory along with momentum theory is used to estimate propeller thrust and\ntorque essential for formulating equation of motion of the vehicle. The\nproposed flight dynamics model is used for non-linear control design using\ndynamic inversion technique, which is then used to stabilize, track reference\ntrajectory, and simulate flip maneuver. The rotor torque is an irrational\nfunction of the control input which makes the control design challenging. To\naddress this problem, the control design employs three loops. The outer loop\nsolves the translational dynamics to generate the thrust, pitch angle, and roll\nangle commands required to track the prescribed trajectory. Using the command\ngenerated in the outer loop, the inner loop simplifies the rotational dynamics\nto provide the desired rate of angular velocities. A control allocation loop is\nadded to address the problem of nonlinearity associated with rotor torque. This\nis done by introducing the derivative of thrust coefficient as a virtual\ncontrol input. These virtual inputs determine the derivatives of thrust and\nbody moments, which in turn is used to generate the required thrust and body\nmoments. The concept is validated by showing attitude stabilization in real\nflight for a variable pitch quadrotor. The performance of the proposed design\nis shown through simulated results for attitude stabilization and trajectory\nfollowing. Reverse thrust capability of variable-pitch quadrotor is also shown\nby performing flip maneuver in which quadrotor roll angle changes from 0 to 180\ndegrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 13:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

This paper proposes a\nsequence-to-sequence neural attention network system for automatic text\ncorrection and completion.

It is theoretically possible for rings to have formed around\nextrasolar planets in a similar way to that in which they formed around the\ngiant planets in our solar system.

Support-based clustering method always undergoes two phases:\nfinding the domain of novelty and performing clustering assignment. To find the\ndomain of novelty, the training time given by the current solvers is typically\nover-quadratic in the training size, and hence precluding the usage of\nsupport-based clustering method for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we\npropose applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework to the first phase\nof support-based clustering for finding the domain of novelty and a new\nstrategy to perform the clustering assignment. However, the direct application\nof SGD to the first phase of support-based clustering is vulnerable to the\ncurse of kernelization, that is, the model size linearly grows up with the data\nsize accumulated overtime. To address this issue, we invoke the budget approach\nwhich allows us to restrict the model size to a small budget. Our new strategy\nfor clustering assignment enables a fast computation by means of reducing the\ntask of clustering assignment on the full training set to the same task on a\nsignificantly smaller set. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis\nabout the convergence rate for the proposed method. Finally, we validate our\nproposed method on the well-known datasets for clustering to show that the\nproposed method offers a comparable clustering quality while simultaneously\nachieving significant speedup in comparison with the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

The thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid\nis temperature dependent and chosen such that the fluid density is maximum at\nthe inversion temperature $T_b>T_i>T_t$. Thus, the lower layer of the fluid is\nconvectively unstable while the upper layer is stably stratified. We show that\nthe characteristics of the convection change significantly depending on the\ndegree of stratification of the stable layer. For strong stable stratification,\nthe convection zone coincides with the fraction of the fluid that is\nconvectively unstable (i.e. where $T>T_i$), and convective motions consist of\nrising and sinking plumes of large density anomaly, as is the case in canonical\nRayleigh-Benard convection; internal gravity waves are generated by turbulent\nfluctuations in the convective layer and propagate in the upper layer. For weak\nstable stratification, we demonstrate that a large fraction of the stable fluid\n(i.e. with temperature $T<T_i$) is instead destabilized and entrained by\nbuoyant plumes emitted from the bottom boundary. The convection thus mixes cold\npatches of low density-anomaly fluid with hot upward plumes, and the end result\nis that the $T_i$ isotherm sinks within the bottom boundary layer and that the\nconvection is entrainment-dominated. We provide a phenomenological description\nof the transition between the regimes of plume-dominated and\nentrainment-dominated convection through analysis of quantities for different\nstratification strengths. We find that the effect of the stable layer on the\nconvection decreases only weakly with increasing stratification strength,\nmeaning that the dynamics of the stable layer and convection should be studied\nself-consistently in a wide range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Our objective was to study how disease risk perception can\ninfluence opinions about vaccination and therefore the spreading of the\ndisease. Differently from previous works we have considered continuous\nopinions. The epidemic spreading is governed by a SIS-like model with an extra\nvaccinated state. In our model individuals vaccinate with a probability\nproportional to their opinions. The opinions change due to peer influence in\npairwise interactions. The epidemic feedback to the opinion dynamics acts as an\nexternal field increasing the vaccination probability. We performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations in fully-connected populations. Interestingly we observed the\nemergence of a first-order phase transition, besides the usual active-absorbing\nphase transition presented in the SIS model. Our simulations also show that\nwith a certain combination of parameters, an increment in the initial fraction\nof the population that is pro-vaccine has a twofold effect: it can lead to\nsmaller epidemic outbreaks in the short term, but it also contributes to the\nsurvival of the chain of infections in the long term. Our results also suggest\nthat it is possible that more effective vaccines can decrease the long-term\nvaccine coverage. This is a counterintuitive outcome, but it is in line with\nempirical observations that vaccines can become a victim of their own success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 18:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Each user is equipped with a cache\nwith capacity of $M$ files. The goal is to design a static content placement\nand delivery scheme such that the average load over the shared link is\nminimized. We first present a class of centralized coded caching schemes\nconsisting of a general content placement strategy specified by a file\npartition parameter, enabling efficient and flexible content placement, and a\nspecific content delivery strategy, enabling load reduction by exploiting\ncommon requests of different users. For the proposed class of schemes, we\nconsider two cases for the optimization of the file partition parameter,\ndepending on whether a large subpacketization level is allowed or not. In the\ncase of an unrestricted subpacketization level, we formulate the coded caching\noptimization in order to minimize the average load under an arbitrary file\npopularity. A direct formulation of the problem involves $N2^K$ variables. By\nimposing some additional conditions, the problem is reduced to a linear program\nwith $N(K+1)$ variables under an arbitrary file popularity and with $K+1$\nvariables under the uniform file popularity. We can recover Yu {\\em et al.}'s\noptimal scheme for the uniform file popularity as an optimal solution of our\nproblem. When a low subpacketization level is desired, we introduce a\nsubpacketization level constraint involving the $\\ell_0$ norm for each file.\nAgain, by imposing the same additional conditions, we can simplify the problem\nto a difference of two convex functions (DC) problem with $N(K+1)$ variables\nthat can be efficiently solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 14:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 08:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Using PNAD data background we also\nconfirm the effectiveness of a semi-empirical model that reconciles Pareto\npower-law for high-income people and Boltzmann- Gibbs distribution for the rest\nof population. We use three measures of income inequality: the Pareto index,\nthe average income and the crossover income. In order to cope with many\ndimensions of the income inequality, we calculate these three indices and also\nthe Gini coefficient for the general population as well as for two kinds of\npopulation dichotomies: black / indigenous / mixed race versus white / yellow;\nand men versus women. We also followed the time series of these indices for the\nperiod 2001-2014. The results suggest a decreasing of Brazilian income\ninequality over the selected period. Another important result is that\nhistorically-disadvantaged subgroups (Women and black / indigenous / mixed\nrace),that are the majority of the population, have a more equalitarian income\ndistribution. These groups have also a smaller monthly income than the others\nand this social structure remained virtually unchanged in the period of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 15:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

As a result, when the problem is ill-conditioned or the\nprediction horizon is large, each outer iteration becomes computationally very\nexpensive.

The curvature information of Newton-type\nmethods enables asymptotic superlinear rates under mild assumptions at the\nlimit point, and the proposed algorithm is based on very simple operations:\naccess to first-order information of the cost and dynamics and low-cost direct\nlinear algebra.

In\naddition, a grid- connected PV/Battery system with Maximum Power Point Tracking\n(MPPT) controller is modeled to analyze the system performance that has been\nevaluated under two different test conditions: (1) PV power production is\nhigher than the load demand (2) PV generated power is less than required load.\nA battery system has also been sized to provide smoothing services to this\narray. The simulation results show the effective of the proposed method. This\nsystem can be implemented in developing countries with similar weather\nconditions to Florida.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 03:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In HEVC, the quad-tree partition of coding unit (CU) consumes a\nlarge proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the bruteforce search\nfor rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity\nat both intra- and inter-modes, which is based on convolutional neural network\n(CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network. First, we establish a\nlarge-scale database including substantial CU partition data for HEVC intra-\nand inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we\nrepresent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit (CTU) in the form of a\nhierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we propose an early-terminated\nhierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently, the\nencoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing\nthe brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an\nearly-terminated hierarchical LSTM (ETH-LSTM) is proposed to learn the temporal\ncorrelation of the CU partition. Then, we combine ETH-LSTM and ETH-CNN to\npredict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity for inter-mode.\nFinally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and\ninter-modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 02:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 07:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 11:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The time and energy overhead\nof checkpointing, however, grows with the frequency of checkpointing.\nAmortizing this overhead becomes especially challenging, considering the growth\nof expected error rates, as checkpointing frequency tends to increase with\nincreasing error rates. Based on the observation that due to imbalanced\ntechnology scaling, recomputing a data value can be more energy efficient than\nretrieving (i.e., loading) a stored copy, this paper explores how recomputation\nof data values (which otherwise would be read from a checkpoint from memory or\nsecondary storage) can reduce the machine state to be checkpointed, and thereby\nreduce the checkpointing overhead. Specifically, the resulting amnesic\ncheckpointing framework AmnesiCHK can reduce the storage overhead by up to\n23.91%; time overhead, by 11.92%; and energy overhead, by 12.53%, respectively,\neven in a relatively small scale system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 21:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 22:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}
