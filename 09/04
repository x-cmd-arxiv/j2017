The early\nsurprise in solar energetic particles (SEPs) was 1000-fold enhancements in\n3He/4He from resonant wave-particle interactions in the small \"impulsive\" SEP\nevents that emit electron beams that produce type III radio bursts. Further\nstudies found enhancements in Fe/O, then extreme enhancements in abundances\nthat increase with mass-to-charge ratio A/Q by a factor of 1000 from He to Pb\narising in magnetic reconnection on open field lines in solar jets. In\ncontrast, in the largest SEP events, the \"gradual\" events, acceleration occurs\nat shock waves driven out from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs). Averaging many events provides a measure of solar coronal abundances,\nbut A/Q-dependent scattering during transport causes variations with time; thus\nif Fe scatters less than O, Fe/O is enhanced early and depleted later. To\ncomplicate matters, shock waves often reaccelerate impulsive suprathermal ions\nabove active regions that have spawned many impulsive events. Since both\nimpulsive and gradual SEP events have abundance enhancements that vary as\npowers of A/Q, we can use abundances to deduce Q-values and 1 - 3 MK source\nplasma temperatures during acceleration. Comparing coronal abundances from SEPs\nand from the slow solar wind as a function of the first ionization potential\n(FIP) of the elements, remaining differences are for the elements C, P, and S.\nThe theory of the fractionation of ions by Alfv\\'en waves shows that C, P, and\nS are suppressed because of wave resonances during chromospheric transport on\nclosed magnetic loops but not on open magnetic fields that supply the solar\nwind.

Based on\ndata from Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this study\ndeveloped a unique database that integrates intersection crash and inventory\ndata with more than 65 million real-world Basic Safety Messages logged by 3,000\nconnected vehicles, providing a more complete picture of operations and safety\nperformance of intersections.

To quantify relationships\nbetween intersection-specific volatilities and crash frequencies, rigorous\nfixed- and random-parameter Poisson regression models are estimated. While\ncontrolling for exposure related factors, the results provide evidence of\nstatistically significant (5% level) positive association between\nintersection-specific volatility and crash frequencies for signalized\nintersections.

The standard model of novae predicts that\ntheir optical luminosity derives from energy released near the hot white dwarf\nwhich is reprocessed through the ejected material. Recent studies with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope have shown that many classical novae are accompanied\nby gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray emission. This emission likely originates from\nstrong shocks, providing new insights into the properties of nova outflows and\nallowing them to be used as laboratories to study the unknown efficiency of\nparticle acceleration in shocks. Here we report gamma-ray and optical\nobservations of the Milky Way nova ASASSN-16ma, which is among the brightest\nnovae ever detected in gamma-rays. The gamma-ray and optical light curves show\na remarkable correlation, implying that the majority of the optical light comes\nfrom reprocessed emission from shocks rather than the white dwarf. The ratio of\ngamma-ray to optical flux in ASASSN-16ma directly constrains the acceleration\nefficiency of non-thermal particles to be ~0.005, favouring hadronic models for\nthe gamma-ray emission.

This problem arises often in the\nthermodynamics of computation and nonequilibrium statistical physics more\ngenerally (e.g., when designing processes to implement some desired\ncomputation, feedback controller, or Maxwell demon). It was previously known\nthat some conditional distributions cannot be implemented using any master\nequation that involves just the states in $X$. However, here we show that any\nconditional distribution $P$ can in fact be implemented---if additional\n\"hidden\" states not in $X$ are available. Moreover, we show that it is always\npossible to implement $P$ in a thermodynamically reversible manner. We then\ninvestigate a novel cost of the physical resources needed to implement a given\ndistribution $P$: the minimal number of hidden states needed to do so. We\ncalculate this cost exactly for the special case where $P$ represents a\nsingle-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in\nterms of the nonnegative rank of $P$. These results show that having access to\none extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states,\nis sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a\nthermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed\nform of the master equation. (Such constraints can greatly increase the minimal\nneeded number of hidden states.)

In\npower and cost limited applications, e.g., for sensor nodes in the Internet of\nThings, wideband RF feature extraction with conventional, Nyquist-rate\nanalog-to-digital converters is infeasible. However, the structure of many RF\nfeatures (such as signal sparsity) enables the use of compressive sensing (CS)\ntechniques that acquire such signals at sub-Nyquist rates. While such CS-based\nanalog-to-information (A2I) converters have the potential to enable low-cost\nand energy-efficient wideband RF sensing, they suffer from a variety of\nreal-world limitations, such as noise folding, low sensitivity, aliasing, and\nlimited flexibility.\n  This paper proposes a novel CS-based A2I architecture called non-uniform\nwavelet sampling (NUWS).

We performed numerical simulations of\nrelativistic MHD turbulence in isothermal plasmas, and analyzed the ratio of\nfast to Alfv\\'en mode energy. We found that the increase of the fast mode with\nthe background $\\sigma$-parameter can be observed even in isothermal plasma,\nshowing that such a phenomena is universal in trans-Alfv\\'enic turbulence in\nPoynting-dominated plasmas. To study the detailed energy conversion process, we\nalso performed a series of simulations of decaying turbulence injecting pure\nAlfv\\'en, fast, and slow modes, respectively, and investigated the development\nof the mode conversion from the each mode. We also found that the mode\nconversion between Alfv\\'en and fast modes is nearly insensitive to the\nbackground temperature. Finally, we report a result of a simulation with\ninitially fast mode dominated turbulence. It developed into a temporally\nstrong-coupling regime, which is a strong evidence for the existence of our\nsuggesting strong-coupling regime of fast and Alfv\\'en modes. Our result\nsuggests that the strong turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasma is very\ndifferent from that in the non-relativistic plasma. It will also give an\nimportant guidance to studies of particle acceleration and non-thermal photon\nemission from Poynting-dominated plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 02:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

We resolved the source+lens star from sub-arcsecond blends in H\nband using adaptive optics (AO) observations with NIRC2 mounted on Keck II\ntelescope.

The liquid morphologies are characterized by\nsponge-like interpenetrating polar and apolar networks in ionic liquids\nconsisting of tetraalkylphosphonium cations with short aliphatic chains. The\nlengthening aliphatic chains in tetraalkylphosphonium cations leads to polar\ndomains consisting of chloride anions and central polar groups in cations being\npartially or totally segregated in ionic liquid matrices due to a progressive\nexpansion of apolar domains in between. Prominent polarity alternation peaks\nand adjacency correlation peaks are observed at low and high $q$ range in total\nX-ray scattering structural functions, respectively, and their peak positions\ngradually shift to lower q values with lengthening aliphatic chains in\ntetraalkylphosphonium cations. The charge alternation peaks registered in\nintermediate q range exhibit complicated tendencies due to the complete\ncancellations of peaks and anti-peaks in partial structural functions for ionic\nsubcomponents. The particular microstructures and liquid morphologies in\ntetraalkylphosphonium chloride ionic liquids intrinsically contribute to\ndistinct dynamics characterized by translational diffusion coefficients, van\nHove correlation functions, and non-Gaussian parameters for ionic species in\nheterogeneous ionic environment. The increase of aliphatic chain length in\ntetraalkylphosphonium cations leads to concomitant shift of van Hove\ncorrelation functions and non-Gaussian parameters to larger radial distances\nand longer timescales, respectively, indicating the enhanced translational\ndynamical heterogeneities of tetraalkylphosphonium cations and the\ncorresponding chloride anions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 05:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The velocities are filtered in the three\nspatial directions and the results analyzed at different scales. We show that\nthe $R$--$Q$ plane does not capture the changes undergone by the flow as the\nfilter width increases, and that the enstrophy/enstrophy-production and\nstrain/strain-production planes represent better choices. We also show that the\nconditional mean trajectories may differ significantly from the instantaneous\nbehavior of the flow since they are the result of an averaging process where\nthe mean is 3-5 times smaller than the corresponding standard deviation. The\norbital periods in the $R$--$Q$ plane are shown to be independent of the\nintensity of the events, and of the same order of magnitude than those in the\nenstrophy/enstrophy-production and strain/strain-production planes.

The framework, referred to as EPG-X,\nmodels coupled two-compartment systems by describing each compartment with\nseparate phase graphs that exchange during evolution periods. There are two\nvariants: EPG-X(BM) for systems governed by the Bloch-McConnell equations; and\nEPG-X(MT) for the pulsed MT formalism. For the MT case the \"bound\" protons have\nno transverse components so their phase graph consists only longitudinal\nstates. EPG-X was used to model steady-state gradient echo imaging, MT effects\nin multislice Turbo Spin Echo imaging, multiecho CPMG for multicomponent T2\nrelaxometry and transient variable flip angle gradient echo imaging of the type\nused for MR Fingerprinting. Experimental data were also collected for the final\ncase. Steady-state predictions from EPG-X closely match directly derived\nsteady-state solutions which differ substantially from classic \"single pool\"\nEPG predictions. EPG-X(MT) predicts similar MT related levels of signal\nattenuation in white matter as have been reported elsewhere in the literature.\nModelling of CPMG echo trains with EPG-X(BM) suggests that exchange processes\ncan lead to an underestimate of the fraction of short T2 species. Modelling of\ntransient gradient echo sequences with EPG-X(MT) suggests that measurable MT\neffects result from variable saturation of bound protons, particularly after\ninversion pulses. In conclusion, EPG-X can be used for modelling of the\ntransient signal response of systems exhibiting chemical exchange or MT.

To incorporate\nboth bounded-distance (BD) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding at GC nodes\ninto our analysis without resorting on multi-edge type of degree distributions\n(DDs), we propose the probabilistic peeling decoding (P-PD) algorithm, which\nmodels the decoding step at every GC node as an instance of a Bernoulli random\nvariable with a successful decoding probability that depends on both the GC\nblock code as well as its decoding algorithm.

The presence of such features is believed to be a necessary consequence\nof nanoflare-based coronal and chromospheric heating theories. We separate the\ncalibrated MWA solar dynamic spectra into a slowly varying and an impulsive,\nand hence non-thermal, component. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixtures\nmodeling can be used to robustly model the latter and we estimate the flux\ndensity distribution as well as the prevalence of impulsive non-thermal\nemission in the frequency-time plane. Evidence for presence of non-thermal\nemission at levels down to $\\sim$0.2 SFU (1 SFU = 10$^4$ Jy) is reported,\nmaking them the weakest reported emissions of this nature.

A lattice bond\nis said to be connected when its two end discs overlap with each other.\nDepending on the difference of the phase angles of these discs a bond may be\ntermed as dead or live. While a dead bond can never be connected, a live bond\nis connected at least once in a complete time period. Two different time scales\ncan be associated with such a system, leading to two transition points. Namely,\na percolation transition occurs at $R_{0c} =0.908$ when a spanning cluster of\nconnected bonds emerges in the system.

For this setup, lower-bounds for secure\ncommunication rate are derived without imposing any limitation at the\neavesdropper processing. These lower-bounds are then compared with the rates\nachieved by assuming the worst-case linear eavesdropper processing. We show\nthat in certain special cases the worst-case eavesdropper does not enlarge the\nachievable secure rate region in comparison to the unconstrained eavesdropper\ncase. It turns out that in order to achieve the Pareto boundary of the secrecy\nrate region, smart tuning of the transmit power and receiver PS coefficient is\nrequired. Hence, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize these parameters\njointly in polynomial-time. The secrecy rate region characterization is\nformulated as a weighted max-min optimization problem. This problem turns out\nto be a non-convex problem due to the non-convex constrained set. This set is\nreplaced by a convex subset that in consequence leads to an achievable\nsuboptimal solution which is improved iteratively. By solving the problem\nefficiently, we obtain the amount of rate loss for providing secrecy, meanwhile\nsatisfying the energy demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 11:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 14:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

The detected angular-dependent longitudinal and\ntransverse magnetoresistances are measured by rotating the sample in magnetic\nfields up to 11 T, along three orthogonal planes (xy-, yz- and xz-rotation\nplanes, where the z-axis is orthogonal to the sample plane). The total\nmagnetoresistance has contributions arising from both the SMR and ordinary\nmagnetoresistance. The onset of the SMR signal occurs between 1 and 3 T and no\nsaturation is visible up to 11 T. The three-dimensional angular dependence of\nthe SMR can be explained by a model considering the reversible field-induced\nredistribution of magnetostrictive antiferromagnetic S- and T-domains in the\nNiO(001), stemming from the competition between the Zeeman energy and the\nelastic clamping effect of the non-magnetic MgO substrate.

This feature can be utilized in many contexts, ranging from Bell\ninequalities to device dependent QKD protocols. Typically, in these\napplications the measurements are chosen from a predetermined set based on a\nclassical random variable. One can naturally ask, whether the non-determinism\nof the outcomes is due to intrinsic hiding property of quantum mechanics, or\nrather by the fact that classical, incoherent information entered the system\nvia the choice of the measurement. Authors of [NJP 19, 023038 (2017)] examined\nthis question for a specific case of two mutually unbiased measurements on\nsystems of different dimensions. They have somewhat surprisingly shown that in\ncase of qubits, if the measurements are chosen coherently with the use of a\ncontrolled unitary, outcomes of both measurements can be guessed\ndeterministically. Here we extend their analysis and show that specifically for\nqubits, measurement result for any set of measurements with any a-priori\nprobability distribution can be faithfully guessed by a suitable state\npreparation and measurement. We also show that up to a small set of specific\ncases, this is not possible for higher dimensions. This result manifests a deep\ndifference in properties of qubits and higher dimensional systems and suggests\nthat these systems might offer higher security in specific cryptographic\nprotocols. More fundamentally, the results show that the impossibility of\npredicting a result of a measurement is not caused solely by a loss of\ncoherence between the choice of the measurement and the guessing procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 12:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In order to interpret the\nstatistical properties of selected sources, which has been proven as a very\nchallenging task due the complexity of observed artefacts, we make end-to-end\nsimulations including physical clustering and lensing. The estimated fraction\nof strongly lensed sources is $24^{+6}_{-5}\\%$ based on models. We present the\nfaintest known statistical sample of \"500 $\\mu$m-risers\" and show that noise\nand strong lensing have crucial impact on measured counts and redshift\ndistribution of selected sources. We estimate the flux-corrected star formation\nrate density at $4<z<5$ with the \"500 $\\mu$m-risers\" and found it close to the\ntotal value measured in far-infrared. It indicates that colour selection is not\na limiting effect to search for the most massive, dusty $z>4$ sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 13:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 11:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In this paper we derive a similar result in a complementary\nasymptotic regime related to fast and strongly localized waves with high\nenergy. In particular, we show that the spectrum of the linearized FPUT\noperator contains asymptotically no unstable eigenvalues except for the neutral\nones that stem from the shift symmetry and the spatial discreteness. This\nensures that high-energy waves are linearly stable in some orbital sense, and\nthe corresponding nonlinear stability is granted by the general, non-asymptotic\npart of the seminal Friesecke-Pego result and the extension by Mizumachi.\n  Our analytical work splits into two principal parts. First we refine\ntwo-scale techniques that relate high-energy wave to a nonlinear asymptotic\nshape ODE and provide accurate approximation formulas. In this way we establish\nthe existence, local uniqueness, smooth parameter dependence, and exponential\nlocalization of fast lattice waves for a wide class of interaction potentials\nwith algebraic singularity. Afterwards we study the crucial eigenvalue problem\nin exponentially weighted spaces, so that there is no unstable essential\nspectrum. Our key argument is that all proper eigenfunctions can asymptotically\nbe linked to the unique bounded and normalized solution of the linearized shape\nODE, and this finally enables us to disprove the existence of unstable\neigenfunctions in the symplectic complement of the neutral ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 13:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 12:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

The PMTs' timing information is useful only in\nthe case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added\nand removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to\naccount for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.\nTherefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself\nto a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with\ncontinuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these\ncomplications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an\nhypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This\ninitially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'\ntiming information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated\ntrajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position\nat the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the\nvertical by about 3 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 14:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

If properly integrated into legacy IEEE 802.11 standards, mmW\ncommunications can offer substantial gains by offloading traffic from congested\nsub-6 GHz unlicensed bands to the 60 GHz mmW frequency band. In this paper, a\nnovel medium access control (MAC) is proposed to dynamically manage the WLAN\ntraffic over the unlicensed mmW and sub-6 GHz bands. The proposed protocol\nleverages the capability of advanced multi-band wireless stations (STAs) to\nperform fast session transfers (FST) to the mmW band, while considering the\nintermittent channel at the 60 GHz band and the level of congestion observed\nover the sub-6 GHz bands. The performance of the proposed scheme is\nanalytically studied via a new Markov chain model and the probability of\ntransmissions over the mmW and sub-6 GHz bands, as well as the aggregated\nsaturation throughput are derived. In addition, analytical results are\nvalidated by simulation results. Simulation results show that the proposed\nintegrated mmW-sub 6 GHz MAC protocol yields significant performance gains, in\nterms of maximizing the saturation throughput and minimizing the delay\nexperienced by the STAs. The results also shed light on the tradeoffs between\nthe achievable gains and the overhead introduced by the FST procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 14:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

The methods were\noriginally devised for the numerical solution of stiff differential equations.\nMeanwhile, they constitute a well-established class of exponential integrators.\nThe popularity of Lawson methods is in some contrast to the fact that they may\nhave a bad convergence behaviour, since they do not satisfy any of the stiff\norder conditions. The aim of this paper is to explain this discrepancy. It is\nshown that non-stiff order conditions together with appropriate regularity\nassumptions imply high-order convergence of Lawson methods. Note, however, that\nthe term regularity here includes the behaviour of the solution at the\nboundary. For instance, Lawson methods will behave well in the case of periodic\nboundary conditions, but they will show a dramatic order reduction for, e.g.,\nDirichlet boundary conditions. The precise regularity assumptions required for\nhigh-order convergence are worked out in this paper and related to the\ncorresponding assumptions for splitting schemes.

However, not all tests can easily fit\ninto this framework, as they might not be differentiable with respect to the\ndata points, and hence with respect to the parameters of the implicit model.\nMotivated by this problem, in this paper we show how two such classical tests,\nthe Friedman-Rafsky and k-nearest neighbour tests, can be effectively smoothed\nusing ideas from undirected graphical models - the matrix tree theorem and\ncardinality potentials.

It is therefore\nimportant to study as many GCs as possible to characterize whether or not they\nhave MPs, and determine their detailed behavior to enlighten formation\nscenarios, using a wide range of techniques. The Washington photometric system\nhas proved to be useful to find MPs thanks mainly to the UV-sensitivity and\nhigh efficiency of the C filter. We search for MPs in the Galactic GC NGC 7099\n(M30), the second GC being searched for MPs using this system.

Our reduction procedure included addstar\nexperiments to properly assess photometric errors. We find a clear signal of\nMPs based on an intrinsically wide color spread on the RGB, in particular due\nto a relatively small fraction of stars significantly bluer than the main RGB\nlocus. These stars should correspond to so-called first generation stars, which\nwe estimate to be roughly 15\\% of the total. However, we find these\nfirst-generation stars to be more spatially concentrated than their second\ngeneration counterparts, which is the opposite to the general trend found in\nother clusters. We briefly discuss possible explanations for this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 15:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}
