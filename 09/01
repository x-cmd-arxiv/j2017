The purpose of this article\nis to fill this gap. We follow Leray's results in detail: we prove local\nexistence of strong solutions starting from divergence-free initial data that\nis either smooth, or belongs to $H^1$, $L^2\\cap L^p$ (with $p\\in(3,\\infty]$),\nas well as lower bounds on the norms $\\| \\nabla u (t) \\|_2$, $\\| u(t) \\|_p$\n($p\\in(3,\\infty]$) as $t$ approaches a putative blow-up time. We show global\nexistence of a weak solution and weak-strong uniqueness. We present Leray's\ncharacterisation of the set of singular times for the weak solution, from which\nwe deduce that its upper box-counting dimension is at most $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\nThroughout the text we provide additional details and clarifications for the\nmodern reader and we expand on all ideas left implicit in the original work,\nsome of which we have not found in the literature. We use some modern\nmathematical tools to bypass some technical details in Leray's work, and thus\nexpose the elegance of his approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some\nparticipants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in\nproportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks\nthreaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH)\nattack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants\nreceive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools\nlaunch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a\nNash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack\ncalled selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by\ndeliberately generating forks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called\na fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The\nreward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH\nattacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH\nattack. When considering multiple pools - the current state of the Bitcoin\nnetwork - the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a\nBWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the\nminer's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can\nconsistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional\nforks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also\ndiscuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and\nefficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see\nFAW attacks among mining pools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, the\nmain effect of thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the\nplanet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes on either\nside of the orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes\nexert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to\nthe one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the\nlobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the `cold'\nthermal torque, which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the\ndistance to corotation to the size of the lobes $\\sim\\sqrt{\\chi/\\Omega_p}$,\n$\\chi$ being the thermal diffusivity and $\\Omega_p$ the orbital frequency. We\nbelieve that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named `cold finger'\nrecently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes\nthe dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is\nluminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional\ndisturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes.

As\noften in prediction with expert advice, designing an algorithm that achieves\nnear-optimal regret guarantees is straightforward, using aggregation of\nexperts. However, when the comparison class is sufficiently rich, for instance\nwhen the best expert and the set of experts itself changes over time, such\nstrategies naively require to maintain a prohibitive number of weights\n(typically exponential with the time horizon). By contrast, designing\nstrategies that both achieve a near-optimal regret and maintain a reasonable\nnumber of weights is highly non-trivial. We consider three increasingly\nchallenging objectives (simple regret, shifting regret and sparse shifting\nregret) that extend existing notions defined for a fixed expert ensemble; in\neach case, we design strategies that achieve tight regret bounds, adaptive to\nthe parameters of the comparison class, while being computationally\ninexpensive. Moreover, our algorithms are anytime, agnostic to the number of\nincoming experts and completely parameter-free.

A straightforward\nimplication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency\nof (a) destroying lower-mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher-mass\ngalaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs\nof star-forming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the\nquiescent subsample.

Though the two are driven by the same\ndynamics---global time-varying potential for the energy, and torques caused by\nasymmetries for angular momentum---we measure them differently. We define\nmixing as the redistribution of energy and angular momentum between particles\nof the two merging galaxies. We assess the degree of mixing as the difference\nbetween the shapes of their N(E)s, and their N(L^2)s. We find that the\ndifference is decreasing with time, indicating mixing. To measure relaxation,\nwe compare N(E) of the newly merged system to N(E) of a theoretical prediction\nfor relaxed collisionless systems, DARKexp, and witness the system becoming\nmore relaxed, in the sense that N(E) approaches DARKexp N(E). Because the\ndynamics driving mixing and relaxation are the same, the timescale is similar\nfor both. We measure two sequential timescales: a rapid, 1 Gyr phase after the\ninitial merger, during which the difference in N(E) of the two merging halos\ndecreases by ~80%, followed by a slow phase, when the difference decreases by\n~50% over ~8.5 Gyrs. This is a direct measurement of the relaxation timescale.\nOur work also draws attention to the fact that when a galaxy has reached Jeans\nequilibrium it may not yet have reached a fully relaxed state given by DARKexp,\nin that it retains information about its past history. This manifests itself\nmost strongly in stars being centrally concentrated. We argue that it is\nparticularly difficult for stars, and other tightly bound particles, to mix\nbecause they have less time to be influenced by the fluctuating potential, even\nacross multiple merger events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 19:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The catalog includes\nsources with z$\\leq 0.05$, with a radio size $\\lesssim$ 5 kpc, and with an\noptical spectrum characteristic of low-excitation galaxies. Their 1.4-GHz radio\nluminosities range $10^{38} \\lesssim \\nu L_{1.4} \\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s. The\nFR0CAT hosts are mostly (86%) luminous ($-21 \\gtrsim M_r \\gtrsim -23$) red\nearly-type galaxies with black hole masses $10^8 \\lesssim M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim\n10^9 M_\\odot$: similar to the hosts of FRI radio galaxies, but they are on\naverage a factor $\\sim$1.6 less massive. The number density of FR0CAT sources\nis $\\sim$5 times higher than that of FRIs, and thus they represent the dominant\npopulation of radio sources in the local Universe. Different scenarios are\nconsidered to account for the smaller sizes and larger abundance of FR0s with\nrespect to FRIs. An age-size scenario that considers FR0s as young radio\ngalaxies that will all eventually evolve into extended radio sources cannot be\nreconciled with the large space density of FR0s. However, the radio activity\nrecurrence, with the duration of the active phase covering a wide range of\nvalues and with short active periods strongly favored with respect to longer\nones, might account for their large density number. Alternatively, the jet\nproperties of FR0s might be intrinsically different from those of the FRIs, the\nformer class having lower bulk Lorentz factors, possibly due to lower black\nhole spins. Our study indicates that FR0s and FRI/IIs can be interpreted as two\nextremes of a continuous population of radio sources that is characterized by a\nbroad distribution of sizes and luminosities of their extended radio emission,\nbut shares a single class of host galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Another scenario uses the wavefront\ncontrol system in the coronagraph instrument and using a recent Super-Nyquist\nWavefront Control (SNWC) technique can remove the off-axis stellar leakage to\nenable a region of high-contrast around the on-axis star blocked by the\nstarshade.We present simulation results relevant for the WFIRST telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

However, a key challenge in\napplying CNN to biological problems is that the available labeled training\nsamples are very limited. Another issue for CNN to be applied in computer aided\ndiagnosis applications is that to achieve better diagnosis and prognosis\naccuracy, one usually has to deal with the longitudinal dataset, i.e., the\ndataset of images scanned at different time points. Here we argue that an\nenhanced CNN model with transfer learning for the joint analysis of tasks from\nmultiple time points or regions of interests may have a potential to improve\nthe accuracy of computer aided diagnosis. To reach this goal, we innovate a CNN\nbased deep learning multi-task dictionary learning framework to address the\nabove challenges. Firstly, we pre-train CNN on the ImageNet dataset and\ntransfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model to the medical imaging\nprogression representation, generating the features for different tasks. Then,\nwe propose a novel unsupervised learning method, termed Multi-task Stochastic\nCoordinate Coding (MSCC), for learning different tasks by using shared and\nindividual dictionaries and generating the sparse features required to predict\nthe future cognitive clinical scores. We apply our new model in a publicly\navailable neuroimaging cohort to predict clinical measures with two different\nfeature sets and compare them with seven other state-of-the-art methods.

We do not see any signature of\nthe bipolar outflows associated with B1b-N and B1b-S, which were previously\ndetected in H2CO and CH3OH, in any of the imaged species. The non-detection of\nSO constrains the SO/CH3OH abundance ratio in the high-velocity gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 19:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Breakthroughs in computer vision technology are often marked by\nadvances in inference techniques. This thesis proposes novel inference schemes\nand demonstrates applications in computer vision. We propose inference\ntechniques for both generative and discriminative vision models. The use of\ngenerative models in vision is often hampered by the difficulty of posterior\ninference. We propose techniques for improving inference in MCMC sampling and\nmessage-passing inference. Our inference strategy is to learn separate\ndiscriminative models that assist Bayesian inference in a generative model.\nExperiments on a range of generative models show that the proposed techniques\naccelerate the inference process and/or converge to better solutions. A main\ncomplication in the design of discriminative models is the inclusion of prior\nknowledge. We concentrate on CNN models and propose a generalization of\nstandard spatial convolutions to bilateral convolutions. We generalize the\nexisting use of bilateral filters and then propose new neural network\narchitectures with learnable bilateral filters, which we call `Bilateral Neural\nNetworks'. Experiments demonstrate the use of the bilateral networks on a wide\nrange of image and video tasks and datasets. In summary, we propose techniques\nfor better inference in several vision models ranging from inverse graphics to\nfreely parameterized neural networks. In generative models, our inference\ntechniques alleviate some of the crucial hurdles in Bayesian posterior\ninference, paving new ways for the use of model based machine learning in\nvision.

A variety of\ngraph structures, graph dynamics, and behaviours of replicators have been\nexplored. These models have primarily been studied in the framework of\nfacilitation of cooperation, and much previous research has shed light on this\nfield of study. However, there has been little attention devoted to truncation\nselection as most models employ proportional selection (such as in the\nreplicator equation) or `imitate the best.' Here we systematically explore\ntruncation selection on periodic square lattices, where replicators below a\nfitness threshold are culled and the reproduction probabilities are equal for\nall survivors. We employ two variations of this method: independent truncation,\nwhere the threshold is fixed; and dependent truncation, which is a\ngeneralization of `imitate the best.' Further, we explore the effects of\ndiffusion in our networks in the following orders of operation:\ncontest-diffusion-offspring (CDO), and diffusion-contest-offspring (DCO). CDO\nand DCO frequently facilitate and diminish cooperation, respectively. For\nindependent truncation, we find three regimes determined by the fitness\nthreshold: cooperation decreases as we raise the threshold; polymorphisms and\nextinction can occur; and the entire population goes extinct. Further, we show\nhow an intermediate sucker's payoff maximizes cooperation in the DCO\nindependent truncation model. We find that dependent truncation affects games\ndifferently; lower levels reduce cooperation for the Hawk Dove game and\nincrease it for the Stag Hunt, and higher levels produce the opposite effects.\nWe compare these truncation methods to proportional selection, and show that\nthey can facilitate cooperation. We conclude that truncation selection can\nimpact the prevalence of cooperation in complex ways, and therefore merit\nfurther study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 20:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

When the instruments,\nexposure and outcome are not measured in the same sample, Angrist and Krueger\n(1992) suggested to use two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimators that\nuse sample moments from an instrument-exposure sample and an instrument-outcome\nsample. However, this method is biased if the two samples are from\nheterogeneous populations so that the distributions of the instruments are\ndifferent. In linear structural equation models, we derive a new class of TSIV\nestimators that are robust to heterogeneous samples under the key assumption\nthat the structural relations in the two samples are the same. The widely used\ntwo-sample two-stage least squares estimator belongs to this class. It is\ngenerally not asymptotically efficient, although we find that it performs\nsimilarly to the optimal TSIV estimator in most practical situations. We then\nattempt to relax the linearity assumption. We find that, unlike one-sample\nanalyses, the TSIV estimator is not robust to misspecified exposure model.\nAdditionally, to nonparametrically identify the magnitude of the causal effect,\nthe noise in the exposure must have the same distributions in the two samples.\nHowever, this assumption is in general untestable because the exposure is not\nobserved in one sample. Nonetheless, we may still identify the sign of the\ncausal effect in the absence of homogeneity of the noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 20:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 18:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

The detector took data during two periods of\nsearching for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) searches. After the\nfirst period completed, a time-varying non-uniform negative charge developed in\nthe polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) panels that define the radial boundary of\nthe detector's active volume. This caused electric field variations in the\ndetector in time, depth and azimuth, generating an electrostatic\nradially-inward force on electrons on their way upward to the liquid surface.\nTo map this behavior, 3D electric field maps of the detector's active volume\nwere built on a monthly basis. This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL\nMultiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected\non a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the\ncourse of the exposure from -3.6 to $-5.5~\\mu$C/m$^2$. From our studies, we\ndeduce that the electric field magnitude varied while the mean value of the\nfield of $\\sim200$~V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure. As a result\nof this work the varying electric fields and their impact on event\nreconstruction and discrimination were successfully modeled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 22:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 19:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 22:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

For\nsimulations of realistic scenarios, full detailed chemical models are\ncomputationally prohibitive. In addition, they are usually inaccurate for\nhigh-temperature and high-pressure shock-laden flows. This paper presents a\ngeneral approach for developing an automated procedure to determine the\nreaction parameters for a simplified chemical-diffusive model to simulate flame\nacceleration and DDT in stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen\nmixtures. The procedure uses a combination of a genetic algorithm and\nNelder-Mead optimization scheme to find the optimal reaction parameters for a\nreaction rate based on an Arrhenius form for conversion of reactants to\nproducts. The model finds six optimal reaction parameters that reproduce six\ntarget flame and detonation properties. Results from the optimization procedure\nshow that the optimal reaction parameters, when used in 1-D reactive\nNavier-Stokes simulations, closely reproduce the target flame and detonation\nproperties for the stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen mixtures.\nWhen the reaction parameters are used as input in a 2-D simulation of flame\nacceleration and DDT in an obstacle-laden channel containing stoichiometric\nmethane-air, the simulation results closely follow the transition to detonation\nobserved in experiments. This automated procedure for finding parameters for a\nproposed reaction model makes it possible to simulate the behavior of flames\nand detonations in large, complex scenarios, which would otherwise be an\nincalculable problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 22:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

We conclude that high pressure from\nthe cluster's centre affects the balance of galaxies and they lose a\nsignificant amount of their fuels; as a result, clustering process quenches\nX-ray emission of the member galaxies.

Here we create a semantic feature network\nin which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to\nsemantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles\nof applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose\nmanifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of\nmultiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16\nto 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained\nnull model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections.\nFurthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers\nwith differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word\nlevel, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains\ncomparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with\nfilling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length\nand frequency of the corresponding word. Finally, we show that the large-scale\narchitecture of the semantic feature network is topologically accommodating to\nmany node orders. We discuss the importance of topology in language learning,\nand we speculate that the formation and filling of knowledge gaps may be a\nrobust feature of knowledge acquisition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 02:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

In particular, we deal with misspecified settings where a test\nintegrand is less smooth than a Sobolev RKHS based on which a quadrature rule\nis constructed. We provide convergence guarantees based on two different\nassumptions on a quadrature rule: one on quadrature weights, and the other on\ndesign points. More precisely, we show that convergence rates can be derived\n(i) if the sum of absolute weights remains constant (or does not increase\nquickly), or (ii) if the minimum distance between design points does not\ndecrease very quickly. As a consequence of the latter result, we derive a rate\nof convergence for Bayesian quadrature in misspecified settings. We reveal a\ncondition on design points to make Bayesian quadrature robust to\nmisspecification, and show that, under this condition, it may adaptively\nachieve the optimal rate of convergence in the Sobolev space of a lesser order\n(i.e., of the unknown smoothness of a test integrand), under a slightly\nstronger regularity condition on the integrand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 04:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 16:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

In this\npaper we show, however, that the GHZ argument implicitly relies on an\nadditional crucial assumption, which is not required by fundamental physical\nprinciples and had gone unnoticed.

We further note that such an absolute\nframe of reference would not exist if the hidden configurations of the\nentangled particles spontaneously break the gauge rotational symmetry.

Unfortunately,\ndue to the hardware limitations, the hyperspectral image (HSI) is vulnerable to\nvarious degradations, such noises (random noise, HSI denoising), blurs\n(Gaussian and uniform blur, HSI deblurring), and down-sampled (both spectral\nand spatial downsample, HSI super-resolution). Previous HSI restoration methods\nare designed for one specific task only. Besides, most of them start from the\n1-D vector or 2-D matrix models and cannot fully exploit the structurally\nspectral-spatial correlation in 3-D HSI. To overcome these limitations, in this\nwork, we propose a unified low-rank tensor recovery model for comprehensive HSI\nrestoration tasks, in which non-local similarity between spectral-spatial cubic\nand spectral correlation are simultaneously captured by 3-order tensors.\nFurther, to improve the capability and flexibility, we formulate it as a\nweighted low-rank tensor recovery (WLRTR) model by treating the singular values\ndifferently, and study its analytical solution. We also consider the exclusive\nstripe noise in HSI as the gross error by extending WLRTR to robust principal\ncomponent analysis (WLRTR-RPCA). Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed\nWLRTR models consistently outperform state-of-the-arts in typical low level\nvision HSI tasks, including denoising, destriping, deblurring and\nsuper-resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 07:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

J0811+4730 strongly deviates from the main-sequence defined by SFGs in the\nemission-line diagnostic diagrams and the metallicity - luminosity diagram.\nThese differences are caused mainly by the extremely low oxygen abundance in\nJ0811$+$4730, which is ~10 times lower than that in main-sequence SFGs with\nsimilar luminosities.

We formulate the problem of finding a\nspectrum sensing policy for multi-band dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic\nrestless multi-armed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward\ndistributions. In cognitive radio networks the multi-armed bandit problem\narises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies\nthat could be efficiently exploited for data transmission. We consider two\nmodels for the dynamics of the frequency bands: 1) the independent model where\nthe state of the band evolves randomly independently from the past and 2) the\nGilbert-Elliot model, where the states evolve according to a 2-state Markov\nchain. It is shown that in these conditions the proposed sensing policy attains\nasymptotically logarithmic weak regret. The policy proposed in this paper is an\nindex policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample\nmean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes\nspectrum exploitation whereas the exploration bonus encourages for further\nexploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency\nbased approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it\nwill grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a\nsuboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing\nweak regret.

Current IACT telescope arrays (MAGIC, H.E.S.S, VERITAS)\nuse photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect the optical/near-UV Cherenkov\nradiation emitted due to the interaction of gamma rays with the atmosphere. For\nthe next generation of IACT experiments, the possibility of replacing the PMTs\nwith Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) is being studied. Among the main\ndrawbacks of SiPMs are their limited active area (leading to an increase in the\ncost and complexity of the camera readout) and their sensitivity to unwanted\nwavelengths. Here we propose a novel method to build a relatively low-cost\npixel consisting of a SiPM attached to a PMMA disc doped with a wavelength\nshifter. This pixel collects light over a much larger area than a single\nstandard SiPM and improves sensitivity to near-UV light while simultaneously\nrejecting background. We describe the design of a detector that could also have\napplications in other fields where detection area and cost are crucial.

These features are often\nassociated with possible young planets in these disks. Many non-planetary\nexplanations have also been suggested, including snow lines, dead zones and\nsecular gravitational instabilities in the dust. In this paper we suggest\nanother potential origin. The presence of copious amounts of dust tends to\nstrongly reduce the conductivity of the gas, thereby inhibiting the\nmagneto-rotational instability, and thus reducing the turbulence in the disk.\nFrom viscous disk theory it is known that a disk tends to increase its surface\ndensity in regions where the viscosity (i.e. turbulence) is low. Local maxima\nin the gas pressure tend to attract dust through radial drift, increasing the\ndust content even more. We investigate mathematically if this could potentially\nlead to a feedback loop in which a perturbation in the dust surface density\ncould perturb the gas surface density, leading to increased dust drift and thus\namplification of the dust perturbation and, as a consequence, the gas\nperturbation. We find that this is indeed possible, even for moderately small\ndust grain sizes, which drift less efficiently, but which are more likely to\naffect the gas ionization degree. We speculate that this instability could be\ntriggered by the small dust population initially, and when the local pressure\nmaxima are strong enough, the larger dust grains get trapped and lead to the\nfamiliar ring-like shapes. We also discuss the many uncertainties and\nlimitations of this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 11:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

We show that the extracted convex skeletons retain the degree\ndistribution, clustering, connectivity, distances, node position and also\ncommunity structure, while making the shortest paths between the nodes largely\nunique. Moreover, in the Slovenian computer scientists coauthorship network, a\nconvex skeleton retains the strongest ties between the authors, differently\nfrom a spanning tree or high-betweenness backbone and high-salience skeleton. A\nconvex skeleton thus represents a simple definition of a network backbone with\napplications in coauthorship and other social collaboration networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 11:36:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 19:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 18:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Finding a mathematical estimate for its\naccuracy has remained an open problem, going from the original paper by De\nVylder (1978) through an attempt of justification by Grandell (2000). The\npresent paper consists of a mathematical and critical treatment of the problem.\nWe more generally consider De Vylder type approximations of any order k, based\non fitting the k first moments of the classical risk reserve process. Moreover,\nwe not only deal with the ruin probability, but also with the moments of the\ntime of ruin, of the deficit at ruin and of the surplus before ruin. We\nestimate the approximation errors in terms of the safety loading coefficient,\nthe initial reserve and the approximation order. We show their different\nbehaviours, and the extent to which each relative error remains small or blows\nup, so that one has to be careful when using this approximation.

Consequently,\ngamma-rays of different energies, emitted simultaneously from astrophysical\nsources, could accumulate measurable differences in their time of flight until\nthey reach the Earth. Such tests have been carried out in the past using fast\nvariations of gamma-ray flux from pulsars, and more recently from active\ngalactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. We present new constraints studying the\ngamma-ray emission of the galactic Crab Pulsar, recently observed up to TeV\nenergies by the MAGIC collaboration. A profile likelihood analysis of pulsar\nevents reconstructed for energies above 400GeV finds no significant variation\nin arrival time as their energy increases. Ninety-five percent~CL limits are\nobtained on the effective Lorentz invariance violating energy scale at the\nlevel of $E_{\\mathrm{QG}_1} > 5.5\\cdot 10^{17}$GeV ($4.5\\cdot 10^{17}$GeV) for\na linear, and $E_{\\mathrm{QG}_2} > 5.9\\cdot 10^{10}$GeV ($5.3\\cdot 10^{10}$GeV)\nfor a quadratic scenario, for the subluminal and the superluminal cases,\nrespectively.

Examples of this include the classical problem of assigning\ncomputing tasks to nodes in a distributed computing environment, as well as the\nmore recent problem of crowdsourcing where a broad array of tasks are slated to\nbe completed by human workers. Extensive research into this problem generally\naddresses important issues such as uncertainty and, in crowdsourcing,\nincentives. However, the problem of adversarial tampering with the task\nallocation process has not received as much attention. We are concerned with a\nparticular adversarial setting in task allocation where an attacker may target\na specific worker in order to prevent the tasks assigned to this worker from\nbeing completed. We consider two attack models: one in which the adversary\nobserves only the allocation policy (which may be randomized), and the second\nin which the attacker observes the actual allocation decision. For the case\nwhen all tasks are homogeneous, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for both\nsettings. When tasks are heterogeneous, however, we show the adversarial\nallocation problem to be NP-Hard, and present algorithms for solving it when\nthe defender is restricted to assign only a single worker per task. Our\nexperiments show, surprisingly, that the difference between the two attack\nmodels is minimal: deterministic allocation can achieve nearly as much utility\nas randomized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 15:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

However there remains a lack of\nconsensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One\npotential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of\nrelatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc\nlifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in\nthe depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a\nlocal pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then\nbecome susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional\nviscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,\nwe explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range\nof parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals\nis often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We\nconclude that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of\ndebris discs, rather than a common mechanism for the formation of planetary\ncores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar investigation that\nconsidered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation of\ntens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily\na consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until\nobservations more tightly constrain photoevaporation models, the relevance of\nthis process to the formation of planets remains uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 15:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Here we report that if\nT_c is sufficiently low, applying the renormalization group approach into the\nBCS action at zero temperature will naturally lead to the parabolic scaling.\nOur result indicates that when T_c sufficiently approaches zero, quantum\nfluctuations will be overwhelmingly amplified so that the mean-field\napproximation may break down at zero temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}
