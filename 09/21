This paper investigates a new approach to wireless\ncaching for the case when cache content has to be updated during on-peak hours.\nTwo non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted caching strategies are\ndeveloped, namely the push-then-deliver strategy and the push-and-deliver\nstrategy. In the push-then-deliver strategy, the NOMA principle is applied to\npush more content files to the content servers during a short time interval\nreserved for content pushing in on-peak hours and to provide more connectivity\nfor content delivery, compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple access\n(OMA) strategy. The push-and-deliver strategy is motivated by the fact that\nsome users' requests cannot be accommodated locally and the base station has to\nserve them directly. These events during the content delivery phase are\nexploited as opportunities for content pushing, which further facilitates the\nfrequent update of the files cached at the content servers. It is also shown\nthat this strategy can be straightforwardly extended to device-to-device\ncaching, and various analytical results are developed to illustrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed caching strategies compared to OMA based schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used for generating\nquantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime,\nwhere the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of\nions in the trap, giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous\nproposals for performing gates faster than this natural \"speed limit\" of the\ntrap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser\npulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along\ntrajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical\nphase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust\nto this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement\ngeneration for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single\noscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter\nthan the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits.\nThe method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields\na gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for\nexample, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are\npossible at the price of higher laser intensity. The method requires only a\nsingle amplitude-shaped pulse and one pair of beams derived from a\ncontinuous-wave laser, and offers the prospect of combining the unrivalled\ncoherence properties, operation fidelities and optical connectivity of\ntrapped-ion qubits with the sub-microsecond logic speeds usually associated\nwith solid state devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:19:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

We compare radial profiles of the mass fractions and the velocity\ndispersions of different sub-populations of stars according to their birth and\ncurrent locations. Results: Radial redistribution of stars is important in all\ngalaxies regardless of their light profiles. Type II breaks seem to be a\nconsequence of the combined effects of outward-moving and accreted stars. The\nformer produces shallower inner profiles (lack of stars in the inner disc) and\naccumulate material around the break radius and beyond, strengthening the\nbreak; the latter can weaken or even convert the break into a pure exponential.\nFurther accretion from satellites can concentrate material in the outermost\nparts, leading to type III breaks that can coexist with type II breaks, but\nsituated further out. Type III galaxies would be the result of an important\nradial redistribution of material throughout the entire disc, as well as a\nconcentration of accreted material in the outskirts. In addition, type III\ngalaxies display the most efficient radial redistribution and the largest\nnumber of accreted stars, followed by type I and II systems, suggesting that\ntype I galaxies may be an intermediate case between types II and III.

The solution method is quasi-Newton, but rather than approximating\nonly the Hessian or constraint Jacobian, the Jacobian of the entire nonlinear\nset of equations is approximated using a multisecant method. We show how\npreconditioning can be incorporated into the multisecant update in order to\nimprove the performance of the method. For nonconvex problems, we propose a\nsimple modification of the secant conditions to regularize the Hessian.\nNumerical experiments suggest that the algorithm is a promising alternative to\nconventional gradient-based algorithms, particularly when errors are present in\nthe data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 17:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

J0113 is likely buried in\na torus with a narrow ionization cone, but ionizing radiation is also leaking\nin other directions as revealed by our Gemini/GMOS 3D spectroscopy. The latter\nshows a bipolar outflow over $10$ kpc, with a peculiar velocity profile that is\nbest explained by AGN flickering. X-ray analysis of J1155 reveals a weakly\nabsorbed AGN that may ionize over a wide solid angle, consistent with our 3D\nspectra. Extinction corrected [OIII] log-luminosities are high, $\\sim43.6$. The\nvelocity dispersions are low, $\\sim100$--$150$ km s$^{-1}$, even at the AGN\npositions. We argue that this is a combination of high extinction hiding the\nturbulent gas, and previous outflows that have cleared the escape paths for\ntheir successors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 18:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Theoretical models frame\nexpectations regarding the rates and extent of this planetary accretion. For\ninstance, tidal interactions between planets and stars may drive complete\norbital decay during the main sequence. Many planets that survive their stars'\nmain sequence lifetime will still be engulfed when the host stars become red\ngiant stars. There is some observational evidence supporting these predictions,\nsuch as a dearth of close-in planets around fast stellar rotators, which is\nconsistent with tidal spin-up and planet accretion. There remains no clear\nchemical evidence for pollution of the atmospheres of main sequence or red\ngiant stars by planetary materials, but a wealth of evidence points to active\naccretion by white dwarfs. In this article, we review the current understanding\nof accretion of planetary material, from the pre- to the post-main sequence and\nbeyond.

Specifically, we analyze a scheme with $N>1$ independent\nthreads implementing each a stochastic gradient algorithm. The threads are\ncoupled via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive\nforces) in a similar manner to mathematical models of flocking, swarming and\nother group formations found in nature with mild communication requirements.\nWhen the objective function is convex, we show that a flocking-like approach\nfor distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction effect\nsimilar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the\naverage of $N$ gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of\nflocking makes it an appealing computational alternative. We show that when the\noverhead related to the time needed to gather $N$ samples and synchronization\nis not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized\nstochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at\neach step. When the objective function is not convex, the flocking-based\napproach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions due to the\nrepulsive force which enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of\ncandidate solutions.

We used loess and bootstrapped confidence\ninterval to subjectively identify the number and positions of potential\necological breakpoints in a bivariate relationship, and a piecewise linear\nregression model (PLRM) to quantitatively estimate the location of breakpoints\nand the associated precision. We also estimated breakpoint location and\nprecision using a piecewise linear quantile regression model (PQRM), which is\nfitted to the quantiles of the conditional distribution of the response\nvariable given the predictor and provides much richer information in terms of\nestimating relationships and breakpoints.

To illustrate the advantages of this approach we\nincorporate it into a variational autoencoder and apply the resulting model to\nthe task of generative few-shot learning. The intuition behind this\narchitecture is that the memory module can pick a relevant template from memory\nand the continuous part of the model can concentrate on modeling remaining\nvariations. We demonstrate empirically that our model is able to identify and\naccess the relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot\ncharacters in memory\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 01:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

In this paper, we introduce\nhybrid device-to-device (D2D) communications by integrating ambient\nbackscattering and wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D\ncommunications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is\nrequired. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and\nbackscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D\ncommunications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode\nselection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible\nadaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to\ncharacterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g.,\ndistribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient\ntransmitters, on the hybrid D2D communications performance.

(2016) to provide a full census of\nVLA-COSMOS radio sources. We identify 90% of such sources and sub-divide them\ninto AGN and star-forming galaxies on the basis of their radio luminosity. The\nAGN sample is COMPLETE with respect to radio selection at all z<3.5. Out of 704\nAGN, 272 have a counterpart in the Herschel maps. By exploiting the better\nstatistics of the new sample, we confirm the results of Magliocchetti et al.\n(2014): the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR\nwavelengths is both a function of radio luminosity and redshift, whereby\npowerful sources are more likely FIR emitters at earlier epochs. Such an\nemission is due to star-forming processes within the host galaxy. FIR emitters\nand non-FIR emitters only differentiate in the z<1 universe. At higher\nredshifts they are indistinguishable from each other, as there is no difference\nbetween FIR-emitting AGN and star-forming galaxies. Lastly, we focus on radio\nAGN which show AGN emission at other wavelengths. We find that MIR emission is\nmainly associated with ongoing star-formation and with sources which are\nsmaller, younger and more radio luminous than the average parent population.\nX-ray emitters instead preferentially appear in more massive and older\ngalaxies. We can therefore envisage an evolutionary track whereby the first\nphase of a radio-active AGN and of its host galaxy is associated with MIR\nemission, while at later stages the source becomes only active at radio\nwavelengths and possibly also in the X-ray.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 09:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

First, we\npropose a new model that captures how the presence of triangles in the\ndependence graph alters the manner in which failures transmit from affected\nsystems to others. Unlike existing models, the new model allows us to\napproximate the failure propagation dynamics using a multi-type branching\nprocess, even with triangles. Second, making use of the model, we provide a\nsimple condition that indicates how increasing clustering will affect the\nlikelihood that a random failure triggers a cascade of failures, which we call\nthe probability of cascading failures (PoCF). In particular, our condition\nreveals an intriguing observation that the influence of clustering on PoCF\ndepends on the vulnerability of comprising systems to an increasing number of\nfailed neighboring systems and the current PoCF, starting with different types\nof failed systems. Our numerical studies hint that increasing clustering\nimpedes cascading failures under both (truncated) power law and Poisson degree\ndistributions. Furthermore, our finding suggests that, as the degree\ndistribution becomes more concentrated around the mean degree with smaller\nvariance, increasing clustering will have greater impact on the PoCF. A\nnumerical investigation of networks with Poisson and power law degree\ndistributions reflects this finding and demonstrates that increasing clustering\nreduces the PoCF much faster under Poisson degree distributions in comparison\nto power law degree distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 13:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 18:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Mathematical\nmodeling can be used to investigate the mechanisms driving transmission during\nthis outbreak -- in particular, burial practices appear to have been major\nsource of infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a\nmulti-stage model of Ebola virus transmission linked to a game-theoretic model\nof population burial practice selection. We fit our model to cumulative\nincidence and mortality data from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from\nJanuary 2014 to March, 2016. The inclusion of behavior change substantially\nimproved best fit estimates and final size prediction compared to a reduced\nmodel with fixed burials. Best fit trajectories suggest that the majority of\nsanitary burial adoption occurred between July, 2014 and October, 2014.\nHowever, these simulations also indicated that continued sanitary burial\npractices waned following the resolution of the outbreak.\nConclusions/Significance: Surveillance data from the 2014 outbreak appears to\nhave a signal of changes in the dominant burial practices in all three\ncountries. Increased adoption of sanitary burials likely attenuated\ntransmission, but these changes occurred too late to prevent the explosive\ngrowth of the outbreak during its early phase. For future outbreaks, explicitly\nmodeling behavior change and collecting data on transmission-related behaviors\nmay improve intervention planning and outbreak response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 17:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

The average mass-loss rate during the creation of\nthe detected CSE is estimated through modelling, using the ALMA brightness\ndistribution and previously published single-dish measurements as observational\nconstraints. The ALMA observations are presented and compared to the results\nfrom a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) binary interaction model with\nthe same properties as the W Aql system and with two different orbital\neccentricities. Three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling is performed and\nthe response of the interferometer is modelled and discussed. The estimated\naverage mass-loss rate of W~Aql agrees with previous results. The size of the\nemitting region is consistent with photodissociation models. The CO(J=3-2)\nemission is dominated by a smooth component overlayed with two weak arc\npatterns with different separations. The larger pattern is predicted by the\nbinary interaction model with separations of 10\" and therefore likely due to\nthe known companion. It is consistent with a binary orbit with low\neccentricity. The smaller separation pattern is asymmetric and coincides with\nthe dust distribution, but the separation timescale (200 yrs) is not consistent\nwith any known process of the system. The separation of the known companions of\nthe system is large enough to not have a very strong effect on the\ncircumstellar morphology.

Specifically in recent years there has been considerable progress in\nthis area primarily due to the increased efficiency and accessibility of deep\nlearning techniques. In fact, for single-label object classification [i.e. only\none object present in the image] the state-of-the-art techniques employ deep\nneural networks and are reporting very close to human-like performance. There\nare specialized applications in which single-label object-level classification\nwill not suffice; for example in cases where the image contains multiple\nintertwined objects of different labels.\n  In this paper, we address the complex problem of multi-label pixelwise\nclassification. We present our distinct solution based on a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) for performing multi-label pixelwise classification and\nits application to large-scale urban reconstruction. A supervised learning\napproach is followed for training a 13-layer CNN using both LiDAR and satellite\nimages. An empirical study has been conducted to determine the hyperparameters\nwhich result in the optimal performance of the CNN. Scale invariance is\nintroduced by training the network on five different scales of the input and\nlabeled data. This results in six pixelwise classifications for each different\nscale. An SVM is then trained to map the six pixelwise classifications into a\nsingle-label. Lastly, we refine boundary pixel labels using graph-cuts for\nmaximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation with Markov Random Field (MRF) priors.\nThe resulting pixelwise classification is then used to accurately extract and\nreconstruct the buildings in large-scale urban areas.

Within the current observational\nlimits, however, no such massive planets have been detected. Here we propose a\nless stringent `lone-planet' scenario to account for the observed structure\nwith a single eccentric gas giant and suggest that clearing of these wide gaps\nis induced by its sweeping secular resonance. During the depletion of the disk\ngas, the planet's secular resonance propagates inward and clears a wide gap\nover an extended region of the disk. Although some residual intermediate-size\nplanetesimals may remain in the gap, their surface density is too low to either\nproduce super-Earths or lead to sufficiently frequent disruptive collisions to\ngenerate any observable dusty signatures. The main advantage of this\nlone-planet sweeping-secular-resonance model over the previous multiple gas\ngiant tidal truncation scenario is the relaxed requirement on the number of gas\ngiants. The observationally inferred upper mass limit can also be satisfied\nprovided the hypothetical planet has a significant eccentricity. A significant\nfraction of solar or more massive stars bear gas giant planets with significant\neccentricities.

Confirming previous work in the\nliterature, we test to see if the differences in observed spectra could result\nfrom different distributions of jet viewing angles, but find no evidence for\nthis. We conclude therefore that the jets in the two groups are physically\ndifferent in some way, and briefly discuss possible origins and further\npossible diagnostics. Finally we note that extrapolating to lower frequencies\nthe two subsets move closer together in the radio -- X-ray plane, and\napproximately merge into a single distribution at around 400 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 15:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The\npresent paper reviews the state-of-the-art in these fields. Computation of\nrovibrational states on a given potential energy surface (PES) has now become\nstandard for triatomic molecules, at least up to intermediate energies, due to\ndevelopments achieved by the present authors and others. However, highly\naccurate Born--Oppenheimer energies leading to highly accurate PESs are not\naccessible even for this two-electron system using conventional electronic\nstructure procedures e.g., configuration-interaction or coupled-cluster\ntechniques with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit). For this\npurpose highly specialized techniques must be used, e.g., those employing\nexplicitly correlated Gaussians and nonlinear parameter optimizations. It has\nalso become evident that a very dense grid of \\ai\\ points is required to obtain\nreliable representations of the computed points extending from the minimum to\nthe asymptotic limits. Furthermore, adiabatic, relativistic, and QED correction\nterms need to be considered to achieve near-spectroscopic accuracy during\ncalculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+. The remaining and most\nintractable problem is then the treatment of the effects of non-adiabatic\ncoupling on the rovibrational energies, which, in the worst cases, may lead to\ncorrections on the order of several \\cm. A promising way of handling this\ndifficulty is the further development of effective, motion- or even\ncoordinate-dependent, masses and mass surfaces. Finally, the unresolved\nchallenge of how to describe and elucidate the experimental pre-dissociation\nspectra of H$_3^+$ and its isotopologues is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 15:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

The\nscaling relation between the beating frequency and the self-propulsive force\ndeviates from theoretical predictions made previously on active filaments.\nHowever, this discrepancy is resolved by assuming that the attractive\ninteraction between the particles is mediated by the quadrupolar distribution\nof the induced charges, which gives indirect but convincing evidence on the\nmechanisms of the Janus particles. This signifies that the dependence between\nthe propulsion mechanism and the interaction mechanism, which had been\ndismissed previously, can modify dispersion relations of beating behaviors. In\naddition, hydrodynamic interaction within the chain and its effect on\npropulsion speed are discussed. These provide new insights on active filaments\nsuch as optimal flagellar design for biological functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 05:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 10:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

While there are common mathematical models\nfor neurons, which can be realized as nonlinear oscillating circuits, an\nelectrical representation of the synaptic coupling between those is more\nchallenging. Since this coupling strength depends on the learning procedure in\nthe past, it should include a kind of memory. We believe that memristive\ndevices, which are essentially nonlinear resistors with memory, are potential\ncandidates for replacing synapses in neuromorphic circuits. Due to a huge\nnumber of synapses in a complex neuromorphic circuit, pre-investigations based\non simulations of such systems can be very inefficient and time-consuming.\nFlexible and real-time capable memristive emulators, which can directly be\nincorporated into real circuits, can overcome this problem. In our approach, we\nintroduce a generic memristive emulator based on wave digital principles. The\nproposed emulator is flexible, robust, efficient, and it preserves the\npassivity of the real device. This, in turn, also makes it reusable independent\nof a particular application. In the presented work, the emulation of different\nmathematical models as well as of a real device based on physical models are\nlisted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Finally, a parallel neighbourhood search algorithm is applied to\ncreate the vehicle routes.
