One of the reasons for their effectiveness\nis their ability to capture relevant source-side contextual information at each\ntime-step prediction through an attention mechanism. However, the target-side\ncontext is solely based on the sequence model which, in practice, is prone to a\nrecency bias and lacks the ability to capture effectively non-sequential\ndependencies among words. To address this limitation, we propose a\ntarget-side-attentive residual recurrent network for decoding, where attention\nover previous words contributes directly to the prediction of the next word.\nThe residual learning facilitates the flow of information from the distant past\nand is able to emphasize any of the previously translated words, hence it gains\naccess to a wider context. The proposed model outperforms a neural MT baseline\nas well as a memory and self-attention network on three language pairs. The\nanalysis of the attention learned by the decoder confirms that it emphasizes a\nwider context, and that it captures syntactic-like structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 16:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 15:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 11:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 09:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

The tracking performance of the control system is\nrobust with respect to modeling uncertainties and computational errors in the\nloop. The main challenge of designing such a controller is that the power\ndissipation of program-workloads varies widely and often cannot be measured\naccurately; hence extant controllers are either ad hoc or based on a-priori\nmodeling characterizations of the processor and workloads. Our approach is\ndifferent. Leveraging the aforementioned robustness it uses a simple textbook\nmodeling framework, and adjusts its parameters in real time by a\nsystem-identification module. In this it trades modeling precision for fast\ncomputations in the loop making it suitable for on-line implementation in\ncommodity data-center processors. Consequently, the proposed controller is\nagnostic in the sense that it does not require any a-priori system\ncharacterizations. We present an implementation of the controller on Intel's\nfourth-generation microarchitecture, Haswell, and test it on a number of\nindustry benchmark programs which are used in scientific computing and\ndatacenter applications.

We show\nthat, even in the weak interaction regime, the coupling intensity limits the\nrange of weak values achievable, putting a threshold on the signal\namplification effect exploited in many weak measurement based experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 16:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Our method then produces a\n1-parameter family of circle-invariant complete G2-metrics on M that collapses\nto the original Calabi-Yau metric on the base B as the parameter converges to\n0. The G2-metrics we construct have controlled asymptotic geometry at infinity,\nso-called asymptotically locally conical (ALC) metrics, and are the natural\nhigher-dimensional analogues of the ALF metrics that are well known in\n4-dimensional hyperk\\\"ahler geometry. We give two illustrations of the strength\nof our method.

Our procedure will allow entanglement measurements in a\nwide variety of systems, including strongly interacting many body systems in\nboth equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

This has important implications for the activity\nand structure of massive stars near the end of their lives. Since previous work\nfocused on just a few events, here we expand to a larger sample of twenty\nwell-observed SNe II. For each event we are able to constrain the progenitor\nzero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass, explosion energy, and the mass and radial\nextent of dense CSM. We then study the distribution of each of these properties\nacross the full sample of SNe. The inferred ZAMS masses are found to be largely\nconsistent with a Salpeter distribution with minimum and maximum masses of 10.4\nand 22.9 Msun, respectively. We also compare the individual ZAMS masses we\nmeasure with specific SNe II that have pre-explosion imaging to check their\nconsistency. Our masses are generally comparable to or larger than the\npre-explosion imaging masses, potentially helping ease the red supergiant\nproblem. The explosion energies vary from (0.1-1.3)x10^51 erg, and for ~70% of\nthe SNe we obtain CSM masses in the range between 0.18-0.83 Msun.

Galaxy clusters assemble late, doubling their\nmasses since z~0.5, and so the outer regions of clusters should be replete with\ninfalling group-mass systems. We present an XMM-Newton survey to search for\nX-ray groups in the infall regions of 23 massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2,\nidentifying 39 X-ray groups that have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie\nat the cluster redshift. These groups have mass estimates in the range\n2x10^13-7x10^14Msun, and group-to-cluster mass ratios as low as 0.02. The\ncomoving number density of X-ray groups in the infall regions is ~25x higher\nthan that seen for isolated X-ray groups from the XXL survey. The average mass\nper cluster contained within these X-ray groups is 2.2x10^14Msun, or 19% of the\nmass within the primary cluster itself. We estimate that ~10^15Msun clusters\nincrease their masses by 16% between z=0.223 and the present day due to the\naccretion of groups with M200>10^13.2Msun. This represents about half of the\nexpected mass growth rate of clusters at these late epochs. The other half is\nlikely to come from smooth accretion of matter not bound in halos. The mass\nfunction of the infalling X-ray groups appears significantly top-heavy with\nrespect to that of field X-ray systems, consistent with expectations from\nnumerical simulations, and the basic consequences of collapsed massive dark\nmatter halos being biased tracers of the underlying large-scale density\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 18:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

More fundamentally, we\nidentify and characterize planetary shocks as an extra, hitherto ignored,\nsource of luminosity in transition disks.

A stronger shock heating rate by a factor 20\nwould be necessary to qualitatively reproduce the morphology of the second\ninfrared source. Instead, we find that the outer edge of the gap carved by the\nplanet heats up by about 50% relative to the initial reference temperature,\nwhich leads to an increase in the scale height. The bulge is illuminated by the\ncentral star, producing a lopsided feature in scattered light, as the outer gap\nedge shows an asymmetry in density and temperature attributable to a secondary\nspiral arm launched not from the Lindblad resonances but from the 2:1\nresonance.

Interestingly, on days with\nexcellent data coverage in the NIR--UV bands, the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) show signatures of bumps in the visible--UV bands, never seen before in\nthis source. The optical bump can be explained as accretion-disk emission\nassociated with the primary black hole of mass $\\sim \\rm 1.8 \\times10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$ while the little bump feature in the optical-UV appears consistent\nwith line emission. Further, the broadband SEDs extracted during the first\nflare and during a quiescent period during this span show very different\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra compared to previously observed flare or quiescent\nspectra. The probable thermal bump in the visible seems to have been clearly\npresent since May 2013, as found by examining all available NIR-optical\nobservations, and favors the binary super-massive black hole model. The\nsimultaneous multi-wavelength variability and relatively weak $\\gamma$-ray\nemission that shows a shift in the SED peak is consistent with $\\gamma$-ray\nemission originating from inverse Compton scattering of photons from the line\nemission that apparently contributes to the little blue bump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 19:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

Depending on the prices\nchosen, each seller observes a certain demand which is satisfied subject to the\nsupply constraint. The goal of the seller is to price her good dynamically so\nas to maximize her revenue. For the static market case, when the consumer\nutility satisfies the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) property, we\ngive a $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound on the maximum loss in revenue of a seller\nusing a modified version of the celebrated Online Gradient Descent Algorithm by\nZinkevich.

Here we show that the elasticity\nof a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible\nbiopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli.\nSpecifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil-water\ninterface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes the formation of a\nnematic phase riddled with $\\pm1/2$ topological defects, characteristic of a\ntwo-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the\ndefect morphology transitions from a U-shape into a V-shape, indicating the\nrelative increase of the material's bend over splay modulus. Furthermore,\nthrough the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can further\ncontrol the liquid crystal elasticity. We show how the material's bend constant\ncan be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and\npresent a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from\npurely optical observations.

This problem\nis exacerbated in the short, informal nature of many social media posts. To\nbypass this issue, a suite of special characters called \"emojis,\" which are\nsmall pictograms, are embedded within the text. Many emojis are small\ndepictions of facial expressions designed to help disambiguate the emotional\nmeaning of the text. However, a new ambiguity arises in the way that emojis are\nrendered.

Kepler has\nrevealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like\nKepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the\nhypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might\nreasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes.\nHowever, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature,\nmay erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they\nformed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary\nsystem's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring\nplanets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We\nderive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and\nprovide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet\nsystems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property\nthat their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We\nfind that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in\nentropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for\nsystems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is\nrobust against the possibility of missing planets too.

For the CPT-even classes ($k_{F}$ breaking tensor), when the photino\nis considered, the DRs display also a massive behaviour inversely proportional\nto a coefficient in the Lagrangian and to a term linearly dependent on $k_{F}$.\nAll DRs display an angular dependence and lack LoSy invariance. In describing\nour results, we also point out the following properties: i) the appearance of\ncomplex or simply imaginary frequencies and super-luminal speeds and ii) the\nemergence of bi-refringence. Finally, we point out the circumstances for which\nSuSy and LoSy breakings, possibly in presence of an external field, lead to the\nnon-conservation of the photon energy-momentum tensor. We do so for both CPT\nsectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 08:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

Characterizing the flow profiles through such layers\nis therefore critical towards understanding the function of such arrays in cell\nsignaling and molecular filtering. External filtering layers are also important\nto many animals and plants.

We make several notable observations: (i) On\nthe sphere, there is a critical disc radius such the number of discs parked is\nalways exactly four: the random parking is actually deterministic. We prove\nthis statement rigorously, and also show that random parking on the surface of\na $d$-dimensional sphere would have deterministic behaviour at the same\ncritical radius.

When the applied magnetic field $H$ is above a critical value $H_c$, a\nreentrance appears as a peak in the temperature dependent resistivity\n$\\rho_{xx}(T)$ at $T$ = $T_p$, similar to that observed in graphite where it\nwas attributed to local superconductivity. The $T_p(H)$ relationship follows a\npower-law dependence $T_p\\sim(H-H_c)^{1/v}$ where $v$ can be derived from the\ntemperature dependence of the zero-field resistivity $\\rho_0(T) \\sim T^v$.

In addition, users can also receive potential contacts of recruiters\nand senior positions for connection and networking opportunities. The high\nlevel implementation of the framework is described as follows: 1) Collect job\npostings data in the United States, 2) Extract meaningful tokens from the\npostings data using ETL pipelines, 3) Normalize the data set to link company\nnames to their specific company websites, 4) Extract and ranking the skill\nsets, 5) Link the company names and websites to their respective company level\nattributes with the EVERSTRING Company API, 6) Run user-specific search queries\non the database to identify relevant job postings and 7) Rank the job search\nresults.

The pulses are typically out of phase and\nwithout a clear pattern. These corals live in lagoons and bays found in the Red\nSea and Indian Ocean where they at times experience strong ambient flows. In\nthis paper, $3D$ fluid-structure interaction simulations are used to quantify\nthe effects of ambient flow on the exchange currents produced by the active\ncontraction of pulsing corals.

Developing\nan optimal control policy for DC cooling system is a challenging task. The\nprevailing approaches often rely on approximating system models that are built\nupon the knowledge of mechanical cooling, electrical and thermal management,\nwhich is difficult to design and may lead to sub-optimal or unstable\nperformances. In this paper, we propose utilizing the large amount of\nmonitoring data in DC to optimize the control policy. To do so, we cast the\ncooling control policy design into an energy cost minimization problem with\ntemperature constraints, and tap it into the emerging deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end cooling\ncontrol algorithm (CCA) that is based on the actor-critic framework and an\noff-policy offline version of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)\nalgorithm. In the proposed CCA, an evaluation network is trained to predict an\nenergy cost counter penalized by the cooling status of the DC room, and a\npolicy network is trained to predict optimized control settings when gave the\ncurrent load and weather information. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on\nthe EnergyPlus simulation platform and on a real data trace collected from the\nNational Super Computing Centre (NSCC) of Singapore. Our results show that the\nproposed CCA can achieve about 11% cooling cost saving on the simulation\nplatform compared with a manually configured baseline control algorithm. In the\ntrace-based study, we propose a de-underestimation validation mechanism as we\ncannot directly test the algorithm on a real DC.

Previous work on DNA models\nshowed that when evolution occurs under a heterogeneous process it is important\nto consider the property of model closure, because non-closed models can give\nbiased estimates of evolutionary processes. The existing codon models that\naccount for the genetic code are not closed; to establish this it is enough to\nshow that they are not linear (meaning that the sum of two codon rate matrices\nin the model is not a matrix in the model). This raises the concern that a\nsingle codon model fit to a heterogeneous process might mis-estimate both the\neffect of selection and branch lengths.\n  Codon models are typically constructed by choosing an underlying DNA model\n(e.g., HKY) that acts identically and independently at each codon position, and\nthen applying the genetic code via the parameter $\\omega$ to modify the rate of\ntransitions between codons that code for different amino acids. Here we use\nsimulation to investigate the accuracy of estimation of both the selection\nparameter $\\omega$ and branch lengths in cases where the underlying DNA process\nis heterogeneous but $\\omega$ is constant. We find that both $\\omega$ and\nbranch lengths can be mis-estimated in these scenarios. Errors in $\\omega$ were\nusually less than 2% but could be as high as 17%. We also assessed if choosing\ndifferent underlying DNA models had any affect on accuracy, in particular we\nassessed if using closed DNA models gave any advantage.

One of the approaches of this technique is based on the well-known\nradiography principle, by reconstructing the incident direction of the detected\nmuons after crossing the studied objects. In this case, muons detected after a\nprevious forward scattering on the object surface represent an irreducible\nbackground noise, leading to a bias on the measurement and consequently on the\nreconstruction of the object mean density. Therefore, a prior characterization\nof this effect represents valuable information to conveniently correct the\nobtained results.

As an example,\nthese simulations have been used to evaluate the impact of forward scattered\nmuons on two different applications of muon imaging: archaeology and\nvolcanology, revealing a significant impact on the latter case.

In reality, there often exist multiple human actions in a video\nstream. Such a video stream is often weakly-annotated with a set of relevant\nhuman action labels at a global level rather than assigning each label to a\nspecific video episode corresponding to a single action, which leads to a\nmulti-label learning problem. Furthermore, there are many meaningful human\nactions in reality but it would be extremely difficult to collect/annotate\nvideo clips regarding all of various human actions, which leads to a zero-shot\nlearning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that has\naddressed all the above issues together in human action recognition. In this\npaper, we formulate a real-world human action recognition task as a multi-label\nzero-shot learning problem and propose a framework to tackle this problem in a\nholistic way. Our framework holistically tackles the issue of unknown temporal\nboundaries between different actions for multi-label learning and exploits the\nside information regarding the semantic relationship between different human\nactions for knowledge transfer. Consequently, our framework leads to a joint\nlatent ranking embedding for multi-label zero-shot human action recognition. A\nnovel neural architecture of two component models and an alternate learning\nalgorithm are proposed to carry out the joint latent ranking embedding\nlearning. Thus, multi-label zero-shot recognition is done by measuring\nrelatedness scores of action labels to a test video clip in the joint latent\nvisual and semantic embedding spaces. We evaluate our framework with different\nsettings, including a novel data split scheme designed especially for\nevaluating multi-label zero-shot learning, on two datasets: Breakfast and\nCharades. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 08:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 08:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 12:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Popular and effective measures of importance of a node or a\nset of nodes are defined in terms of suitable entries of functions of matrices\n$f(A)$. These kinds of measures are particularly relevant as they are able to\ncapture the global structure of connections involving a node. However,\ncomputing the entries of $f(A)$ requires a significant computational effort. In\nthis work we address the problem of estimating the changes in the entries of\n$f(A)$ with respect to changes in the edge structure. Intuition suggests that,\nif the topology of connections in the new graph $\\tilde G$ is not significantly\ndistorted, relevant components in $G$ maintain their leading role in $\\tilde\nG$. We propose several bounds giving mathematical reasoning to such intuition\nand showing, in particular, that the magnitude of the variation of the entry\n$f(A)_{k\\ell}$ decays exponentially with the shortest-path distance in $G$ that\nseparates either $k$ or $\\ell$ from the set of nodes touched by the edges that\nare perturbed. Moreover, we propose a simple method that exploits the\ncomputation of $f(A)$ to simultaneously compute the all-pairs shortest-path\ndistances of $G$, with essentially no additional cost. As the nodes whose edge\nconnection tends to change more often or tends to be more often affected by\nnoise have marginal role in the graph and are distant from the most central\nnodes, the proposed bounds are particularly relevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 09:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 17:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 09:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Enhanced tensor models extend tensor models\nwith special scalings of their interactions which allow, in the same limit,\nthat the sub-dominant amplitudes to be \"enhanced\", that is to be as dominant as\nthe melonic ones. These models were introduced to explore new large $N$ limits\nand to probe different phases for tensor models. Tensor field theory is the\nquantum field theoretic counterpart of tensor models and enhanced tensor field\ntheory enlarges this theory space to accommodate enhanced tensor interactions.\nWe undertake the multi-scale renormalization analysis for two types of enhanced\nquartic melonic theories with rank $d$ tensor fields $\\phi: (U(1)^{D})^{d} \\to\n\\mathbb{C}$ and with interactions of the form $p^{2a}\\phi^4$ reminiscent of\nderivative couplings expressed in momentum space.

However, little is known\nabout that of the variable version LLL (variable-LLL) where events are\ngenerated by independent random variables, though this model of events is\napplicable to almost all applications of LLL. We introduce a necessary and\nsufficient criterion for variable-LLL, in terms of the probabilities of the\nevents and the event-variable graph specifying the dependency among the events.\nBased on this new criterion, we obtain boundaries for two families of\nevent-variable graphs, namely, cyclic and treelike bigraphs. These are the\nfirst two non-trivial cases where the variable-LLL boundary is fully\ndetermined. As a byproduct, we also provide a universal constructive method to\nfind a set of events whose union has the maximum probability, given the\nprobability vector and the event-variable graph. Though it is #P-hard in\ngeneral to determine variable-LLL boundaries, we can to some extent decide\nwhether a gap exists between a variable-LLL boundary and the corresponding\nabstract-LLL boundary. In particular, we show that the gap existence can be\ndecided without solving Shearer's conditions or checking our variable-LLL\ncriterion. Equipped with this powerful theorem, we show that there is no gap if\nthe base graph of the event-variable graph is a tree, while gap appears if the\nbase graph has an induced cycle of length at least 4. The problem is almost\ncompletely solved except when the base graph has only 3-cliques, in which case\nwe also get partial solutions.

Also for simplicity, the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform\nand turbulence is not taken into account. The perturbation equation is\nformulated to be an eigenvalue problem. The growth rate is obtained as a\nfunction of the wavenumber for fragmentation along the axis and the magnetic\nfield strength. The growth rate depends critically on the outer boundary. If\nthe displacement vanishes in the region very far from the cloud axis (fixed\nboundary), cloud fragmentation is suppressed by a moderate magnetic field,\nwhich means the plasma beta is below 1.67 on the cloud axis. If the\ndisplacement is constant along the magnetic field in the region very far from\nthe cloud, the cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is infinitely\nstrong. The cloud is deformed by circulation in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. The unstable mode is not likely to induce dynamical collapse,\nsince it is excited even when the whole cloud is magnetically subcritical.

Important information on the evolution of the jet can be obtained by\ncomparing the physical state of the plasma at its propagation through the\nbroad-line region (where the jet is most likely formed) into the intergalactic\nmedium, where it starts to significantly decelerate. Aims. We compare the\nconstraints on the physical parameters in the innermost ($\\leq$ pc) and outer\n($\\geq$ kpc) regions of the 3C 120 jet by means of a detailed multiwavelength\nanalysis and theoretical modeling of their broadband spectra. Methods.The data\ncollected by Fermi LAT, Swift and Chandra are analyzed together and the\nspectral energy distributions are modeled using a leptonic synchrotron and\ninverse Compton model, taking into account the seed photons originating inside\nand outside of the jet. The model parameters are estimated using the MCMC\nmethod. Results. The $\\gamma$-ray flux from the inner jet of 3C 120 was\ncharacterized by rapid variation from MJD 56900 to MJD 57300. Two strong flares\nwere observed on April 24, 2015 when, within 19.0 minutes and 3.15 hours the\nflux was as high as $(7.46\\pm1.56)\\times10^{-6}photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}$ and\n$(4.71\\pm0.92)\\times10^{-6}photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}$ respectively. The broadband\nemission in the quiet and flaring states can be described as SSC emission while\nIC scattering of dusty torus photons cannot be excluded for the flaring states.\nThe X-ray emission from the knots can be well reproduced by IC scattering of\nCMB photons only if the jet is highly relativistic (since even when $\\delta=10$\nstill $U_{\\rm e}/U_B\\geq80$). These extreme requirements can be somewhat\nsoftened assuming the X-rays are from the synchrotron emission of a second\npopulation of very-high-energy electrons. Conclusions. We found that the jet\npower estimated at two scales is consistent, suggesting that the jet does not\nsuffer severe dissipation, it simply becomes radiatively inefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 12:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

These eruptions are\noften associated with the acceleration of energetic electrons which produce\nvarious sources of high intensity plasma emission. In relatively rare cases,\nthe energetic electrons may also produce gyrosynchrotron emission from within\nthe CME itself, allowing for a diagnostic of the CME magnetic field strength.\nSuch a magnetic field diagnostic is important for evaluating the total magnetic\nenergy content of the CME, which is ultimately what drives the eruption. Here\nwe report on an unusually large source of gyrosynchrotron radiation in the form\nof a type IV radio burst associated with a CME occurring on 2014-September-01,\nobserved using instrumentation from the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio Astronomy Facility. A\ncombination of spectral flux density measurements from the Nan\\c{c}ay\ninstruments and the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) from 300MHz to 5 GHz\nreveals a gyrosynchrotron spectrum with a peak flux density at $>$1 GHz. Using\nthis radio analysis, a model for gyrosynchrotron radiation, a non-thermal\nelectron density diagnostic using the Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and\nimages of the eruption from the GOES Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), we are able to\ncalculate both the magnetic field strength and the properties of the X-ray and\nradio emitting energetic electrons within the CME.

In other words, one could say that a regular\nfunction is locally modelled by the set of polynomials. The theory of\nregularity structures due to Hairer generalizes this observation and provides\nan abstract setup, which in the application of singular SPDE extends the set of\npolynomials by functionals constructed from, e.g., white noise. In this\ncontext, the notion of Taylor polynomials is lifted to the notion of so-called\nmodelled distributions. The celebrated reconstruction theorem, which in turn\nwas inspired by Gubinelli's sewing lemma, is of paramount importance for the\ntheory.

Recent attempts to design such materials,\nvia e.g. micro-patterning of wavy fibres on soft substrates, polymer\nengineering at the molecular level or even kirigami techniques, provide\nappealing prospects but suffer drawbacks impacting the material viability:\ncomplexity of manufacturing, fatigue or failure upon cycling, restricted range\nof materials or biological incompatibility. Here, we report a universal\nstrategy to design highly stretchable, self-assembling and fatigue-resistant\nsynthetic fabrics. Our approach finds its inspiration in the mechanics of\nliving animal cells that routinely encounter and cope with extreme\ndeformations, e.g. with the engulfment of large intruders by macrophages,\nsqueezing and stretching of immune cells in tiny capillaries or\nshrinking/swelling of neurons upon osmotic stimuli. All these large instant\ndeformations are actually mediated and buffered by membrane reserves available\nin the form of microvilli, membrane folds or endomembrane that can be recruited\non demand. We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous\nliquid-infused tissues spontaneously forming surface reserves whose unfolding\nfuels any imposed shape change. Our process, relying only on geometry,\nelasticity and capillarity, allows to endow virtually any material with high\nstretchability and reversibility, making it straightforward to implement\nadditional mechanical, electrical or chemical functions.

In the low Lundquist number run, no oscillatory behavior is\nfound. In the moderate Lunquist number run, on the other hand, quasi-periodic\noscillations are excited both at the bottom of the flux rope and at the flare\nloop-top.

We answer this question by considering duplicity in\nthe thick-disc stellar population using a binary population-nucleosynthesis\nmodel.

We show that a few\nper cent of thick-disc stars can interact in binary star systems and become\nmore massive than $1.3{\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}}$. Of these stars, most are single\nbecause they are merged binaries. Some stars more massive than\n$1.3{\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}}$ form in binaries by wind mass transfer.

In a multi-attributed network, often, a\ncluster of nodes is only interesting for a subset (subspace) of attributes, and\nthis type of clusters is called subspace clusters. However, in the current\nliterature, few methods are capable of detecting subspace clusters, which\ninvolves concurrent feature selection and network cluster detection.

In this paper, we\naddress the notion of capacity with respect to Hopfield networks and propose a\ndynamic approach to monitoring a network's capacity. We define our\nunderstanding of capacity as the maximum number of stored patterns which can be\nretrieved when probed by the stored patterns. Prior work in this area has\npresented static expressions dependent on neuron count $N$, forcing network\ndesigners to assume worst-case input characteristics for bias and correlation\nwhen setting the capacity of the network. Instead, our model operates\nsimultaneously with the learning Hopfield network and concludes on a capacity\nestimate based on the patterns which were stored. By continuously updating the\ncrosstalk associated with the stored patterns, our model guards the network\nfrom overwriting its memory traces and exceeding its capacity. We simulate our\nmodel using artificially generated random patterns, which can be set to a\ndesired bias and correlation, and observe capacity estimates between 93% and\n97% accurate. As a result, our model doubles the memory efficiency of Hopfield\nnetworks in comparison to the static and worst-case capacity estimate while\nminimizing the risk of lost patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 01:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

To be more specific,\nthe proposed PPS divides the search process into two different stages,\nincluding the push and pull search stages. In the push stage, a multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is adopted to explore the search space without\nconsidering any constraints, which can help to get across infeasible regions\nvery fast and approach the unconstrained Pareto front. Furthermore, the\nlandscape of CMOPs with constraints can be probed and estimated in the push\nstage, which can be utilized to conduct the parameters setting for\nconstraint-handling approaches applied in the pull stage. Then, a constrained\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) equipped with an improved\nepsilon constraint-handling is applied to pull the infeasible individuals\nachieved in the push stage to the feasible and non-dominated regions. Compared\nwith other CMOEAs, the proposed PPS method can more efficiently get across\ninfeasible regions and converge to the feasible and non-dominated regions by\napplying push and pull search strategies at different stages. To evaluate the\nperformance regarding convergence and diversity, a set of benchmark CMOPs is\nused to test the proposed PPS and compare with other five CMOEAs, including\nMOEA/D-CDP, MOEA/D-SR, C-MOEA/D, MOEA/D-Epsilon and MOEA/D-IEpsilon.

During the last ten years the problem of the\norigin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many\nauthors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the\nproblem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second\npresents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded\non the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in\nthe third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum\norigin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two\nof which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and\nbiosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and\nexperimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main\nresearch themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a\nphysicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life\nwhile the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the\nessence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the\nInformation Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life\nthrough replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is\nfundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum\ncomputation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto\nreplicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence\nof quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve\nthe question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put\nforward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in\nthe origin of genetic language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 11:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}
