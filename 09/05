In the case of the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC, the luminosity\nis raised by increasing the number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions,\nso-called pile-up. This increases the expected yields of signal and background\nprocesses alike. The signal is embedded in a large background of processes that\nmimic that of signal events. It is therefore imperative for the experiments to\ndevelop new triggering methods to effectively distinguish the interesting\nevents from the background. We present a comparison of two methods for\nfiltering detector hits to be used for triggering on particle tracks: one based\non a pattern matching technique using Associative Memory (AM) chips and the\nother based on the Hough transform. Their efficiency and hit rejection are\nevaluated for proton-proton collisions with varying amounts of pile-up using a\nsimulation of a generic silicon tracking detector.

Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little\nafter birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at\nthe time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity\ndispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than\nthe importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would\nresult from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical\ngradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.\nSuch radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of\nthe parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular\nevolutionary processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 16:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 17:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Bottom-up growth of a solid inner core, the\ncrystallization regime for Earth's core, has been found to produce a long-lived\ndynamo leading to the suggestion that the Martian core remains entirely liquid\nto this day. Motivated by the experimentally-determined increase in the Fe-S\nliquidus temperature with decreasing pressure at Martian core conditions, we\ninvestigate whether Mars' core could crystallize from the top down. We focus on\nthe \"iron snow\" regime, where newly-formed solid consists of pure Fe and is\ntherefore heavier than the liquid.

The interaction suppresses quantum coherence and forces the system\ntowards a steady state. Such dissipative processes are captured by the\nparadigmatic spin-boson model, describing a two-state particle, the \"spin\",\ninteracting with an environment formed by harmonic oscillators. A fundamental\nquestion to date is to what extent intense coherent driving impacts a strongly\ndissipative system. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically a\nsuperconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment and\nsubjected to a coherent drive. This setup realizes the driven Ohmic spin-boson\nmodel. We show that the drive reinforces environmental suppression of quantum\ncoherence, and that a coherent-to-incoherent transition can be achieved by\ntuning the drive amplitude. An out-of-equilibrium detailed balance relation is\ndemonstrated. These results advance fundamental understanding of open quantum\nsystems and bear potential for the design of entangled light-matter states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 21:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

A similar\neffect is induced by the presence of generic, weak doping gradients. In\ncontrast to genuine magnetic fields in superconductors, the strain- and doping\ngradient-induced pseudo-magnetic fields couple in a way that preserves\ntime-reversal symmetry and is not subject to the screening associated with the\nMeissner effect.

If one applies the dAFF procedure to the QCD\nlight-front Hamiltonian, it leads to a color confining potential $\\kappa^4\n\\zeta^2$ for mesons, where $\\zeta^2$ is the LF radial variable conjugate to the\n$q \\bar q$ invariant mass squared.

When one generalizes\nthis procedure using superconformal algebra, the resulting light-front\neigensolutions provide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and\ntetraquarks, including remarkable supersymmetric relations between the masses\nof mesons and baryons and a universal Regge slope.

By\ngeneralization analysis via Rademacher complexity, the generalization error\nbound for the kernel classifier learned from hypothetical labeling is expressed\nas the sum of pairwise similarity between the data from different classes,\nparameterized by the weights of the kernel classifier.

Henning and Yeo\nin \\cite{hen} proved that if $G$ is a cubic graph different from the Heawood\ngraph, $\\gamma_{\\times 2, t}(G) \\leq \\frac{5}{6}n$, and this bound is sharp.\nSimilarly, a $k$-tuple dominating set is a subset $S$ of vertices of $G$, $V\n(G)$ such that $|N[v] \\cap S| \\geq k$ for every vertex $v$, where $N[v] =\n\\{v\\}\\cup \\{u \\in V(G) : uv \\in E(G)\\}$. The $k$-tuple domination number of\n$G$, denoted by $\\gamma_{\\times k}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a\n$k$-tuple dominating set of $G$.\n  In this paper, we give a simple approach to compute an upper bound for\n$(r-1)$-tuple total domination number of $r$-regular graphs. Also, we give an\nupper bound for the $r$-tuple dominating number of $r$-regular graphs. In\naddition, our method gives algorithms to compute dominating sets with the given\nbounds, while the previous methods are existential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 06:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 12:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

A widely used method for hypergraph partitioning\nrelies on minimizing a normalized sum of the costs of partitioning hyperedges\nacross clusters. Algorithmic solutions based on this approach assume that\ndifferent partitions of a hyperedge incur the same cost. However, this\nassumption fails to leverage the fact that different subsets of vertices within\nthe same hyperedge may have different structural importance. We hence propose a\nnew hypergraph clustering technique, termed inhomogeneous hypergraph\npartitioning, which assigns different costs to different hyperedge cuts.

To address this fundamental limitation,\nwe propose a sparse blending method that automatically selects a smaller number\nof deformation modes to compactly describe the desired deformation.

During the analysis the temporal dynamics of noise from\neach of the radar direction and for each flare is investigated separately. As a\nresult, on the basis of about 13000 daily measurements we found a strong\nanticorrelation between noise power and x-ray flare intensity, that allows to\nuse short-wave sky noise to diagnose the ionospheric effects of x-ray solar\nflares. It is shown that in 88.3\\% of cases an attenuation of daytime decameter\nradio noise is observed during solar flare, correlating with the temporal\ndynamics of the solar flare. The intensity of decameter noise anticorrelates\nwell (the Pearson correlation coefficient better than -0.5) with the shape of\nthe X-ray flare in the daytime (for solar elevation angle $>0$) in 33\\% of\ncases, the average Pearson correlation over the daytime is about -0.34. Median\nregression coefficient between GOES 0.1-0.8nm x-ray intensity and daytime\nsky-noise attenuation is about $-4.4\\cdot10^{4}\\ [dB\\cdot m^{2}/Wt]$. Thus, it\nhas been shown that measurements of the decameter sky noise level at\nmidlatitude decameter radars can be used to study the ionospheric absorption of\nhigh-frequency waves in the lower ionosphere during x-ray solar flares.

In this\npaper, we present a new approach for dense LiDAR mapping using probabilistic\nsurfel fusion.

The proposed surfel data association\nmethod considers surface resolution as well as high measurement uncertainty\nalong its beam direction which enables the mapping system to be able to control\nsurface resolution without introducing spatial digitization. The proposed\nfusion method successfully suppresses the map noise level by considering\nmeasurement noise caused by laser beam incident angle and depth distance in a\nBayesian filtering framework.

The sampling of the parameter set plays a crucial role in this\napproach.

Comparing the\noutcomes of our simulations to observations, we find that simulations remaining\nclose to virial balance throughout their history produce star formation\nefficiencies and initial mass function (IMF) peaks that are stable in time and\nin reasonable agreement with observations. Our results indicate that\nsmall-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide a\nfeedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency.

In the ICP approach, vehicles jointly localize\nnon-cooperative physical features (such as people, traffic lights or inactive\ncars) in the surrounding areas, and use them as common noisy reference points\nto refine their location estimates. Information on sensed features are fused\nthrough V2V links by a consensus procedure, nested within a message passing\nalgorithm, to enhance the vehicle localization accuracy. As positioning does\nnot rely on explicit ranging information between vehicles, the proposed ICP\nmethod is amenable to implementation with off-the-shelf vehicular communication\nhardware. The localization algorithm is validated in different traffic\nscenarios, including a crossroad area with heterogeneous conditions in terms of\nfeature density and V2V connectivity, as well as a real urban area by using\nSimulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) for traffic data generation. Performance\nresults show that the proposed ICP method can significantly improve the vehicle\nlocation accuracy compared to the stand-alone GNSS, especially in harsh\nenvironments, such as in urban canyons, where the GNSS signal is highly\ndegraded or denied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 08:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The aim of this paper is to understand in\ndetail the depletion (and desorption) of CO on (from) interstellar dust grains.\nExperimental simulations were performed under two different (astrophysically\nrelevant) conditions. In parallel, Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were used to\nmimic the experimental conditions. In our experiments, CO molecules accrete\nonto water ice at temperatures below 27 K, with a deposition rate that does not\ndepend on the substrate temperature. During the warm-up phase, the desorption\nprocesses do exhibit subtle differences indicating the presence of weakly bound\nCO molecules, therefore highlighting a low diffusion efficiency. IR\nmeasurements following the ice thickness during the TPD confirm that diffusion\noccurs at temperatures close to the desorption. Applied to astrophysical\nconditions, in a pre-stellar core, the binding energies of CO molecules,\nranging between 300 K and 850 K, depend on the conditions at which CO has been\ndeposited. Because of this wide range of binding energies, the depletion of CO\nas a function of AV is much less important than initially thought. The weakly\nbound molecules, easily released into the gas phase through evaporation, change\nthe balance between accretion and desorption, which result in a larger\nabundance of CO at high extinctions. In addition, weakly bound CO molecules are\nalso be more mobile, and this could increase the reactivity within interstellar\nices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 08:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Although novel methods are\ncontinuously introduced, little has been done to evaluate these methods\ntogether with large-scale query log analysis. Consequently, how far have these\nmethods brought us in answering real-user queries is unclear. Given baseline\nmethods that compute cross-media similarity using relatively simple text/image\nmatching, how much progress have advanced models made is also unclear. This\npaper takes a pragmatic approach to answering the two questions. Queries are\nautomatically categorized according to the proposed query visualness measure,\nand later connected to the evaluation of multiple cross-media similarity models\non three test sets. Such a connection reveals that the success of the\nstate-of-the-art is mainly attributed to their good performance on\nvisual-oriented queries, while these queries account for only a small part of\nreal-user queries. To quantify the current progress, we propose a simple\ntext2image method, representing a novel test query by a set of images selected\nfrom large-scale query log. Consequently, computing cross-media similarity\nbetween the test query and a given image boils down to comparing the visual\nsimilarity between the given image and the selected images.

With the idling\nmechanism, each node $i$, at each iteration $k$, is active -- updates its\nsolution estimate and exchanges messages with its network neighborhood -- with\nprobability $p_k$, and it stays idle with probability $1-p_k$, while the\nactivations are independent both across nodes and across iterations. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that the idling mechanism can be successfully\nincorporated in \\emph{distributed second order methods} also. Specifically, we\napply the idling mechanism to the recently proposed Distributed Quasi Newton\nmethod (DQN). We first show theoretically that, when $p_k$ grows to one across\niterations in a controlled manner, DQN with idling exhibits very similar\ntheoretical convergence and convergence rates properties as the standard DQN\nmethod, thus achieving the same order of convergence rate (R-linear) as the\nstandard DQN, but with significantly cheaper updates.

Nevertheless, the conventional deep RL methods have mainly focused\neither on experiential learning where the agent learns through interactions\nwith the environment from the start or on imitation learning that tries to\nmimic the teacher. Contrary to these, our proposed book learning shares key\ninformation among different agents in a book-like manner by delving into the\nfollowing two characteristic features: (1) By defining the linguistic function,\ninput states can be clustered semantically into a relatively small number of\ncore clusters, which are forwarded to other RL agents in a prescribed manner.\n(2) By defining state priorities and the contents for recording, core\nexperiences can be selected and stored in a small container. We call this\ncontainer as `BOOK'. Our method learns hundreds to thousand times faster than\nthe conventional methods by learning only a handful of core cluster\ninformation, which shows that deep RL agents can effectively learn through the\nshared knowledge from other agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 09:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 16:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 08:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

In modern datacenters, user network traffic requires a set of Virtual\nNetwork Functions (VNFs) as a service chain to process traffic demands. Traffic\nfluctuations in Large-scale DataCenters (LDCs) could result in overload and\nunderload phenomena in service chains. In this paper, we propose a distributed\napproach based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to jointly\nload balance the traffic and horizontally scale up and down VNFs in LDCs with\nminimum deployment and forwarding costs. Initially we formulate the targeted\noptimization problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which\nis NP-complete. Secondly, we relax it into two Linear Programming (LP) models\nto cope with over and underloaded service chains. In the case of small or\nmedium size datacenters, LP models could be run in a central fashion with a low\ntime complexity. However, in LDCs, increasing the number of LP variables\nresults in additional time consumption in the central algorithm. To mitigate\nthis, our study proposes a distributed approach based on ADMM.

With a widely growing adoption rate, SIP is an\napplication layer signaling protocol, standardized by the IETF, for creating,\nmodifying, and terminating VoIP sessions. Generally speaking, SIP routes a call\nrequest to its destination by using SIP proxies. With the increasing use of\nSIP, traditional configurations pose certain drawbacks, such as ineffective\nrouting, un-optimized management of proxy resources (including CPU and memory),\nand overload conditions. This paper presents OpenSIP to upgrade the SIP network\nframework with emerging technologies, such as SDN and NFV. SDN provides for\nmanagement that decouples the data and control planes along with a\nsoftware-based centralized control that results in effective routing and\nresource management. Moreover, NFV assists SDN by virtualizing various network\ndevices and functions. However, current SDN elements limit the inspected fields\nto layer 2-4 headers, whereas SIP routing information resides in the layer-7\nheader. A benefit of OpenSIP is that it enforces policies on SIP networking\nthat are agnostic to higher layers with the aid of a Deep Packet Inspection\n(DPI) engine. Among the benefits of OpenSIP is programmability, cost reduction,\nunified management, routing, as well as efficient load balancing. The present\nstudy implements OpenSIP on a real testbed which includes Open vSwitch and the\nFloodlight controller. The results show that the proposed architecture has a\nlow overhead and satisfactory performance and, in addition, can take advantage\nof a flexible scale-out design during application deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 10:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

We describe the design and first light observations from the $\\beta$\nPictoris b Ring (\"bRing\") project. The primary goal is to detect photometric\nvariability from the young star $\\beta$ Pictoris due to circumplanetary\nmaterial surrounding the directly imaged young extrasolar gas giant planet\n\\bpb. Methods. Over a nine month period centred on September 2017, the Hill\nsphere of the planet will cross in front of the star, providing a unique\nopportunity to directly probe the circumplanetary environment of a directly\nimaged planet through photometric and spectroscopic variations. We have built\nand installed the first of two bRing monitoring stations (one in South Africa\nand the other in Australia) that will measure the flux of $\\beta$ Pictoris,\nwith a photometric precision of $0.5\\%$ over 5 minutes. Each station uses two\nwide field cameras to cover the declination of the star at all elevations.\nDetection of photometric fluctuations will trigger spectroscopic observations\nwith large aperture telescopes in order to determine the gas and dust\ncomposition in a system at the end of the planet-forming era.

To prevent the untrusted relay from intercepting the source message,\nthe destination sends an intended jamming noise to the relay, which is referred\nto as destination-based cooperative jamming (DBCJ).

We propose both extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. The extrinsic\napproach is based on embedding the manifold into an Euclidean space of higher\ndimension. Models following this approach can be formulated within the\nEuclidean space with a constraint restricting them to the manifold. Then\nalternating direction methods of multipliers can be employed for finding\nminima. However, the components within the infimal convolution or total\ngeneralized variation decomposition live in the embedding space rather than on\nthe manifold which makes their interpretation difficult. Therefore we also\ninvestigate two intrinsic approaches. For manifolds which are Lie groups we\npropose three priors which exploit the group operation, an additive one,\nanother with IC coupling and a third TGV like one. For computing the minimizers\nof the intrinsic models we apply gradient descent algorithms. For general\nRiemannian manifolds we further define a model for infimal convolution based on\nthe recently developed second order differences.\n  We demonstrate by numerical examples that our approaches works well for the\ncircle, the 2-sphere, the rotation group, and the manifold of positive definite\nmatrices with the affine invariant metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 12:04:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 08:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 08:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

But that is not always\nthe case because there is no guarantee that two different models always have\ndifferent Hubble diagrams. It may be possible for two physically-inequivalent\nmodels to have the same Hubble diagrams. In that case, the Hubble diagram\ncannot be used to differentiate between two models and it is necessary to find\nanother way to distinguish between them. Therefore, the question of whether two\ndifferent scenarios are distinguishable by using the Hubble diagrams is an\nimportant question which would not have an obvious answer. The Jordan and\nEinstein frames of $f(R)$ theories of gravity are inequivalent, provided that\nthe metricity condition holds in both frames. In the present paper it is argued\nthat if the time-variation of particle masses in the Einstein frame is taken\ninto consideration, the Hubble diagram derived practically from type Ia\nsupernova surveys does not enable us to differentiate between these two frames.\nNevertheless, we show that by waiting long enough to measure the change in\nHubble diagram it is possible to differentiate between two frames. In other\nwords, the Hubble diagram cannot be employed alone to differentiate between two\nframes but comparison between the rates of changes in Hubble diagrams can\nprovide a way to do so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 12:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 09:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

In the meeting The Physics of Evolved Stars\nII: The role of Binarity (Nice, July 10-13, 2017) many talks and posters were\nconcentrated on the shaping of circumstellar matter, with some significant new\nresults, like the observations of wide jets launched from binary systems. In\nthe meeting The Impact of Binaries on Stellar Evolution (ESO Garching, July\n3-7, 2017), both in the opening and the summary talks the speakers mentioned\nthat \"Textbooks need most likely to be rewritten\". I made my point that some\nnew chapters were already written, although researchers do not read them but\nrather keep referring to the `old textbooks'. For example, too many speakers\nand authors keep referring only to the single degenerate and double degenerate\nscenarios for the progenitors of SNe Ia. Researchers must refer also to the\n`new textbook chapter' on the core degenerate (CD) scenario. Other examples\ninvolve the role of jets. Jets lead to a new evolutionary phase, that of the\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE), that should be considered alongside the older\nones, e.g., the common envelope evolution, Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and wind\nmass loss and accretion. I discuss how the GEE can solve some puzzling binary\nsystems. We should also consider the role of jets as an extra energy source to\nremove the common envelope and in powering intermediate luminosity optical\ntransients (ILOTs). One strong advantage of jets is that in many cases they\noperate through a negative feedback mechanism, hence preventing the need for a\nfine tuning. The operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) connects also\nbinary evolution to explosion of massive stars as core collapse supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 14:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

What formal flesh can we put on\nsuch malleable notion? We propose to frame the concept of resilience in the\nmathematical garbs of control theory under uncertainty. Our setting covers\ndynamical systems both in discrete or continuous time, deterministic or subject\nto uncertainties. Our definition of resilience extends others, be they \"a la\nHolling\" or rooted in viability theory. Indeed, we require that, after a shock,\nthe system returns to an acceptable \"regime\" , that is, that the state-control\npath as a whole must return to a set of acceptable paths (and not only the\nstate values must belong to an acceptable subset of the state set). More\ngenerally, as state and control paths are contingent on uncertainties, we\nrequire that their tails processes must lay within acceptable domains of\nstochastic processes.

We demonstrate that the coherent\ntune shifts due to reactive impedances can enhance the space-charge induced\ndamping and change the stability thresholds (here, a reactive impedance implies\nthe imaginary part of the impedance of both signs). For example, high damping\nrates at strong space-charge, or damping of the $k=0$ mode, can be possible. It\nis shown and explained, how the negative reactive impedances (causing negative\ncoherent tune shifts similarly to the effect of space-charge) can enhance the\nLandau damping, while the positive coherent tune shifts have an opposite\neffect. It is shown that the damping rate is a function of the coherent mode\nposition in the incoherent spectrum, in accordance with the concept of the\ninteraction of a collective mode with resonant particles.

These groups then fragment into individual\ncores. (ii) Non-magnetized filaments with high MpL are found to fragment\nexcessively, at odd with observations. This is resolved by taking into account\nthe magnetic field treated simply as additional pressure support). The present\ntheory suggests two complementary modes of star formation: while small\n(spherical or filamentary) structures will collapse directly into prestellar\ncores, according to the standard Hennebelle-Chabrier theory, the large\n(filamentary) ones, the dominant population according to observations, will\nfollow the afore-described two-step process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 15:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings.

Part 2 (our companion paper) then uses SANA\nto compare over a dozen objectives in terms of the biology they recover,\ndemonstrating that some objective functions recover useful biological\ninformation while others do not. We propose that further work should focus on\nimproving objective functions, with SANA the obvious choice as the search\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 15:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Finding non-trivial solutions to the Einstein field equations requires\nsome reduction of the problem, which usually is done by exploiting symmetries\nor other properties.

Swedish law enforcement officers were asked to\nregister a residential burglary using both methods in order to measure the\neffectiveness of each method. The effectiveness was quantified as both the time\nit took to register the crime as well as the number of relevant unique crime\nscene details that were collected. The results show the structured method to be\nsignificantly more efficient than traditional text-based crime reports (p <\n0.05). Also, the novel method registers 2.96 times more relevant and unique\ncrime scene details on average. In addition to the differences in efficiency\nthis work also discusses more qualitative pros and cons with the novel method,\nas well as various data analysis methods that could be used on the registered\ndata. It is concluded that the novel method can benefit law enforcement\nagencies in two ways. First, related to increased quality and more elaborate\ncrime reports. Secondly, related to significant time-savings, which according\nto a rough estimate is expect to lie in the range 11-30 full-time positions per\nyear for Swedish law enforcement agencies, particularly for volume crime\ncategories. Those resources could instead be used for unburden the workload for\nour law enforcement officers, and to some extent free resources that could be\nused in other parts of the organization.\n  Note: this pre-print manuscript is written in Swedish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 09:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Such a context initializes the function\nparameters and global variables to comply with function requirements. However\nit may be error-prone to write it by hand: the handwritten context might\ncontain bugs or not match the intended specification. A more robust approach is\nto specify the context in a dedicated specification language, and hold the\nanalysis tools to support it properly. This may mean to put significant\ndevelopment efforts for enhancing the tools, something that is often not\nfeasible if ever possible.\n  This paper presents a way to systematically generate such a context from a\nformal specification of a C function. This is applied to a subset of the ACSL\nspecification language in order to generate suitable contexts for the abstract\ninterpretation-based value analysis plug-ins of Frama-C, a framework for\nanalysis of code written in C. The idea here presented has been implemented in\na new Frama-C plug-in which is currently in use in an operational industrial\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 08:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

As a result, the lattice Maxwell system is shown to admit a discrete\nlocal energy-momentum conservation law corresponding to the discrete space-time\nsymmetry. These conservative properties make the discrete system an effective\nalgorithm for numerically solving the governing differential equations on\ncontinuous space-time. Moreover, the lattice model, respecting all conservation\nlaws and geometric structures, is as good as and probably more preferable than\nthe continuous Maxwell model.
