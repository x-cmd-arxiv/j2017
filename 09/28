Patients and Methods The shell predictive model was constructed using\npretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) images from 48 NSCLC patients\nreceived stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and 52 CC patients\nunderwent external beam radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy followed\nwith high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. A shell feature, consisting of\nouter voxels around the tumor boundary, was extracted from a series of axial\nPET slices. The hypothesis behind this feature is that non-invasive and\ninvasive tumors may have different morphologic patterns in the tumor periphery,\nin turn reflecting the differences in radiological presentations in the PET\nimages. The utility of the shell was evaluated by the support vector machine\n(SVM) classifier in comparison with intensity, geometry, gray level\nco-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture, neighborhood gray tone difference\nmatrix (NGTDM) based texture, and a combination of these four features. The\nresults were assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the\narea under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results For NSCLC, the AUC\nachieved by the shell feature was 0.82 while the highest AUC achieved by the\nother features was 0.76. Similarly, for CC, the AUC achieved by the shell\nfeature was 0.83 while the highest AUC achieved by the other features was 0.76.\nAlso, the difference in performance between shell and the other features was\nsignificant (P < 0.005) in all cases. Conclusions We propose a boundary-based\nshell feature that correlates with tumor metastasis. The shell feature showed\nbetter predictive performance than all the other features for distant failure\nprediction in both NSCLC and CC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

To address this\nproblem, previous works have proposed automatic retouching systems based on\nsupervised learning from paired training images acquired before and after\nmanual editing. As it is difficult for users to acquire paired images that\nreflect their retouching preferences, we present in this paper a deep learning\napproach that is instead trained on unpaired data, namely a set of photographs\nthat exhibits a retouching style the user likes, which is much easier to\ncollect. Our system is formulated using deep convolutional neural networks that\nlearn to apply different retouching operations on an input image. Network\ntraining with respect to various types of edits is enabled by modeling these\nretouching operations in a unified manner as resolution-independent\ndifferentiable filters. To apply the filters in a proper sequence and with\nsuitable parameters, we employ a deep reinforcement learning approach that\nlearns to make decisions on what action to take next, given the current state\nof the image. In contrast to many deep learning systems, ours provides users\nwith an understandable solution in the form of conventional retouching edits,\nrather than just a \"black-box\" result. Through quantitative comparisons and\nuser studies, we show that this technique generates retouching results\nconsistent with the provided photo set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 16:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

It is hard, however, to provide\nsecurity, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system.\nOn the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their\ntrade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be\nprotected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the\nentire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions\n(PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that\nenables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra\nbuilds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for\ncommunication, bidding, and trading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

In\nturn, existing theoretical models often reason about the response of optimal\nprices to changing market characteristics without exploiting all available\ninformation about the demand distribution. Our aim is to develop a theory for\nthe optimization and systematic comparison of prices between different\ninstances of the same market under various forms of knowledge about the\ncorresponding demand distributions. We revisit the classic problem of monopoly\npricing under demand uncertainty in a vertical market with an upstream supplier\nand multiple forms of downstream competition between arbitrary symmetric\nretailers. In all cases, demand uncertainty falls to the supplier who acts\nfirst and sets a uniform price before the retailers observe the realized demand\nand place their orders. Our main methodological contribution is that we express\nthe price elasticity of expected demand in terms of the mean residual demand\n(MRD) function of the demand distribution. This leads to a closed form\ncharacterization of the points of unitary elasticity that maximize the\nsupplier's profits and the derivation of a mild unimodality condition for the\nsupplier's objective function that generalizes the widely used increasing\ngeneralized failure rate (IGFR) condition. A direct implication is that optimal\nprices between different markets can be ordered if the markets can be\nstochastically ordered according to their MRD functions or equivalently, their\nelasticities. Using the above, we develop a systematic framework to compare\noptimal prices between different market instances via the rich theory of\nstochastic orders. This leads to comparative statics that challenge previously\nestablished economic insights about the effects of market size, demand\ntransformations and demand variability on monopolistic prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:49:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 13:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 11:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:30:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 11:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 14:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

Using a combination of techniques, we carry out an\nextensive and systematic study of the hydrodynamical, thermodynamical, and\ngeometrical properties of the matter ejected dynamically, employing the WinNet\nnuclear-reaction network to recover the relative abundances of heavy elements\nproduced by each configurations.

The location and evolution of\nthis obscuring material have been the subject of intense research in the past\ndecades, and are still highly debated. A decrease in the covering factor of the\ncircumnuclear material with increasing accretion rates has been found by\nstudies carried out across the electromagnetic spectrum. The origin of this\ntrend has been suggested to be driven either by the increase in the inner\nradius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity due to the\nsublimation of dust; by the gravitational potential of the black hole; by\nradiative feedback; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows. However,\nthe lack of a large, unbiased and complete sample of accreting black holes,\nwith reliable information on gas column density, luminosity and mass, has left\nthe main physical mechanism regulating obscuration unclear. Using a systematic\nmulti-wavelength survey of hard X-ray-selected black holes, here we show that\nradiation pressure on dusty gas is indeed the main physical mechanism\nregulating the distribution of the circumnuclear material. Our results imply\nthat the bulk of the obscuring dust and gas in these objects is located within\nthe sphere of influence of the black hole (i.e., a few to tens of parsecs), and\nthat it can be swept away even at low radiative output rates. The main physical\ndriver of the differences between obscured and unobscured accreting black holes\nis therefore their mass-normalized accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 17:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Typically, a clustering method is used that requires\ncalculation of similarities between each possible record pair. However, the\ntotal number of pairs grows quadratically with the size of the author database\nmaking such clustering difficult for millions of records. One remedy for this\nis a blocking function that reduces the number of pairwise similarity\ncalculations. Here, we introduce a new way of learning blocking schemes by\nusing a conjunctive normal form (CNF) in contrast to the disjunctive normal\nform (DNF). We demonstrate on PubMed author records that CNF blocking reduces\nmore pairs while preserving high pairs completeness compared to the previous\nmethods that use a DNF with the computation time significantly reduced. Thus,\nthese concepts in scholarly data can be better represented with CNFs. Moreover,\nwe also show how to ensure that the method produces disjoint blocks so that the\nrest of the AND algorithm can be easily paralleled. Our CNF blocking tested on\nthe entire PubMed database of 80 million author mentions efficiently removes\n82.17% of all author record pairs in 10 minutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 17:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

We provide an instructive example of a quasi-periodic\noscillation in NuSTAR and show that applying standard periodogram statistics\nleads to underestimated tail probabilities for period detection.

In the present work, however, we consider systems\nwith a finite density of either fractons or their dipolar bound states, with a\nfocus on the $U(1)$ fracton models. We study some of the phases in which\nemergent fractonic matter can exist, thereby initiating the study of the\n\"condensed matter\" of fractons. We begin by considering a system with a finite\ndensity of fractons, which we show can exhibit microemulsion physics, in which\nfractons form small-scale clusters emulsed in a phase dominated by long-range\nrepulsion. We then move on to study systems with a finite density of mobile\ndipoles, which have phases analogous to many conventional condensed matter\nphases. We focus on two major examples: Fermi liquids and quantum Hall phases.\nA finite density of fermionic dipoles will form a Fermi surface and enter a\nFermi liquid phase. Interestingly, this dipolar Fermi liquid exhibits a\nfinite-temperature phase transition, corresponding to an unbinding transition\nof fractons.

Assumptions about how the foregrounds scale with\nfrequency are therefore crucial to interpreting the data. Recent results from\nthe Planck satellite collaboration claim significant evidence for a\ndecorrelation in the polarization signal of the spatial pattern of galactic\ndust between 353 GHz and 217 GHz. Such a decorrelation would suppress power in\nthe cross spectrum between high frequency maps, where the dust is strong, and\nlower frequency maps, where the sensitivity to cosmological $B$-modes is\nstrongest. Alternatively, it would leave residuals in lower frequency maps\ncleaned with a template derived from the higher frequency maps. If not\naccounted for, both situations would result in an underestimate of the dust\ncontribution and thus an upward bias on measurements of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, $r$. In this paper we revisit this measurement and find that the\nno-decorrelation hypothesis cannot be excluded with the Planck data. There are\nthree main reasons for this: i) there is significant noise bias in cross\nspectra between Planck data splits that needs to be accounted for; ii) there is\nstrong evidence for unknown instrumental systematics whose amplitude we\nestimate using alternative Planck data splits; iii) there are significant\ncorrelations between measurements in different sky patches that need to be\ntaken into account when assessing the statistical significance.

The one is the\nmanifestly gauge-invariant mechanical OAM, while the other is the so-called\ngauge-invariant canonical (g.i.c.) OAM, the concept of which was introduced by\nChen et al. To get a deep insight into the difference of these two\ndecompositions, it is therefore vitally important to understand the the\nphysical meanings of the above two OAMs correctly. Also to be clarified is the\nimplication of the gauge symmetry that is immanent in the concept of g.i.c.\nOAM. We find that the famous Landau problem provides us with an ideal tool to\nanswer these questions owing to its analytically solvable nature. After\nderiving a complete relation between the standard eigen-functions of the Landau\nHamiltonian in the Landau gauge and in the symmetric gauge, we try to unravel\nthe physics of the the canonical OAM and the mechanical OAM, by paying special\nattention to their gauge-dependence.

Also briefly discussed is the uniqueness or non-uniqueness problem of\nthe nucleon spin decomposition, which arises from the arbitrariness in the\ndefinition of the so-called physical component of the gauge field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 00:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 10:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

It decomposes the\noriginal search space into L subregions and executes L parallel processes\nsearching in these subregions simultaneously. Inside each subregion, the PPLS/D\nprocess is guided by a unique scalar objective function. PPLS/D differs from\nthe well-known Two Phase Pareto Local Search (2PPLS) in that it uses the scalar\nobjective function to guide every move of the PLS procedure in a fine-grained\nmanner. In the experimental studies, PPLS/D is compared against the basic PLS\nand a recently proposed PLS variant on the multiobjective Unconstrained Binary\nQuadratic Programming problems (mUBQPs) and the multiobjective Traveling\nSalesman Problems (mTSPs) with at most four objectives.

They fit generative models by minimizing\ncertain distance measure between the real image distribution and the generated\ndata distribution. Several distance measures have been used, such as\nJensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-divergence, and Wasserstein distance, and\nchoosing an appropriate distance measure is very important for training the\ngenerative network. In this paper, we choose to use the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) as the distance metric, which has several nice theoretical\nguarantees. In fact, generative moment matching network (GMMN) (Li, Swersky,\nand Zemel 2015) is such a generative model which contains only one generator\nnetwork $G$ trained by directly minimizing MMD between the real and generated\ndistributions. However, it fails to generate meaningful samples on challenging\nbenchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and LSUN. To improve on GMMN, we propose\nto add an extra network $F$, called mapper. $F$ maps both real data\ndistribution and generated data distribution from the original data space to a\nfeature representation space $\\mathcal{R}$, and it is trained to maximize MMD\nbetween the two mapped distributions in $\\mathcal{R}$, while the generator $G$\ntries to minimize the MMD. We call the new model generative adversarial mapping\nnetworks (GAMNs). We demonstrate that the adversarial mapper $F$ can help $G$\nto better capture the underlying data distribution. We also show that GAMN\nsignificantly outperforms GMMN, and is also superior to or comparable with\nother state-of-the-art GAN based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Bedrooms\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 06:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

We studied\nthe structures and electronic spectra of two periodic GBs in graphene on highly\noriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy\nand spectroscopy (STM/S). Our results demonstrated that a GB consisting of dual\nparallel periodic dislocation cores of pentagonal-heptagonal (5-7) carbon rings\ngives rise to an enhanced localized state at 0.45 eV above the Dirac point in\ngraphene surfaces, which is attributed to van Hove singularities (VHSs).\nMoreover, the energy positions of the localized states are varied between 0.40\nand 0.47 eV depending on the site and eventually decayed to 0.36 eV. The\nvariation of the energy positions is induced by two parallel GBs because of the\nhigher electron density at the GB as a defect center and the lower electron\naway from the GB. Another periodic GB with a symmetric zigzag structural\nfeature induced VHSs at -0.038 and 0.12 eV near the Fermi level. Moreover,\nintervalley scattering was observed on both these GBs. This means that carrier\nconcentration and thus, the conductance around the periodic GBs can be\nsignificantly enhanced by localized density of states.

We then build predictive threshold-based portfolios\n(TBPs) that are subsets of the universe satisfying given threshold criteria for\nthe predicted returns. The TBPs are rebalanced monthly to restore equal weights\nto each security within the TBPs.

This shows the availability of TBPs in\ntargeting specific risk-return levels, and an EWP based on all the assets plays\na role in the reference portfolio of TBPs.

Graphene and its heterostructures have attracted particular\nattention because the absence of an energy gap allows for plasmon polaritons to\nbe continuously tuned. Here, we introduce black phosphorus (BP) as a promising\nnew material in surface polaritonics that features key advantages for ultrafast\nswitching. Unlike graphene, BP is a van der Waals bonded semiconductor, which\nenables high-contrast interband excitation of electron-hole pairs by ultrashort\nnear-infrared (near-IR) pulses. We design a SiO$_2$/BP/SiO$_2$ heterostructure\nin which the surface phonon modes of the SiO$_2$ layers hybridize with surface\nplasmon modes in BP that can be activated by photo-induced interband\nexcitation. Within the Reststrahlen band of SiO$_2$, the hybrid interface\npolariton assumes surface-phonon-like properties, with a well-defined frequency\nand momentum and excellent coherence. During the lifetime of the photogenerated\nelectron-hole plasma, coherent polariton waves can be launched by a broadband\nmid-IR pulse coupled to the tip of a scattering-type scanning near-field\noptical microscopy (s-SNOM) setup. The scattered radiation allows us to trace\nthe new hybrid mode in time, energy, and space. We find that the surface mode\ncan be activated within ~50 fs and disappears within 5 ps, as the electron-hole\npairs in BP recombine. The excellent switching contrast and switching speed,\nthe coherence properties, and the constant wavelength of this transient mode\nmake it a promising candidate for ultrafast nanophotonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 08:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

Large-scale, multi-institution\nclinical studies are the typical examples of such datasets. These sets make\npossible the search for multi-parametric relations since from the plenty of the\ndata one is likely to find a satisfying number of subjects with the required\nparameter ensembles. Specifically, finding combinatorial biomarkers for some\ngiven condition also needs a very large dataset to analyze. For this goal,\nstatistical regression analysis is not the preferred tool of choice, since (i)\nthe {\\em a priori} knowledge of the parameter-sets to analyze is missing, and\n(ii) typically relatively few subjects have the interesting parameter-value\nensembles for the analysis. For fast and automatic multi-parametric relation\ndiscovery association-rule finding tools are used for more than two decades in\nthe data-mining community. Here we present the SCARF webserver for {\\em\ngeneralized} association rule mining. Association rules are of the form: $a$\nAND $b$ AND ... AND $x \\rightarrow y$, meaning that the presence of properties\n$a$ AND $b$ AND ...

This feature also helps reducing the\ntypically very large result-tables of such studies, since allowing ORs in the\nleft-hand side of a single rule could include dozens of classical rules.

During the disk transit of seven days, the AR launched four sequential\nfast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with long duration M-class\nflares. Morphological study delineates a pre-eruptive coronal sigmoid structure\nabove the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study. Velocity\nfield derived from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and\nconverging motions of polarity regions about the PIL. While these shear motions\ncontinue, the crossed arms of two sigmoid elbows are being brought to\ninteraction by converging motions at the middle of PIL, initiating\ntether-cutting reconnection of field lines and the onset of CME explosion. The\nsuccessive CMEs are explained by a cyclic process of magnetic energy storage\nand release terming \"sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid\" transformation driven by\nphotospheric flux motions. Further, the continued shear motions inject helicity\nflux of dominant negative sign, which contributes to core field twist and its\nenergy by building a twisted flux rope (FR). After a limiting value, the excess\ncoronal helicity is expelled by bodily ejection of the FR initiated by some\ninstability as realized by intermittent CMEs.

However, there are two major\ncorrections I will make in this paper, the first is on the proof of the\nParisi-Sourlas mechanism and the second is on the effective action for the\n'gluons', which leads to a direct proof of gluons being confined inside\nhadrons. The correction also leads to how the mass gap will be calculated,\nwhich was explicitly done in 2D.\n  The starting point is that contrary to the prevailing ideas in the\nliterature, the Coulomb gauge is an incomplete gauge-fixing condition in the\nsense that there are field configurations that cannot be gauge transformed to\nthe Coulomb gauge. In other words the orbit of these configurations will not\nintersect the Coulomb gauge surface. I proposed the non-linear gauge condition\nprecisely because it includes the Coulomb gauge in the high energy (short\ndistance) regime and the quadratic regime (the large distance regime where the\nrunning coupling becomes large), where the gauge fields cannot be gauge\ntransformed to the Coulomb surface. We proposed a new decomposition of the\ngauge potential in the non-linear regime, which involves an isoscalar (the\ndivergence of the gauge field) and a new vector field, which exhibits a mass\ngap and confinement. When we add the quarks, we find that they are localized to\na given distance scale and has an effective four-Fermi action with a linear\npotential. Thus, we have shown a mass gap for gluons and confinement for both\ndynamical quarks and gluons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 10:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

However, some classes can be more difficult to\ndistinguish than others, and classes may be organized in a hierarchy of\ncategories. At the same time, a CNN is designed to learn internal\nrepresentations that abstract from the input data based on its hierarchical\nlayered structure. So it is natural to ask if an inverse of this idea can be\napplied to learn a model that can predict over a classification hierarchy using\nmultiple output layers in decreasing order of class abstraction. In this paper,\nwe introduce a variant of the traditional CNN model named the Branch\nConvolutional Neural Network (B-CNN). A B-CNN model outputs multiple\npredictions ordered from coarse to fine along the concatenated convolutional\nlayers corresponding to the hierarchical structure of the target classes, which\ncan be regarded as a form of prior knowledge on the output. To learn with\nB-CNNs a novel training strategy, named the Branch Training strategy\n(BT-strategy), is introduced which balances the strictness of the prior with\nthe freedom to adjust parameters on the output layers to minimize the loss. In\nthis way we show that CNN based models can be forced to learn successively\ncoarse to fine concepts in the internal layers at the output stage, and that\nhierarchical prior knowledge can be adopted to boost CNN models' classification\nperformance.

An interplay of relativistic effects is\nresponsible for the modulation of the observed light curves: Doppler boosting,\ngravitational redshift, light focusing, and light-travel time delays. We find\nthe flare properties to be in agreement with the simulations (our ray-tracing\ncode sim5lib). The inferred mass for each of the flares comes out in agreement\nwith previous estimates based on orbits of stars; the latter have been observed\nat radii and over time-scales two orders of magnitude larger than those typical\nfor the X-ray flares, so the two methods are genuinely different.

Therefore, in this paper we investigate the $q$-deformed\nWheeler-DeWitt equation of a spatially closed homogeneous and isotropic\nUniverse in the presence of a conformally coupled scalar field. Specifically,\nthe quantum deformed Universe is a quantized minisuperspace model constructed\nfrom quantum Heisenberg-Weyl $\\mathcal U_q(h_4)$ and $\\mathcal U_q(su(1, 1))$\ngroups. These intrinsic mathematical features allow to establish that ($i$) the\nscale factor, the scalar field and corresponding momenta are quantized and\n($ii$) the phase space has a non-equidistance lattice structure. On the other\nhand, such quantum group structure provides us a new framework to discuss the\ncosmological constant problem. Subsequently, we show that a ultraviolet cutoff\ncan be obtained at $10^{-3} eV$, i.e., at a scale much larger than the expected\nPlanck scale. In addition, an infrared cutoff, at the size of the observed\nUniverse, emerges from within such quantum deformation of Universe. In other\nwords, the spectrum of the scale factor is upper bounded. Moreover, we show\nthat the emerged cosmological horizon is a quantum sphere $S^2_q$ or,\nalternatively, a fuzzy sphere $S^2_F$ which explicitly exhibits features of the\nholographic principle. The corresponding number of fundamental cells equals the\ndimension of the Hilbert space and hence, the cosmological constant can be\npresented as a consequence of the quantum deformation of the FLRW\nminisuperspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 12:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

For large spatial or temporal\nregions, however, the model leads to an intractable likelihood. An increasingly\ncommon method for dealing with large spatio-temporal models is by using Laplace\napproximations (LA). This method is convenient as it can easily be applied and\nis quickly implemented. However, as we will demonstrate in this manuscript,\nwhen applied to self-exciting Poisson spatial-temporal models, Laplace\nApproximations result in a significant bias in estimating some parameters. Due\nto this bias, we propose using up to sixth-order corrections to the LA for\nfitting these models. We will demonstrate how to do this in a Bayesian setting\nfor Self-Exciting Spatio-Temporal models. We will further show there is a\nlimited parameter space where the extended LA method still has bias.

The sources used in the corresponding experiments are\nnonlinear crystals pumped by laser light.

Gaps in debris disks\nmay indicate a planet physically present within the gap, but such gaps can also\noccur away from the planet's orbit at mean-motion resonances (MMRs), and this\nis the focus of our interest here. We extend our study of planet-disk\ninteraction through MMRs, presented in an earlier paper, to systems in which\nthe perturbing planet has moderate orbital eccentricity, a common occurrence in\nexoplanetary systems. In particular, a new result is that the 3:1 MMR becomes\ndistinct at higher eccentricity, while its effects are absent for circular\nplanetary orbits.

Our earlier work shows that even a 1\nEarth mass planet can theoretically open an MMR gap; however, given the narrow\ngap that can be opened by a low-mass planet, its observability would be\nquestionable. We find that the widths, locations, and shapes of two prominent\nstructures, the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, could be used to determine the mass,\nsemimajor axis, and eccentricity of the planetary perturber and present an\nalgorithm for doing so. These MMR structures can be used to narrow the position\nand even determine the planetary properties (such as mass) of any inferred but\nas-yet-unseen planets within a debris disk.

Thermal instability in the post-shock region, triggered by efficient\ncooling process at the base, is believed to be the primary reason behind the\ntemporal variability. Here we study the structure and the dynamical properties\nof the post-shock accretion column including the effects of bremsstrahlung and\ncyclotron radiation. We find that the presence of significant cyclotron\nemission in optical band reduces the overall variability of the post-shock\nregion. In the case of a larger post-shock region above the stellar surface,\nthe effects of stratification due to stellar gravity becomes important. An\naccretion column, influenced by the strong gravity, has a smaller variability\nas the strength of the thermal instability at the base of the column is\nreduced. On the other hand, the cool, dense plasma, accumulated just above the\nstellar surface, may enhance the post-shock variability due to the propagation\nof magnetic perturbations. These characteristics of the post-shock region are\nconsistent with the observed properties of V834~Cen and in general with\nCataclysmic Variable sources that exhibit QPO frequency of about a Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 14:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

When an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is present, e.g.,\nthrough the center of the ring domain, persistent currents, i.e., permanent\ncurrents without dissipation, can arise. In real materials, impurities and\ndefects are inevitable, raising the issue of robustness of the persistent\ncurrents. Using localized random potential to simulate the disorders, we\ninvestigate how the ensemble averaged current magnitude varies with the\ndisorder density. For comparison, we study the nonrelativistic quantum\ncounterpart by analyzing the solutions of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation under\nthe same geometrical and disorder settings. We find that, for the Dirac ring\nsystem, as the disorder density is systematically increased, the average\ncurrent decreases slowly initially and then plateaus at a finite nonzero value,\nindicating remarkable robustness of the persistent currents. The physical\nmechanism responsible for the robustness is the emergence of a class of\nboundary states - whispering gallery modes. In contrast, in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nring system, such boundary states cannot form and the currents diminish rapidly\nto zero with increase in the disorder density. We develop a physical theory\nbased on a quasi one-dimensional approximation to understand the striking\ncontrast in the behaviors of the persistent currents in the Dirac and\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger rings.

A natural next step is to study the set of\nparameter values where the Jacobian matrix drops in rank, which we refer to as\nthe locus of non-identifiable parameter values, or, for short, the singular\nlocus.

However, the existing literature only\nhighlights optimized bifacial PV for a few geographic locations or develops\nworldwide performance maps for very specific configurations, such as the\nvertical installation. It is still difficult to translate these location- and\nconfiguration-specific conclusions to a general optimized performance of this\ntechnology. In this paper, we present a global study and optimization of\nbifacial solar modules using a rigorous and comprehensive modeling framework.\nOur results demonstrate that with a low albedo of 0.25, the bifacial gain of\nground-mounted bifacial modules is less than 10% worldwide. However, increasing\nthe albedo to 0.5 and elevating modules 1 m above the ground can boost the\nbifacial gain to 30%. Moreover, we derive a set of empirical design rules,\nwhich optimize bifacial solar modules across the world, that provide the\ngroundwork for rapid assessment of the location-specific performance. We find\nthat ground-mounted, vertical, east-west-facing bifacial modules will\noutperform their south-north-facing, optimally tilted counterparts by up to 15%\nbelow the latitude of 30 degrees, for an albedo of 0.5.

In WSNs, CS based techniques are well motivated by not only the sparsity\nprior observed in different forms but also by the requirement of efficient\nin-network processing in terms of transmit power and communication bandwidth\neven with nonsparse signals. In order to apply CS in a variety of WSN\napplications efficiently, there are several factors to be considered beyond the\nstandard CS framework. We start the discussion with a brief introduction to the\ntheory of CS and then describe the motivational factors behind the potential\nuse of CS in WSN applications. Then, we identify three main areas along which\nthe standard CS framework is extended so that CS can be efficiently applied to\nsolve a variety of problems specific to WSNs. In particular, we emphasize on\nthe significance of extending the CS framework to (i). take communication\nconstraints into account while designing projection matrices and reconstruction\nalgorithms for signal reconstruction in centralized as well in decentralized\nsettings, (ii) solve a variety of inference problems such as detection,\nclassification and parameter estimation, with compressed data without signal\nreconstruction and (iii) take practical communication aspects such as\nmeasurement quantization, physical layer secrecy constraints, and imperfect\nchannel conditions into account. Finally, open research issues and challenges\nare discussed in order to provide perspectives for future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 03:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 23:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}
