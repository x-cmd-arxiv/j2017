Usually this approach is considered for photons and gravitons\nseparately. We develop the emergent electrogravity theory consisting of the\nordinary QED and the tensor field gravity model which mimics the linearized\ngeneral relativity in Minkowski spacetime. In this theory, Lorentz symmetry\nappears incorporated into higher global symmetries of the length-fixing\nconstraints put on the vector and tensor fields involved, $A_{\\mu }^{2}=\\pm\nM_{A}^{2}$ and $H_{\\mu \\nu }^{2}=\\pm M_{H}^{2}$ ($M_{A}$ and $M_{H}$ are the\nproposed symmetry breaking scales). We show that such a SLIV pattern being\nrelated to breaking of global symmetries underlying these constraints induces\nthe massless Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone modes shared among photon and\ngraviton. While for a vector field case the symmetry of the constraint\ncoincides with Lorentz symmetry $SO(1,3)$ of the electrogravity Lagrangian, the\ntensor field constraint itself possesses much higher global symmetry $SO(7,3)$,\nwhose spontaneous violation provides a sufficient number of zero modes\ncollected in a graviton. Accordingly, while photon may only contain true\nGoldstone modes, graviton appears at least partially composed from\npseudo-Goldstone modes rather than from pure Goldstone ones. When expressed in\nterms of these modes, the theory looks essentially nonlinear and contains a\nvariety of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings. However, all SLIV effects\nturn out to be strictly cancelled in the lowest order processes that is\nconsidered in some detail. How this emergent electrogravity theory could be\nobservationally differed from conventional QED and GR theories is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 17:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 21:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Although several\npatents have since appeared hinting at the algorithms that may be used to\nachieve differential privacy, they did not include a precise explanation of the\napproach taken to privacy parameter choice.

QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,\ninvestigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve\nthe problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both\ndirections of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital\napplication in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our \"big data\" world.\nConversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become\ninstrumental in advanced quantum technologies.

Thanks to the extreme regularity of the emitted pulses,\nminuscule disturbances leave particular fingerprints in the times-of-arrival\n(TOAs) measured on Earth with the technique of pulsar timing. Tiny deviations\nfrom the expected TOAs, predicted according to a theoretical timing model based\non known physics, can therefore reveal a plethora of interesting new physical\neffects. Pulsar timing can be used to measure the dynamics of pulsars in\ncompact binaries, thus probing the post-Newtonian expansion of general\nrelativity beyond the weak field regime, while offering unique possibilities of\nconstraining alternative theories of gravity. Additionally, the correlation of\nTOAs from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars can be exploited to detect\nlow-frequency gravitational waves of astrophysical and cosmological origins. We\npresent a comprehensive review of the many applications of pulsar timing as a\nprobe of gravity, describing in detail the general principles, current\napplications and results, as well as future prospects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Star formation is\nfirst quenched by tides as the companion approaches, before being enhanced\nshortly after the collision. The ring ploughs the disc material as it radially\nextends, and almost simultaneously depletes its stellar and gaseous reservoir\ninto the central region, through the spokes, and finally dissolve 200 Myr after\nthe collision. Most of star formation first occurs in the ring before this\nactivity is transferred to the spokes and then the nucleus. We thus propose\nthat the location of star formation traces the dynamical stage of ring\ngalaxies, and could help constrain their star formation histories. The ring\nhosts tidal compression associated with strong turbulence. This compression\nyields an azimuthal asymmetry, with maxima reached in the side furthest away\nfrom the nucleus, which matches the star formation activity distribution in our\nmodels and in observed ring systems. The interaction triggers the formation of\nstar clusters significantly more massive than before the collision, but less\nnumerous than in more classical galaxy interactions.

Although participants\nwere able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in\nsocial network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social\nnetwork learning.

Accordingly, there arises a need to protect the state values of\na system. Recently, the notion of differential privacy has been used to protect\nstate trajectories in dynamical systems, and it is this notion of privacy that\nwe use here to protect the state trajectories of CPSs. We incorporate a cloud\ncomputer to coordinate the agents comprising the CPSs of interest, and the\ncloud offers the ability to remotely coordinate many agents, rapidly perform\ncomputations, and broadcast the results, making it a natural fit for systems\nwith many interacting agents or components. Striving for broad applicability,\nwe solve infinite-horizon linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) problems, and each\nagent protects its own state trajectory by adding noise to its states before\nthey are sent to the cloud. The cloud then uses these state values to generate\noptimal inputs for the agents. As a result, private data is fed into feedback\nloops at each iteration, and each noisy term affects every future state of\nevery agent. In this paper, we show that the differentially private LQR problem\ncan be related to the well-studied linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem, and\nwe provide bounds on how agents' privacy requirements affect the cloud's\nability to generate optimal feedback control values for the agents.

One commonly used technique is reactive training - applying\nstandard RL methods while treating other agents as a part of the learner's\nenvironment. It is known that in general-sum games reactive training can lead\ngroups of agents to converge to inefficient outcomes. We focus on one such\nclass of environments: Stag Hunt games. Here agents either choose a risky\ncooperative policy (which leads to high payoffs if both choose it but low\npayoffs to an agent who attempts it alone) or a safe one (which leads to a safe\npayoff no matter what). We ask how we can change the learning rule of a single\nagent to improve its outcomes in Stag Hunts that include other reactive\nlearners. We extend existing work on reward-shaping in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning and show that that making a single agent prosocial, that\nis, making them care about the rewards of their partners can increase the\nprobability that groups converge to good outcomes. Thus, even if we control a\nsingle agent in a group making that agent prosocial can increase our agent's\nlong-run payoff.

The projection matrix is then learned on\nthe assumption that the neighborhood information (e.g., the similarity) is\nknown and fixed prior to learning. However, it is difficult to precisely\nmeasure the intrinsic similarity of samples in high-dimensional space because\nof the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, the neighbors selected according\nto such similarity might and the projection matrix obtained according to such\nsimilarity and neighbors are not optimal in the sense of classification and\ngeneralization.

The idea behind\napproximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the\nentire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing - based on the chosen sample\nsize - can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and\ncomputation efficiency.\n  Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing\nprimarily target batch analytics, where the input data remains unchanged during\nthe course of sampling. Thus, they are not well-suited for stream analytics.\nThis motivated the design of StreamApprox - a stream analytics system for\napproximate computing. To realize this idea, we designed an online stratified\nreservoir sampling algorithm to produce approximate output with rigorous error\nbounds. Importantly, our proposed algorithm is generic and can be applied to\ntwo prominent types of stream processing systems: (1) batched stream processing\nsuch as Apache Spark Streaming, and (2) pipelined stream processing such as\nApache Flink.\n  We evaluated StreamApprox using a set of microbenchmarks and real-world case\nstudies.

In order to tackle this cause, we simply\nmodify the well known preferential attachment mechanism by imposing a time\ndependent kernel function in the network evolution equation. This approach\nleads to a fractional order Barabasi-Albert (BA) differential equation,\ngeneralizing the BA model. Our results show that, with passing time, an aging\nprocess is observed for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a\ndecay for the node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the\npreferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the preferential\nattachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more likely to absorb links;\nbut, on the other hand, a node's age has a reduced chance for new connections.\nThis competitive scenario allows an increased chance for younger members to\nbecome a hub. Simulations of such a network growth with aging constraint\nconfirm the results found from solving the fractional BA equation.
