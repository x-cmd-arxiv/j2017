In this paper, we propose to\nfurther reduce the number of Hessian-vector products for faster non-convex\noptimization. Previous algorithms need to approximate the smallest eigen-value\nwith a sufficient precision (e.g., $\\epsilon_2\\ll 1$) in order to achieve a\nsufficiently accurate second-order stationary solution (i.e.,\n$\\lambda_{\\min}(\\nabla^2 f(\\x))\\geq -\\epsilon_2)$. In contrast, the proposed\nalgorithms only need to compute the smallest eigen-vector approximating the\ncorresponding eigen-value up to a small power of current gradient's norm. As a\nresult, it can dramatically reduce the number of Hessian-vector products during\nthe course of optimization before reaching first-order stationary points (e.g.,\nsaddle points). The key building block of the proposed algorithms is a novel\nupdating step named the NCG step, which lets a noisy negative curvature descent\ncompete with the gradient descent. We show that the worst-case time complexity\nof the proposed algorithms with their favorable prescribed accuracy\nrequirements can match the best in literature for achieving a second-order\nstationary point but with an arguably smaller per-iteration cost. We also show\nthat the proposed algorithms can benefit from inexact Hessian by developing\ntheir variants accepting inexact Hessian under a mild condition for achieving\nthe same goal. Moreover, we develop a stochastic algorithm for a finite or\ninfinite sum non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed stochastic algorithm is the first one that converges to a second-order\nstationary point in {\\it high probability} with a time complexity independent\nof the sample size and almost linear in dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 20:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

We model the roadways, which are\npredominantly straight and randomly oriented, by a Poisson line process (PLP)\nand the locations of nodes on each road as a homogeneous 1D Poisson point\nprocess (PPP). Assuming that each node transmits independently, the locations\nof transmitting and receiving nodes are given by two Cox processes driven by\nthe same PLP. For this setup, we derive the coverage probability of a typical\nreceiver, which is an arbitrarily chosen receiving node, assuming independent\nNakagami-$m$ fading over all wireless channels. Assuming that the typical\nreceiver connects to its closest transmitting node in the network, we first\nderive the distribution of the distance between the typical receiver and the\nserving node to characterize the desired signal power. We then characterize\ncoverage probability for this setup, which involves two key technical\nchallenges. First, we need to handle several cases as the serving node can\npossibly be located on any line in the network and the corresponding\ninterference experienced at the typical receiver is different in each case.\nSecond, conditioning on the serving node imposes constraints on the spatial\nconfiguration of lines, which require careful analysis of the conditional\ndistribution of the lines. We address these challenges in order to accurately\ncharacterize the interference experienced at the typical receiver. We then\nderive an exact expression for coverage probability in terms of the derivative\nof Laplace transform of interference power distribution. We analyze the trends\nin coverage probability as a function of the network parameters: line density\nand node density.

Similarly, neurons have their own codes to convey information\nin the brain. Even though it is well-known that neurons exchange information\nusing a pool of several protocols of spatio-temporal encodings, the suitability\nof each code and their performance as a function of network parameters and\nexternal stimuli is still one of the great mysteries in neuroscience. This\npaper sheds light on this by modeling small-size networks of chemically and\nelectrically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose spiking neurons. We focus on a class of\ntemporal and firing-rate codes that result from neurons' membrane-potentials\nand phases, and quantify numerically their performance estimating the Mutual\nInformation Rate, aka the rate of information exchange. Our results suggest\nthat the firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes are more robust to additive\nGaussian white noise. In a network of four interconnected neurons and in the\nabsence of such noise, pairs of neurons that have the largest rate of\ninformation exchange using the interspike-intervals and firing-rate codes are\nnot adjacent in the network, whereas spike-timings and phase codes (temporal)\npromote large rate of information exchange for adjacent neurons. If that result\nwould have been possible to extend to larger neural networks, it would suggest\nthat small microcircuits would preferably exchange information using temporal\ncodes (spike-timings and phase codes), whereas on the macroscopic scale, where\nthere would be typically pairs of neurons not directly connected due to the\nbrain's sparsity, firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes would be the most\nefficient codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 09:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 15:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

However, past\napproaches assume full state measurements or a centralized controller, which is\nnot found in networked LTI systems with subcontrollers. Since generally the\nentire system is neither controllable nor observable by a single subcontroller,\ncommunication of sensor measurements is required to ensure closed-loop\nstability. The possibility of attacking the communication channel has not been\nexplicitly considered by previous watermarking schemes, and requires a new\ndesign. In this paper, we derive a statistical watermarking test that can\ndetect both sensor and communication attacks. A unique (compared to the\nnon-networked case) aspect of the implementing this test is the state-feedback\ncontroller must be designed so that the closed-loop system is controllable by\neach sub-controller, and we provide two approaches to design such a controller\nusing Heymann's lemma and a multi-input generalization of Heymann's lemma.

We test the method using spectroscopic data from several other radio\nAGN studies, and find good agreement between our WISE-based redshift estimates\nand published spectroscopic redshifts out to z ~ 1 for galaxies and z ~ 3-4 for\nradio-loud QSOs. Our chosen method is also compared against other\nclassification methods and found to perform reliably. This technique is likely\nto be particularly useful in the analysis of upcoming large-area radio surveys\nwith SKA pathfinder telescopes, and our code is publicly available. As a\nconsistency check, we show that our WISE-based redshift estimates for sources\nin the 843 MHz SUMSS survey reproduce the redshift distribution seen in the\nCENSORS study up to z ~ 2. We also discuss two specific applications of our\ntechnique for current and upcoming radio surveys; an interpretation of large\nscale HI absorption surveys, and a determination of whether low-frequency\npeaked spectrum sources lie at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The\npolynomial chaos method is a computational approach to solve stochastic partial\ndifferential equations (SPDE) by projecting the solution onto a space of\northogonal polynomials of the stochastic variables and solving for the\ndeterministic coefficients. Polynomial chaos can be more efficient than Monte\nCarlo methods when the number of stochastic variables is low, and the\nintegration time is not too large. When performing long-term integration,\nhowever, achieving accurate solutions often requires the space of polynomial\nfunctions to become unacceptably large. This paper presents an alternative\napproach, where sets of empirical basis functions are constructed by examining\nthe behavior of the solution for fixed values of the random variables. The\nempirical basis functions are evolved over time, which means that the total\nnumber can be kept small, even when performing long-term integration. We\nintroduce this method of empirical chaos expansion, and apply it to a number of\nmodel equations, demonstrating that the computational time scales linearly with\nthe final integration time. That is not the case for polynomial chaos in\ngeneral, since achieving accuracy for long-term integration usually requires\nlarger polynomial bases, causing a nonlinear scaling with the final integration\ntime. We also present an analytical method that uses the dynamics of the SPDE\nto evolve the empirical basis functions and demonstrate how it can be applied\nto extend the validity of empirical basis functions in time without the need to\nsample additional realizations of the original SPDE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 18:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Our approach, which captures the similarities and disparities\nbetween different image modalities in a learned sparse feature domain in\n\\emph{lieu} of the original image domain, consists of two phases. The coupled\ndictionary learning phase is used to learn a set of dictionaries that couple\ndifferent image modalities in the sparse feature domain given a set of training\ndata. In turn, the coupled super-resolution phase leverages such coupled\ndictionaries to construct a HR version of the LR target image given another\nrelated image modality. One of the merits of our sparsity-driven approach\nrelates to the fact that it overcomes drawbacks such as the texture copying\nartifacts commonly resulting from inconsistency between the guidance and target\nimages. Experiments on real multimodal images demonstrate that incorporating\nappropriate guidance information via joint sparse representation induced by\ncoupled dictionary learning brings notable benefits in the super-resolution\ntask with respect to the state-of-the-art.

We show that the\nfraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative to triple\nsystems, over a broader range of parameter space. We show that this fraction\ngrows with time, unlike triple systems evolved at quadrupole order. This is\nfundamentally because with their additional degrees of freedom, quadruple\nsystems do not have a maximal set of commuting constants of the motion, even in\nsecular theory at quadrupole order. We discuss these results in the context of\nstar-star and white dwarf-white dwarf(WD) binaries, with emphasis on WD-WD\nmergers and collisions relevant to the Type Ia supernova problem. For star-star\nsystems, we find that more than 30% of systems reach high eccentricity within a\nHubble time, potentially forming triple systems via stellar mergers or close\nbinaries. For WD-WD systems, taking into account general relativistic and tidal\nprecession and dissipation, we show that the merger rate is enhanced in\nquadruple systems relative to triple systems by a factor of 3.5-10, and that\nthe long-term evolution of quadruple systems leads to a delay-time distribution\n~1/t for mergers and collisions.

Here we theoretically\ninvestigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy\n(IMA). Our results show that the spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but\nonly with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. The\nspin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and\nright-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast,\nthe spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular\nmomentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself\nis not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical\nspin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe\nnanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque\nthat plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit\ntorque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration,\na prediction that can be tested experimentally.

Both for\nthe LHC and for future colliders, there is a growing interest in using jet\nsubstructure methods based only on charged-particle information. The reason is\nthat silicon-based tracking detectors offer excellent granularity and precise\nvertexing, which can improve the angular resolution on highly-collimated jets\nand mitigate the impact of pileup. In this paper, we assess how much jet\nsubstructure performance degrades by using track-only information, and we\ndemonstrate physics contexts in which calorimetry is most beneficial.\nSpecifically, we consider five different hadronic final states - W bosons, Z\nbosons, top quarks, light quarks, gluons - and test the pairwise discrimination\npower with a multi-variate combination of substructure observables. In the\nidealized case of perfect reconstruction, we quantify the loss in\ndiscrimination performance when using just charged particles compared to using\nall detected particles. We also consider the intermediate case of using charged\nparticles plus photons, which provides valuable information about neutral\npions. In the more realistic case of a segmented calorimeter, we assess the\npotential performance gains from improving calorimeter granularity and\nresolution, comparing a CMS-like detector to more ambitious future detector\nconcepts. Broadly speaking, we find large performance gains from\nneutral-particle information and from improved calorimetry in cases where jet\nmass resolution drives the discrimination power, whereas the gains are more\nmodest if an absolute mass scale calibration is not required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 19:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 23:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

In this regard, the governing equations\nare first cast in terms of a set of scalar observables of the state variables,\nleading to a linear set of equations.

In low metallicity\nenvironments, such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), stellar winds are\nweaker and binary interaction is expected to dominate WR-star formation.\nHowever, the WR binary fraction appears to be ~40% at any metallicity. We use\nthe recently determined physical properties of the twelve known SMC WR stars to\nexplore their possible formation channels through comparisons with grids of SMC\nmodels, simulated with the detailed stellar evolution code MESA. These include\nmodels of rapidly rotating single stars, which experience (partial) chemically\nhomogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that CHE is not able to account for the\nmajority of the SMC WR stars. However, the apparently single WN star SMC AB12\nand the double WR system SMC AB5 (HD 5980) appear consistent with this channel.\nWe also analyze core helium burning stellar models assuming constant hydrogen\ngradients in their envelopes. We find a dichotomy in the envelope hydrogen\ngradients required to explain the observed temperatures of the SMC WR stars.\nShallow gradients are found for the WR stars with O star companions, consistent\nwith binary models where mass transfer occurs early, which is in agreement with\ntheir binary properties. On the other hand, much steeper hydrogen gradients are\ninferred for the group of hot apparently single WR stars. Since the hydrogen\nprofiles in post main sequence models of massive stars become steeper with\ntime, we conclude that these stars have likely been stripped by a companion\nduring a phase of common envelope evolution. The companions, either main\nsequence stars or compact objects, are expected to still be present.

The goal is to\nfind a minimum set of vertices such that after iteratively applying the rule,\nall of the vertices become colored (i.e., a minimum zero forcing set). Of\nparticular interest is the propagation time of a chosen set which is the number\nof steps the rule must be applied in order to color all the vertices of a\ngraph.\n  We give a purely linear algebraic interpretation of zero forcing: Find a set\nof vertices $S$ such that for any weighted adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$,\nwhenever $\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{0}$, the entirety of of $\\mathbf{x}$ can be\nrecovered using only $\\mathbf{x}_S$, the entries corresponding to $S$. The key\nhere is that $S$ must be chosen before $\\mathbf{A}$. In this light, we are able\nto give a linear algebraic interpretation of the propagation time: Any error in\n$\\mathbf{x}_S$ effects the error of $\\mathbf{x}$ exponentially in the\npropagation time. This error can be quantitatively measured using newly defined\nzero forcing-related parameters, the error polynomial vector and the variance\npolynomial vector. In this sense, the quality of two zero forcing sets can\nobjectively be compared even if the sets are the same size and their\npropagation time is the same.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation.

Through\na systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December\n2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise\nthe variability of the total flux density and linear polarisation. We find that\nall sources in the sample are highly variable in total flux density at both 3.5\nand 1.3mm, as well as in spectral index, that is found to be optically thin in\ngeneral. The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable.

Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every\n10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is\nthat the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time,\nBitcoin's inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the\nconsistent flow of validated transactions through the system. We propose an\nalternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an\ninter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called\nBobtail, generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k\nlowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block\ntimes decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied to Bitcoin, about\n80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block\nwould be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would\nremain at 10 minutes. Further, we show that low-variance mining significantly\nthwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For Bitcoin and Ethereum\ncurrently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 30%\nprobability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when\nk>=20, the probability of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin\nand Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 40% of the mining power will claim\nabout 66% of blocks; however, when k>=5, the same miner will find that selfish\nmining is less successful than honest mining.

Further more, based on our comprehensive and concise model, we\ncontribute a typology of combination methods of 2D and 3D visualizations that\ndistinguish between linked views, embedded views, and mixed views. We also\npropose a supporting guideline to assist users in selecting a proper view under\ncertain circumstances by considering visual geometry and spatial distribution\nof the 2D and 3D visualizations. Finally, based on existing works, possible\nfuture research opportunities are explored and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 01:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The paucity of\nobservations of extreme events often motivates the use of statistical\napproaches to model the distribution of extreme storm surge events. A key deep\nuncertainty that is often overlooked is model structural uncertainty. There is\ncurrently no strong consensus among experts regarding which class of\nstatistical model to use as a best practice. Robust management of coastal\nflooding risks requires coastal managers to consider the distinct possibility\nof non-stationarity in storm surges. This increases the complexity of the\npotential models to use, which tends to increase the data required to constrain\nthe model. Here, we use a Bayesian model averaging approach to analyze the\nbalance between model complexity sufficient to capture decision-relevant risks\nand data availability to constrain complex model structures. We characterize\ndeep model structural uncertainty through a set of calibration experiments.\nSpecifically, we calibrate a set of models ranging in complexity using\nlong-term tide gauge observations from the Netherlands and the United States.\nWe find that in both cases, roughly half the model weight is associated with\nnon-stationary models. Our approach provides a formal framework to integrate\ninformation across model structures, in light of the potentially sizable\nmodeling uncertainties. By combining information from multiple models, our\ninference sharpens for the projected storm surge 100-year return levels, and\nestimated return levels increase by several centimeters. We assess the impacts\nof data availability through a set of experiments with temporal subsets and\nmodel comparison metrics.

It is written in terms of the condensation\nand Green's function, which is obtained with two-particle irreducible (2PI)\nclosed time path (CTP) effective action (EA). In the spatially flat universe\nwith a time-dependent scale factor, the time evolution of the PNA is computed.\nWe start with an initial condition where only the condensation of the neutral\nscalar is non-zero. The initial condition for the fields is specified by a\ndensity operator parameterized by the temperature of the universe. With the\nabove initial conditions, the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is\ngenerated through the interaction between the complex scalar and the\ncondensation of the neutral scalar. We investigate the case that both the\ninteraction and the expansion rate of the universe are small and include their\neffects up to the first order of the perturbation. The expanding universe\ncauses the effects of the dilution of the PNA, freezing interaction and the\nredshift of the particle energy. As for the time dependence of the PNA, we\nfound that PNA oscillates at the early time and it begins to dump at the later\ntime.

They serve as base\nmodels for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a\nmultidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly\nwell established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of\nmonophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies\ntheir prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply\nthe recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic\nmusic modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and\nL1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the\nfeature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common\nfeature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE,\npropose task-optimized feature generating operations and various\nmusic-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus\nof monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly\noutperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free\nparameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the\nlearned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are\nmusicologically interpreted for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 05:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

It was presented at the public meeting of the St.Petersburg\nAcademy of Sciences in November 1753 and is traditionally listed among\nLomonosov's most important scientific accomplishments. In the Discourse,\nLomonosov presents an original theory of generation of electricity in the air\nand lightning, many elements of which are profoundly correct even by present\nday understanding of the phenomenon. The theory is based on experimental\nobservations and measurements and supported by some mathematical estimates. The\nbasis of the Lomonosov theory is the idea of vertical air movements as the main\ncause of atmospheric electricity - the immersion of the cold upper strata of\nthe atmosphere into the lower (warmer) layers causes mechanical friction of\nminiscular particles in the air against each other, that results in generation\nof atmospheric electricity. Miniscular particles of two types are required:\nthose of water (vapors) capable of accumulation of the electricity, and organic\ncompounds/fatty particles in the air which are involved in production of the\nelectricity via friction. Electrically charged droplets are assumed to be\nspread throughout the entire volume of the cloud. The transfer of charges from\nindividual fatty particles to droplets of water in the clouds via countless\ncollisions leads to formation in atmosphere, in clouds of strong electric\nfields, which are the cause of the appearance of lightning.

While about $79 \\%$ of the pulsars that could be\nclassified have simple power law spectra, we find significant deviations in 73\npulsars, 35 of which have curved spectra, 25 with a spectral break and 10 with\na low-frequency turn-over. We identify 11 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS)\npulsars, with 3 newly identified in this work and 8 confirmations of known GPS\npulsars; 3 others show tentative evidence of GPS, but require further\nlow-frequency measurements to support this classification. The weighted mean\nspectral index of all pulsars with simple power law spectra is $-1.60 \\pm\n0.03$. The observed spectral indices are well described by a shifted log-normal\ndistribution. The strongest correlations of spectral index are with spin-down\nluminosity, magnetic field at the light-cylinder and spin-down rate. We also\ninvestigate the physical origin of the observed spectral features and determine\nemission altitudes for three pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

The waves induce a shift of the vortex center in\nthe direction transverse to wave propagation, together with a decrease in\nsurface vorticity. We interpret these two phenomena in the framework introduced\nby Craik and Leibovich (1976): we identify the dimensionless Stokes drift\n$S=U_s/U_0$ as the relevant control parameter, $U_s$ being the Stokes drift\nvelocity of the waves. We propose a simple vortex line model which indicates\nthat the shift of the vortex center originates from a balance between vorticity\nadvection by the Stokes drift and self-advection of the vortex. The decrease in\nsurface vorticity is interpreted as a consequence of vorticity expulsion by the\nfast Stokes drift, which confines it at depth. This purely hydrodynamic process\nis analogous to the magnetohydrodynamic expulsion of magnetic field by a\nrapidly moving conductor through the electromagnetic skin effect. We study\nvorticity expulsion in the limit of fast Stokes drift and deduce that the\nsurface vorticity decreases as $1/S$, a prediction which is compatible with the\nexperimental data. Such wave-induced vortex distortions have important\nconsequences for the nonlinear regime of wave refraction: the refraction angle\nrapidly decreases with wave intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 09:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

New\nobservations are driving this study, in particular some recent Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer (VLTI)/MIDI data acquired in December 2013. Our\none-component disk model could not reproduce simultaneously all our data: the\nSpectral Energy Distribution, the near-infrared Keck Interferometer data and\nthe mid-infrared data obtained with the MIDI instrument. In order to explain\nall measurements, one possibility is to add an asymmetry in our one-component\ndisk model with the assumption that the structure of the disk of MWC480 has not\nvaried with time. Several scenarios are tested, and the one considering the\npresence of an azimuthal bright feature in the inner component of the disk\nmodel provides a better fit of the data.

The\naim of the present work is to identify new line pairs useful for the MLR\ntechnique and to test their reliability. We use a three dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation representing the quiet Sun atmosphere to\nsynthesize the Stokes profiles. Then, we apply the MLR technique to the Stokes\nV profiles to recover the fields in the MHD cube both, at original resolution\nand after degrading with a point spread function. In both these cases, we aim\nto empirically represent the field strengths returned by the MLR method in\nterms of the field strengths in the MHD cube. We have identified two new line\npairs that are very well adapted to be used for MLR measurements. The first\npair is in the visible, Fe I 6820 A - 6842 A (whose intensity profiles have\nearlier been used to measure stellar magnetic fields), and the other is in the\ninfrared (IR), Fe I 15534 A - 15542 A. The lines in these pairs reproduce the\nmagnetic fields in the MHD cube rather well, partially better than the original\n5250 A pair. The newly identified line pairs complement the old pairs. The\nlines in the new IR pair, due to their higher Zeeman sensitivity, are ideal for\nthe measurement of weak fields. The new visible pair works best above 300 G.\nThe new IR pair, due to its large Stokes V signal samples more fields in the\nMHD cube than the old IR pair at $1.56\\,\\mu$m, even in the presence of noise,\nand hence likely also on the real Sun.

For this\npurpose, a novel iterative method for deriving a self-consistent steady-state\nstructure of RRMS is developed, based on a Monte-Carlo code that solves the\ntransfer of photons subject to Compton scattering and pair\nproduction/annihilation. Systematic study is performed by imposing various\nupstream conditions which are characterized by the following three parameters:\nthe photon-to-baryon inertia ratio $\\xi_{u *}$, the photon-to-baryon number\nratio $\\tilde{n}$, and the shock Lorentz factor $\\gamma_u$. We find that the\nproperties of RRMSs vary considerably with these parameters. In particular,\nwhile a smooth decline in the velocity, accompanied by a gradual temperature\nincrease is seen for $\\xi_{u*} \\gg 1$, an efficient bulk Comptonization, that\nleads to a heating precursor, is found for $\\xi_{u*} \\lesssim 1$. As a\nconsequence, although particle acceleration is highly inefficient in these\nshocks, a broad non-thermal spectrum is produced in the latter case. The\ngeneration of high energy photons through bulk Comptonization leads, in certain\ncases, to a copious production of pairs that provide the dominant opacity for\nCompton scattering. We also find that for certain upstream conditions a weak\nsubshock appears within the flow.

This statement is robust with respect to the strength of\nCoulomb interaction. We firstly exploit the idea of introducing an imbalance\nbetween the quasiparticles, by creating different conditions of propagation for\nthem. It can be done by taking into account either dispersion or dissipation,\nwhich indeed results in the partial coherence recovery. The idea of imbalance\ncan also be realized by applying a periodic potential to the arms of\ninterferometer. We discuss such an experiment, which might also shed light on\nthe internal coherence of the two edge excitations. Another scenario relies on\nthe lowering of the energy density of the electron wave packet by the time it\narrives at the interferometer in presence of dissipation or dispersion.

It occurs if the interaction of the bunch with its\nown radiation leads to the formation of sub-structures on the longitudinal\nbunch profile. These sub-structures can grow rapidly -- leading to a\nsawtooth-like behaviour of the bunch. At KARA, we use a fast-gated intensified\ncamera for energy spread studies, Schottky diodes for coherent synchrotron\nradiation studies as well as electro-optical spectral decoding for longitudinal\nbunch profile measurements. For a synchronization, a hardware synchronization\nscheme is used which compensates for eventual hardware delays.

The highly-nonlinear nature of screening\nmechanisms means that they evade classical fifth-force searches, and there has\nbeen an intense effort towards designing new and novel tests to probe them,\nboth in the laboratory and using astrophysical objects, and by reinterpreting\nexisting datasets.

Existing techniques mostly focus on\nbinary brain activity recognition for a single person, which limits their\ndeployment in wider and complex practical scenarios. Therefore, multi-person\nand multi-class brain activity recognition has obtained popularity recently.\nAnother challenge faced by brain activity recognition is the low recognition\naccuracy due to the massive noises and the low signal-to-noise ratio in EEG\nsignals. Moreover, the feature engineering in EEG processing is time-consuming\nand highly re- lies on the expert experience. In this paper, we attempt to\nsolve the above challenges by proposing an approach which has better EEG\ninterpretation ability via raw Electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis for\nmulti-person and multi-class brain activity recognition. Specifically, we\nanalyze inter-class and inter-person EEG signal characteristics, based on which\nto capture the discrepancy of inter-class EEG data.

We evaluate our approach on both a public and a local EEG\ndatasets and conduct extensive experiments to explore the effect of several\nfactors (such as normalization methods, training data size, and Autoencoder\nhidden neuron size) on the recognition results.

In\nparticular, when the particle Stokes number, ${\\rm St}$, is below a certain\nvalue, the forward-in-time (FIT) dispersion should be faster than the\nbackward-in-time (BIT) dispersion, but for ${\\rm St}$ above this value, this\nshould invert so that BIT becomes faster than FIT dispersion. This non-trivial\nbehavior arises because of the competition between two physically distinct\nirreversibility mechanisms that operate in different regimes of ${\\rm St}$. In\n3D turbulence, both mechanisms act to produce faster BIT than FIT dispersion,\nbut in 2D turbulence, the two mechanisms have opposite effects because of the\nflux of energy from the small to the large scales. We supplement the\nqualitative argument given by Bragg \\emph{et al.} (Phys. Fluids \\textbf{28},\n013305 (2016)) by deriving quantitative predictions of this effect in the short\ntime limit. We confirm the theoretical predictions using results of inertial\nparticle dispersion in a direct numerical simulation of 2D turbulence. A more\ngeneral finding of this analysis is that in turbulent flows with an inverse\nenergy flux, inertial particles may yet exhibit a net downscale flux of kinetic\nenergy because of their non-local in-time dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 15:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Apart from overall energy shifts of up to about\n3 eV, the theoretical cross sections are in good agreement with each other and\nwith the experimental results. In addition, the complex deexcitation cascades\nafter the creation of inner-shell holes in the Fe+ ion have been tracked on the\natomic fine-structure level. The corresponding theoretical results for the\nproduct charge-state distributions are in much better agreement with the\nexperimental data than previously published configuration-average results. The\npresent experimental and theoretical results are valuable for opacity\ncalculations and are expected to pave the way to a more accurate determination\nof the iron abundance in the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 15:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

A common approach to overcome this difficulty is employing a nodal\nquadrature formula to approximately discretize the $L^1$-norm.

In this paper, we introduce generalized approximation\nframeworks for the study and analysis of multistate dynamical processes on\nnetworks. These frameworks are degree-based, allowing for the analysis of the\neffect of network connectivity structures on dynamical processes. We illustrate\nthe utility of our approach with the analysis of two specific dynamical\nprocesses from the epidemiological and physical sciences. The approximation\nframeworks that we develop, along with open-source numerical solvers, provide a\nunifying framework and a valuable suite of tools for the interdisciplinary\nstudy of multistate dynamical processes on networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 03:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}
