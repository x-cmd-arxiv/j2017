In comparison, other bosonic QEC codes require\n$O(N^2)$ photons to correct the same degree of bosonic errors. Such improved\nphoton-efficiency underscores the additional error-correction power that can be\nprovided by channel monitoring. We develop quantum Hamming bounds for\nphoton-loss errors in the code subspaces associated with the $\\chi^{(2)}$\nparity-check code and the $\\chi^{(2)}$ embedded error-correcting code, and we\nprove that these codes saturate their respective bounds.

The main idea of the proposed model is\nto recursively recycle data storage of synaptic weights (parameters) during\ntraining. This enables a device with a given storage constraint to train and\ninstantiate a neural network classifier with a larger number of weights on a\nchip and with a less number of off-chip storage accesses. This enables higher\nclassification accuracy, shorter training time, less energy dissipation, and\nless on-chip storage requirement. We verified the training model with deep\nneural network classifiers and the permutation-invariant MNIST benchmark. Our\nmodel uses only 2.28 bits/weight while for the same data storage constraint\nachieving ~1% lower classification error as compared to the conventional\nbinary-weight learning model which yet has to use 8 to 16 bit storage per\nweight. To achieve the similar classification error, the conventional binary\nmodel requires ~4x more data storage for weights than the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 16:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

Afterwards, we investigate if and to what extent visual saliency\ncan support visual classification in nontrivial cases. To achieve this, we\npropose SalClassNet, a CNN framework consisting of two networks jointly\ntrained: a) the first one computing top-down saliency maps from input images,\nand b) the second one exploiting the computed saliency maps for visual\nclassification. To test our approach, we collected a dataset of eye-gaze maps,\nusing a Tobii T60 eye tracker, by asking several subjects to look at images\nfrom the Stanford Dogs dataset, with the objective of distinguishing dog\nbreeds. Performance analysis on our dataset and other saliency bench-marking\ndatasets, such as POET, showed that SalClassNet out-performs state-of-the-art\nsaliency detectors, such as SalNet and SALICON. Finally, we analyzed the\nperformance of SalClassNet in a fine-grained recognition task and found out\nthat it generalizes better than existing visual classifiers.

However, retrieval of important activities from\nsuch a large data can be time consuming. Thus, researchers are working on\nfinding solutions to present hours of visual data in a compressed, but\nmeaningful way. Video synopsis is one of the ways to represent activities using\nrelatively shorter duration clips. So far, two main approaches have been used\nby researchers to address this problem, namely synopsis by tracking moving\nobjects and synopsis by clustering moving objects. Synopses outputs, mainly\ndepend on tracking, segmenting, and shifting of moving objects temporally as\nwell as spatially. In many situations, tracking fails, thus produces multiple\ntrajectories of the same object. Due to this, the object may appear and\ndisappear multiple times within the same synopsis output, which is misleading.\nThis also leads to discontinuity and often can be confusing to the viewer of\nthe synopsis. In this paper, we present a new approach for generating\ncompressed video synopsis by grouping tracklets of moving objects. Grouping\nhelps to generate a synopsis where chronologically related objects appear\ntogether with meaningful spatio-temporal relation.

The stable unit treatment assumption for\ncausal mediation analysis is thus unrealistic for this type of time series\ndata. To address this challenge, our framework integrates two types of models:\ncausal mediation analysis across the variables and vector autoregressive models\nacross the temporal observations.

To understand the emission, we have used the moving mesh\ncode Arepo to perform magneto-hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations with\nself-consistent CR physics. Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently\naccumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the\nmagnetic tension of the toroidal disk field.

Thousands of organizations now use\nconfiguration languages, such as Puppet. However, specifications written in\nconfiguration languages can have bugs and the shell remains the simplest way to\ndebug a misconfigured system. Unfortunately, it is unsafe to use the shell to\nfix problems when a system configuration language is in use: a fix applied from\nthe shell may cause the system to drift from the state specified by the\nconfiguration language. Thus, despite their advantages, configuration languages\nforce system administrators to give up the simplicity and familiarity of the\nshell.\n  This paper presents a synthesis-based technique that allows administrators to\nuse configuration languages and the shell in harmony. Administrators can fix\nerrors using the shell and the technique automatically repairs the higher-level\nspecification written in the configuration language. The approach (1) produces\nrepairs that are consistent with the fix made using the shell; (2) produces\nrepairs that are maintainable by minimizing edits made to the original\nspecification; (3) ranks and presents multiple repairs when relevant; and (4)\nsupports all shells the administrator may wish to use. We implement our\ntechnique for Puppet, a widely used system configuration language, and evaluate\nit on a suite of benchmarks under 42 repair scenarios. The top-ranked repair is\nselected by humans 76% of the time and the human-equivalent repair is ranked\n1.31 on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 18:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

CEP finds applications in diverse domains, which has resulted in\na large number of proposals for expressing and processing complex events.\nHowever, existing CEP languages lack from a clear semantics, making them hard\nto understand and generalize. Moreover, there are no general techniques for\nevaluating CEP query languages with clear performance guarantees.\n  In this paper we embark on the task of giving a rigorous and efficient\nframework to CEP. We propose a formal language for specifying complex events,\ncalled CEL, that contains the main features used in the literature and has a\ndenotational and compositional semantics. We also formalize the so-called\nselection strategies, which had only been presented as by-design extensions to\nexisting frameworks. With a well-defined semantics at hand, we study how to\nefficiently evaluate CEL for processing complex events in the case of unary\nfilters. We start by studying the syntactical properties of CEL and propose\nrewriting optimization techniques for simplifying the evaluation of formulas.\nThen, we introduce a formal computational model for CEP, called complex event\nautomata (CEA), and study how to compile CEL formulas into CEA. Furthermore, we\nprovide efficient algorithms for evaluating CEA over event streams using\nconstant time per event followed by constant-delay enumeration of the results.\nBy gathering these results together, we propose a framework for efficiently\nevaluating CEL with unary filters. Finally, we show experimentally that this\nframework consistently outperforms the competition, and even over trivial\nqueries can be orders of magnitude more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

A\ngeneral phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable\nvarious joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and\nflow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS).\nSince phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive\nto phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase\ncycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps.\nThe proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo\ndatasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods.\n  Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared\nto reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances as\nstate of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free\nregularized flow reconstruction.

First, countries trade more with those\nwith whom they share history, language, and culture, suggesting that trade is\nlimited by information frictions. Second, countries are more likely to start\nexporting products that are similar to their current exports, suggesting that\nknowledge diffusion among related industries is a key constrain shaping the\ndiversification of exports. But does knowledge about how to export to a\ndestination also diffuses among related products and geographic neighbors? Do\ncountries need to learn how to trade each product to each destination? Here, we\nuse bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2015 to show that countries are more\nlikely to increase their exports of a product to a destination when: (i) they\nexport related products to it, (ii) they export the same product to the\nneighbor of a destination, (iii) they have neighbors who export the same\nproduct to that destination. Then, we explore the magnitude of these effects\nfor new, nascent, and experienced exporters, (exporters with and without\ncomparative advantage in a product) and also for groups of products with\ndifferent level of technological sophistication. We find that the effects of\nproduct and geographic relatedness are stronger for new exporters, and also,\nthat the effect of product relatedness is stronger for more technologically\nsophisticated products. These findings support the idea that international\ntrade is shaped by information frictions that are reduced in the presence of\nrelated products and experienced geographic neighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 20:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

To render a new scene, we sample visible points of the cloud\nand, for each, extract a hierarchical 3D descriptor of the cloud geometry with\nrespect to the shading location and the light source. The descriptor is input\nto a deep neural network that predicts the radiance function for each shading\nconfiguration. We make the key observation that progressively feeding the\nhierarchical descriptor into the network enhances the network's ability to\nlearn faster and predict with high accuracy while using few coefficients. We\nalso employ a block design with residual connections to further improve\nperformance. A GPU implementation of our method synthesizes images of clouds\nthat are nearly indistinguishable from the reference solution within seconds\ninteractively. Our method thus represents a viable solution for applications\nsuch as cloud design and, thanks to its temporal stability, also for\nhigh-quality production of animated content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 21:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

In particular, pressure\nanisotropy with respect to the local magnetic-field direction can both change\nthe linear MRI dispersion relation and cause nonlinear modifications to the\nmode structure and growth rate, even when the field and flow perturbations are\nsmall. This work studies these pressure-anisotropy-induced nonlinearities in\nthe weakly nonlinear, high-ion-beta regime, before the MRI saturates into\nstrong turbulence. Our goal is to better understand how the saturation of the\nMRI in a low collisionality plasma might differ from that in the collisional\nregime. We focus on two key effects: (i) the direct impact of self-induced\npressure-anisotropy nonlinearities on the evolution of an MRI mode, and (ii)\nthe influence of pressure anisotropy on the \"parasitic instabilities\" that are\nsuspected to cause the mode to break up into turbulence. Our main conclusions\nare: (i) The mirror instability regulates the pressure anisotropy in such a way\nthat the linear MRI in a collisionless plasma is an approximate nonlinear\nsolution once the mode amplitude becomes larger than the background field (just\nas in MHD). This implies that differences between the collisionless and\ncollisional MRI become unimportant at large amplitudes. (ii) The break up of\nlarge amplitude MRI modes into turbulence via parasitic instabilities is\nsimilar in collisionless and collisional plasmas. Together, these conclusions\nsuggest that the route to magnetorotational turbulence in a collisionless\nplasma may well be similar to that in a collisional plasma, as suggested by\nrecent kinetic simulations. As a supplement to these findings, we offer\nguidance for the design of future kinetic simulations of magnetorotational\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 22:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 03:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

CTA is expected to discover hundreds of new TeV\ngamma- ray sources, allowing it to significantly advance our understanding of\nthe origin of cosmic rays, to probe much larger distances in the universe, and\nto search for WIMP dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity in TeV mass\nrange.\n  The development of CTA is being carried out by a worldwide consortium of\nscientists from 32 countries. Consortium scientists have developed the core\nscientific programme of CTA and institutes of the Consortium are expected to\nprovide the bulk of the CTA components. The construction of CTA is overseen by\nthe CTA Observatory that will in the future manage observatory operations, the\nguest observer programme, and data dissemination.\n  This talk will review the scientific motivation for CTA, focusing on the key\nscience projects that form the core programme of research.

This capability\ncan help them avoid injury or serious damage, e.g., as a result of running into\npeople and obstacles, getting stuck, or falling off an edge. To this end, we\npropose an unsupervised and a near-unsupervised method based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) to classify scenarios as traversable or not based on\nvisual data. Our method is inspired by the recent success of data-driven\napproaches on computer vision problems and anomaly detection, and reduces the\nneed for vast amounts of negative examples at training time. Collecting\nnegative data indicating that a robot should not go through a space is\ntypically hard and dangerous because of collisions, whereas collecting positive\ndata can be automated and done safely based on the robot's own traveling\nexperience. We verify the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach\non a test dataset collected in a previously unseen environment with a mobile\nrobot.

This kind of scenario can arise, for instance, when quadcopters\nsearch a collapsed building after a natural disaster. Choosing the quadcopter\nas the target platform, this paper proposes the Kinodynamic Aggressive\nTrajectory (KAT) motion planning algorithm, which aims to compute aggressive\ntrajectories for narrow passages under nonholonomic constraints. This type of\nmaneuvers is necessary because the dynamics of quadcopters entail that some\nnarrow passages can only be traversed at high speed.\n  To find the best path, the KAT uses RRT to determine a holonomic path first\nand then adjusts it to satisfy the nonholonomic constraints. The innovations in\nthis process are: 1) The states of the robot are divided into near-holonomic\nset and non-holonomic set, which makes the constraints local rather than\nglobal; 2) For each of the most confined waypoints in the path, KAT plans\nforward and backward simultaneously around the waypoint to find a feasible\nlocal trajectory traversing the narrow passage. Our approach thus transforms a\nglobally-constrained planning problem into a problem with local constraints,\nand as a result, the computation becomes tractable. We evaluate KAT by applying\nit to a quadcopter flying through two inclined holes that require aggressive\nmaneuvers in a simulated environment. The average computation time to\nsuccessfully find a solution for passing two 50 degree inclined holes is around\n32 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2017 01:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Traditionally, these samples are drawn either\nprobabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet,\nthe motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to \"small\" regions of\nthe state space, due to, for example, differential constraints or\ncollision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus\ndesirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in\nthose regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a\nmethodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is\nlearned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling\ndistribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder,\nallowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific\nplanning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with\nany sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying\nstructure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of\nsampling-based approaches.

For larger\nself-propelled organisms like fish, it is unclear how particle inertia impacts\ntheir stress generation and collective movement. Here, we analyze the effects\nof finite particle inertia on the mechanical pressure (or stress) generated by\na suspension of self-propelled bodies.

Experiments using the\npublicly available NCLT dataset revealed that retraining scheduling of a DCN\nclassifier ensemble is crucial and performance is significantly increased by\nusing planned scheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2017 06:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Most of the existing local descriptors are generated over the raw\ninput images. In order to increase the discriminative power of the local\ndescriptors, some researchers converted the raw image into multiple images with\nthe help of some high and low pass frequency filters, then the local\ndescriptors are computed over each filtered image and finally concatenated into\na single descriptor. By doing so, these approaches do not utilize the inter\nfrequency relationship which causes the less improvement in the discriminative\npower of the descriptor that could be achieved. In this paper, this problem is\nsolved by utilizing the decoder concept of multi-channel decoded local binary\npattern over the multi-frequency patterns. A frequency decoded local binary\npattern (FDLBP) is proposed with two decoders. Each decoder works with one low\nfrequency pattern and two high frequency patterns. Finally, the descriptors\nfrom both decoders are concatenated to form the single descriptor. The face\nretrieval experiments are conducted over four benchmarks and challenging\ndatabases such as PaSC, LFW, PubFig, and ESSEX. The experimental results\nconfirm the superiority of the FDLBP descriptor as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art descriptors such as LBP, SOBEL_LBP, BoF_LBP, SVD_S_LBP, mdLBP,\netc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2017 06:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 02:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Here, we report efficient and fast filtration of\norganic solutions through GO laminates containing smooth two-dimensional (2D)\ncapillaries made from flakes with large sizes of ~ 10-20 micron. Without\nsacrificing their sieving characteristics, such membranes can be made\nexceptionally thin, down to ~ 10 nm, which translates into fast permeation of\nnot only water but also organic solvents. We attribute the organic solvent\npermeation and sieving properties of ultrathin GO laminates to the presence of\nrandomly distributed pinholes that are interconnected by short graphene\nchannels with a width of 1 nm. With increasing the membrane thickness, the\norganic solvent permeation rates decay exponentially but water continues to\npermeate fast, in agreement with previous reports. The application potential of\nour ultrathin laminates for organic-solvent nanofiltration is demonstrated by\nshowing >99.9% rejection of various organic dyes with small molecular weights\ndissolved in methanol.
