Our regressor is that degree $r$ polynomial which depends on at\nmost $k$ inputs, counting at most $\\ell$ monomial terms, which minimizes the\nsum of the squares of its prediction errors. The previous hierarchical sparse\nspecification aligns well with modern big data settings where many inputs are\nnot relevant for prediction purposes and the functional complexity of the\nregressor needs to be controlled as to avoid overfitting. We present a two-step\napproach to this hierarchical sparse regression problem. First, we discard\nirrelevant inputs using an extremely fast input ranking heuristic. Secondly, we\ntake advantage of modern cutting plane methods for integer optimization to\nsolve our resulting reduced hierarchical $(k, \\ell)$-sparse problem exactly.\nThe ability of our method to identify all $k$ relevant inputs and all $\\ell$\nmonomial terms is shown empirically to experience a phase transition.\nCrucially, the same transition also presents itself in our ability to reject\nall irrelevant features and monomials as well. In the regime where our method\nis statistically powerful, its computational complexity is interestingly on par\nwith Lasso based heuristics.

Previous\nworks on coexistence in metropolitan areas have used wavelength-division\nmultiplexing, however, coexistence in backbone fiber networks remains a great\nexperimental challenge, as Tbps data of up to 20 dBm optical power is\ntransferred, and much more noise is generated for QKD. Here we present for the\nfirst time, to the best of our knowledge, the integration of QKD with a\ncommercial backbone network of 3.6 Tbps classical data at 21 dBm launch power\nover 66 km fiber. With 20 GHz pass-band filtering and large effective core area\nfibers, real-time secure key rates can reach 4.5 kbps and 5.1 kbps for\nco-propagation and counter-propagation at the maximum launch power,\nrespectively. This demonstrates feasibility and represents an important step\ntowards building a quantum network that coexists with the current backbone\nfiber infrastructure of classical communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 16:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 02:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

However, speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation\nnetwork, due to either safety-related considerations (e.g., workzone\noperations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization\nsystems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shock- wave\nformation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a\nplatooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to\nenabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a\ngeneralized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring\nsafety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural\nerror terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system,\nwhich is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the\ncase when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the minimum safe\ndistance between them. In this way, we change the tracking velocity profile\nproblem into a state- feedback stabilization problem with respect to the target\ncurve.

We assume that the Standard Model is valid up to certain, high,\nenergy scale $\\Lambda$ and use the framework of the effective field theory to\ndescribe physics below that scale. Performing numerical simulations with\ndifferent values of the scale $\\Lambda$ we are able to extend our previous\nanalysis and determine its range of validity.\n  We study domain walls interpolating between the physical electroweak vacuum\nand the vacuum appearing at very high field strengths. These domain walls could\nbe formed from non-homogeneous configurations of the Higgs field produced by\nquantum fluctuations during inflation or thermal fluctuations during reheating.\n  Our numerical simulations show that evolution of Higgs domain walls is rather\ninsensitive to interactions beyond the Standard Model as long as masses of new\nparticles are grater than $10^{12}\\ \\textrm{GeV}$. For lower values of\n$\\Lambda$ the RG improved effective potential is strongly modified at field\nstrengths crucial to the evolution of domain walls. For instance its minima\nbecome degenerate for $\\Lambda$ around $10^{11}\\ \\textrm{GeV}$. We find that\neven in the case when the minima of the potential are nearly degenerate Higgs\ndomain walls decayed shortly after their formation for generic initial\nconditions. On the other hand, in simulations with specifically chosen initial\nconditions Higgs domain walls can live longer and enter the scaling regime.\n  We also determine the energy spectrum of gravitational waves produced by\ndecaying domain walls of the Higgs field. For generic initial field\nconfigurations the amplitude of the signal is too small to be observed in\npresent and planned detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 17:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

While such large numbers\nwill help reduce statistical uncertainties, the control of systematics in\ncluster masses becomes ever more crucial. Here we examine the effects of an\nimportant source of systematic uncertainty in galaxy-based cluster mass\nestimation techniques: the presence of significant dynamical substructure.\nDynamical substructure manifests as dynamically distinct subgroups in\nphase-space, indicating an 'unrelaxed' state. This issue affects around a\nquarter of clusters in a generally selected sample. We employ a set of mock\nclusters whose masses have been measured homogeneously with commonly-used\ngalaxy-based mass estimation techniques (kinematic, richness, caustic, radial\nmethods). We use these to study how the relation between observationally\nestimated and true cluster mass depends on the presence of substructure, as\nidentified by various popular diagnostics. We find that the scatter for an\nensemble of clusters does not increase dramatically for clusters with dynamical\nsubstructure. However, we find a systematic bias for all methods, such that\nclusters with significant substructure have higher measured masses than their\nrelaxed counterparts. This bias depends on cluster mass: the most massive\nclusters are largely unaffected by the presence of significant substructure,\nbut masses are significantly overestimated for lower mass clusters, by\n$\\sim10\\%$ at $10^{14}$ and $\\geq20\\%$ for $\\leq10^{13.5}$.

At the same time, a primary user emulation (PUE) attacker can send\nfalsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing\nthe available channel. The best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply\nhave not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study optimal\nPUE attack strategies by formulating an online learning problem where the\nattacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot\nbased on its attacking experience. The challenge in our problem is that since\nthe PUE attack happens in the spectrum sensing phase, the attacker cannot\nobserve the reward on the attacked channel. To address this challenge, we\nutilize the attacker's observation capability. We propose online learning-based\nattacking strategies based on the attacker's observation capabilities. Through\nour analysis, we show that with no observation within the attacking slot, the\nattacker loses on the regret order, and with the observation of at least one\nchannel, there is a significant improvement on the attacking performance.\nObservation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit to the\nattacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of\nobservations required to achieve the minimum constant factor.

The length of such route\nequals, in an edge-weighted tree, twice the total weight of all edges of the\ntree and this is asymptotically optimal over all exploration strategies. This\npaper considers a variant of such search strategies where the length of each\nroute is bounded by a positive integer $B$ (e.g. due to limited energy\nresources of the searcher). The objective is to cover all the edges of a tree\n$T$ using the minimum number of routes, each starting and ending at the root\nand each being of length at most $B$. To this end, we analyze the following\nnatural greedy tree traversal process that is based on decomposing a depth\nfirst search traversal into a sequence of limited length routes. Given any\narbitrary depth first search traversal $R$ of the tree $T$, we cover $R$ with\nroutes $R_1,\\ldots,R_l$, each of length at most $B$ such that: $R_i$ starts at\nthe root, reaches directly the farthest point of $R$ visited by $R_{i-1}$, then\n$R_i$ continues along the path $R$ as far as possible, and finally $R_i$\nreturns to the root. We call the above algorithm \\emph{piecemeal-DFS} and we\nprove that it achieves the asymptotically minimal number of routes $l$,\nregardless of the choice of $R$. Our analysis also shows that the total length\nof the traversal (and thus the traversal time) of piecemeal-DFS is\nasymptotically minimum over all energy-constrained exploration strategies. The\nfact that $R$ can be chosen arbitrarily means that the exploration strategy can\nbe constructed in an online fashion when the input tree $T$ is not known in\nadvance. Surprisingly, our results show that depth first search is efficient\nfor energy constrained exploration of trees, even though it is known that the\nsame does not hold for energy constrained exploration of arbitrary graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 19:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 13:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

In this work, we write the equations governing the dynamics\nof thermal tides in a local vertically-stratified section of a rotating\nplanetary atmosphere by taking into account the effects of the complete\nCoriolis acceleration on tidal waves. This allows us to derive analytically the\ntidal torque and the tidally dissipated energy, which we use to discuss the\npossible regimes of tidal dissipation and examine the key role played by\nstratification.\n  In agreement with early studies, we find that the frequency dependence of the\nthermal atmospheric tidal torque in the vicinity of synchronization can be\napproximated by a Maxwell model. This behaviour corresponds to weakly stably\nstratified or convective fluid layers, as observed in ADLM2016a. A strong\nstable stratification allows gravity waves to propagate, which makes the tidal\ntorque become negligible. The transition is continuous between these two\nregimes. The traditional approximation appears to be valid in thin atmospheres\nand in regimes where the rotation frequency is dominated by the forcing or the\nbuoyancy frequencies.\n  Depending on the stability of their atmospheres with respect to convection,\nobserved exoplanets can be tidally driven toward synchronous or asynchronous\nfinal rotation rates.

However, while the\nrole played by bulk dislocations is relatively well-understood, the\ncontribution of grain boundaries (GBs) has only recently begun to be studied.\nGB plasticity is known to play a key role along with bulk plasticity under a\nwide range of conditions, such as dynamic recovery, superplasticity, severe\nplastic deformation , etc., and developing models capable of simultaneously\ncapturing GB and bulk plasticity has become a topic of high relevance. In this\npaper we develop a thermodynamically-consistent polycrystal plasticity model\ncapable of simulating a variety of grain boundary-mediated plastic processes in\nconjunction with bulk dislocation slip. The model starts from the description\nof a single crystal and creates lattice strain-free polycrystalline\nconfigurations by using a specially-designed multiplicative decomposition\ndeveloped by the authors. This leads to the introduction of a particular class\nof geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) that define fundamental GB\nfeatures such as misorientation and inclination. The evolution of the system is\nbased on an energy functional that uses a non-standard function of the GND\ntensor to account for the grain boundary energy, as well as for the standard\nelastic energy. Our implementation builds on smooth descriptions of GBs\ninspired on diffuse-interface models of grain evolution for numerical\nconvenience. We demonstrate the generality and potential of the methodology by\nsimulating a wide variety of phenomena such as shear-induced GB sliding,\ncoupled GB motion, curvature-induced grain rotation and shrinkage, and\npolygonization via dislocation sub-grain formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 21:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

When such videos are sub-sampled to play fast-forward, as in the\nincreasingly popular forms of timelapse and hyperlapse videos, these temporal\nvariations are exacerbated and appear as visually disturbing high frequency\nflickering. Previous techniques to photometrically stabilize videos typically\nrely on computing dense correspondences between video frames, and use these\ncorrespondences to remove all color changes in the video sequences. However,\nthis approach is limited in fast-forward videos that often have large content\nchanges and also might exhibit changes in scene illumination that should be\npreserved. In this work, we propose a novel photometric stabilization algorithm\nfor fast-forward videos that is robust to large content-variation across\nframes. We compute pairwise color and tone transformations between neighboring\nframes and smooth these pair-wise transformations while taking in account the\npossibility of scene/content variations. This allows us to eliminate\nhigh-frequency fluctuations, while still adapting to real variations in scene\ncharacteristics. We evaluate our technique on a new dataset consisting of\ncontrolled synthetic and real videos, and demonstrate that our techniques\noutperforms the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 02:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

One is based on the Fisher information metric, which\nis invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the\nother is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which\nreflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we\npropose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework\nconnecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We\nprimarily considered a discrete case consisting of $n$ elements and studied the\ngeometry of the probability simplex $S_{n-1}$, which is the set of all\nprobability distributions over $n$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was\nintroduced in $S_{n-1}$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from\ndistribution ${\\mathbf{p}}$ to distribution ${\\mathbf{q}}$, where\n${\\mathbf{p}}$, ${\\mathbf{q}} \\in S_{n-1}$. We relaxed the optimal\ntransportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal\nsolution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The\nentropy-relaxed optimal cost $C({\\mathbf{p}}, {\\mathbf{q}})$ was\ncomputationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but\ndoes not define a distance because it is not minimized at\n${\\mathbf{p}}={\\mathbf{q}}$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the\ncomputational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the\nmanifold $S_{n-1} \\times S_{n-1}$ of optimal transportation plans.

We investigate the behavior of the\nclosed-loop dynamics for a two agent mutual pursuit system in which each agent\nemploys the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent\nand a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control\nparameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria wherein\nthe agents move on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes\nperpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacon. As the common radius\nand distances from the beacon are determined by choice of parameters in the\nfeedback law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in\na three-dimensional setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 04:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

In the case of diffusion in\ninhomogeneous media, distinct spatial domains in the system may yield distinct\nparticle hopping rates. Starting from the master equations (MEs) governing\ndiffusion in inhomogeneous media we derive here, for arbitrary spatial\ndimensions, the deterministic lattice equations (DLEs) specifying the average\nparticle number at each lattice site for randomly diffusing particles in\ninhomogeneous media. We consider the case of free diffusion with no steric\nconstraints on the maximum particle number per lattice site as well as the case\nof diffusion under steric constraints imposing a maximum particle\nconcentration. We find, for both transient and asymptotic regimes, excellent\nagreement between the DLEs and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the MEs. The\nDLEs provide a computationally efficient method for predicting the (average)\ndistribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media, with the\nnumber of DLEs associated with a given system being independent of the number\nof particles in the system. From the DLEs we obtain general analytic\nexpressions for the steady-state particle distributions for free diffusion and,\nin special cases, diffusion under steric constraints in inhomogeneous media. We\nfind that, in the steady state of the system, the average fraction of particles\nin a given domain is independent of most system properties, such as the\narrangement and shape of domains, and only depends on the number of lattice\nsites in each domain, the hopping rates, the number of distinct particle\nspecies, and the total number of particles of each particle species in the\nsystem.

This theory has already a long history that\nessentially started with two remarkable papers of Tatsujir\\^o Shimizu that were\npublished in 1931. The elements $\\phi(z)$ of the group are defined by the\nautomorphic equation $f(\\phi(z))=f(z)$, were $f(z)$ is entire. Tatsujir\\^o\nShimizu also refers to the functions of this group as those functions that are\ndetermined by $f^{-1}\\circ f$. He proved many remarkable properties of those\nautomorphic functions. He indicated how they induce a beautiful geometric\nstructure on the complex plane. Those structures were termed by Tatsujir\\^o\nShimizu, the system of normal polygonal domains, and the more refined system of\nthe fundamental domains of $f(z)$. The last system if exists tiles up the\ncomplex plane with remarkable geometric tiles that are conformally mapped to\none another by the automorphic functions. In the Ph.D thesis of the author,\nthose tiles were also called the system of the maximal domains of $f(z)$. One\ncan not avoid noticing the many similarities between this automorphic group and\nits accompanying geometric structures and analytic properties, and the more\ntame discrete groups that appear in the theory of hyperbolic geometry and also\nthe arithmetic groups in number theory. This paper pursues further the theory\ninitiated by Tatsujir\\^o Shimizu, towards understanding global properties of\nthe automorphic group, rather than just understanding the properties of the\nindividual automorphic functions. We hope to be able in sequel papers to\ngeneralize arithmetic and analytic tools such as the Selberg trace formula, to\nthis new setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 07:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

In this paper, we take advantage of the full-sky and high quality\npolarization data released by the \\textit{Planck} satellite to provide an\nindependent, complementary, and up-to-date estimation of the contamination\nlevel of the quasar optical polarization data by the Galactic dust.

We further found\narguments suggesting that Galactic thermal dust cannot fully account for the\nreported quasar optical polarization alignments. Based on the measurements of\nthe ratio of the polarized intensity of the dust in the submillimeter to the\ndegree of linear polarization of the quasar in the optical, we provide a new\nand independent quality criteria to apply to the quasar optical polarization\nsample.

Spatial facility location models have successfully predicted the\noutcome of competition in a variety of scenarios. In a typical facility\nlocation game, users/customers/voters are mapped to a metric space representing\ntheir preferences, and each player picks a point (facility) in that space. In\nmost facility location games considered in the literature, users are assumed to\nact deterministically: given the facilities chosen by the players, users are\nattracted to their nearest facility. This paper introduces facility location\ngames with probabilistic attraction, dubbed Shapley facility location games,\ndue to a surprising connection to the Shapley value. The specific attraction\nfunction we adopt in this model is aligned with the recent findings of the\nbehavioral economics literature on choice prediction. Given this model, our\nfirst main result is that Shapley facility location games are potential games;\nhence, they possess pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the latter is true for any\ncompact user space, any user distribution over that space, and any number of\nplayers. Note that this is in sharp contrast to Hotelling facility location\ngames. In our second main result we show that under the assumption that players\ncan compute an approximate best response, approximate equilibrium profiles can\nbe learned efficiently by the players via dynamics. Our third main result is a\nbound on the Price of Anarchy of this class of games, as well as showing the\nbound is tight. Ultimately, we show that player payoffs coincide with their\nShapley value in a coalition game, where coalition gains are the social welfare\nof the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 08:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 16:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

It is proved that the proposed NMIM can\nsufficiently describe two key characters of big data: rare events finding and\nlarge diversities of events. Based on NMIM, we first propose an effective\ncompressed encoding mode for data storage, and then discuss the channel\ntransmission over some typical channel models.

Dynamic Flows have been used to model many\nproblems including traffic congestion, hop-routing of packets and evacuation\nprotocols in buildings. While the basic problem of moving the maximal amount of\nsupplies from sources to sinks is polynomial time solvable, natural minor\nmodifications can make it NP-hard.\n  One such modification is that flows be confluent, i.e., all flows leaving a\nvertex must leave along the same edge.

Under the assumption of the\ncancellation of the vacuum energy, the dilaton develops a very small mass at\n2-loop order. As a result, a flat direction is present in the classical\ndilaton-Higgs potential at zero temperature while the quantum potential admits\ntwo (almost) degenerate local minima with unbroken and broken eletroweak\nsymmetry. We found that the cosmological electroweak phase transition in this\nmodel can only be triggered by a QCD chiral symmetry breaking phase transition\nat low temperatures, $T\\lesssim 132$ MeV.

Understanding the mechanisms controlling the occurrence of rapid,\ndynamic slip radiating seismic waves (i.e. earthquakes) or slow, silent slip\n(i.e. SSEs) is a fundamental point in the estimation of seismic hazard along\nsubduction zones. On top of showing slower rupture propagation velocity than\nearthquakes, SSEs exhibit different scaling relationships, which could reflect\neither different physical mechanisms or an intriguing lack of observations.\nLike earthquakes, SSEs are bound to occur along unstable portions of active\nfaults, raising the question of the physical control of the mode of slip\n(seismic or aseismic) along these sections. Here, we use the numerical\nimplementation of a simple rate-weakening fault model to explain the\nspontaneous occurrence, the characteristics and the scaling relationship of\nSSEs and earthquakes. We show that the simplest of fault geometrical\ncomplexities with uniform friction properties can reproduce slow and fast\nearthquakes without appealing to complex rheologies or mechanisms.

It enables decomposing and quantifying\nmaterials with different atomic numbers by imaging cargo at two different x-ray\nenergies, or dual energy (DE) radiography. The performance of both single\nenergy and DE radiography depends on beam energy, beam filtration, radiation\ndose, object size, and object content. The purpose of this work was to perform\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative investigations of the image quality\nin MV radiography depending on the above parameters. A digital phantom was\ndesigned including Fe background with thicknesses of 2cm, 6cm, and 18cm, and\nmaterials samples of Polyethylene, Fe, Pb, and U. The single energy images were\ngenerated at x-ray beam energies 3.5MV, 6MV, and 9MV. The DE material\ndecomposed images were generated using interlaced low and high energy beams\n3.5/6MV and 6/9MV. The x-rays beams were filtered by low-Z (Polyethylene) and\nhigh-Z (Pb) filters with variable thicknesses. The radiation output of the\naccelerator was kept constant for all beam energies. The image quality metrics\nwas signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the particular sample over a particular\nbackground. It was found that the SNR depends on the above parameters in a\ncomplex way, but can be optimized by selecting a particular set of parameters.\nFor some imaging setups increased filter thicknesses, while strongly absorbed\nthe beams, increased the SNR of material decomposed images. Beam hardening due\nto polyenergetic x-ray spectra resulted in material decomposition errors, but\nthis could be addressed using region of interest decomposition. It was shown\nthat it is not feasible to separate the materials with close atomic numbers\nusing the DE method.

The\nabove procedure makes the instances used to compute the gradients no longer\nindependently sampled from the training data set. Then does the distributed SGD\nmethod have desirable convergence properties in this practical situation? In\nthis paper, we give answers to this question. First, we give a mathematical\nformulation for the practical data processing procedure in distributed machine\nlearning, which we call data partition with global/local shuffling. We observe\nthat global shuffling is equivalent to without-replacement sampling if the\nshuffling operations are independent. We prove that SGD with global shuffling\nhas convergence guarantee in both convex and non-convex cases. An interesting\nfinding is that, the non-convex tasks like deep learning are more suitable to\napply shuffling comparing to the convex tasks. Second, we conduct the\nconvergence analysis for SGD with local shuffling. The convergence rate for\nlocal shuffling is slower than that for global shuffling, since it will lose\nsome information if there's no communication between partitioned data. Finally,\nwe consider the situation when the permutation after shuffling is not uniformly\ndistributed (insufficient shuffling), and discuss the condition under which\nthis insufficiency will not influence the convergence rate. Our theoretical\nresults provide important insights to large-scale machine learning, especially\nin the selection of data processing methods in order to achieve faster\nconvergence and good speedup. Our theoretical findings are verified by\nextensive experiments on logistic regression and deep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 14:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

A scientific basis for estimating the capacity of a given\nface representation will not only benefit the evaluation and comparison of\ndifferent representation methods, but will also establish an upper bound on the\nscalability of an automatic face recognition system.

By explicitly accounting for the manifold\nstructure of the representation as well two different sources of\nrepresentational noise: epistemic (model) uncertainty and aleatoric (data)\nvariability, our approach is able to estimate the capacity of a given face\nrepresentation.

A key step in data integration is entity consolidation. It\ntakes a collection of clusters of duplicate records as input and produces a\nsingle \"golden record\" for each cluster, which contains the canonical value for\neach attribute. Truth discovery and data fusion methods, as well as Master Data\nManagement (MDM) systems, can be used for entity consolidation. However, to\nachieve better results, the variant values (i.e., values that are logically the\nsame with different formats) in the clusters need to be consolidated before\napplying these methods.\n  For this purpose, we propose a data-driven method to standardize the variant\nvalues based on two observations: (1) the variant values usually can be\ntransformed to the same representation (e.g., \"Mary Lee\" and \"Lee, Mary\") and\n(2) the same transformation often appears repeatedly across different clusters\n(e.g., transpose the first and last name). Our approach first uses an\nunsupervised method to generate groups of value pairs that can be transformed\nin the same way (i.e., they share a transformation).

Experimental evidence has shown that one\npathway for waste clearance, termed intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD), is\nthe rapid drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) via basement membranes (BM) of\nthe smooth muscle cells (SMC) of cerebral arteries and its failure is closely\nassociated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously\nshown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to\ndrive waste clearance. Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a\nmechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,\nthat is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased\nneuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through\nthe vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed\nin mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as\nrecommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally\nand physically active.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 11:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 10:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Here, we propose a scheme for an\noptical bidirectional transducer using a spatial light modulator. By exploiting\nthe principle of time-reversal symmetry of light scattering, two-dimensional\nreference-free measurement and modulation of optical fields are realized.

The\nsequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered\nan information source with unknown underlying structure. $\\epsilon$-machines\nare discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on\ndifferent future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).\nThey artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive\nmanner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the\nsource.

It is\nfound that the fraction of the SDE $\\geq$M1.0-class flares (including spikes)\nin Cycle 24 exceeds that in Cycle 23 in all three temporal parameters at the\nmaximum phase and in the decay time during the ascending cycle phase. However,\nCycles 23 and 24 barely differ in the fraction of the SDE C-class flares. The\ntemporal parameters of SDEs, their fraction, and consequently the relationship\nbetween the SDE and LDE flares do not remain constant, but they reveal regular\nchanges within individual cycles and during the transition from one cycle to\nanother. In all phases of all four cycles, these changes have the character of\npronounced, large-amplitude \"quasi-biennial\" oscillations (QBOs). In different\ncycles and at the separate phases of individual cycles, such QBOs are\nsuperimposed on various systematic trends displayed by the analyzed temporal\nflare parameters.
