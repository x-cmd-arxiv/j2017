The dataset was recorded using a static\nKinect 2 sensor which is commonly used on many robotic platforms. The dataset\ncomprises of RGB-D images, point cloud data, automatically generated skeleton\ntracks in addition to crowdsourced annotations. Furthermore, we also describe\nthe methodology used to acquire annotations through crowdsourcing. Finally some\nactivity recognition benchmarks are presented using current state-of-the-art\ntechniques. We believe that this dataset is particularly suitable as a testbed\nfor activity recognition research but it can also be applicable for other\ncommon tasks in robotics/computer vision research such as object detection and\nhuman skeleton tracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 16:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

This method is used in the\npresent work to evaluate thermodynamical quantities within the two-dimensional\nnonlinear sigma model, which, apart from providing a technically simpler\ntesting ground, shares some common features with Yang-Mills theories, like\nasymptotic freedom, trace anomaly and the nonperturbative generation of a mass\ngap. The present application confirms that nonperturbative results can be\nreadily generated solely by considering the lowest-order (quasi-particle)\ncontribution to the thermodynamic effective potential, when this quantity is\nrequired to be renormalization group invariant.

The analysis\nis carried out in terms of the compact group approach reformulated in a way\nthat allows one to analyze the role of different contributions to the\npermittivity distribution in the system. It is shown that the asymmetrical\nBruggeman model (ABM) is physically inconsistent since the electromagnetic\ninteraction between previously added constituents and those being added is\nreplaced by the interaction of the latter with recursively formed effective\nmedium. The overall changes in the effective permittivity due to addition of\none constituent include the contributions from both constituents and depend on\nthe system structure before the addition. Ignoring the contribution from one of\nthe constituents, we obtain generalized versions of the original ABM mixing\nrules.

High-level abstractions\ncan often lead to good strategic decision making, but tactical decision quality\nmay suffer due to lost details. A competing method is to sample the search\nspace which often leads to good tactical performance in simple scenarios, but\npoor high-level planning.\n  We propose to use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to select among a\nlimited set of abstract action choices, and to utilize the remaining\ncomputation time for game tree search to improve low level tactics. The CNN is\ntrained by supervised learning on game states labelled by Puppet Search, a\nstrategic search algorithm that uses action abstractions. The network is then\nused to select a script --- an abstract action --- to produce low level actions\nfor all units. Subsequently, the game tree search algorithm improves the\ntactical actions of a subset of units using a limited view of the game state\nonly considering units close to opponent units.\n  Experiments in the microRTS game show that the combined algorithm results in\nhigher win-rates than either of its two independent components and other\nstate-of-the-art microRTS agents.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of a\nconvolutional network to play a full RTS game on standard game maps, as\nprevious work has focused on sub-problems, such as combat, or on very small\nmaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Our model, while bypassing the\nprocess of blur kernel estimation, significantly reduces the test time which is\nnecessary for practical applications. The experiments on the benchmark datasets\nprove the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art blind deblurring algorithms both quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

We investigate\nthe range of model parameters that is consistent with current observational\nconstraints on the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The\namplitude of primordial gravitational waves in these models is shown to be\naccessible by future laser interferometers such as DECIGO. We also demonstrate\nhow these observables are affected by the temperature and equation of state\nduring reheating. We find that a large subset of this model can support\ninstantaneous reheating, as well as very low reheating temperatures of order a\nfew MeV, giving rise to interesting consequences for dark-matter production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 04:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 18:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-20"}

A leading candidate is\nFarhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates\nbetween applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian.\nHere, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general\nfamilies of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating\nOperator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of\nunitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a\nfixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz\nsupports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of\nstates than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a\nbroad array of application areas.

More efficient\nimplementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating\noperator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact\noptimization, and sampling problems.

One key difference lies in the role of Goldstone bosons, which for\nspacetime symmetries includes a subset which are inessential for the non-linear\nrealisation and hence can be eliminated. In this paper we address two important\nissues that arise when eliminating inessential Goldstones.\n  The first concerns the elimination itself, which is often performed by\nimposing so-called inverse Higgs constraints. Contrary to claims in the\nliterature, there are a series of conditions on the structure constants which\nmust be satisfied to employ the inverse Higgs phenomenon, and we discuss which\nparametrisation of the coset element is the most effective in this regard. We\nalso consider generalisations of the standard inverse Higgs constraints, which\ncan include integrating out inessential Goldstones at low energies, and prove\nthat under certain assumptions these give rise to identical effective field\ntheories for the essential Goldstones.\n  Secondly, we consider mappings between non-linear realisations that differ\nboth in the coset element and the algebra basis. While these can always be\nrelated to each other by a point transformation, remarkably, the inverse Higgs\nconstraints are not necessarily mapped onto each other under this\ntransformation. We discuss the physical implications of this non-mapping, with\na particular emphasis on the coset space corresponding to the spontaneous\nbreaking of the Anti-De Sitter isometries by a Minkowski probe brane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 18:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box\nsimulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence\n(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in\nthe presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to\ntest the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that\naccretion remains efficient for marginally coupled particles (dimensionless\nstopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI turbulence.\nThough more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this\neffect is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability. As a\nresult, the overall effect of turbulence on the accretion rate is mainly\nreflected in the changes in the thickness of the dust layer. On the other hand,\nwe find that the efficiency of pebble accretion for strongly coupled particles\n(down to tau_s ~ 0.01) can be modestly reduced by strong turbulence for\nlow-mass cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 18:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Optical and near-IR observations reveal that\nnearly 60% of disk galaxies in the local universe are barred, thus it is\nimportant to understand the relationship between bars and star formation in\ndisk galaxies. Recent observational results imply that the Milky Way quenched\nabout 9-10 Gyr ago, at the transition between the cessation of the growth of\nthe kinematically hot, old, metal-poor thick disk and the kinematically colder,\nyounger, and more metal-rich thin disk. Although perhaps coincidental, the\nquenching episode could also be related to the formation of the bar. To explore\nthe relation between bar formation and star formation in gas rich galaxies\nquantitatively, we simulated gas-rich disk isolated galaxies. Our simulations\ninclude prescriptions for star formation, stellar feedback, and for regulating\nthe multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that the action of stellar bar\nefficiently quenches star formation, reducing the star-formation rate by a\nfactor of 10 in less than 1 Gyr. Analytical and self-consistent galaxy\nsimulations with bars suggest that the action of the stellar bar increases the\ngas random motions within the co-rotation radius of the bar. Indeed, we detect\nan increase in the gas velocity dispersion up to 20-35 km/s at the end of the\nbar formation phase. The star-formation efficiency decreases rapidly, and in\nall of our models, the bar quenches the star formation in the galaxy. The\nstar-formation efficiency is much lower in simulated barred compared to\nunbarred galaxies and more rapid bar formation implies more rapid quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 21:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Providing accurate mobile app recommendation for users becomes\nan imperative task. Conventional approaches mainly focus on learning users'\npreferences and app features to predict the user-app ratings.

Specifically, we utilize a tensor-based framework to\neffectively integrate user's preference, app category information and\nmulti-view features to facilitate the performance of app rating prediction. The\nmultidimensional structure is employed to capture the hidden relationships\nbetween multiple app categories with multi-view features. We develop an\nefficient factorization method which applies Tucker decomposition to learn the\nfull-order interactions within multiple categories and features. Furthermore,\nwe employ a group $\\ell_{1}-$norm regularization to learn the group-wise\nfeature importance of each view with respect to each app category.

Tensor network\n(TN) contraction is an algorithmic method that can efficiently simulate some\nquantum circuits, often greatly reducing the computational cost over methods\nthat simulate the full Hilbert space. In this study we implement a tensor\nnetwork contraction program for simulating quantum circuits using multi-core\ncompute nodes. We show simulation results for the Max-Cut problem on 3- through\n7-regular graphs using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA),\nsuccessfully simulating up to 100 qubits. We test two different methods for\ngenerating the ordering of tensor index contractions: one is based on the tree\ndecomposition of the line graph, while the other generates ordering using a\nstraight-forward stochastic scheme. Through studying instances of QAOA\ncircuits, we show the expected result that as the treewidth of the quantum\ncircuit's line graph decreases, TN contraction becomes significantly more\nefficient than simulating the whole Hilbert space. The results in this work\nsuggest that tensor contraction methods are superior only when simulating\nMax-Cut/QAOA with graphs of regularities approximately five and below. Insight\ninto this point of equal computational cost helps one determine which\nsimulation method will be more efficient for a given quantum circuit. The\nstochastic contraction method outperforms the line graph based method only when\nthe time to calculate a reasonable tree decomposition is prohibitively\nexpensive. Finally, we release our software package, qTorch (Quantum TensOR\nContraction Handler), intended for general quantum circuit simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 17:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

However, such an event could\nprovide us a good opportunity to study the evolution of embedded Alfv\\'enic\nfluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma heating\ndirectly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998\nis tracked to the location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside\nthe ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence rate of 21.7% and at broadband\nfrequencies from 4$\\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When the ICME\npropagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\\'enicity decreases significantly, and AFs are\nrare and only found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate\ndecreasing to 3.0%. At the same time, the magnetic field intensity at the\nAF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME expansion effect.\nThe energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated\nhere. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the\nturbulence cascade rate at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at\nthe AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain as the decrease of magnetic field\nintensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many AFs, it\nreduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation\nrate within the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$,\nwhich satisfies the requirement of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2\n$J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$.

To alleviate the negative effects from makeup, we first\ngenerate non-makeup images from makeup ones, and then use the synthesized\nnon-makeup images for further verification. Two adversarial networks in BLAN\nare integrated in an end-to-end deep network, with the one on pixel level for\nreconstructing appealing facial images and the other on feature level for\npreserving identity information. These two networks jointly reduce the sensing\ngap between makeup and non-makeup images. Moreover, we make the generator well\nconstrained by incorporating multiple perceptual losses.

However, in the real-world applications, original data\noften contain noises and outliers that lead to unreliable graphs. In addition,\ndifferent views may have different contributions to data clustering. In this\npaper, a novel Multiview Subspace Clustering method unifying Adaptive\nneighbours and Metric learning (MSCAM), is proposed to address the above\nproblems. In this method, we use the subspace representations of different\nviews to adaptively learn a consensus similarity matrix, uncovering the\nsubspace structure and avoiding noisy nature of original data. For all views,\nwe also learn different Mahalanobis matrixes that parameterize the squared\ndistances and consider the contributions of different views. Further, we\nconstrain the graph constructed by the similarity matrix to have exact c (c is\nthe number of clusters) connected components.

In\nthe training stage, an objective function is often adopted to optimize the\nmodel parameters.

Most of the existing works on multi-view graph embedding aim to\nfind a shared common node embedding across all the views of the graph by\ncombining the different views in a specific way. Hub detection, as another\nessential topic in graph mining has also drawn extensive attentions in recent\nyears, especially in the context of brain network analysis. Both the graph\nembedding and hub detection relate to the node clustering structure of graphs.\nThe multi-view graph embedding usually implies the node clustering structure of\nthe graph based on the multiple views, while the hubs are the boundary-spanning\nnodes across different node clusters in the graph and thus may potentially\ninfluence the clustering structure of the graph. However, none of the existing\nworks in multi-view graph embedding considered the hubs when learning the\nmulti-view embeddings. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the hub\ndetection task into the multi-view graph embedding framework so that the two\ntasks could benefit each other. Specifically, we propose an auto-weighted\nframework of Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection (MVGE-HD) for brain\nnetwork analysis. The MVGE-HD framework learns a unified graph embedding across\nall the views while reducing the potential influence of the hubs on blurring\nthe boundaries between node clusters in the graph, thus leading to a clear and\ndiscriminative node clustering structure for the graph.

All players accept the offer. However, due to the\npossibility of unforeseen circumstances, each player has a fixed probability of\nbeing unable to participate in the game, unlike similar models which assume\nvoluntary participation. We first study how prescribed stochastic opting-out\naffects cooperation in finite populations. Moreover, in the model, cooperation\nis favored by natural selection over both neutral drift and defection if return\non investment exceeds a threshold value defined solely by the population size,\ngame size, and a player's probability of opting-out. Ultimately, increasing the\nprobability that each player is unable to fulfill her promise of participating\nin the public goods game facilitates natural selection of cooperators. We also\nuse adaptive dynamics to study the coevolution of cooperation and opting-out\nbehavior. However, given rare mutations minutely different from the original\npopulation, an analysis based on adaptive dynamics suggests that the over time\nthe population will tend towards complete defection and non-participation, and\nsubsequently, from there, participating cooperators will stand a chance to\nemerge by neutral drift. Nevertheless, increasing the probability of\nnon-participation decreases the rate at which the population tends towards\ndefection when participating. Our work sheds light on understanding how\nstochastic opting-out emerges in the first place and its role in the evolution\nof cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 02:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

While most of\nthe prior works focus on a setting in which the number of data points involved\nin a measurement is two, this work explores a generalized setting in which the\nnumber can be more than two. Motivated by applications particularly in machine\nlearning and channel coding, we consider two types of measurements: (1)\nhomogeneity measurement which indicates whether or not the associated data\npoints belong to the same community; (2) parity measurement which denotes the\nmodulo-2 sum of the values of the data points.

Such calculations,\ninvolving large, sparse interaction matrices, expose the limitation of\nconventional data-and-computation reordering techniques for improving space and\ntime locality on modern computer memory hierarchies. We introduce a novel\nmethod for obtaining a matrix permutation that renders a desirable sparsity\nprofile. The method is distinguished by the guiding principle to obtain a\nprofile that is block-sparse with dense blocks. Our profile model and measure\ncapture the essential properties affecting space and time locality, and permit\nvariation in sparsity profile without imposing a restriction to a fixed\npattern. The second distinction lies in an efficient algorithm for obtaining a\ndesirable profile, via exploring and exploiting multi-scale cluster structure\nhidden in but intrinsic to the data. The algorithm accomplishes its task with\nkey components for lower-dimensional embedding with data-specific principal\nfeature axes, hierarchical data clustering, multi-level matrix compression\nstorage, and multi-level interaction computations. We provide experimental\nresults from case studies with two important data analysis algorithms. The\nresulting performance is remarkably comparable to the BLAS performance for the\nbest-case interaction governed by a regularly banded matrix with the same\nsparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 03:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This paper\nproposes an adversarial discriminative feature learning framework to close the\nsensing gap via adversarial learning on both raw-pixel space and compact\nfeature space. This framework integrates cross-spectral face hallucination and\ndiscriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In the\npixel space, we make use of generative adversarial networks to perform\ncross-spectral face hallucination. An elaborate two-path model is introduced to\nalleviate the lack of paired images, which gives consideration to both global\nstructures and local textures. In the feature space, an adversarial loss and a\nhigh-order variance discrepancy loss are employed to measure the global and\nlocal discrepancy between two heterogeneous distributions respectively.

Various solutions to this very\nhard problem have been provided. In contrast to existing literature, we change\nthe underlying assumptions of the problem definition: we adapt the problem for\nsystems that store relations in memory, and use complex specification\nlanguages, e.g., Datalog. In our framework, we decompose complex queries into\nprimitive searches that select tuples in a relation for which an equality\npredicate holds. A primitive search can be accelerated by an index exhibiting a\nworst-case run-time complexity of log-linear time in the size of the output\nresult of the primitive search. However, the overheads associated with\nmaintaining indexes are very costly in terms of memory and computing time.\n  In this work, we present an optimal polynomial-time algorithm that finds the\nminimal set of indexes of a relation for a given set of primitive searches. An\nindex may cover more than one primitive search due to the algebraic properties\nof the search predicate, which is a conjunction of equalities over the\nattributes of a relation.

First, we present a general\nphenomenological analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in media based on\nthe dielectric tensor. Then, we calculate the microscopic electromagnetic\nresponse of the current and spin of conduction electrons subjected to $ \\alpha$\nand $M$, based on linear response theory and the Green's function method.\nFirstly, it is found that a large $\\alpha$ enhances the anisotropic properties\nof the system and enlarges the frequency range in which the electromagnetic\nwaves have hyperbolic dispersion surfaces and exhibit unusual propagations\nknown as negative refraction and backward waves. Secondly, we consider the\nelectromagnetic cross-correlation effects on the wave propagation. These\neffects stem from the lack of space inversion symmetry and yield $q$-linear\noff-diagonal components in the dielectric tensor. This induces a Rashba-induced\nbirefringence. In the presence of $M$, there arises an anomalous Hall effect\nand the dielectric tensor acquires off-diagonal components linear in $M$. These\ncomponents yield the Faraday effect and the Cotton-Mouton effect.

In this article, we propose a\nnon-wearable system for eye tracking and gaze detection with low complexity and\ncost. The proposed system provides a medium accuracy which makes it suitable\nfor general applications in which low cost and easy implementation is more\nimportant than achieving very precise gaze detection. The proposed method\nincludes pupil and marker detection using infrared image processing, and gaze\nevaluation using an interpolation-based strategy. The interpolation-based\nstrategy exploits the positions of the detected pupils and markers in a target\ncaptured image and also in some previously captured training images for\nestimating the position of a point that the user is gazing at.

The trajectory of the skyrmion can\nalso be modulated by periodically located VCMA gates, which protects the\nskyrmion from destruction by touching the track edge. In addition, the location\nof the skyrmion can be controlled by adjusting the driving pulse length in the\npresence of the VCMA effect. Our results provide guidelines for practical\nrealization of the skyrmion-based information channel, diode, and racetrack\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

IEEE has released the 802.11ad\nstandard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed communication. It adopts\nbeamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate for\nhigh path loss. In the Association Beamforming Training (A-BFT) phase of\nbeamforming (BF) training, a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to\ncontend for training opportunity. Due to the limited number of A-BFT slots,\nA-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios,\nresulting in inefficient training performance. Based on the evaluation of the\nIEEE 802.11ad standard and 802.11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave\nwireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT beam training and random access\nmechanism, including the Separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and Secondary Backoff A-BFT\n(SBA-BFT). The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide A-BFT slots into\ntwo regions by defining a new `E-A-BFT Length' field compared to the legacy\n802.11ad A-BFT, thereby maintaining compatibility when 802.11ay devices are\nmixed with 802.11ad devices. It can also reduce the collision probability in\ndense user scenarios greatly. The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff with very\nsmall overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not\nonly further reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots\nutilization. Furthermore, we propose a three-dimensional Markov model to\nanalyze the performance of the SBA-BFT. The analytical and simulation results\nshow that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training\nefficiency, which are beneficial to the optimization design of dense user\nwireless networks based on the IEEE 802.11ay standard and mmWave technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Surprisingly, even for the generic case of flow through a\nstraight pipe, there is little consensus regarding the influence of pulsation\non the transition threshold to turbulence: while most studies predict a\nmonotonically increasing threshold with pulsation frequency (i.e. Womersley\nnumber, $\\alpha$), others observe a decreasing threshold for identical\nparameters and only observe an increasing threshold at low $\\alpha$. In the\npresent study we apply recent advances in the understanding of transition in\nsteady shear flows to pulsating pipe flow. For moderate pulsation amplitudes we\nfind that the first instability encountered is subcritical (i.e. requiring\nfinite amplitude disturbances) and gives rise to localized patches of\nturbulence (\"puffs\") analogous to steady pipe flow. By monitoring the impact of\npulsation on the lifetime of turbulence we map the onset of turbulence in\nparameter space. Transition in pulsatile flow can be separated into three\nregimes. At small Womersley numbers the dynamics are dominated by the decay\nturbulence suffers during the slower part of the cycle and hence transition is\ndelayed significantly. As shown in this regime thresholds closely agree with\nestimates based on a quasi steady flow assumption only taking puff decay rates\ninto account. The transition point predicted in the zero $\\alpha$ limit equals\nto the critical point for steady pipe flow offset by the oscillation Reynolds\nnumber. In the high frequency limit puff lifetimes are identical to those in\nsteady pipe flow and hence the transition threshold appears to be unaffected by\nflow pulsation. In the intermediate frequency regime the transition threshold\nsharply drops (with increasing $\\alpha$) from the decay dominated (quasi\nsteady) threshold to the steady pipe flow level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

Object functions are closely related to hand-object interactions\nduring handling of a functional object; i.e., how the hand approaches the\nobject, which parts of the object and contact the hand, and the shape of the\nhand during interaction. Hand-object interactions are helpful for modeling\nobject functions.

We also show\nthat the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for\nchromium, as Cr I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen\nwhen we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models.\nWhile Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is\nvery well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower\nmetallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results\nstrongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar\nparameters results in a low star-to-star scatter ($0.04$ dex) in the Li\nabundances of our sample, with a mean value about $0.4$ dex lower than the\nprediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation\nbetween lithium depletion and stellar mass, but it is difficult to assess a\ncorrelation due to the limited mass range. We find two blue straggler stars,\nbased on their very depleted Li abundances. One of them shows intriguing\nabundance anomalies, including a possible zinc enhancement, suggesting that\nzinc may have been also produced by a former AGB companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 09:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

While some scholars\nare in the opinion that RES only adds complexity - as RES production is\nvolatile and stochastic - others share the opinion that RES has value in terms\nof energy savings, as well as capacity savings, and contributes to the\nreliability of an energy system. Instead of analyzing the losses as a result of\nadding RES, it should be focused on the overall system economics, as this is\nmore important than if more or less electricity is lost for whatever reason.\nEconomy of Scale (EoS) can have significant impact on project evaluation, and\ntherefore should be considered in medium- and long-term planning exercises. As\na result of not limiting RES to minimize losses within the system, the most\neconomic systems show penetration for photovoltaic of above 80 percent, and for\nWind of above 55 percent, on peak demand for both locations. This shows that\nsignificant energy out of RES is not used during the winter, as the demand is\nless than 50 percent of summer RES, adding value to the system, as RES saves\nfuel and increases system reliability by decreasing the required electricity\nfrom conventional generation. Dependent on the location, between 30 and 40\npercent of peak demand on renewable technologies are required before curtailing\ntakes place.

Our method is based on a simple idea that is surprisingly\neffective in helping to identify causes of poor performance, such as high\nparallelization overheads, lack of adequate parallelism, and memory effects.\nOur method relies on only the measurement of the run time of a baseline\nsequential program, the run time of the parallel program, the single-processor\nrun time of the parallel program, and the total amount of time processors spend\nidle, waiting for work.\n  In our proposed approach, we establish an equality between the observed\nparallel speedups and three terms that we call parallel work, idle time, and\nwork-inflation, where all terms except work inflation can be measured\nempirically, with precision. We then use the equality to calculate the\ndifficult-to-measure work-inflation term, which includes increased\ncommunication costs and memory effects due to parallel execution.

The second is the lack of spatial information for\nclassification. To tackle these two problems, in this paper, we propose a new\nframework for ELM based spectral-spatial classification of HSI, where\nprobabilistic modelling with sparse representation and weighted composite\nfeatures (WCF) are employed respectively to derive the op-timized output\nweights and extract spatial features. First, the ELM is represented as a\nconcave logarithmic likelihood function under statistical modelling using the\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP). Second, the sparse representation is applied to the\nLaplacian prior to effi-ciently determine a logarithmic posterior with a unique\nmaximum in order to solve the ill-posed problem of ELM. The variable splitting\nand the augmented Lagrangian are subsequently used to further reduce the\ncomputation complexity of the proposed algorithm and it has been proven a more\nefficient method for speed improvement. Third, the spatial information is\nextracted using the weighted compo-site features (WCFs) to construct the\nspectral-spatial classification framework. In addition, the lower bound of the\nproposed method is derived by a rigorous mathematical proof. Experimental\nresults on two publicly available HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethodology outperforms ELM and a number of state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 12:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

If A is of finite\ntype, then De Morgan laws hold on E in both the synaptic and spectral ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 12:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In essence, it combines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and\nreverse KL divergences into a unified objective function, thus it exploits the\ncomplementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively\ndiversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method\ndual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which, unlike GAN, has\ntwo discriminators; and together with a generator, it also has the analogy of a\nminimax game, wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data\ndistribution whilst another discriminator, conversely, favoring data from the\ngenerator, and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators.

The question addressed is whether, and,\nif so, under which circumstances, the presence of vortices has a significant\ncatalyzing effect on vacuum decay. After studying the existence and properties\nof vortices, we study their decay rate through quantum tunneling using a\nvariety of techniques.

We check the adequacy of a two-dimensional time-dependent\nmodel of a Cepheid-like variable with focus on its spectroscopic properties.\nWith the radiation-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD, we construct a two-dimensional\ntime-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid with $T_\\mathrm{eff}= 5600$ K, $\\log\ng=2.0$, solar metallicity, and a 2.8-day pulsation period.

The mean Doppler shift is non-zero and negative, -1 km/s, after\naveraging over several full periods and lines. This residual line-of-sight\nvelocity (related to the \"K-term\") is primarily caused by horizontal\ninhomogeneities, and consequently we interpret it as the familiar convective\nblueshift ubiquitously present in non-pulsating late-type stars. Limited\nstatistics prevent firm conclusions on the line asymmetries.

We define specious rules and show they\noffer a unifying framework which covers many types of previously proposed\nredundant or misleading association rules. After theoretical analysis, we\nintroduce practical algorithms for detecting and pruning out specious\nassociation rules efficiently under many key goodness measures, including\nmutual information and exact hypergeometric probabilities. We demonstrate that\nthe procedure greatly reduces the number of associations discovered, providing\nan elegant and effective solution to the problem of association mining\ndiscovering large numbers of misleading and redundant rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Unfortunately, in many situations the complete topology of this\nnetwork is empirically inaccessible, and one has to resort to probabilistic\ntechniques to infer it from limited information. While network reconstruction\nmethods have reached some degree of maturity in the case of single-layer\nnetworks (where nodes can be connected only by one type of links), the problem\nis practically unexplored in the case of multiplex networks, where several\ninterdependent layers, each with a different type of links, coexist. Even the\nmost advanced network reconstruction techniques, if applied to each layer\nseparately, fail in replicating the observed inter-layer dependencies making up\nthe whole coupled multiplex. Here we develop a methodology to reconstruct a\nclass of correlated multiplexes which includes the World Trade Multiplex as a\nspecific example we study in detail. Our method starts from any reconstruction\nmodel that successfully reproduces some desired marginal properties, including\nnode strengths and/or node degrees, of each layer separately. It then\nintroduces the minimal dependency structure required to replicate an additional\nset of higher-order properties that quantify the portion of each node's degree\nand each node's strength that is shared and/or reciprocated across pairs of\nlayers. These properties are found to provide empirically robust measures of\ninter-layer coupling. Our method allows joint multi-layer connection\nprobabilities to be reliably reconstructed from marginal ones, effectively\nbridging the gap between single-layer properties and truly multiplex\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The novel DDF-ROM framework consists\nof two steps: (i) In the first step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of\nthe nonlinear PDE to construct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is\nlow-dimensional, but is not closed (because of the nonlinearity in the given\nPDE). (ii) In the second step, we use data-driven modeling to close the\nfiltered ROM, i.e., to model the interaction between the resolved and\nunresolved modes. To this end, we use a quadratic ansatz to model this\ninteraction and close the filtered ROM. To find the new coefficients in the\nclosed filtered ROM, we solve an optimization problem that minimizes the\ndifference between the full order model data and our ansatz. We emphasize that\nthe new DDF-ROM is built on general ideas of spatial filtering and optimization\nand is independent of (restrictive) phenomenological arguments.\n  We investigate the DDF-ROM in the numerical simulation of a 2D channel flow\npast a circular cylinder at Reynolds number $Re=100$. The DDF-ROM is\nsignificantly more accurate than the standard projection ROM. Furthermore, the\ncomputational costs of the DDF-ROM and the standard projection ROM are similar,\nboth costs being orders of magnitude lower than the computational cost of the\nfull order model. We also compare the new DDF-ROM with modern ROM closure\nmodels in the numerical simulation of the 1D Burgers equation. The DDF-ROM is\nmore accurate and significantly more efficient than these ROM closure models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 19:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Traditional detection methods detect events primarily by the\nuse of similarity and correlation in data. Those methods can be inefficient and\nyield low accuracy. In recent years, because of the significantly increased\ncomputational power, machine learning techniques have revolutionized many\nscience and engineering domains. In this study, we apply a deep-learning-based\nmethod to the detection of events from time series seismic signals. However, a\ndirect adaptation of the similar ideas from 2D object detection to our problem\nfaces two challenges. The first challenge is that the duration of earthquake\nevent varies significantly; The other is that the proposals generated are\ntemporally correlated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded\nregion-based convolutional neural network to capture earthquake events in\ndifferent sizes, while incorporating contextual information to enrich features\nfor each individual proposal. To achieve a better generalization performance,\nwe use densely connected blocks as the backbone of our network. Because of the\nfact that some positive events are not correctly annotated, we further\nformulate the detection problem as a learning-from-noise problem. To verify the\nperformance of our detection methods, we employ our methods to seismic data\ngenerated from a bi-axial \"earthquake machine\" located at Rock Mechanics\nLaboratory, and we acquire labels with the help of experts. Through our\nnumerical tests, we show that our novel detection techniques yield high\naccuracy. Therefore, our novel deep-learning-based detection methods can\npotentially be powerful tools for locating events from time series data in\nvarious applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 04:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

When quarks are close to each other, quarkonium\nbehaves like a scalar and by their getting away, it transits to a fermionic\nsystem. In order to analyze this particular behaviour, a new outlook approach\nneeds to be adopted as the concurrent view is found deficient to analyse the\naforesaid behaviour. Therefore, the authors' post deliberation accept the\nfermions and fermionic being cognate. We need to accept a theory that the\norigin of fermions and bosons be the same. However, in $M$-theory, these\nparticles are independent and for this reason, \\textbf{we use a new broader\ntheory based on Lie-$N$-Algebra and we call it BLNA (Broad Lie-$N$-Algebra)}\ntheory. Thus, the BLNA in a way the $M$-theory with $11$ dimensions. In this\nmodel, two types of energies with opposite signs emerge from nothing such as\nthe sum over them becomes zero. They produce two types of branes with opposite\nquantum numbers and bosonic fields, which interact with each other and get\ncompact. By compacting branes, the quarks and anti-quarks are produced on\nbranes and exchange the graviton and the gravitino. These particles produce two\ntypes of wormholes which act opposite to each other. They preclude from closing\nor getting away of branes from each other and also occurrence of confinement.\nThis confined potential which emerges from these wormholes depends on the\nseparation distance between quarks and anti-quarks and also on temperature of\nsystem and is reduced to predicted potential in experiments and QCD. Also,\ntotal entropy of this system grows with increasing temperature and produces a\nrepulsive force which leads to the separation of quarks and anti-quarks and\nalso to the emergence of deconfinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The energy--momentum tensor that is formally derived from the\nMaxwell--Minkowski field equations is inconsistent with both angular and linear\nmomentum conservation in this closed system; this very solid fact is the\nfoundational and continuing issue of the Abraham--Minkowski controversy. The\nextant resolution of the Abraham--Minkowski dilemma is to treat Maxwellian\ncontinuum electrodynamics as being a subsystem and to write the total\nenergy--momentum tensor as the sum of a Maxwellian electromagnetic subsystem\nenergy--momentum tensor and a phenomenological material subsystem\nenergy--momentum tensor. We prove that fundamental principles of physics are\nviolated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics and that fundamental\nprinciples of physics are violated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics\nsupplemented by the material subsystem conjecture. We use field theory to\nderive legitimate equations for macroscopic electromagnetic fields in a\ntransparent linear magneto-dielectric medium. The new field equations are a\npart of a self-consistent formulation of macroscopic electrodynamics,\nconservation laws, special relativity, and invariance in a continuous linear\nmedium. In the new formulation, the temporal and spatial coordinates are\nrenormalized by the continuous linear medium instead of the permittivity and\npermeability being carried as independent material parameters. Then an\nisotropic, homogeneous, flat, four-dimensional, continuous, linear,\nnon-Minkowski spacetime is the proper setting for the continuum electrodynamics\nof a simple linear medium in which the effective speed of light is $c/n$ and\neach medium will be associated with a different spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 20:35:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 18:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 19:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}
