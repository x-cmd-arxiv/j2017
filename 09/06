We further\ndemonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for\nexisting state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost.\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017\nclassification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to\n2.251%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of ~25%.\nModels and code are available at https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 17:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 17:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 19:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 05:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

Examples include source detection in\nX-ray images, gamma-rays, UV, neutrinos, and search for clusters of galaxies\nand stellar streams. However, the solutions in the X-ray-related literature are\nsub-optimal -- in some cases by considerable factors. Using the lemma of\nNeyman-Pearson we derive the optimal statistics for template detection in the\npresence of Poisson noise. We demonstrate that this method provides higher\ncompleteness, for a fixed false-alarm probability value, compared with\nfiltering the image with the point-spread function (PSF). In turn, we find that\nfiltering by the PSF is better than filtering the image using the Mexican-hat\nwavelet (used by wavedetect). For some background levels, our method improves\nthe sensitivity of source detection by more than a factor of two over the\npopular Mexican-hat wavelet filtering. This filtering technique can also be\nused also for fast PSF photometry and flare detection, and it is efficient, as\nwell as straight forward to implement.

More importantly, they learn user and item dynamics\nseparately, thus failing to capture their joint effects on user-item\ninteractions. To better model user and item dynamics, we present the\nInteracting Attention-gated Recurrent Network (IARN) which adopts the attention\nmodel to measure the relevance of each time step.

By doing so, IARN can\nselectively memorize different time steps of a user's history when predicting\nher preferences over different items.

Each point in a scan had approximately 2 nm FWHM out of the\nmonochromator. Different sets of telescopes in the observatory have different\noptical components, and the eight telescopes measured represent two each of the\nfour combinations of components represented in the observatory. We made an\nend-to-end measurement of the response from different combinations of optical\ncomponents, and the monochromator setup allowed for more precise and complete\nmeasurements than our previous multi-wavelength calibrations. We find an\noverall uncertainty in the calibration of the spectral response of most of the\ntelescopes of 1.5% for all wavelengths; the six oldest telescopes have larger\noverall uncertainties of about 2.2%. We also report changes in physics\nmeasureables due to the change in calibration, which are generally small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 18:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 17:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 14:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

To this end, benefiting from the concept of\n'virtual load demand', we first design the distributed controller for the\ncontrollable generators by leveraging the primal-dual decomposition technique.\nWe then propose a method to estimate the virtual load demand of each\ncontrollable generator based on local frequencies. We derive incremental\npassivity conditions for the uncontrollable generators.

As a first step, we have\nformulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In\nour earlier work, we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure\nas-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii)\nthe explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few\nsuccessive steps and then selects the best relay placement location. The latter\nwas shown to provide better performance but at the expense of more measurements\nand deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick\ndeployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, the\ndeployment algorithm should not require prior knowledge of the parameters of\nthe wireless propagation model. In [1] we, therefore, developed learning\nalgorithms for the explore-forward approach.\n  The current paper provides deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go\napproach.

Segmental models, a class of models that explicitly\nhypothesizes segments, have allowed the exploration of rich segment features\nfor sequence prediction. However, segmental models suffer from slow decoding,\nhampering the use of computationally expensive features.\n  In this thesis, we introduce discriminative segmental cascades, a multi-pass\ninference framework that allows us to improve accuracy by adding higher-order\nfeatures and neural segmental features while maintaining efficiency. We also\nshow that instead of including more features to obtain better accuracy,\nsegmental cascades can be used to speed up training and decoding.\n  Segmental models, similarly to conventional speech recognizers, are typically\ntrained in multiple stages. In the first stage, a frame classifier is trained\nwith manual alignments, and then in the second stage, segmental models are\ntrained with manual alignments and the out- puts of the frame classifier.\nHowever, obtaining manual alignments are time-consuming and expensive. We\nexplore end-to-end training for segmental models with various loss functions,\nand show how end-to-end training with marginal log loss can eliminate the need\nfor detailed manual alignments.\n  We draw the connections between the marginal log loss and a popular\nend-to-end training approach called connectionist temporal classification. We\npresent a unifying framework for various end-to-end graph search-based models,\nsuch as hidden Markov models, connectionist temporal classification, and\nsegmental models. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of segmental models\nto large-vocabulary sequence prediction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 19:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 03:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

The Br-gamma absorption lines are used to\ndetermine the RVs of S2. The RVs we obtained are 497 km/s, 877 km/s, and 1108\nkm/s in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The statistical uncertainties are\nderived using the jackknife analysis.

However, identifying individuals\nwith AD and MCI, especially MCI individuals who will convert to AD (progressive\nMCI, pMCI), in a single setting, is needed to achieve the goal of early\ndiagnosis of AD.

Unlike previous works that simply aggregate or\ncascade classifiers for addressing image segmentation and labeling tasks, we\npropose to embed strong classifiers into a tree structure that allows\nbi-directional flow of information between its classifier nodes to gradually\nimprove their performances. Our DMT is a generic classification model that\ninherently embeds different cascades of classifiers while enhancing learning\ntransfer between them to boost up their classification accuracies.\nSpecifically, each node in our DMT can nest a Structured Random Forest (SRF)\nclassifier or a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier. The proposed SRF-BN DMT\narchitecture has several appealing properties. First, while SRF operates at a\npatch-level (regular image region), BN operates at the super-pixel level\n(irregular image region), thereby enabling the DMT to integrate multi-level\nimage knowledge in the learning process. Second, although BN is powerful in\nmodeling dependencies between image elements (superpixels, edges) and their\nfeatures, the learning of its structure and parameters is challenging. On the\nother hand, SRF may fail to accurately detect very irregular object boundaries.\nThe proposed DMT robustly overcomes these limitations for both classifiers\nthrough the ascending and descending flow of contextual information between\neach parent node and its children nodes. Third, we train DMT using different\nscales, where we progressively decrease the patch and superpixel sizes as we go\ndeeper along the tree edges nearing its leaf nodes. Last, DMT demonstrates its\noutperformance in comparison to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods\nfor multi-labeling of brain images with gliomas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 21:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

The task is\noften cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large\noutput-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The\nbest segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution\nover the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in\noptimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a\ntrade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order\ninteractions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly\nintractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less\naccurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of\nits output distribution.\n  This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to\nsemantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model\noutputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying\ndistribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically\nthe output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a\nsingle one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model\nselects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much\nmore complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation\nmodel, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply\nreturning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying\nsegmentation model (e.g. CRF, CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which\nmakes it applicable to a wide range of models and inference methods. Evaluation\nof the approach on a number of semantic image segmentation benchmark datasets\nhighlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 23:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

From structure and thermal\nevolution models, we determine that the required energy deposition for halting\nthe contraction of mini-Neptunes increases with planetary mass and envelope\nfraction. Scaled to the insolation power, the ohmic heating needed is small\n$\\sim10^{-5}$ -- orders of magnitude lower than for exo-Jupiters $\\sim\n10^{-2}$. Conversely, from solving the magnetic induction equation, we find\nthat ohmic energy is dissipated more readily for lower-mass planets and those\nwith larger envelope fractions.

However, most existing works use\npercolation-based models where only the largest component of each network\nremains functional throughout the cascade. Although suitable for communication\nnetworks, this assumption fails to capture the dependencies in systems carrying\na flow (e.g., power systems, road transportation networks), where cascading\nfailures are often triggered by redistribution of flows leading to overloading\nof lines. Here, we consider a model consisting of systems $A$ and $B$ with\ninitial line loads and capacities given by $\\{L_{A,i},C_{A,i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and\n$\\{L_{B,i},C_{B,i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, respectively.

We give a thorough analysis of cascading failures\nof this model initiated by a random attack targeting $p_1$-fraction of lines in\n$A$ and $p_2$-fraction in $B$.

The first is Thomson scattering of a XFEL pulse from\nplasma wave excited by an intense laser pulse. Properly chosen observation\nangles enable us to distinguish the Unruh effect from the normal Doppler shift\nwith a reasonable photon number. The second is a system consisting of electron\nbunches accelerated by a laser wake-field, as sources and as detectors, which\nmove in a constantly accelerating reference frame (Rindler space) and are\nprobed by x-ray free electron laser pulses. The numbers of photons is shown to\nbe enough to observe reproducible results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 03:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

For\nsuch a network, we design routing-scheduling policies that maximize the\nend-to-end timely throughput of the network. Timely throughput of a flow $f$ is\ndefined as the average rate at which packets of flow $f$ reach their\ndestination node $d_f$ within their deadline.\n  Our policy has several surprising characteristics. Firstly, we show that the\noptimal routing-scheduling decision for an individual packet that is present at\na wireless node $i\\in V$ is solely a function of its location, and \"age\". Thus,\na wireless node $i$ does not require the knowledge of the \"global\" network\nstate in order to maximize the timely throughput. We notice that in comparison,\nunder the backpressure routing policy, a node $i$ requires only the knowledge\nof its neighbours queue lengths in order to guarantee maximal stability, and\nhence is decentralized. The key difference arises due to the fact that in our\nset-up the packets loose their utility once their \"age\" has crossed their\ndeadline, thus making the task of optimizing timely throughput much more\nchallenging than that of ensuring network stability. Of course, due to this key\ndifference, the decision process involved in maximizing the timely throughput\nis also much more complex than that involved in ensuring network-wide queue\nstabilization. In view of this, our results are somewhat surprising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 04:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 03:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The Chandra imaging shows that a point-like\nX-ray source is located at the nucleus of the galaxy at energies above 2 keV.\nHowever, the point source resolves into diffuse emission at lower energies,\nextending to the east, where the extranuclear [O III] emission, presumably\ninduced by a galactic-scale outflow, is present. The nuclear source is detected\nby NuSTAR up to the rest-frame 30 keV. The strong, high-ionization Fe K line,\nfirst seen by XMM-Newton, and subsequently by Suzaku and Chandra, is not\ndetected in the NuSTAR data. The line flux appears to have been declining\ncontinuously between 2003 and 2016, while the continuum emission remained\nstable to within 30%. The X-ray continuum below 10 keV is characterised by a\nhard spectrum caused by cold absorption of nH ~1e23 cm-2, compatible to that of\nthe silicate absorption at 9.7 micron, and a broad absorption feature around 8\nkeV which we attribute to a high-ionization Fe K absorption edge.

The development of models,\ntools and methods has significantly benefited from the availability of reusable\ntest collections formed through a standardized and thoroughly tested\nmethodology, known as the Cranfield paradigm. Constructing these collections\nrequires obtaining relevance judgments for a pool of documents, retrieved by\nsystems participating in an evaluation task; thus involves immense human labor.\nTo alleviate this effort different methods for constructing collections have\nbeen proposed in the literature, falling under two broad categories: (a)\nsampling, and (b) active selection of documents. The former devises a smart\nsampling strategy by choosing only a subset of documents to be assessed and\ninferring evaluation measure on the basis of the obtained sample; the sampling\ndistribution is being fixed at the beginning of the process. The latter\nrecognizes that systems contributing documents to be judged vary in quality,\nand actively selects documents from good systems. The quality of systems is\nmeasured every time a new document is being judged. In this paper we seek to\nsolve the problem of large-scale retrieval evaluation combining the two\napproaches. We devise an active sampling method that avoids the bias of the\nactive selection methods towards good systems, and at the same time reduces the\nvariance of the current sampling approaches by placing a distribution over\nsystems, which varies as judgments become available.

That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural\nproperties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might\nshare the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.\n  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components\nbuilt from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the\nConservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical\nmechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous\nand homogeneous.

Homogeneous systems contain\ncomponents each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and\nyield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.\n  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer\nsoftware, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the\nelements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour\nco-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In\neach case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high\nlevels of statistical significance.

Femtoscopy is used to measure the space-time characteristics of\nparticle production from the effects of quantum statistics and final-state\ninteractions in two-particle correlations. Kaon femtoscopy is an important\nsupplement to that of pions because it allows one to distinguish between\ndifferent model scenarios working equally well for pions. In particular, we\ncompare the measured 3D kaon radii with a purely hydrodynamical calculation and\na model where the hydrodynamic phase is followed by a hadronic rescattering\nstage. The former predicts an approximate transverse mass ($m_{\\mathrm{T}}$)\nscaling of source radii obtained from pion and kaon correlations. This\n$m_{\\mathrm{T}}$ scaling appears to be broken in our data, which indicates the\nimportance of the hadronic rescattering phase at LHC energies. A\n$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ scaling of pion and kaon source radii is observed instead. The\ntime of maximal emission of the system is estimated using the three-dimensional\nfemtoscopic analysis for kaons. The measured emission time is larger than that\nof pions. Our observation is well supported by the hydrokinetic model\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 09:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 11:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

It\npresents nonetheless all other characteristics of a quiet 1 Gyr old F3V star.\nThese dimmings resemble the absorption features expected for the transit of\ndust cometary tails. The exocomet scenario is therefore most commonly\nadvocated. We reanalyzed the Kepler data and extracted a new high-quality light\ncurve to allow for the search of shallow signature of single or a few\nexocomets. We discovered that among the 22 flux dimming events that we\nidentified, two events present a striking similarity. These events occurred\n928.25 days apart, lasted for 4.4 days with a drop of the star brightness by\n1000 ppm. We show that the light curve of these events is well explained by the\noccultation of the star by a giant ring system, or the transit of a string of\nhalf a dozen of exocomets with a typical dust production rate of 10$^5$-10$^6$\nkg/s. Assuming that these two similar events are related to the transit of the\nsame object, we derive a period of 928.25 days. The following transit was\nexpected in March 2017 but bad weather prohibited us to detect it from\nground-based spectroscopy. We predict that the next event will occur from the\n3rd to the 8th of October 2019.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 09:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Yet it is still unclear whether\nmultiple dechlorination reactions taking place in EI-MS are concerted or\nstepwise. This study investigated the concertedness of the multiple\ndechlorination reactions of perchlorethylene (PCE) in EI-MS in light of the\nobserved chlorine isotope effects during different dechlorination reactions\nalong with the detected MS signal intensities. The fluctuant isotope ratios\namong different ions revealed that the observed multiple dechlorinated\nreactions in the EI-DFS-HRMS were stepwise. And the changing trends of isotope\nratios of the ions detected by EI-qMS might suggest that the observed multiple\ndechlorination reactions in this MS were concerted. Mechanisms for these\nconcerted/stepwise multiple dechlorination reactions are tentatively\ninterpreted. Besides the evidence of isotope effects, according to the\nquasi-equilibrium theory, the MS signal intensities also suggested that the\nmultiple dechlorination reactions in the EI-HRMS were likely stepwise, while\nthose in the EI-qMS might be concerted. The distance from the ionization region\nto the mass analyzer entrance in an MS may be a critical factor affecting the\ndechlorination reactions of ions flying over this distance. This distance in\nthe EI-qMS is significantly shorter than that in the EI-HRMS. Thus, the main\ndetected ions in the EI-qMS might be generated during the ionization and\nin-source fragmentation processes, while the main ions detected in the EI-HRMS\nmight be produced during the fragmentation of precursor ions flying over the\ndistance. We deduce that the main dechlorination reactions in the ionization\nregion were concerted, while those taking place during the flight of precursor\nions over the distance from the ionization region to the mass analyzer entrance\nwere stepwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 09:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

In this\npaper, we study the contagion adoption behavior under a set of interactions,\nspecifically, the interactions among users, contagions' contents and\nsentiments, which are learned from social network structures and texts. We then\ndevelop an effective and efficient interaction-aware diffusion (IAD) framework,\nincorporating these interactions into a unified model. We also present a\ngenerative process to distinguish user roles, a co-training method to determine\ncontagions' categories and a new topic model to obtain topic-specific\nsentiments. Evaluation on large-scale Weibo dataset demonstrates that our\nproposal can learn how different users, contagion categories and sentiments\ninteract with each other efficiently. With these interactions, we can make a\nmore accurate prediction than the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, we can\nbetter understand how the interactions influence the propagation process and\nthus can suggest useful directions for information promotion or suppression in\nviral marketing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 11:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 16:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

Once validating a particular\nmodel, it is important that all key parameter involved in the model are\ncarefully verified. Such verification is typically performed by separate effect\ntests, where one parameter at a time is compared to a measured or otherwise\nknown value. Needless to say that for complex models, which are typical for CFD\napplications to two-phase flow, the number of independent parameters that need\nto be verified can be quite high. This particular feature makes the validation\nprocess of complex CFD models in open source codes very attractive, since full\naccess to the implementation details is possible.\n  This paper is concerned with implementation and validation of two-phase\nboiling bubbly flow models using the OpenFOAM, open source environment. The\nmodel employs the two-fluid formulation of the conservation equations with the\nReynolds-averaged treatment of the turbulent terms. The model consists of six\nconservation equations for the liquid and the vapor phase, allowing for the\nthermodynamic non-equilibrium and compressibility of both phases. In addition,\nthe model includes two transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy\nand energy dissipation and one transport equation for the interfacial area\nconcentration. New models for wall heat partitioning as well as for the phase\nchange terms in nucleate boiling have been implemented. Sensitivity studies as\nwell as validation of the model against measured data available in the open\nliterature have been performed and it has been shown that a reasonable\nagreement between predictions and experiments has been achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 11:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

A major challenge is thus to estimate the outcome of\nspreading processes occurring on temporal networks built from partial\ninformation. To cope with this problem, we devise an approach based on\nNon-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) -- a dimensionality reduction technique\nfrom multi-linear algebra. The key idea is to learn a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of the temporal network built from partial information, to adapt\nit to take into account temporal and structural heterogeneity properties known\nto be crucial for spreading processes occurring on networks, and to construct\nin this way a surrogate network similar to the complete original network. To\ntest our method, we consider several human-proximity networks, on which we\nsimulate a loss of data. Using our approach on the resulting partial networks,\nwe build a surrogate version of the complete network for each. We then compare\nthe outcome of a spreading process on the complete networks (non altered by a\nloss of data) and on the surrogate networks. We observe that the epidemic sizes\nobtained using the surrogate networks are in good agreement with those measured\non the complete networks.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of\nspeculation: Based on the likelihood of an event's consumption in a window,\nsubsequent windows may speculatively suppress that event. We propose the\nSPECTRE framework for speculative processing of multiple dependent windows in\nparallel. Our evaluations show an up to linear scalability of SPECTRE with the\nnumber of CPU cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 13:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

While contributing\nto enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes may\nlead to undesired seismic activity. Here, we present a three dimensional\nnumerical model aiming to increase understanding of this mechanism and its\nconsequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly\nrepresented large scale fractures immersed in a permeable rock matrix. The\nnumerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes:\nfluid flow, fracture deformation, and rock matrix deformation. For flow\nsimulations, the discrete fracture matrix model is used, which allows the fluid\ntransport from high permeable conductive fractures to the rock matrix and vice\nversa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using a hyperbolic\nmodel with reversible and irreversible deformations. Linear elasticity is\nassumed for the mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the rock\nmatrix. Fractures are modeled as lower dimensional surfaces embodied in the\ndomain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along\nthe tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance\nequations are approximated by finite volume discretizations. The new numerical\nmodel is demonstrated considering a three dimensional fractured formation with\na network of 20 explicitly represented fractures. The effects of fluid exchange\nbetween fractures and rock matrix on the permeability evolution and the\ngenerated seismicity are examined for test cases resembling realistic reservoir\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 14:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 15:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

If applying a voltage (electric field)\ntransfers electrons from an energy sub band of a low effective mass to a second\none with higher effective mass, then the current drops. This manifests itself\nas a negative slope or NDR in the I-V characteristics of the device which is in\nessence due to the reduction of electron mobility. Recalling that mobility is\ninversely proportional to electron effective mass or curvature of the energy\nsub band. This effect was observed in semiconductors like GaAs which has direct\nbandgap of very low effective mass and its second indirect sub band is about\n300 meV above the former.

In\nthis paper, we provide a detailed introduction to CPC codes using conventional\nquantum circuit notation. We demonstrate the implementation of a CPC code on\nreal hardware, by designing a [[4,2,2]] detection code for the IBM 5Q\nsuperconducting qubit device. Whilst the individual gate-error rates on the IBM\ndevice are too high to realise a fault tolerant quantum detection code, our\nresults show that the syndrome information from a full encode-decode cycle of\nthe [[4,2,2]] CPC code can be used to increase the output state fidelity by\npost-selection.

Beyond minimizing the memory\nrequired to store weights, as in a BNN, we show that it is essential to\nminimize the memory used for temporaries which hold intermediate results\nbetween layers in feedforward inference. To accomplish this, eBNN reorders the\ncomputation of inference while preserving the original BNN structure, and uses\njust a single floating-point temporary for the entire neural network.
