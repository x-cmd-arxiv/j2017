The coupled elliptic and doubly quasilinear parabolic\nequations for the electric and heat currents are stated, respectively,\naccomplished with power-type boundary conditions that describe the thermal\nradiative effects. To verify the existence of weak solutions to this coupled\nproblem (Theorem 1), analytical investigations for abstract multi-quasilinear\nelliptic-parabolic systems with nonsmooth data are presented (Theorem 2 and 3).\nThey are essentially approximated solutions based on the Rothe method. It\nconsists on introducing time discretized problems, establishing their\nexistence, and then passing to the limit as the time step goes to zero. The\nproof of the existence of time discretized solutions relies on fixed point and\ncompactness arguments. In this study, we establish quantitative estimates to\nclarify the smallness conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 16:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

This method is based on robustly determining the distribution of\nbackground pixel values and should provide comparable improvement in\nphotometric analysis of any crowded fields.

This improvement in\nredshift precision, in combination with a detection scheme designed to maximize\npurity, yields a substantial upgrade in cluster member identification over the\nprevious CLASH galaxy catalog. We construct luminosity functions for each\ncluster, reliably reaching depths of at least 4.5 mag below M* in every case,\nand deeper still in several clusters.

An important independent test is whether or not the\nsimulations capture the broad demographics of the observed AGN population.\nHere, we have used the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations to produce realistic synthetic catalogs of X-ray AGN out to $z$=3,\nwith the aim of comparing the catalogs to the observed X-ray AGN population in\nthe XXL survey and other recent surveys. We focused on the unabsorbed X-ray\nluminosity function (XLF), the Eddington ratio distribution, the black hole\nmass function, and the projected clustering of X-ray AGN. To compute the\nunabsorbed XLF of the simulated AGN, we used recent empirically-determined\nbolometric corrections. We show that the simulated AGN sample accurately\nreproduces the observed XLF over 3 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity in\nall redshift bins. To compare to the observed Eddington ratio distribution and\nthe clustering of AGN, we produced detailed 'XMM-Newton-detected' catalogs of\nthe simulated AGN. This requires the production of synthetic X-ray images\nextracted from light cones of the simulations that fold in the relevant\ninstrumental effects of XMM-Newton. We apply a luminosity- and\nredshift-dependent obscuration function for the AGN and employ the same AGN\ndetection algorithm as used for the real XXL survey. We demonstrate that the\ndetected population of simulated AGN reproduces the observed Eddington ratio\ndistribution and projected clustering from XXL quite well. We conclude that the\nsimulations have a broadly realistic population of AGN and that our synthetic\nX-ray AGN catalogs should be useful for interpreting additional trends and as a\nhelpful tool for quantifying AGN contamination in galaxy group and cluster\nX-ray surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 09:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

Here, we compare for the first time the generation of such streams in\nNewtonian and Milgromian gravity (MOND). We first compute analytical results to\ninvestigate the expected shape of the GC gravitational potential in both\nframeworks, and we then run N-body simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code.\nWe find that the GCs tend to become lopsided in MOND. This is a consequence of\nthe external field effect which breaks the strong equivalence principle. When\nthe GC is filling its tidal radius the lopsidedness generates a strongly\nasymmetric tidal stream. In Newtonian dynamics, such markedly asymmetric\nstreams can in general only be the consequence of interactions with dark matter\nsubhalos, giant molecular clouds, or interaction with the Galactic bar. In\nthese Newtonian cases, the asymmetry is the consequence of a very large gap in\nthe stream, whilst in MOND it is a true asymmetry. This should thus allow us in\nthe future to distinguish these different scenarios by making deep observations\nof the environment of the asymmetric stellar stream of Palomar 5. Moreover, our\nsimulations indicate that the high internal velocity dispersion of Palomar 5\nfor its small stellar mass would be natural in MOND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Here we report the detection of\noptical pulsations from a transitional pulsar, the first ever from a\nmillisecond spinning neutron star. The pulsations were observed when the pulsar\nwas surrounded by an accretion disk and originated inside the magnetosphere or\nwithin a few hundreds of kilometres from it. Energy arguments rule out\nreprocessing of accretion-powered X-ray emission and argue against a process\nrelated to accretion onto the pulsar polar caps; synchrotron emission of\nelectrons in a rotation-powered pulsar magnetosphere seems more likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 18:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 11:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

Third, we use these zeros to construct low rank\ntensor approximations. If the symmetric tensor to be approximated is\nsufficiently close to a low rank one, we show that the computed low rank\napproximations are quasi-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 18:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

Stable graphs play an important role in some interesting game theory\nproblems, such as network bargaining games and cooperative matching games,\nbecause they characterize instances which admit stable outcomes. Motivated by\nthis, in the last few years many researchers have investigated the algorithmic\nproblem of turning a given graph into a stable one, via edge- and\nvertex-removal operations. However, all the algorithmic results developed in\nthe literature so far only hold for unweighted instances, i.e., assuming unit\nweights on the edges of $G$.\n  We give the first polynomial-time algorithm to find a minimum cardinality\nsubset of vertices whose removal from $G$ yields a stable graph, for any\nweighted graph $G$. The algorithm is combinatorial and exploits new structural\nproperties of basic fractional matchings, which are of independent interest. In\nparticular, one of the main ingredients of our result is the development of a\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute a basic maximum-weight fractional matching\nwith minimum number of odd cycles in its support. This generalizes a\nfundamental and classical result on unweighted matchings given by Balas more\nthan 30 years ago, which we expect to prove useful beyond this particular\napplication.\n  In contrast, we show that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality subset\nof edges whose removal from a weighted graph $G$ yields a stable graph, does\nnot admit any constant-factor approximation algorithm, unless $P=NP$. In this\nsetting, we develop an $O(\\Delta)$-approximation algorithm for the problem,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a node in $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 20:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 00:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Consequently, researchers and developers\nrequire efficient and precise tools for the parallel development of vehicular\nmobility and communication. Although current state-of-the-art approaches allow\nthe coupled simulation of those two components, they are making use of multiple\nspecialized simulators that are synchronized using interprocess communication,\nresulting in highly complex simulation setups. Furthermore, the compatibility\nof those simulators requires constant attention as they are developed\nindependently. In this paper, we present a lightweight and integrated approach\nfor simulating vehicular mobility directly in Objective Modular Network Testbed\nin C++ (OMNeT++) and INET without the need for external tools or Interprocess\nCommunication (IPC). The proposed framework Lightweight ICT-centric Mobility\nSimulation (LIMoSim) is available as Open Source software and can easily be\ncombined with other third-party extension frameworks for providing vehicular\nmobility based on well-known microscopical models. In contrast to existing\napproaches, the amount of necessary preprocessing steps for simulation setups\nis significantly reduced.

In ionic compounds,\nelectrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but\nself-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to\nfollow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic\ntheory. Here we show that elastic effects are also important in the description\nof defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect\nconclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious\nself-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic\ntheory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure,\nwe show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom supercells,\nmisidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We\nshow that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500\natoms), and careful analysis determines that elastic effects, not\nelectrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction was also observed\nin non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used,\nthereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field\nmethods, previously attributed to the level of theory. The surprising magnitude\nof the elastic effects are a cautionary tale for defect calculations in ionic\nmaterials, particularly when employing computationally expensive methods or\nwhen modelling large defect clusters. We propose two computationally\npracticable methods to test the magnitude of the elastic self-interaction in\nany ionic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 01:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

While these traditional kinds of descriptions are informative and\nuseful, they cannot cover insect specimens \"from all angles\" and precious\nspecimens are still exchanged between researchers and collections for this\nreason. Furthermore, insects can be complex in structure and pose many\nchallenges to computer vision systems. We present a new prototype for a\npractical, cost-effective system of off-the-shelf components to acquire\nnatural-colour 3D models of insects from around 3mm to 30mm in length. Colour\nimages are captured from different angles and focal depths using a digital\nsingle lens reflex (DSLR) camera rig and two-axis turntable.

The system is portable, safe,\nrelatively affordable, and complements the sort of volumetric data that can be\nacquired by computed tomography.

To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose\nthe FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a\nfocusing attention mechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention.\nFAN consists of two major components: an attention network (AN) that is\nresponsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing methods, and a\nfocusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating\nwhether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images.\nFurthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based\nnetwork to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive\nexperiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR\ndatasets, show that the FAN method substantially outperforms the existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 02:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 01:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 04:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

This paper provides an algorithm to\nrank design ideas such that the ranked list simultaneously maximizes the\nquality and diversity of recommended designs. To do so, we first define and\ncompare two diversity measures using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) and\nadditive sub-modular functions. We show that DPPs are more suitable for items\nexpressed as text and that a greedy algorithm diversifies rankings with both\ntheoretical guarantees and empirical performance on what is otherwise an\nNP-Hard problem. To produce such rankings, this paper contributes a novel way\nto extend quality and diversity metrics from sets to permutations of ranked\nlists.\n  These rank metrics open up the use of multi-objective optimization to\ndescribe trade-offs between diversity and quality in ranked lists. We use such\ntrade-off fronts to help designers select rankings using indifference curves.\nHowever, we also show that rankings on trade-off front share a number of\ntop-ranked items; this means reviewing items (for a given depth like the top\n10) from across the entire diversity-to-quality front incurs only a marginal\nincrease in the number of designs considered. While the proposed techniques are\ngeneral purpose enough to be used across domains, we demonstrate concrete\nperformance on selecting items in an online design community (OpenIDEO), where\nour approach reduces the time required to review diverse, high-quality ideas\nfrom around 25 hours to 90 minutes.

This\nspectral interval is very important for thermal bio-imaging and,\nsimultaneously, this spectral range includes vibrational lines of many chiral\nbiomolecules. Here we demonstrate that graphene plasmons indeed offer such\nopportunity. In particular, we show that chiral graphene assemblies consisting\nof a few graphene nanodisks can generate strong circular dichroism (CD) in the\nmid-infrared interval. The CD signal is generated due to the plasmon-plasmon\ncoupling between adjacent nanodisks in the specially designed chiral graphene\nassemblies. Because of the large dimension mismatch between the thickness of a\ngraphene layer and the incoming light's wavelength, three-dimensional\nconfigurations with a total height of a few hundred nanometers are necessary to\nobtain a strong CD signal in the mid-infrared range. The mid-infrared CD\nstrength is mainly governed by the total dimensions (total height and helix\nscaffold radius) of the graphene nanodisk assembly, and by the plasmon-plasmon\ninteraction strength between its constitutive nanodisks. Both positive and\nnegative CD bands can be observed in the graphene assembly array. The frequency\ninterval of the plasmonic CD spectra overlaps with the vibrational modes of\nsome important biomolecules, such as DNA and many different peptides, giving\nrise to the possibility of enhancing the vibrational optical activity of these\nmolecular species by attaching them to the graphene assemblies. Simultaneously\nthe spectral range of chiral mid-infrared plasmons in our structures appears\nnear the typical wavelength of the human-body thermal radiation and, therefore,\nour chiral metastructures can be potentially utilized as optical components in\nthermal imaging devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 04:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

This type of ADS is typically\nlimited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual\nto automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed\nmanually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that\nthe automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives\n(e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely\nexecuted. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other\nvehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the\nmerging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem,\nwe propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an\noptimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive\nenvironment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\narchitecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state\ncontaining historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network\n(DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal\nstate as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this\nDRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the\nlong-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the\noptimal control policy.

Among them, the synthesis of computed tomography\n(CT) image from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image is of great\nimportance, although the mapping between them is highly complex due to large\ngaps of appearances of the two modalities. In this work, we aim to tackle this\nMR-to-CT synthesis by a novel deep embedding convolutional neural network\n(DECNN). Specifically, we generate the feature maps from MR images, and then\ntransform these feature maps forward through convolutional layers in the\nnetwork. We can further compute a tentative CT synthesis from the midway of the\nflow of feature maps, and then embed this tentative CT synthesis back to the\nfeature maps. This embedding operation results in better feature maps, which\nare further transformed forward in DECNN. After repeat-ing this embedding\nprocedure for several times in the network, we can eventually synthesize a\nfinal CT image in the end of the DECNN. We have validated our proposed method\non both brain and prostate datasets, by also compar-ing with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In this study, we examine the effects of the scatted\nechoes on the SN polarization through radiative transfer simulations for\nvarious geometry and amount of CS dust.

However, integrating such\nclassifiers is nontrivial. Existing methods, e.g. weighted average, usually\nimplicitly assume that all constituents of an ensemble cover the same set of\nclasses. Such methods can produce misleading predictions when used to combine\nspecialized classifiers. This work explores a novel approach. Instead of\ncombining predictions from individual classifiers directly, it first decomposes\nthe predictions into sets of pairwise preferences, treating them as transition\nchannels between classes, and thereon constructs a continuous-time Markov\nchain, and use the equilibrium distribution of this chain as the final\nprediction. This way allows us to form a coherent picture over all specialized\npredictions. On large public datasets, the proposed method obtains considerable\nimprovement compared to mainstream ensemble methods, especially when the\nclassifier coverage is highly unbalanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 07:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

EHB stars are produced in\nour calculations by the so called `delayed (late) hot core flash' scenario. The\nMLR is increased on the red giant branch (RGB) to the extent that, prior to\nreaching core flash conditions, only a very thin H-rich envelope remains and\nhelium ignition takes place at hotter positions on the HRD.

However, this correspondence set\nis usually contaminated by outliers in practical scenarios, which has led to\nmany past contributions based on robust detectors such as the Hough transform\nor RANSAC. The key insight of our work is that a single correspondence between\noriented points on the two models is constrained to cast votes in a 1 DoF\nrotational subgroup of the full group of poses, SE(3). Kernel density\nestimation allows combining the set of votes efficiently to determine a full 6\nDoF candidate pose between the models. This modal pose with the highest density\nis stable under challenging conditions, such as noise, clutter, and occlusions,\nand provides the output estimate of our method.\n  We first analyze the robustness of our method in relation to noise and show\nthat it handles high outlier rates much better than RANSAC for the task of 6\nDoF pose estimation.

Up to now, only a few embedded candidate protoplanets have\nbeen detected with semi-major axes of 20-50 au. Due to the small angular\nseparation from their central star, only long-baseline interferometry provides\nthe angular resolving power to detect disk asymmetries associated to\nprotoplanets at solar system scales in nearby star-forming regions.

In traditional non-machine-learning (ML) based\napproaches the parameters required for noise reduction are estimated blindly\nfrom the noisy observation while the actual filter functions are derived\nanalytically based on statistical assumptions. Even though such approaches\ngeneralize well to many different acoustic conditions, the noise suppression\ncapability in transient noises is low.

However, due to their data-driven nature, the\ngeneralization of ML based approaches to unknown noise types is still\ndiscussed. To improve the generalization of ML based algorithms and to enhance\nthe noise suppression of non-ML based methods, we propose a combination of both\napproaches.

The radio access in existing cellular networks is unable to\nefficiently support massive connectivity, due to its signaling overhead.

Specifically, the timing and frequency\noffsets, as well as sending of multiple replicas of the same packet, are\nexploited as form of diversities at the receiver-side to trigger successive\ninterference cancellation. The proposed scheme is investigated by deriving\nclosed-form expressions for key performance indicators, including reliability\nand battery-lifetime. The performance evaluation indicates that the scheme can\nbe tuned to realize long battery lifetime radio access for low-complexity\ndevices.

Modeling a line-driven\nstellar wind from the companion by two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations,\nwe investigate the processes of wind capture by and accretion onto the black\nhole. We assume that the wind acceleration is terminated at the He II\nionization front because ions responsible for line-driven acceleration are\nionized within the front, i.e. He III region. It is found that the mass\naccretion rate inferred from the luminosity is remarkably smaller than the\ncapture rate. Considering the difference, we construct a model for the state\ntransition based on the accretion flow being controlled by magneto-rotational\ninstability. The outer flow is torus like, and plays an important role to\ntrigger the transition. The model can explain why state transition does occur\nin Cyg X-1, while not in LMC X-1. Cyg X-1 exhibits a relatively low luminosity,\nand then the He II ionization front is located and can move between the\ncompanion and black hole, depending on its ionizing photon flux. On the other\nhand, LMC X-1 exhibits too high luminosity for the front to move considerably;\nthe front is too close to the companion atmosphere. The model also predicts\nthat each state of high-soft or low-hard would last fairly long because the\nluminosity depends weakly on the wind velocity. In the context of the model,\nthe state transition is triggered by a fluctuation of the magnetic field when\nits amplitude becomes comparable to the field strength in the torus-like outer\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 12:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Venus is covered\nwith thick clouds that extend from about 45 to 70 km altitude, but thermal\nradiation emitted from the lower atmosphere and the surface on the planet's\nnightside escapes to space at narrow spectral windows of the near-infrared. The\nradiation can be used to estimate winds by tracking the silhouettes of clouds\nin the lower and middle cloud regions below about 57 km in altitude. Estimates\nof wind speeds have ranged from 50 to 70 m/s at low to mid-latitudes, either\nnearly constant across latitudes or with winds peaking at mid-latitudes. Here\nwe report the detection of winds at low latitude exceeding 80 m/s using IR2\ncamera images from the Akatsuki orbiter taken during July and August 2016.

After the collapse the accretion of the unburnt part of the shell onto\nthe newly formed NS powers the extended emission (EE). During the collapse the\nneutron star is spun to millisecond periods and produce long lasting\nrelativistic winds that shock against the material lost during the\nshell-burning stage, and produce afterglow emission from the wind termination\nshock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 13:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

The first structure, hydrogenated at only one side,\nlabeled Up, also known as graphone, and the second, labelled Alt, is 25\\%\nhydrogenated at both sides. The hydrogenation opens an energy gap in both\nstructures. We analyze two possibilities: in the first, the spin is fixed along\na chosen direction, and the resulting SVI is calculated; in the second, we\nchoose the SVI direction along the surface plane, and calculate the resulting\nspin orientation. This is done by changing the energy $\\hbar\\omega$ and\npolarization angle $\\alpha$ of the incoming light. The results are calculated\nwithin a full electronic band structure scheme using the Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) in the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The maxima of the\nspin-velocities are reached when $\\hbar\\omega=0.084$\\,eV and $\\alpha=35^\\circ$\nfor the Up structure, and $\\hbar\\omega=0.720$\\,eV and $\\alpha=150^\\circ$ for\nthe Alt geometry. We find a speed of 668\\,Km/s and 645\\,Km/s for the Up and the\nAlt structures, respectively, when the spin points perpendicularly to the\nsurface. Also, the response is maximized by fixing the spin-velocity direction\nalong a high symmetry axis, obtaining a speed of 688Km/s with the spin pointing\nat $13^\\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Up, and 906 Km/s and the spin\npointing at $60^\\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Alt system. These speed\nvalues are of order of magnitude larger than those of bulk semiconductors, such\nas CdSe and GaAs, thus making the hydrogenated graphene structures excellent\ncandidates for spintronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 14:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

At\nthe quasilinear regions the splitted bands typically disperse with different\nbroadenings and tend to cross with their magnetization continuously changing in\norder to match that at the edges of the upper and lower gaps. As a result, both\nthe splittings and spin direction become strongly k dependent.

Then it\ncalibrates automatically the optical density ratios of the immunostaining of\nthe vessel walls and of the counterstaining, performs a colour deconvolution\ninside the regions of blur-free tissue, and finds the vessel walls inside these\nregions by selecting, on the image resulting from the colour deconvolution,\nzones which satisfy a double-threshold criterion. A mask of vessel wall regions\non the WSI is produced. The density of microvessels is finally computed as the\nfraction of the area of significant tissue which is occupied by vessel walls.\n  We apply this algorithm to a set of 186 WSI of paediatric brain tumours from\nWorld Health Organisation grades I to IV.

This has the potential to improve the\nallocation of research budgets. Despite this, practical EVSI evaluations are\nlimited, partly due to the computational cost of estimating this value using\nthe \"gold-standard\" nested simulation methods. Recently, however, Heath et al\ndeveloped an estimation procedure that reduces the number of simulations\nrequired for this \"gold-standard\" calculation. Up to this point, this new\nmethod has been presented in purely technical terms. Study Design: This study\npresents the practical application of this new method to aid its\nimplementation. We use a worked example to illustrate the key steps of the EVSI\nestimation procedure before discussing its optimal implementation using a\npractical health economic model. Methods: The worked example is based on a\nthree parameter linear health economic model. The more realistic model\nevaluates the cost-effectiveness of a new chemotherapy treatment which aims to\nreduce the number of side effects experienced by patients. We use a Markov\nModel structure to evaluate the health economic profile of experiencing side\neffects. Results: This EVSI estimation method offers accurate estimation within\na feasible computation time, seconds compared to days, even for more complex\nmodel structures. The EVSI estimation is more accurate if a greater number of\nnested samples are used, even for a fixed computational cost. Conclusions: This\nnew method reduces the computational cost of estimating the EVSI by nested\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 15:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 13:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

On the other hand, electrodiffusion models, which have\nbeen successful in describing electrokinetic phenomena, incorporate ionic\nconcentration dynamics. Mathematical reconciliation of the electrodiffusion\npicture and the TM model has been a major issue for electrohydrodynamic theory.\nHere, we derive the TM model from an electrodiffusion model in which we\nexplicitly model the electrochemistry of ion dissociation. We introduce salt\ndissociation reaction terms in the bulk electrodiffusion equations and take the\nlimit in which the salt dissociation is weak; the assumption of weak\ndissociation corresponds to the fact that the TM model describes poor\nconductors. Together with the assumption that the Debye length is small, we\nderive the TM model with or without the surface charge convection term\ndepending upon the scaling of relevant dimensionless parameters. An important\nquantity that emerges is the Galvani potential (GP), the jump in voltage across\nthe liquid-liquid interface between the two leaky dielectric media; the GP\narises as a natural consequence of the interfacial boundary conditions for the\nionic concentrations, and is absent under certain parametric conditions. When\nthe GP is absent, we recover the TM model. Our analysis also reveals the\nstructure of the Debye layer at the liquid-liquid interface, which suggests how\ninterfacial singularities may arise under strong imposed electric fields. In\nthe presence of a non-zero GP, our model predicts that the liquid droplet will\ndrift under an imposed electric field, the velocity of which is computed\nexplicitly to leading order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 15:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

As semiconductor technology revolutionized computing, modern DNA\nsequencing technology (termed Next Generation Sequencing, NGS)revolutionized\ngenomic research. As a result, modern NGS platforms can sequence hundreds of\nmillions of short DNA fragments in parallel. The sequenced DNA fragments,\nrepresenting the output of NGS platforms, are termed reads. Besides genomic\nvariations, NGS imperfections induce noise in reads. Mapping each read to (the\nmost similar portion of) a reference genome of the same species, i.e., read\nmapping, is a common critical first step in a diverse set of emerging\nbioinformatics applications. Mapping represents a search-heavy memory-intensive\nsimilarity matching problem, therefore, can greatly benefit from near-memory\nprocessing. Intuition suggests using fast associative search enabled by Ternary\nContent Addressable Memory (TCAM) by construction. However, the excessive\nenergy consumption and lack of support for similarity matching (under NGS and\ngenomic variation induced noise) renders direct application of TCAM infeasible,\nirrespective of volatility, where only non-volatile TCAM can accommodate the\nlarge memory footprint in an area-efficient way.

We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a\nbackground in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the\nrapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application\nin environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and\nmethodological complexities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 16:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2018 00:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 13:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

This proposal\nresults from the identification of a series of esoteric properties of the\nStandard Model of particle physics from a series of intermediate augmentations\nin the `multi-dimensional form of time'. These physical properties derive from\nthe breaking of the full symmetry of time through the necessary interposition\nof an external 4-dimensional spacetime arena, itself constructed from a\n4-dimensional form of time, as the background to all observations.

In this context,\ngeneration of high purity waves carrying OAM is of great significance and\nchallenge from low frequency band to optical area. Here, a novel strategy of\nmode combination method is proposed to generate twisted waves with arbitrary\norder of OAM index. The higher order mode of a circular horn antenna is used to\ngenerate the twisted waves with quite high purity. The proposed strategy is\nverified with theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experiments. A\ncircular horn antenna operating at millimeter wave band is designed,\nfabricated, and measured. Two twisted waves with OAM index of l=+1 and l=-1\nwith a mode purity as high as 87% are obtained.
