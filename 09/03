In contrast to traditional methods that attempt to solve the ERM\nproblem corresponding to the full dataset directly, adaptive sample size\nschemes start with a small number of samples and solve the corresponding ERM\nproblem to its statistical accuracy. The sample size is then grown\ngeometrically -- e.g., scaling by a factor of two -- and use the solution of\nthe previous ERM as a warm start for the new ERM. Theoretical analyses show\nthat the use of adaptive sample size methods reduces the overall computational\ncost of achieving the statistical accuracy of the whole dataset for a broad\nrange of deterministic and stochastic first-order methods. The gains are\nspecific to the choice of method. When particularized to, e.g., accelerated\ngradient descent and stochastic variance reduce gradient, the computational\ncost advantage is a logarithm of the number of training samples. Numerical\nexperiments on various datasets confirm theoretical claims and showcase the\ngains of using the proposed adaptive sample size scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 16:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

This requires online reconstruction for\nadditional detectors like TRD (Transition Radiation Detector) and TOF (Time Of\nFlight). We present prototypes of these developments, in particular a data\ncompression algorithm that achieves a compression factor of~9 on Run 2 TPC\ndata, and the efficiency of online TRD tracking. We give an outlook to the\nchallenges of TPC tracking with continuous read out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 19:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

We have reduced earlier the unitarizability\nfor these groups to the case of so called weakly real representations.\nFollowing C. Jantzen, to an irreducible weakly real representation $\\pi$ of a\nclassical group one can attach a sequence ($\\pi_1,\\dots,\\pi_k)$ of irreducible\nrepresentations of classical groups, each of them supported by a line of\ncuspidal representations $X_\\rho$ of general linear groups containing a\nselfcontragredient representation $\\rho$, and an irreducible cuspidal\nrepresentation $\\sigma$ of a classical group.

First, instead of using the raw\npixel-value as features that are brittle in the presence of dynamic background,\nwe devise a so-called Gaussian max-pooling operator to estimate a\n\"stable-value\" for each pixel. Those stable-values are robust to various\nbackground changes and can therefore distinguish effectively the foreground\nobjects from the background. Then, to obtain more accurate results, we further\npropose a Segmentation Constrained RPCA (SC-RPCA) model, which incorporates the\ntemporal and spatial continuity in images into RPCA. The inference process of\nSC-RPCA is a group sparsity constrained nuclear norm minimization problem,\nwhich is convex and easy to solve. Experimental results on seven videos from\nthe CDCNET 2014 database show the superior performance of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2017 03:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

The\nsubstrate induced interactions (SII) involve sub-lattice-resolved, and enhanced\nintrinsic spin-orbit couplings, the extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling\n(RSOC), and the orbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic charge\nfrom graphene to the substrate. Furthermore, magnetic impurity atoms are\ndeposited to the graphene surface and the corresponding exchange field is\nincluded in the band dispersion. A Rashba coupling dependent pseudo Zeeman term\narising due to the interplay of SIIs was found to be responsible for the spin\ndegeneracy lifting and the spin polarization. The latter turns out to be\nelectrostatic doping and the exchange field tunable and inversely proportional\nto the square root of the carrier concentration. The strain field, on the other\nhand, brings about the valley polarization. The intra-band plasmon dispersion\nfor the finite doping and the long wavelength limit has also been obtained. The\ndispersion involves the q2/3 behavior and not the well known q1/2 behavior.

Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover\nring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a\nsmall part of the transit.

Among different types of\nrandom number generators (RNG), quantum random number generator (QRNG) is a\nkind of promising RNG as it can provide provable true random numbers based on\nthe inherent randomness of fundamental quantum processes. Nevertheless, the\nrandomness from a QRNG can be diminished (or even destroyed) if the devices\n(especially the entropy source devices) are not perfect or ill-characterized.\nTo eliminate the practical security loopholes from the source,\nsource-independent QRNGs, which allow the source to have arbitrary and unknown\ndimensions, have been introduced and become one of the most important\nsemi-device-independent QRNGs. Herein a method that enables ultra-fast\nunpredictable quantum random number generation from quadrature fluctuations of\nquantum optical field without any assumptions on the input states is proposed.\nParticularly, to estimate a lower bound on the extractable randomness that is\nindependent from side information held by an eavesdropper, a new security\nanalysis framework is established based on the extremality of Gaussian states,\nwhich can be easily extended to design and analyze new semi-device-independent\ncontinuous variable QRNG protocols.

We consider the flavor\nphenomenology of this model in the context of the intriguing hints for new\nphysics in semileptonic $B$ decays. The necessary violation of lepton flavor\nuniversality is induced by mixing SM and vector-like fermions. Concerning\n$R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ we find that sizable effects are possible while respecting\nthe bounds from other flavor observables but predicting a large enhancement of\n$B_s\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$. Furthermore, also in $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ transitions the\nobserved deviations from the SM predictions (including $R(K)$ and $R(K^*)$) can\nbe explained with natural values for the free parameters of the model without\nany fine-tuning, predicting sizable decay rates for $b\\to s\\tau\\mu$. Finally,\nthe anomaly in anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be accounted for by a\nloop-contribution involving the vector leptoquark and vector-like leptons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2017 09:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 11:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Conventional optical mirrors are reciprocal: in a given plane of\nincidence, reflection is independent of the sign of the angle of incidence,\nwhich enables two people to simultaneously look at each other through their\nreflection. In contrast, we propose a strategy to dramatically break this\nsymmetry by exploiting resonant interactions between a travelling acoustic wave\nand highly resonant guided optical modes, inducing total reflection of an\noptical beam at a given angle, and no reflection at the negative angle.\nDifferent from conventional acousto-optic isolators, which are based on\nnon-resonant frequency conversion and filtering, our proposal operates at the\nfrequency of the optical signal by tailoring the resonant properties of the\nstructure as well as the acoustic wave frequency and intensity, enabling 50 dB\nisolation with modest modulation requirements.

In this paper we performed a systematic and homogeneous analysis\nof sufficiently bright X-ray flares from the SFXTs observed with XMM-Newton to\nprobe spectral variations on timescales as short as a few hundred of seconds.\nOur ultimate goal is to investigate if SFXT flares and outbursts are triggered\nby the presence of clumps and eventually reveal whether strongly or mildly\ndense clumps are required.

Overall, there seems to be no obvious correlation between the dynamic\nranges in the X-ray fluxes and absorption column densities in SFXTs, with an\nindication that lower densities are recorded at the highest fluxes. This can be\nexplained by the presence of accretion inhibition mechanism(s). We propose a\nclassification of the flares/outbursts from these sources to drive future\nobservational investigations. We suggest that the difference between the\nclasses of flares/outbursts is related to the fact that the mechanism(s)\ninhibiting accretion can be overcome more easily in some sources compared to\nothers.

We built these with the Cotton tensor,\nwhose properties (tracelessness, symmetry, divergencelessness; completeness,\ninvariance) we established.

Type-logical\ngrammars, being closely related to type theories and systems used in functional\nprogramming, are a perfect candidate to next apply this curiosity to. The\nadvantages of using proof assistants is that they allow one to write formally\nverified proofs about one's type-logical systems, and that any theory, once\nimplemented, can immediately be computed with. The downside is that in many\ncases the formal proofs are written as an afterthought, are incomplete, or use\nobtuse syntax. This makes it that the verified proofs are often much more\ndifficult to read than the pen-and-paper proofs, and almost never directly\npublished. In this paper, we will try to remedy that by example.\n  Concretely, we use Agda to model the Lambek-Grishin calculus, a grammar logic\nwith a rich vocabulary of type-forming operations.

Majority of the applications of sampling use randomized sampling,\nalbeit with stratification where applicable. The randomized technique is not\nconsistent, and may provide different samples each time, and the different\nsamples themselves may not be similar to each other. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel non-statistical no-replacement sampling technique called\nWobbly Center Algorithm, which relies on building clusters iteratively based on\nmaximizing the heterogeneity inside each cluster. The algorithm works on the\nprinciple of stepwise building of clusters by finding the points with the\nmaximal distance from the cluster center. The obtained results are validated\nstatistically using Analysis of Variance tests by comparing the samples\nobtained to check if they are representative of each other. The obtained\nresults generated from running the Wobbly Center algorithm on benchmark\ndatasets when compared against other sampling algorithms indicate the\nsuperiority of the Wobbly Center Algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 17:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 06:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 01:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Previously, to\nperform a 3D reconstruction, specialized hardwares were required. Such systems\nwere often very expensive and was only available for industrial or research\npurpose. With the rise of the availability of high-quality low cost 3D sensors,\nit is now possible to design inexpensive complete 3D scanning systems. The\nobjective of this work was to design an acquisition and processing system that\ncan perform 3D scanning and reconstruction of objects seamlessly. In addition,\nthe goal of this work also included making the 3D scanning process fully\nautomated by building and integrating a turntable alongside the software. This\nmeans the user can perform a full 3D scan only by a press of a few buttons from\nour dedicated graphical user interface. Three main steps were followed to go\nfrom acquisition of point clouds to the finished reconstructed 3D model. First,\nour system acquires point cloud data of a person/object using inexpensive\ncamera sensor. Second, align and convert the acquired point cloud data into a\nwatertight mesh of good quality. Third, export the reconstructed model to a 3D\nprinter to obtain a proper 3D print of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2017 13:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

It provides a natural statistical significance test for the\ninferred hierarchy, and it can be used to perform inference tasks such as\npredicting the existence or direction of edges. The ranking is obtained by\nsolving a linear system of equations, which is sparse if the network is; thus\nthe resulting algorithm is extremely efficient and scalable.
