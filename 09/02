In order to\nexamine the potential policy and legal remedies for emotion AI as an emerging\ntechnology, we first establish a framework of actors, collection motivations,\ntime scales, and space considerations that differentiates emotion AI from other\nalgorithmic lenses. Each of these elements influences available policy\nremedies, and should shape continuing discussions on the antecedent conditions\nthat make emotional AI acceptable or not in particular contexts. Based on our\nframework of unique elements, we examine potential available policy remedies to\nprevent or remediate harm. Specifically, our paper looks toward the regulatory\nrole of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, gaps in the EU's General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) allowing for emotion data collection, and\nprecedent set by polygraph technologies in evidentiary and use restrictions set\nby law. We also examine the way social norms and adaptations could grow to also\nmodulate broader use. Given the challenges in controlling the flow of these\ndata, we call for further research and attention as emotion AI technology\nremains poised for adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 17:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

General Circulation Models (GCMs) are unable to do so, and various\nrainfall generators designed by hydrologists using stochastic processes like\nGaussian Processes are also difficult to apply over the vast and highly diverse\nlandscape of India. In this paper, we explore a series of Bayesian models based\non conditional distributions of latent variables that describe weather\nconditions at specific locations and over the whole country. During parameter\nestimation from observed data, we use spatio-temporal smoothing using Markov\nRandom Field so that the parameters learnt are spatially and temporally\ncoherent.

Several dynamical\nmechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central\nstellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nbinaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity\nanisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,\nand other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations\nto theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show\nthat SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst\npreference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive\nfine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the\nobserved DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the\ninitial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\\rho(r)$, is\nexceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the\npost-starburst preference requires $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium\nprofile of $\\gamma = 7/4$.

We present 3\\,mm photometric\nobservations carried out with the IRAM/Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) of\nthree BD disks in the Taurus star forming region, which have been observed with\nALMA at 0.89\\,mm. The disks were not resolved and only one was detected with\nenough confidence ($\\sim3.5\\sigma$) with PdBI. Based on these observations, we\nobtain the values and lower limits of the spectral index and find low values\n($\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}\\lesssim 3.0$). We compare these observations in the context\nof particle trapping by an embedded planet, a promising mechanism to explain\nthe observational signatures in more massive and warmer disks. We find,\nhowever, that this model cannot reproduce the current millimeter observations\nfor BD disks, and multiple-strong pressure bumps globally distributed in the\ndisk remain as a favorable scenario to explain observations. Alternative\npossibilities are that the gas masses in BD disk are very low\n($\\sim2\\times10^{-3}\\,M_{\\rm{Jup}}$) such that the millimeter grains are\ndecoupled and do not drift, or fast growth of fluffy aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 18:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

To address this issue, in this paper we introduce\nPassGAN, a novel approach that replaces human-generated password rules with\ntheory-grounded machine learning algorithms. Instead of relying on manual\npassword analysis, PassGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to\nautonomously learn the distribution of real passwords from actual password\nleaks, and to generate high-quality password guesses. Our experiments show that\nthis approach is very promising. When we evaluated PassGAN on two large\npassword datasets, we were able to surpass rule-based and state-of-the-art\nmachine learning password guessing tools. However, in contrast with the other\ntools, PassGAN achieved this result without any a-priori knowledge on passwords\nor common password structures. Additionally, when we combined the output of\nPassGAN with the output of HashCat, we were able to match 51%-73% more\npasswords than with HashCat alone. This is remarkable, because it shows that\nPassGAN can autonomously extract a considerable number of password properties\nthat current state-of-the art rules do not encode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 18:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 21:03:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

The formulated problem is a mixed continuous-discrete optimization\nproblem, which is nontrivial to resolve in general.

However, the existing Farey sequence\nis not applicable when the constellation sizes of the two users are not the\nsame. Motivated by this, we define a new type of Farey sequence, termed punched\nFarey sequence.

In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that without gravity (i.e. $Fr=\\infty$, where $Fr$ is\nthe Froude number), bidispersity leads to an enhancement of the relative\nvelocities, and a suppression of their spatial clustering. For $Fr<1$, the\nrelative velocities in the direction of gravity are enhanced by the\ndifferential settling velocities of the bidisperse particles, as expected.\nHowever, we also find that gravity can strongly enhance the relative velocities\nin the \"horizontal\" directions (i.e. in the plane normal to gravity). This\nnon-trivial behavior occurs because fast settling particles experience rapid\nfluctuations in the fluid velocity field along their trajectory, leading to\nenhanced particle accelerations and relative velocities. Indeed, the results\nshow that even when $Fr\\ll1$, turbulence can still play an important role, not\nonly on the horizontal motion, but also on the vertical motion of the\nparticles, with significant implications for understanding the mixing rates of\nsettling bidisperse particles in turbulence.

The received power of each interferer\ndepends on the direction it points and whether it is line-of-sight (LOS),\nnon-LOS (i.e., partially blocked), or completely blocked. While interferers\nthat are sufficiently far away will almost certainly be completely blocked, a\nfinite number of interferers in close proximity will be subject to random\npartial blockages. Previous attempts to characterize mmWave networks have made\nthe simplifying assumption that all interferers within some radius, called the\nLOS ball, are unblocked, while interferers beyond that radius are non-LOS.\nHowever, compared to simulation results, the LOS ball assumption tends to\noverestimate outage. In this paper, we present an accurate yet tractable\nanalysis of finite mmWave networks that dispenses with the LOS ball assumption.\nIn the analysis, each interferer has a distribution that is selected randomly\nfrom several possibilities, each representing different blockage and\ndirectivity states. First, the exact outage probability is found for a finite\nnetwork with interferers in fixed locations. Then, the spatially averaged\noutage probability is found by averaging over the interferer locations. While\nthe focus is on device-to-device networks, the analysis is general enough to\nfind applications outside of the present mmWave framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 02:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

Elements of\nthis structure include the root (that could also be composite), prefixes and\nsuffixes with which various nuances and relations to other words can be\nexpressed. Thus, in order to build a proper word representation one must take\ninto account its internal structure. From a corpus of texts we extract a set of\nfrequent subwords and from the latter set we select patterns, i.e. subwords\nwhich encapsulate information on character $n$-gram regularities. The selection\nis made using the pattern-based Conditional Random Field model with $l_1$\nregularization. Further, for every word we construct a new sequence over an\nalphabet of patterns. The new alphabet's symbols confine a local statistical\ncontext stronger than the characters, therefore they allow better\nrepresentations in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and are better building blocks for word\nrepresentation. In the task of subword-aware language modeling, pattern-based\nmodels outperform character-based analogues by 2-20 perplexity points.

Previous approaches to\non-line motion planning assume that a rough map of the environment is\navailable, thereby simplifying the problem. This paper presents a reactive\non-line motion planner, Robust Autonomous Waypoint generation (RAW), for mobile\nrobots navigating in unknown and unstructured environments. RAW generates a\nlocally maximal ellipsoid around the robot, using semi-definite programming,\nsuch that the surrounding obstacles lie outside the ellipsoid. A reinforcement\nlearning agent then generates a local waypoint in the robot's field of view,\ninside the ellipsoid. The robot navigates to the waypoint and the process\niterates until it reaches the goal. By following the waypoints the robot\nnavigates through a sequence of overlapping ellipsoids, and avoids collision.\nRobot's safety is guaranteed theoretically and the claims are validated through\nrigorous numerical experiments in four different experimental setups.\nNear-optimality is shown empirically by comparing RAW trajectories with the\nglobal optimal trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 08:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

What follows is that the set of separable states\nwhich can be reached during the evolution has zero volume and hence, such\neffects as sudden death of qubit-environment entanglement are very unlikely. In\ncase of the discord with respect to the qubit, a vast majority of separable\nstates qubit-environment is discordant, but in specific situations zero-discord\nstates are possible. This is conceptually important since there is a connection\nbetween the discordance with respect to a given subsystem and the possibility\nof describing the evolution of this subsystem using completely positive maps.\nFinally, we use the formalism to find an exemplary evolution of an entangled\nstate of two qubits that is completely positive, occurs solely due to\ninteraction of only one of the qubits with its environment (so one could guess\nthat it corresponds to a local operation, since it is local in a physical\nsense), but which nevertheless causes the enhancement of entanglement between\nthe qubits. While this simply means that the considered evolution is completely\npositive, but does not belong to LOCC, it shows how much caution has to be\nexercised when identifying evolution channels that belong to that class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 10:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 12:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We have\nmodeled the spallation process during vertical impacts over a range of impact\nvelocities from 6 to 21 km/s using both grid- and particle-based hydrocode\nmodels. The Tillotson equations of state, which are able to treat the nonlinear\ndependence of density on pressure and thermal pressure in the strongly shocked\nmatter, were used to study the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic response after\nimpacts. The effects of material strength and gravitational acceleration were\nnot considered. A two-dimensional time-dependent pressure field within a\n1.5-fold projectile radius from the impact point was investigated in\ncylindrical coordinates to address the generation of spalled material. A\nresolution test was also performed to reject ejected materials with peak\npressures that were too low due to artificial viscosity. The relationship\nbetween ejection velocity veject and peak pressure Ppeak was also derived. Our\napproach shows that late stage acceleration in an ejecta curtain occurs due to\nthe compressible nature of the ejecta, resulting in an ejection velocity that\ncan be higher than the ideal maximum of the resultant particle velocity after\npassage of a shock wave. We also calculate the ejecta mass that can escape from\na planet like Mars (i.e., veject higher than 5 km/s) that matches the\npetrographic constraints from Martian meteorites, and which occurs when Ppeak\nfrom 30-50 GPa. Although the mass of such ejecta is limited to from 0.1-1\npercent of the projectile mass in vertical impacts, this is sufficient for\nspallation to have been a plausible mechanism for the ejection of Martian\nmeteorites. Finally, we propose that impact spallation is a plausible mechanism\nfor the generation of tektites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 10:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

To this end our work has made\nthree main contributions. At first, we have demonstrated that exfoliation via\nionic liquid assisted grinding combined with gradient centrifugation is an\nefficient method to exfoliate bulk WS2 to nanosheets with a thickness of a few\natomic layers and lateral size dimensions in the range of 100 nm to 2 nm. These\nWS2 nanosheets decorated with scattered nanodots exhibited highly enhanced\ncatalytic performance for HER with an onset potential of -130 mV vs. RHE, an\noverpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec-1 in 0.5 M\nH2SO4. Secondly, we found a strong aging effect on the electrocatalytic\nperformance of WS2 stored in high boiling point organic solvents such as\ndimethylformamide (DMF). Importantly, the HER ability could be recovered by\nremoving the organic (DMF) residues, which obstructed the electron transport,\nwith acetone. Thirdly, we established that the HER performance of WS2\nnanosheets/nanodots could be significantly enhanced, by activating the\nelectrode surface at a positive voltage for a very short time (60 s),\ndecreasing the kinetic overpotential by more than 80 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The\nperformance enhancement was found to arise primarily from the ability of a\nformed proton-intercalated amorphous tungsten trioxide (a-WO3) to provide\nadditional active sites and favourably modify the immediate chemical\nenvironment of the WS2 catalyst, rendering it more favorable for local proton\ndelivery and/or transport to the active edge site of WS2. Our results provide\nnew insights into the effects of organic solvents and electrochemical\nactivation on the catalytic performance of two-dimensional WS2 for HER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 11:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

In this paper we investigate conditions under which\nevolving a smooth rotationally symmetric sphere by a linear combination of its\nradii of curvature yields a Hopf sphere. When the coefficients of the flow have\ncertain integer values, the fate of an initial sphere is entirely determined by\nthe local geometry of its isolated umbilic points. A surprising variety of\nbehaviours is uncovered: convergence to round spheres and non-round Hopf\nspheres, as well as divergence to infinity.\n  The critical quantity is the rate of vanishing of the astigmatism - the\ndifference of the radii of curvature - at the isolated umbilic points. It is\nproven that the size of this quantity versus the coefficient in the flow\nfunction determines the fate of the evolution.\n  The geometric setting for the equation is Radius of Curvature space, viewed\nas a pair of hyperbolic/AdS half-planes joined along their boundary, the\numbilic horizon. A rotationally symmetric sphere determines a parameterized\ncurve in this plane with end-points on the umbilic horizon. The slope of the\ncurve at the umbilic horizon is linked by the Codazzi-Mainardi equations to the\nrate of vanishing of astigmatism, and for generic initial conditions can be\nused to determine the outcome of the flow.\n  The slope can jump during the flow, and a number of examples are given:\ninstant jumps of the initial slope, as well as umbilic circles that contract to\npoints in finite time and 'pop' the slope. Finally, we present soliton-like\nsolutions: curves that evolve under linear flows by mutual hyperbolic/AdS\nisometries (dilation and translation) of Radius of Curvature space. A\nforthcoming paper will apply these geometric ideas to non-linear curvature\nflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 13:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

We find that the maximum absolute difference between\nthe abundances in a disc given by broken and pure linear relations is less than\n0.05 dex in the majority of our galaxies and exceeds the scatter in abundances\nfor 26 out of 134 galaxies considered. The scatter in abundances around the\nbroken linear relation is close (within a few percent) to that around the pure\nlinear relation. The breaks in the surface brightness profiles are more\nprominent. The scatter around the broken exponent in a number of galaxies is\nlower by a factor of two or more than that around the pure exponent. The shapes\nof the abundance gradients and surface brightness profiles within the optical\nradius in a galaxy may be different. A pure exponential surface brightness\nprofile may be accompanied by a broken abundance gradient and vise versa. There\nis no correlation between the break radii of the abundance gradients and\nsurface brightness profiles. Thus, a break in the surface brightness profile\ndoes not need to be accompanied by a break in the abundance gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 15:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}
