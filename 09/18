Latest research showed that current organization and retrieval of\nmusic tracks based on album information are inefficient. Moreover, they\ndemonstrated that people use emotion tags for music tracks in order to search\nand retrieve them. In this paper, we discuss separability of a set of emotional\nlabels, proposed in the categorical emotion expression, using Fisher's\nseparation theorem. We determine a set of adjectives to tag music parts: happy,\nsad, relaxing, exciting, epic and thriller. Temporal, frequency and energy\nfeatures have been extracted from the music parts. It could be seen that the\nmaximum separability within the extracted features occurs between relaxing and\nepic music parts. Finally, we have trained a classifier using Support Vector\nMachines to automatically recognize and generate emotional labels for a music\npart. Accuracy for recognizing each label has been calculated; where the\nresults show that epic music can be recognized more accurately (77.4%),\ncomparing to the other types of music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 16:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

We also find that the BC\ndistribution is robust to major alterations in the network, including\nsignificant changes to its topology and edge weight structure, indicating that\nthe only relevant factors shaping the distribution are the number of nodes and\nedges as well as the constraint of planarity. Through simulations of random\nplanar graph models and analytical calculations on Cayley trees, this\ninvariance is demonstrated to be a consequence of a bimodal regime consisting\nof an underlying tree structure for high BC nodes, and a low BC regime arising\nfrom the presence of loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the\nhigh BC nodes display a non-trivial spatial dependence, with increasing spatial\ncorrelation as a function of the number of edges, leading them to cluster\naround the barycenter at large densities. Our results suggest that the spatial\ndistribution of the BC is a more accurate discriminator when comparing patterns\nacross cities. Moreover, the BC being a static predictor of congestion in\nplanar graphs, the observed invariance and spatial dependence has practical\nimplications for infrastructural and biological networks. In particular, for\nthe case of street networks, as long as planarity is conserved, bottlenecks\ncontinue to persist, and the effect of planned interventions to alleviate\nstructural congestion will be limited primarily to load redistribution, a\nfeature confirmed by analyzing 200 years of data for central Paris.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 21:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Instead\nof handcrafted context models, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nperform the probability estimation.

This model is called into\nquestion due to the discovery of several such short lived clouds, which\nsuggests they are common, and hence it is unlikely that their formation\ninvolves an exotic object such as an intermediate mass black hole. In this\npaper we propose an alternative model, where supernovae produce such clouds. We\napply our model to a such a cloud called CO-0.40-0.22. A previous work pointed\nout the fact that the kinetic energy of this cloud is comparable to that from a\nsupernova, but disqualified the supernova scenario due to lack of thermal\nemission. We explain the lack of thermal emission as a consequence of the large\ndensity of the medium. In such a medium, the supernova shock is radiation\ndominated, and hence the initial temperatures are lower by many orders of\nmagnitude compared with a typical supernova. Finally, we discuss some of the\nconsequences of having a significant population of intermediate mass black\nholes in the galactic centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 01:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In the form of credit networks\nsuch as Ripple and Stellar, they also enable low-price real-time gross\nsettlements across different currencies. For example, SilentWhsipers is a\nrecently proposed fully distributed credit network relying on path-based\ntransactions for secure and in particular private payments without a public\nledger. At the core of a decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that\ndiscovers transaction paths between payer and payee. During the last year, a\nnumber of routing algorithms have been proposed.

A potential solution is to use low-resolution digital-to-analog\nconverters (DAC)/analog-to-digital converters for each antenna and RF chain.\nHowever, using low-resolution DACs at the transmit side directly limits the\ndegree of freedom of output signals and thus poses a challenge to the precoding\ndesign. In this study, we develop efficient and universal algorithms for a\ndownlink massive MU-MIMO system with finite-alphabet precodings. Our algorithms\nare developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)\nframework. The original ADMM does not converge in a nonlinear discrete\noptimization problem. The primary cause of this problem is that the alternating\n(update) directions in ADMM on one side are biased, and those on the other side\nare unbiased. By making the two updates consistent in an unbiased manner, we\ndevelop two algorithms called iterative discrete estimation (IDE) and IDE2: IDE\ndemonstrates excellent performance and IDE2 possesses a significantly low\ncomputational complexity. Compared with state-of-the-art techniques, the\nproposed precoding algorithms present significant advantages in performance and\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 03:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 05:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 11:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

These are linearly constrained optimization problems with piecewise\nlinear-quadratic (PLQ) objective functions. Starting from a study of the\nrepresentation of such a function in terms of a family of elementary functions\nconsisting of squared affine functions, squared plus-composite-affine\nfunctions, and affine functions themselves, we summarize some local properties\nof a PLQ function in terms of their first and second-order directional\nderivatives. We extend some well-known necessary and sufficient second-order\nconditions for local optimality of a quadratic program to a PLQ program and\nprovide a dozen such equivalent conditions for strong, strict, and isolated\nlocal optimality, showing in particular that a PLQ program has the same\ncharacterizations for local minimality as a standard quadratic program. As a\nconsequence of one such condition, we show that the number of strong, strict,\nor isolated local minima of a PLQ program is finite; this result supplements a\nrecent result about the finite number of directional stationary objective\nvalues. Interestingly, these finiteness results can be uncovered by invoking a\nvery powerful property of subanalytic functions; our proof is fairly\nelementary, however.

In many problem domains, linear classifiers are preferred\nover more complex models due to their efficiency, robustness and\ninterpretability, and the bag-of-words text representation can capture\nsufficient information for linear classifiers to make highly accurate\npredictions. However in settings where there is a large vocabulary, large\nvariance in the frequency of terms in the training corpus, many classes and\nvery short text (e.g., single sentences or document titles) the bag-of-words\nrepresentation becomes extremely sparse, and this can reduce the accuracy of\nclassifiers.

In the southern\nhemisphere several efforts are currently ongoing to investigate the feasibility\nof a similar observatory at very high altitude sites in the Andes. The science\ncase for such an observatory should be complementary to the science to be\nperformed by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. There are two clear\ndirections in which such an observatory could optimize its performance.\nFirstly, optimize the performance of sub-TeV energies. This is especially\nimportant to provide an unbiased monitoring of a large fraction of the sky for\nobservations of transient and extended sources. Secondly, to obtain the largest\nphoton statistics above roughly 50 TeV, which requires a large collection area\nwith sufficient performance in angular and energy resolution. This would enable\nto extend spectral measurements of Galactic sources and gives the opportunity\nto search for dark matter and exotic physics in a new energy range. Using\nsimulated air showers and a generalized detector description the performance of\na conceptual observatory is studied and the ways to optimize it will be\ndiscussed. With this approach the baseline design of such an observatory can be\nobtained without the need of detailed simulations of the detector hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 07:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Distinct from previous unsupervised machine learning approaches used in\nastronomy we use no pre-selection or pre-filtering of target galaxy type to\nidentify galaxies that are similar. We demonstrate the technique on the HST\nFrontier Fields. By training the algorithm using galaxies from one field (Abell\n2744) and applying the result to another (MACS0416.1-2403), we show how the\nalgorithm can cleanly separate early and late type galaxies without any form of\npre-directed training for what an 'early' or 'late' type galaxy is. We then\napply the technique to the HST CANDELS fields, creating a catalogue of\napproximately 60,000 classifications. We show how the automatic classification\ngroups galaxies of similar morphological (and photometric) type, and make the\nclassifications public via a catalogue, a visual catalogue and galaxy\nsimilarity search. We compare the CANDELS machine-based classifications to\nhuman-based classifications from the Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS project. Although\nthere is not a direct mapping between Galaxy Zoo and our hierarchical\nlabelling, we demonstrate a good level of concordance between human and machine\nclassifications. Finally, we show how the technique can be used to identify\nrarer objects and present new lensed galaxy candidates from the CANDELS\nimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 09:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

This report focuses on the collision-free control for multiple\nrobots in both complete coverage and search tasks in 2D and 3D areas which are\narbitrary unknown. All algorithms are decentralized as robots have limited\nabilities and they are mathematically proved.\n  The report starts with the grid selection in the two tasks. Grid patterns\nsimplify the representation of the area and robots only need to move straightly\nbetween neighbor vertices. For the 100% complete 2D coverage, the equilateral\ntriangular grid is proposed. For the complete coverage ignoring the boundary\neffect, the grid with the fewest vertices is calculated in every situation for\nboth 2D and 3D areas.\n  The second part is for the complete coverage in 2D and 3D areas. A\ndecentralized collision-free algorithm with the above selected grid is\npresented driving robots to sections which are furthest from the reference\npoint. The area can be static or expanding, and the algorithm is simulated in\nMATLAB.\n  Thirdly, three grid-based decentralized random algorithms with collision\navoidance are provided to search targets in 2D or 3D areas. The number of\ntargets can be known or unknown. In the first algorithm, robots choose vacant\nneighbors randomly with priorities on unvisited ones while the second one adds\nthe repulsive force to disperse robots if they are close. In the third\nalgorithm, if surrounded by visited vertices, the robot will use the\nbreadth-first search algorithm to go to one of the nearest unvisited vertices\nvia the grid. The second search algorithm is verified on Pioneer 3-DX robots.\nThe general way to generate the formula to estimate the search time is\ndemonstrated. Algorithms are compared with five other algorithms in MATLAB to\nshow their effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

The\ndevice represents a compact and scalable tuning approach for use in III-V\nsemiconductor integrated quantum optical circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 08:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

The substitution causes a substantial\ndecrease in the Neel temperature (T_N) from 250 K (in parent sample, BFO) to\n152 K (in 2% Co substituted sample). At the same time, the substituted samples\ndisplay a pronounced irreversibility in the ZFC-FC magnetization data for T $<$\n370 K and opening of hysteresis in the M-H plot, thus signifying the onset of\nweak ferromagnetism (FM) and magnetic glassiness. The induced magnetic\nglassiness is found to slow down the dynamics such that the magnetization decay\nfollows. The dielectric measurement in the same temperature window shows\nunusual oppression in, for T$\\sim$T_N and contrasting nature of tan loss for\ntemperatures above and below T_N, thus hinting a plausible coupling between the\nmagnetic and electric order parameters. A confirmation to this coupling is seen\nin the magnetodielectric (MD) results, in which it is found that the\nsubstitution induces an additional component in the MD, apart from the usual\ncomponents in BFO. This additional component of MD is found to obey behaviour,\nwith the n values being comparable to 1-p of magnetization. The temperature\nvariation of MD also shows a contrasting behaviour for the parent and 2% Co\nsubstituted sample with an enhancement of two times in MD value. In summary,\nour study shows ME coupling introduced by the magnetic glassiness and its\nbehaviour is very much different from the intrinsic one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Prior work in\nthis class of learning dynamics primarily analyzes asymptotic convergence\nthrough stochastic approximations, where convergence can be associated with the\nlimit points of an ordinary-differential equation (ODE). However, analyzing\nglobal convergence through an ODE-approximation requires the existence of a\nLyapunov or a potential function, which naturally restricts the analysis to a\nfine class of games. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an\nalternative framework for analyzing asymptotic convergence that is based upon\nan explicit characterization of the invariant probability measure of the\ninduced Markov chain. We further provide a methodology for computing the\ninvariant probability measure in positive-utility games, together with an\nillustration in the context of coordination games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 11:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 10:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

Depending\non the external to the pore conditions the system evolves to various states of\nequilibrium, characterized by different values of the macroscopic\ncharacteristics such as temperature, density, pressure. Comparisons of results\nof molecular dynamic simulations with the results of calculations based on the\nmacroscopic diffusion model and experimental data allow to conclude that the\ncombination of macroscopic and microscopic approach could produce more adequate\nand more accurate description of processes of water vapor interaction with\nporous materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 11:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

While the coexistence of both the ferroic orders is\nencouraging from the view point of technological applications, the origin of\nferromagnetism in this system remains elusive. Here, we synthesized such\ncompositions and carried out a detailed structural analysis employing magnetic\nseparation of the powder particles. We found that the origin of ferromagnetism\nlies in the spontaneous precipitation of a minor ( ~ 1 wt %) barium hexaferrite\n(BaFe9O19) phase, often undetected in routine x-ray diffraction studies of\npowders sampled from the entire specimen. We also demonstrate that inspite of\nthe insignificant fraction the ferrimagnetic phase, this self-grown composite\nexhibit noticeably enhanced ferroelectric switching in the presence of external\nmagnetic field. We obtained a dc magnetoelectric coupling of ~ 9 x 10-8 s/m, a\nvalue which is comparable to what has been reported for layered\nferroelectric/ferromagnetic laminates and bilayer thin film\nferroelectric-ferromagnetic hetrostructures. Our study suggests that reasonably\nlarge magnetoelectric coupling is realizable in simple 0-3\nferroelectric-ferromagnetic bulk composites provided synthesis strategies are\ndeveloped which induces spontaneous precipitation of the ferromagnetic phase in\nsmall volume fraction to ensure good insulating behaviour of the composite thus\ndeveloped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 12:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

At the French-German\nResearch Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) most experimental railguns are driven\nby power supply units based on capacitors. Recent investigations at ISL explore\nthe possibility to use coil based systems to increase the energy density of the\npower supply. In this study an electrical circuit simulation is used to\ninvestigate the difference for railgun operation in between a capacitor and a\ncoil based power supply with respect to current amplitude behavior and\nprojectile velocity.

From a global perspective, the accumulated cyclone\nenergy increases gradually since 1963 and start to decrease after 1994.

Experimental results show that the\nproposed Fast YOLO framework can reduce the number of deep inferences by an\naverage of 38.13%, and an average speedup of ~3.3X for objection detection in\nvideo compared to the original YOLOv2, leading Fast YOLO to run an average of\n~18FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 13:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

The\nmethod is based on (i) a connection between fully nonlinear second-order PDEs\nand second-order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), (ii) a\nmerged formulation of the PDE and the 2BSDE problem, (iii) a temporal forward\ndiscretization of the 2BSDE and a spatial approximation via deep neural nets,\nand (iv) a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical\nresults obtained using ${\\rm T{\\small ENSOR}F{\\small LOW}}$ in ${\\rm P{\\small\nYTHON}}$ illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the method in the cases\nof a $100$-dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, a $100$-dimensional\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a nonlinear expectation of a $ 100\n$-dimensional $ G $-Brownian motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv =\nAv/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction variations in ultraviolet and\noptical bands. Since the Rv=3.1 extinction curve adequately represents the\naverage extinction law of diffuse regions in the Milky Way, it is commonly used\nto correct observational measurements along sightlines toward diffuse regions\nin the interstellar medium. However, the Rv value may vary even along different\ndiffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we investigate the\noptical--mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very diffuse region at l\n= 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map.\nAdopting red clump stars as extinction tracers, we determine the\noptical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our diffuse region in the two APASS bands\n(B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2MASS bands (J, H, Ks,\nand the two WISE bands (W1, W2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected\nfrom the APOGEE--RC catalog based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the\ndiversity of the extinction law.

As in the case of extended\nsupergravities, one model may possess different formulations related by\n$Sp(2n_v,\\mathbb{R})$. The symplectic group mixes its electric and magnetic\npotentials.

We used a combination of geochemical,\ngeophysical, and statistical methods to identify potential causal processes\nunderlying the correlations of degassing patterns of four gases (He, Rn, CO2,\nO2), earth tides, and tectonic processes in three mineral springs (Nette,\nKaerlich and Kobern). We explored whether temporal relations in gas\nconcentrations in the three mineral springs could be indicators of hidden\nfaults through which the gases migrate to the surface from deeper underground.\nOur results do not confirm CO2 as a primary carrier gas for trace gases in all\nsprings. Temporal analyses of the CO2-He couple indicate that Nette and\nK\\\"arlich are directly linked via a continuous tectonic fault in an ENE-WSW\ntrending direction. There is also evidence that Kaerlich and Kobern (NNE-SSW\nfault system) and Nette and Kobern (NW-SE fault system) are tectonically\nlinked. These fault linkages are unknown previously but could be related to the\nrising numbers of earthquake events occurring in this area since 2010.
