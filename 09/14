Based on this model, a four layer process for image segmentation is\nproposed using the split/merge approach. In the first layer, an image is split\ninto numerous regions using the watershed algorithm. In the second layer, a\nco-evolutionary process is applied to form centers of finals segments by\nmerging similar primary regions. In the third layer, a meta-heuristic process\nuses two operators to connect the residual regions to their corresponding\ndetermined centers. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is used to\ncombine the resulted similar and neighbor regions. Different layers of the\nalgorithm are totally independent, therefore for certain applications a\nspecific layer can be changed without constraint of changing other layers. Some\nproperties of this algorithm like the flexibility of its method, the ability to\nuse different feature vectors for segmentation (grayscale, color, texture,\netc), the ability to control uniformity and the number of final segments using\nfree parameters and also maintaining small regions, makes it possible to apply\nthe algorithm to different applications. Moreover, the independence of each\nregion from other regions in the second layer, and the independence of centers\nin the third layer, makes parallel implementation possible. As a result the\nalgorithm speed will increase. The presented algorithm was tested on a standard\ndataset (BSDS 300) of images, and the region boundaries were compared with\ndifferent people segmentation contours. Results show the efficiency of the\nalgorithm and its improvement to similar methods. As an instance, in 70% of\ntested images, results are better than ACT algorithm, besides in 100% of tested\nimages, we had better results in comparison with VSP algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 18:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

This\nnovel Lagrangian formulation is presented first for a generic reparametrization\ninvariant geometric model, deriving its equilibrium condition equation, or\nshape equation, and its linear and angular stress tensors, using the classical\nCanham-Helfrich elastic bending energy for illustration. The robustness of the\nformulation is established by extending it to the presence of external forces,\nand to the case of heterogenous lipid membranes, breaking reparametrization\ninvariance.

Theoretical models of speciation have addressed this\nquestion in the macroecological scale, but little has been investigated in the\nmacroevolutionary context. Knowledge of the evolutionary history allows the\nstudy of patterns underlying the processes considered in these models,\nrevealing their signatures and the role of speciation and extinction in shaping\nmacroevolutionary patterns. In this paper we introduce two algorithms to record\nthe evolutionary history of populations in individual-based models of\nspeciation, from which genealogies and phylogenies can be constructed. The\nfirst algorithm relies on saving ancestral-descendant relationships, generating\na matrix that contains the times to the most recent common ancestor between all\npairs of individuals at every generation (the Most Recent Common Ancestor Time\nmatrix, MRCAT). The second algorithm directly records all speciation and\nextinction events throughout the evolutionary process, generating a matrix with\nthe true phylogeny of species (the Sequential Speciation and Extinction Events,\nSSEE). We illustrate the use of these algorithms in a spatially explicit\nindividual-based model of speciation. We compare the trees generated via MRCAT\nand SSEE algorithms with trees inferred by methods that use only genetic\ndistance among extant species, commonly used in empirical studies and applied\nhere to simulated genetic data. Comparisons between tress are performed with\nmetrics describing the overall topology, branch length distribution and\nimbalance of trees.

They are correlated\nand they are of the interaction type. For the range of pressure in which the\nsystem underlies reentrant phase transition, it transits from large black holes\nphase to small one which possesses higher correlation than the other ranges of\npressures. On the other hand, the type of interaction between small black holes\nnear large/small transition line, differs for usual and reentrant phase\ntransitions. Indeed, for usual case, the dominant interaction is repulsive\nwhereas for reentrant case we encounter with an attractive interaction.

Such attacks can be devastating in practice, especially as DNNs are\nbeing applied to ever increasing critical tasks like image recognition in\nautonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the\nproblem. We do so by first defining robustness of a classifier to adversarial\nexploitation. Next, we show that the problem of adversarial example generation\ncan be posed as learning problem. We also categorize attacks in literature into\nhigh and low perturbation attacks; well-known attacks like fast-gradient sign\nmethod (FGSM) and our attack produce higher perturbation adversarial examples\nwhile the more potent but computationally inefficient Carlini-Wagner (CW)\nattack is low perturbation. Next, we show that the dual approach of the attack\nlearning problem can be used as a defensive technique that is effective against\nhigh perturbation attacks.

It has been\nexperimentally shown that directed motion can be induced, without any external\nfields, by certain geometrically asymmetric obstacles due to interaction\nbetween their boundaries and the swimmers. In this paper, we propose a\nkinetic-type model to study swimming and directional migration of microscale\nbimetallic rods in a periodic array of posts with non-circular cross-sections.\nBoth rod position and orientation are taken into account; rod trapping and\nrelease on the post boundaries are modeled by empirically characterizing\ncurvature and orientational dependence of the boundary absorption and\ndesorption. Intensity of the directed rod migration, which we call the\nnormalized net flux, is then defined and computed given the geometry of the\npost array. We numerically study the effect of post spacings on the flux; we\nalso apply shape optimization to find better post shapes that can induce\nstronger flux. Inspired by preliminary numerical results on two candidate\nposts, we perform an approximate analysis on a simplified model to show the key\ngeometric features a good post should have. Based on that, three new candidate\nshapes are proposed which give rise to large fluxes. This approach provides an\neffective tool and guidance for experimentally designing new devices that\ninduce strong directed migration of microscale swimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 17:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

We\nstress that the cusp is not a steady-state structure, but rather evolves in\namplitude while retaining an approximately $\\rho\\propto r^{-7/4}$ density\nprofile. Finally, we apply the method to the nuclear star cluster of the Milky\nWay, and illustrate a possible evolutionary scenario in which a two-component\nsystem of lighter main-sequence stars and stellar-mass black holes develops a\nBahcall-Wolf cusp in the heavier component and a weaker $\\rho\\propto r^{-3/2}$\ncusp in the lighter, visible component, over the period of several Gyr. The\npresent-day density profile is consistent with the recently detected mild cusp\ninside the central parsec, and is weakly sensitive to initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

The basic question we seek to answer is\nwhether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations\ngovern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for\ntransmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them,\nmust necessarily obey these limitations.

In this work, we analyze the speech representations learned by\na deep end-to-end model that is based on convolutional and recurrent layers,\nand trained with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. We use a\npre-trained model to generate frame-level features which are given to a\nclassifier that is trained on frame classification into phones. We evaluate\nrepresentations from different layers of the deep model and compare their\nquality for predicting phone labels.

Majorana particles often appear in the\ncontemporary many-body literature in the Kitaev, Fu-Kane, or Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\nmodels, where the Majorana condition of self-conjugacy immediately results in\nnonconserved particle number, non-trivial braiding statistics, and the absence\nof a noninteracting limit. We deviate from this description and instead\nconsider a gas of noninteracting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions that obey the\nspin-statistics theorem via imposing a condensed matter analog of momentum\nconservation. This allows us to build a quantum statistical theory of the\nMajorana system in the low temperature, low density limit without the need to\naccount for strong fluctuations in the particle number. A combinatorial\nanalysis leads to a configurational entropy which deviates from the fermionic\nresult with an increasing number of available microstates. A number-conserving\nMajorana distribution function is derived which shows signatures of a\nsharply-defined Fermi surface at finite temperatures. Such a distribution is\nthen re-derived from a microscopic model in the form of a modified Kitaev chain\nwith a bosonic pair interaction. The thermodynamics of this free Majorana\nsystem is found to be nearly identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except now\ndistinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy and, subsequently, a\nresidual entropy at zero temperature. Despite clear differences with the\nanyonic or Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we nevertheless find surprising agreement\nbetween our theory and experimental signatures of Majorana excitations in\nseveral materials.

As the target often occupies a relatively small region in the input\nimage, deep neural networks can be easily confused by the complex and variable\nbackground. To alleviate this, researchers proposed a coarse-to-fine approach,\nwhich used prediction from the first (coarse) stage to indicate a smaller input\nregion for the second (fine) stage. Despite its effectiveness, this algorithm\ndealt with two stages individually, which lacked optimizing a global energy\nfunction, and limited its ability to incorporate multi-stage visual cues.\nMissing contextual information led to unsatisfying convergence in iterations,\nand that the fine stage sometimes produced even lower segmentation accuracy\nthan the coarse stage.\n  This paper presents a Recurrent Saliency Transformation Network. The key\ninnovation is a saliency transformation module, which repeatedly converts the\nsegmentation probability map from the previous iteration as spatial weights and\napplies these weights to the current iteration. This brings us two-fold\nbenefits. In training, it allows joint optimization over the deep networks\ndealing with different input scales. In testing, it propagates multi-stage\nvisual information throughout iterations to improve segmentation accuracy.\nExperiments in the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, which outperforms the previous best by an average of\nover 2%. Much higher accuracies are also reported on several small organs in a\nlarger dataset collected by ourselves. In addition, our approach enjoys better\nconvergence properties, making it more efficient and reliable in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 19:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 13:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 21:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 01:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

The associated flare ribbon contained a quasi-periodic sawtooth pattern\nthat was observed to propagate along the ribbon, perpendicular to the IRIS\nspectral slit, with a phase velocity of $\\sim 15$ km s$^{-1}$. This motion\nresulted in periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity along the\nslit. These periodicities were reported to be approximately $\\pm0.5$ arcseconds\nin position and $\\pm20$ km s$^{-1}$ in velocity and were measured to be\n$\\sim180^{\\circ}$ out of phase with one another. This quasi-periodic behavior\nhas been attributed by others to bursty or patchy reconnection and slipping\noccurring during three-dimensional magnetic reconnection. While able to account\nfor periodicities in both intensity and Doppler velocity these suggestions do\nnot explicitly account for the phase velocity of the entire sawtooth structure,\nor for the relative phasing of the oscillations. Here we propose that the\nobservations can be explained by a tearing mode instability occurring at a\ncurrent sheet across which there is also a velocity shear. Using a linear model\nof this instability we reproduce the relative phase of the oscillations, as\nwell as the phase velocity of the sawtooth structure. We suggest a geometry and\nlocal plasma parameters for the April 18 flare which would support our\nhypothesis. Under this proposal the combined spectral and spatial IRIS\nobservations of this flare may provide the most compelling evidence to date of\na tearing mode occurring in the solar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

At its most\nbasic, it concerns a state of a bipartite quantum system whose subsystems are\nsubjected to local operations. We compare two different methods for obtaining\nthe original state from the state resulting from the action of these\noperations. The first method involves quantum operations called Petz recovery\nmaps, acting locally on the two subsystems. The second method is called matrix\n(or state) reconstruction and involves local, linear maps which are not\nnecessarily completely positive. Moreover, we compare the quantities on which\nthe maps employed in the two methods depend. We show that any state which\nadmits Petz recovery also admits state reconstruction. However, the latter is\nsuccessful for a strictly larger set of states. We also compare these methods\nin the context of a finite spin chain. Here, the state of a finite spin chain\nis reconstructed from the reduced states of a few neighbouring spins. In this\nsetting, state reconstruction is the same as the MPO (i.e. matrix product\noperator) reconstruction proposed by Baumgratz et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n020401 (2013)]. Finally, we generalize both these methods so that they employ\nlong-range measurements instead of relying solely on short-range correlations\nembodied in such local reduced states. Long-range measurements enable the\nreconstruction of states which cannot be reconstructed from measurements of\nlocal few-body observables alone and hereby we improve existing methods for\nquantum state tomography of quantum many-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

We then compare that result to theoretical\npredictions for various models. We examine the population of about 300 giant\nplanets with well-determined masses and radii and apply thermal evolution and\nBayesian statistical models to infer the anomalous power as a function of\nincident flux that best reproduces the observed radii. First, we observe that\nthe inflation of planets below about $M=0.5 \\;\\rm{M}_\\rm{J}$ appears very\ndifferent than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps as the result of mass\nloss or an inefficient heating mechanism.

NA can be local or global. Just as the\nrecent trend in the NA field, we also focus on global NA, which can be pairwise\n(PNA) and multiple (MNA). PNA produces aligned node pairs between two networks.\nMNA produces aligned node clusters between more than two networks. Recently,\nthe focus has shifted from PNA to MNA, because MNA captures conserved regions\nbetween more networks than PNA (and MNA is thus considered to be more\ninsightful), though at higher computational complexity. The issue is that, due\nto the different outputs of PNA and MNA, a PNA method is only compared to other\nPNA methods, and an MNA method is only compared to other MNA methods.\nComparison of PNA against MNA must be done to evaluate whether MNA's higher\ncomplexity is justified by its higher accuracy. We introduce a framework that\nallows for this. We evaluate eight prominent PNA and MNA methods, on synthetic\nand real-world biological networks, using topological and functional alignment\nquality measures.

This setting alleviates the\ndifficulty in collecting an exponentially large dataset to cover occlusion\npatterns and is more essential. In this scenario, the proposal-based deep\nnetworks, like RCNN-series, often produce unsatisfactory results, because both\nthe proposal extraction and classification stages may be confused by the\nirrelevant occluders. To address this, [25] proposed a voting mechanism that\ncombines multiple local visual cues to detect semantic parts. The semantic\nparts can still be detected even though some visual cues are missing due to\nocclusions. However, this method is manually-designed, thus is hard to be\noptimized in an end-to-end manner.\n  In this paper, we present DeepVoting, which incorporates the robustness shown\nby [25] into a deep network, so that the whole pipeline can be jointly\noptimized. Specifically, it adds two layers after the intermediate features of\na deep network, e.g., the pool-4 layer of VGGNet. The first layer extracts the\nevidence of local visual cues, and the second layer performs a voting mechanism\nby utilizing the spatial relationship between visual cues and semantic parts.\nWe also propose an improved version DeepVoting+ by learning visual cues from\ncontext outside objects.

These results establish a general underlying theoretical\nbackground to understand structural phase transitions in 2D materials and their\neffects on material properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 01:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

This is insufficient to drop all of the bonding states into the lower\nHubbard band however. An antiferroelectric distortion on the neighboring\nvanadium chain is required to reduce the repulsion felt by the Peierls bonding\nstates by increasing the distances between the vanadium and apical oxygen\natoms, lowering the potential overlap thus reducing the charge density\naccumulation and thereby the electronic repulsion. The antibonding states are\nsimultaneously pushed into the upper Hubbard band. The data indicate that\nsufficiently modified GW calculations are able to describe the interplay of the\natomic and electronic structures occurring in Mott metal-insulator transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 03:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

Library\ndependencies are constantly evolving, with newly added features and patches\nthat fix bugs in older versions. To take full advantage of third-party reuse,\ndevelopers should always keep up to date with the latest versions of their\nlibrary dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the extent of which\ndevelopers update their library dependencies. Specifically, we conducted an\nempirical study on library migration that covers over 4,600 GitHub software\nprojects and 2,700 library dependencies. Results show that although many of\nthese systems rely heavily on dependencies, 81.5% of the studied systems still\nkeep their outdated dependencies. In the case of updating a vulnerable\ndependency, the study reveals that affected developers are not likely to\nrespond to a security advisory. Surveying these developers, we find that 69% of\nthe interviewees claim that they were unaware of their vulnerable dependencies.\nFurthermore, developers are not likely to prioritize library updates, citing it\nas extra effort and added responsibility. This study concludes that even though\nthird-party reuse is commonplace, the practice of updating a dependency is not\nas common for many developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

Due to the sensing of its surroundings and information exchanged\nwith other vehicles and road infrastructure, a CAV will have access to large\namounts of useful data. While different control algorithms have been proposed\nfor CAVs, the benefits brought about by connectedness of autonomous vehicles to\nother vehicles and to the infrastructure, and its implications on policy\nlearning has not been investigated in literature. This paper investigates a\ndata driven driving policy learning framework through an agent-based modelling\napproaches. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. A dynamic programming\nframework is proposed for in-vehicle policy learning with and without\nconnectivity to neighboring vehicles. The simulation results indicate that\nwhile a CAV can learn to make autonomous decisions, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication of information improves this capability. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe limitations of sensing in a CAV, the paper proposes a novel concept for\ninfrastructure-led policy learning and communication with autonomous vehicles.\nIn infrastructure-led policy learning, road-side infrastructure senses and\ncaptures successful vehicle maneuvers and learns an optimal policy from those\ntemporal sequences, and when a vehicle approaches the road-side unit, the\npolicy is communicated to the CAV. Deep-imitation learning methodology is\nproposed to develop such an infrastructure-led policy learning framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 04:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

In this paper, we investigate the impact of\nmicro-packages in the npm JavaScript ecosystem. Specifically, we conducted an\nempirical in- vestigation with 169,964 JavaScript npm packages to understand\n(i) the widespread phenomena of micro-packages, (ii) the size dependencies\ninherited by a micro-package and (iii) the developer usage cost (ie., fetch,\ninstall, load times) of using a micro-package. Results of the study find that\nmicro-packages form a significant portion of the npm ecosystem.

We present a comprehensive framework spanning\nbiological, computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical\ncontinuity between levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by\nextensive data at each level. Learning is based on making predictions about\nwhat the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and\nadapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus\nof the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are\ngenerated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain\nareas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5\nintrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal\ndifference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex,\ndriving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only\nlocal activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed\nbiophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a\ncarefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of\nthree pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central\nprinciples: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations\nis essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the\ncollective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and\nopportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that\ndrive the learning of further high-level abstractions.

For precise determinations of parameters like the\nelectroweak gauge couplings or the mass of the top quark, efficient, unbiased,\nand theoretically unambiguous analysis methods are needed. Within this context,\nthe Matrix Element Method (MEM) has been established in hadron collider\nanalyses due to its possibility to top out at utilising the information\navailable in experimental data.

Solvent evaporation leads to the formation of a\nconcentrated solute layer at the drying interface, which slows down evaporation\nin a long-time scale regime. In this regime, often referred to as the falling\nrate period, evaporation is dominated by diffusive mass transport within the\nsolution, as already known.

The unexpected size of this comet-like exosphere\nprevented observing the full transit of its tail. In this Letter, we present\nnew Ly{\\alpha} observations of GJ 436 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The\nstability of the Ly{\\alpha} line over six years allowed us to combine these new\nobservations with archival data sets, substantially expanding the coverage of\nthe exospheric transit. Hydrogen atoms in the tail of the exospheric cloud keep\nocculting the star for 10-25 h after the transit of the planet, remarkably\nconfirming a previous prediction based on 3D numerical simulations with the\nEVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE). This result strengthens the interpretation\nthat the exosphere of GJ 436b is shaped by both radiative braking and charge\nexchanges with the stellar wind.

To increase the TLP further, recent GPUs\nhave increased the number of on-chip registers in every generation. However,\nwith the increase in the register file size, the leakage power increases. Also,\nwith the technology advances, the leakage power component has increased and has\nbecome an important consideration for the manufacturing process. The leakage\npower of a register file can be reduced by turning infrequently used registers\ninto low power (drowsy or off) state after accessing them. A major challenge in\ndoing so is the lack of runtime register access information.\n  This paper proposes GREENER (GPU REgister file ENErgy Reducer): a system to\nminimize leakage energy of the register file of GPUs. GREENER employs a\ncompile-time analysis to estimate the run-time register access information. The\nresult of the analysis is used to determine the power state of the registers\n(ON, SLEEP, or OFF) after each instruction. We propose a power optimized\nassembly instruction set that allows GREENER to encode the power state of the\nregisters in the executable itself.

Compared with the existed\napproaches, the attractive advantages of our schemes include 1) they are\ncompletely implemented based on only simple eXclusive OR (XOR) operations and\nhave systematic code property, 2) they can provide arbitrary fault tolerance,\n3) their storage efficiency is quasi-optimal, and 4) data and parity disks of\nRAID storage systems can be randomly expanded according to practical\nrequirements. Thus, our scheme is particularly suitable for RAID storage\nsystems that need higher reliability, availability, and expandability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 11:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

Hash-based methods, and in particular cuckoo hash tables, are\npopular for such lookup operations, but for large structures stored in off-chip\nmemory, such methods have the downside that they may require more than one\noff-chip memory access to perform the key lookup. Although the number of\noff-chip memory accesses can be reduced using on-chip approximate membership\nstructures such as Bloom filters, some lookups may still require more than one\noff-chip memory access. This can be problematic for some hardware\nimplementations, as having only a single off-chip memory access enables a\npredictable processing of lookups and avoids the need to queue pending\nrequests.\n  We provide a data structure for hash-based lookups based on cuckoo hashing\nthat uses only one off-chip memory access per lookup, by utilizing an on-chip\npre-filter to determine which of multiple locations holds a key. We make\nparticular use of the flexibility to move elements within a cuckoo hash table\nto ensure the pre-filter always gives the correct response. While this requires\na slightly more complex insertion procedure and some additional memory accesses\nduring insertions, it is suitable for most packet processing applications where\nkey lookups are much more frequent than insertions. An important feature of our\napproach is its simplicity. Our approach is based on simple logic that can be\neasily implemented in hardware, and hardware implementations would benefit most\nfrom the single off-chip memory access per lookup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 11:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

Millimeter-wave interferometry is the\noptimal investigative tool for this purpose. The circumstellar envelope IRC +10\n216 and its central star, the C-rich TP-AGB star closest to the Sun, are the\nbest objects for such an investigation. Two years ago, we reported on IRAM 30-m\ntelescope CO(2-1) line emission observations in that envelope (HPBW 11\"). We\nnow report much higher angular resolution observations of CO(2-1), CO(1-0),\nCN(2-1) and C$_4$H(24-23) made with the SMA, PdB and ALMA interferometers (with\nsynthesized half-power beamwidths of 3\", 1\" and 0.3\", respectively). Although\nthe envelope appears more intricate at high resolution, its prevailing\nstructure remains a pattern of thin, nearly concentric shells. Outside the\nsmall (r<0.3\") dust formation zone, the gas appears to expand radially at a\nconstant velocity, 14.5 km/s, with small turbulent motions. Based on that\nproperty, we have reconstructed the 3-D structure of the outer envelope and\nhave derived the gas temperature and density radial profiles in the inner\n(r<25\") envelope. The over-dense shells have spherical or slightly oblate\nshapes and typically extend over a few steradians, implying isotropic mass\nloss. The regular spacing of shells in the outer envelope supports the model of\na binary star system with a period of 700 years and a near face-on elliptical\norbit. The companion fly-by triggers enhanced episodes of mass loss near\nperiastron. The densification of the shell pattern observed in the central part\nof the envelope suggests a more complex scenario for the last few thousand\nyears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 12:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The CO SLEDs are found to be similar to those of the local\nstarburst-dominated ULIRGs and of the previously studied SMGs. After correcting\nfor lensing amplification, we derived the global properties of the bulk of\nmolecular gas in the SMGs using non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. The gas\nthermal pressure is found to be correlated with star formation efficiency.\nFurther decomposing the CO SLEDs into two excitation components, we find a\nlow-excitation component, which is less correlated with star formation, and a\nhigh-excitation one which is tightly related to the on-going star-forming\nactivity.

Existing work\nsuggests that for many problems, the shape in the current time series may\ncorrelate an upcoming shape in the same or another series. Therefore, it is a\npromising strategy to associate two recurring patterns as a rule's antecedent\nand consequent: the occurrence of the antecedent can foretell the occurrence of\nthe consequent, and the learned shape of consequent will give accurate\npredictions. Earlier work employs symbolization methods, but the symbolized\nrepresentation maintains too little information of the original series to mine\nvalid rules.

The singularity\nis more severe than a shock in that the solution itself blows up like the log\nof the distance to the blowup-time. We assume that the quasilinear terms\nsatisfy certain structural assumptions, which in particular ensure that the\n\"elliptic part\" of the wave operator vanishes precisely at the singular points.\nThe initial data are compactly supported and can be small or large in\n$L^{\\infty}$, but the spatial derivatives must initially satisfy a nonlinear\nsmallness condition compared to the time derivative. The first main idea of the\nproof is to construct a quasilinear integrating factor, which allows us to\nreformulate the wave equation as a system whose solutions remain regular, all\nthe way up to the singularity. This is equivalent to constructing quasilinear\nvectorfields adapted to the nonlinear flow. The second main idea is to exploit\nsome crucial monotonic terms in various estimates, especially the energy\nestimates, that feature the integrating factor. The availability of the\nmonotonicity is tied to our assumptions on the data and on the structure of the\nquasilinear terms. The third main idea is to propagate the relative smallness\nof the spatial derivatives all the way up to the singularity so that the\nsolution behaves, in many ways, like an ODE solution. As a corollary of our\nmain results, we show that there are quasilinear wave equations that exhibit\ntwo distinct kinds of blowup: the formation of shocks for one non-trivial set\nof data, and ODE-type blowup for another non-trivial set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 13:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Under two node-based strategy updating rules, strategy\nupdating occurs between a randomly chosen focal node and its randomly selected\nneighbour. The focal agent becomes the strategy recipient and may imitate the\nstrategy of the neighbour according to the payoff difference, i.e.\nvoter-model-like dynamics (VMLD), or becomes a strategy donor and thus may be\nimitated by the neighbour, i.e. invasion-process-like dynamics (IPLD). For\nedge-based updating rules, one edge is selected, and the roles of the two\nconnected nodes (donor or recipient) are randomly decided, i.e. edge-based\ndynamics (EBD). A computer simulation shows that partner switching supports the\nevolution of cooperation under VMLD, which has been utilised in many studies on\nspatial evolutionary games, whereas cooperators often vanish under IPLD. The\nEBD results lie between these two processes. This difference is prominent among\nnodes with large degrees. In addition, partner switching induces a\nnon-monotonic relationship between the fraction of cooperators and intensity of\nselection under VMLD and EBD, and a weak or strong selection supports\ncooperation. In contrast, only a strong selection supports cooperators under\nIPLD. Similar differences in the enhancement of cooperation are observed when\ngames are played on static heterogeneous networks. Our results imply that the\ndirection of imitation is quite important for understanding the evolutionary\nprocess of cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 13:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 13:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In contrast, during the\nformation of the VD MGs, the absence of the liquid state results in the\ncreation of a different chemical order with more Zr-Zr homonuclear bonds\ncompared with the melt-quenched MGs. In order to obtain MGs from melt-quench\ntechnique with similarly low energies as in the VD process, the cooling rate\nduring quenching would have to be many orders of magnitude lower than currently\naccessible to MD simulations. The method proposed in this manuscript is a more\nefficient way to create MGs by using MD simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 13:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

Our group recently demonstrated that the\nground-state phase difference across such a junction with carefully chosen\nlayer thicknesses could be controllably toggled between zero and $\\pi$ by\nswitching the relative magnetization directions of the two layers between the\nantiparallel and parallel configurations. However, several technological issues\nmust be addressed before those junctions can be used in a large-scale memory.\nMany of these issues can be more easily studied in single junctions, rather\nthan in the Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) used for the\nphase-sensitive measurements. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of\nspin-valve junctions containing a Ni layer with a fixed thickness of 2.0 nm,\nand a NiFe layer of thickness varying between 1.1 and 1.8 nm in steps of 0.1\nnm. We extract the field shift of the Fraunhofer patterns and the critical\ncurrents of the junctions in the parallel and antiparallel magnetic states, as\nwell as the switching fields of both magnetic layers. We also report a partial\nstudy of similar junctions containing a slightly thinner Ni layer of 1.6 nm and\nthe same range of NiFe thicknesses. These results represent the first step\ntoward mapping out a ``phase diagram\" for phase-controllable spin-valve\nJosephson junctions as a function of the two magnetic layer thicknesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 14:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 16:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Hence, contracts with pre- and postconditions can be used to\nexpress more complex constraints on operations. Contracts can be checked at run\ntime to ensure that operations are only invoked with reasonable arguments and\nreturn intended results. Although such dynamic contract checking provides more\nreliable program execution, it requires execution time and could lead to\nprogram crashes that might be detected with more advanced methods at compile\ntime. To improve this situation for declarative languages, we present an\napproach to combine static and dynamic contract checking for the functional\nlogic language Curry. Based on a formal model of contract checking for\nfunctional logic programming, we propose an automatic method to verify\ncontracts at compile time. If a contract is successfully verified, dynamic\nchecking of it can be omitted. This method decreases execution time without\ndegrading reliable program execution. In the best case, when all contracts are\nstatically verified, it provides trust in the software since crashes due to\ncontract violations cannot occur during program execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 14:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

In\ncontrast to spatially homogeneous FLRW models, the reduced degree of spatial\nsymmetry causes a non-trivial dynamical coupling of gauge-invariant quantities\nalready at first order perturbation theory and the strength and influence of\nthis coupling on the spacetime evolution is investigated here. We present\nresults on the underlying dynamical equations augmented by a cosmological\nconstant and integrate them numerically. We also present a method to derive\ncosmologically relevant initial variables for this setup. Estimates of angular\npower spectra for each metric variable are computed and evaluated on the\ncentral observer's past null cone. By comparing the full evolution to the\nfreely evolved initial profiles, the coupling strength will be determined for a\nbest fit radially inhomogeneous patch obtained in previous works (see Redlich\net. al. (2014)). We find that coupling effects are not noticeable within the\ncosmic variance limit and can therefore safely be neglected for a relevant\ncosmological scenario. On the contrary, we find very strong coupling effects in\na best fit spherical void model matching the distance redshift relation of SNe\nwhich is in accordance with previous findings using parametric void models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

We depart\nfrom the nominal LSPE-SWIPE modulation strategy (HWP stepped every 60 s with a\ntelescope scanning at around 12 deg/s) and perform a thorough investigation of\na wide range of possible HWP schemes (either in stepped or continuously\nspinning mode and at different azimuth telescope scan-speeds) in the frequency,\nmap and angular power spectrum domain.

We finally test the modulation\nperformance against typical HWP-induced systematics.

Considering this fact we propose APOA, a recommendation\nsystem which can be implemented in any marketplace for helping users and\ndevelopers to compare apps in terms of performance.\n  APOA uses as input metric values of apps and a set of metrics to optimize. It\nsolves an optimization problem and it generates optimal sets of apps for\ndifferent user's context. We show how APOA works over an Android case study.\nOut of 140 apps, we define typical usage scenarios and we collect measurements\nof power, CPU, memory, and network usages to demonstrate the benefit of using\nAPOA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 01:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 16:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

This helps control vehicle to alleviate traffic\ncongestion and road accidents. However, Doppler shift existing between vehicles\nwith high relative speed causes an apparent frequency shift for the received\nwireless wave, which consequently decreases the reliability of the recovered\nsafety information and jeopardizes the safety of vehicular CPS. Passive\nconfrontation of Doppler shift at the receiver side is not applicable due to\nmultiple Doppler shifts at each receiver. In this paper, we provide a proactive\nDoppler shift compensation algorithm based on the probabilistic graphical\nmodel. Each vehicle pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that\nthere is no frequency shift from the desired carrier frequency between each\npair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each vehicle is computed in\na distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed and dynamic\ntopology of vehicular CPS. Besides, the updating procedure is designed in a\nbroadcasting fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved\nthat the proposed algorithm is convergence guaranteed even for systems with\npacket drops and random communication delays. Simulations based on real map and\ntransportation data verify the accuracy and convergence property of the\nproposed algorithm. It is shown that this method achieves almost the optimal\nfrequency compensation accuracy with an error approaching the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao\nlower bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Such distortions can occur at fluctuating phase boundaries as\nwell as multiple-phase flows and result from the accompanied refractive index\nchanges. Due to multiple reflexes arising from a fluid flow setup, the usage of\na wave front sensor (WFS) can be hindered. In this work we outline a wave front\nsensor-less approach which includes iterative aberration correction with a fast\ndeformable mirror (DM). A combination of sharpness metric (SM) image evaluation\nand iterative optimization is demonstrated. The SM was measured for each image\nwhile adjusting seven Zernike modes (after Noll index enumeration) in their\namplitude. The SM is used as an indicator for wave front aberrations without\nusing a wave front sensor to correct wave front distortions that are generated\nby the DM. The proposed method allows for the reduction of systematic\nmeasurement uncertainties in fluid flow measurement techniques as particle\nimage velocimetry (PIV). Five different sharpness metrics are demonstrated for\nreliable sharpness maximization with a deformable mirror of 69 elements. A\nsystematic linear search (LS) algorithm was applied in order to find the\noptimal mirror shape. The reduction of measurement uncertainty for PIV\nmeasurements is shown. The iterative approach offers a way to reduce static or\nslowly changing wave front distortions in a fluid flow setup where a WFS is not\napplicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 08:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}
