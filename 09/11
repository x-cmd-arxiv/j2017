In this\nwork, we demonstrate multiheterodyne spectroscopy using interband cascade\nlasers, which combines broadband spectral coverage with high spectral\nresolution and energy-efficient operation. The lasers generate up to 30 mW of\ncontinuous wave optical power while consuming less than 0.5 W of electrical\npower. A computational phase and timing correction algorithm is used to obtain\nkHz linewidths of the multiheterodyne beat notes and up to 30 dB improvement in\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The versatility of the multiheterodyne technique is\ndemonstrated by performing both rapidly swept absorption and dispersion\nspectroscopic assessments of low-pressure ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) acquired by\nextracting a single beat note from the multiheterodyne signal, as well as\nbroadband multiheterodyne spectroscopy of methane (CH$_4$) acquired with all\navailable beat notes with microsecond temporal resolution and an instantaneous\noptical bandwidth of 240 GHz.

To achieve that, several sensors\nlike radars, LiDARs and cameras are installed in autonomous vehicles. The\nproduced sensor data is fused to a general representation of the surrounding.\nIn this thesis the dynamic occupancy grid map approach of Nuss et al. is used\nwhile three goals are achieved. First, the approach of Nuss et al. to\ndistinguish between moving and non-moving obstacles is improved by using Fully\nConvolutional Neural Networks to create a class prediction for each grid cell.\nFor this purpose, the network is initialized with public pre-trained network\nmodels and the training is executed with a semi-automatic generated dataset.\nThe second goal is to provide orientation information for each detected moving\nobstacle. This could improve tracking algorithms, which are based on the\ndynamic occupancy grid map. The orientation extraction based on the\nConvolutional Neural Network shows a better performance in comparison to an\norientation extraction directly over the velocity information of the dynamic\noccupancy grid map. A general problem of developing machine learning approaches\nlike Neural Networks is the number of labeled data, which can always be\nincreased. For this reason, the last goal is to evaluate a semi-supervised\nlearning algorithm, to generate automatically more labeled data. The result of\nthis evaluation shows that the automated labeled data does not improve the\nperformance of the Convolutional Neural Network.

Nuclear theory has\nstruggled to calculate this reaction rate because the cross section is produced\nthrough different underlying nuclear mechanisms. Isospin selection rules\nsuppress the E1 component of the ground state cross section, creating a unique\nsituation where the E1 and E2 contributions are of nearly equal amplitudes.\nExperimentally there have also been great challenges.

Traditional approaches such as VAR (vector\nauto-regressive) models and more recent approaches such as RNNs (recurrent\nneural networks) are indispensable tools in modeling time-series data. In many\nmultivariate time series modeling problems, there is usually a significant\nlinear dependency component, for which VARs are suitable, and a nonlinear\ncomponent, for which RNNs are suitable. Modeling such times series with only\nVAR or only RNNs can lead to poor predictive performance or complex models with\nlarge training times. In this work, we propose a hybrid model called R2N2\n(Residual RNN), which first models the time series with a simple linear model\n(like VAR) and then models its residual errors using RNNs. R2N2s can be trained\nusing existing algorithms for VARs and RNNs. Through an extensive empirical\nevaluation on two real world datasets (aviation and climate domains), we show\nthat R2N2 is competitive, usually better than VAR or RNN, used alone. We also\nshow that R2N2 is faster to train as compared to an RNN, while requiring less\nnumber of hidden units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 19:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

This leads to unnecessary pilot overhead in good channel\nconditions and performance degradation in the worst channel conditions. We\npropose adaptation of pilot spacing and power using a codebook-based approach,\nwhere the transmitter and receiver exchange information about the fading\ncharacteristics of the channel over a short period of time, which are stored as\nentries in a channel profile codebook.

We examined a sample of 655 cluster members, including\nboth disk-bearing and disk-free young stars. We find a significant age spread\nof 4-5 Myr among cluster members. Disk-bearing objects are statistically\nassociated with younger isochronal ages than disk-free sources. The cluster has\na hierarchical structure, with two main blocks. The northern half develops\naround the O-type binary star S Mon; the southern half, close to the tip of the\nCone Nebula, contains the most embedded regions of NGC 2264, populated mainly\nby objects with disks and ongoing accretion. The median ages of objects at\ndifferent locations within the cluster, and the spatial distribution of disked\nand non-disked sources, suggest that star formation began in the north of the\ncluster, over 5 Myr ago, and was ignited in its southern region a few Myr\nlater. Star formation is likely still ongoing in the most embedded regions of\nthe cluster, while the outer regions host a widespread population of more\nevolved objects. We find a detectable lag between the typical age of\ndisk-bearing objects and that of accreting objects in the inner regions of NGC\n2264: the first tend to be older than the second, but younger than disk-free\nsources at similar locations within the cluster. This supports earlier findings\nthat the characteristic timescales of disk accretion are shorter than those of\ndisk dispersal, and smaller than the average age of NGC 2264 (i.e., < 3 Myr).\nAt the same time, disks in the north of the cluster tend to be shorter-lived\n(~2.5 Myr) than elsewhere; this may reflect the impact of massive stars within\nthe region (notably S Mon), that trigger rapid disk dispersal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 21:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Graphon estimation arises in many\napplications such as predicting missing links in networks and learning user\npreferences in recommender systems. The graphon model deals with a random graph\nof $n$ vertices such that each pair of two vertices $i$ and $j$ are connected\nindependently with probability $\\rho \\times f(x_i,x_j)$, where $x_i$ is the\nunknown $d$-dimensional label of vertex $i$, $f$ is an unknown symmetric\nfunction, and $\\rho$ is a scaling parameter characterizing the graph sparsity.\nRecent studies have identified the minimax error rate of estimating the graphon\nfrom a single realization of the random graph. However, there exists a wide gap\nbetween the known error rates of computationally efficient estimation\nprocedures and the minimax optimal error rate.\n  Here we analyze a spectral method, namely universal singular value\nthresholding (USVT) algorithm, in the relatively sparse regime with the average\nvertex degree $n\\rho=\\Omega(\\log n)$. When $f$ belongs to H\\\"{o}lder or Sobolev\nspace with smoothness index $\\alpha$, we show the error rate of USVT is at most\n$(n\\rho)^{ -2 \\alpha / (2\\alpha+d)}$, approaching the minimax optimal error\nrate $\\log (n\\rho)/(n\\rho)$ for $d=1$ as $\\alpha$ increases. Furthermore, when\n$f$ is analytic, we show the error rate of USVT is at most $\\log^d\n(n\\rho)/(n\\rho)$. In the special case of stochastic block model with $k$\nblocks, the error rate of USVT is at most $k/(n\\rho)$, which is larger than the\nminimax optimal error rate by at most a multiplicative factor $k/\\log k$. This\ncoincides with the computational gap observed for community detection. A key\nstep of our analysis is to derive the eigenvalue decaying rate of the edge\nprobability matrix using piecewise polynomial approximations of the graphon\nfunction $f$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 21:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

The\nmodel is a kinetic analog of the Kraichnan-Batchelor model of chaotic\nadvection. The solution of the model is found in Fourier-Hermite space and\nshows that the free-energy flux from low to high Hermite moments is suppressed,\nwith phase mixing cancelled on average by anti-phase-mixing (stochastic plasma\necho). This implies that Landau damping is an ineffective route to dissipation\n(i.e., to thermalisation of electric energy via velocity space). The full\nFourier-Hermite spectrum is derived.

In particular, is it true that the seller can always\nextract more revenue from a market where the buyers value the items higher than\nanother market? In this paper we obtain such a revenue monotonicity result in a\ngeneral setting. Precisely, consider the revenue-maximizing combinatorial\nauction for $m$ items and $n$ buyers in the Bayesian setting, specified by a\nvaluation function $v$ and a set $F$ of $nm$ independent item-type\ndistributions. Let $REV(v, F)$ denote the maximum revenue achievable under $F$\nby any incentive compatible mechanism. Intuitively, one would expect that\n$REV(v, G)\\geq REV(v, F)$ if distribution $G$ stochastically dominates $F$.\nSurprisingly, Hart and Reny (2012) showed that this is not always true even for\nthe simple case when $v$ is additive.

An interesting New\nPhysics scenario which can be linked to a large Higgs self coupling is the\nbaryogenesis based on the strong first order phase transition. We revisit the\nstrong first order phase transition in two classes of Beyond the Standard\nModels, namely the Higgs portal with the singlet scalar under the Standard\nModel gauge group with Z2 symmetry and the effective field theory approach with\nhigher-dimensional operators. We numerically investigate a few important issues\nin the validity of the effective potential, caused by the breakdown of the\nhigh-temperature approximation, and in the criteria for the strong first order\nphase transition. We illustrate that these issues can lead to O(1)\nuncertainties in the precision of the Higgs self couplings, which are relevant\nwhen discussing sensitivity limits of different future colliders. We also find\nthat the quartic coupling of the above two classes of scenarios compatible with\nthe strong first order electroweak phase transition where the cubic coupling is\nnot negligible, can achieve a $2\\sigma$ sensitivity at the 100 TeV pp-collider.\nFrom this novel observation, we show that the correlation between the Higgs\ncubic coupling and the quartic coupling will be useful for differentiating\nvarious underlying New Physics scenarios and discuss its prospect for the\nfuture colliders.

It enjoys a good property of automatically deciding the size of\nthe hidden layer according to specific training data. With sufficient training,\nthe iRBM can achieve a competitive performance with that of the classic RBM.\nHowever, the convergence of learning the iRBM is slow, due to the fact that the\niRBM is sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units, the learned filters\nchange slowly from the left-most hidden unit to right. To break this dependency\nbetween neighboring hidden units and speed up the convergence of training, a\nnovel training strategy is proposed. The key idea of the proposed training\nstrategy is randomly regrouping the hidden units before each gradient descent\nstep. Potentially, a mixing of infinite many iRBMs with different permutations\nof the hidden units can be achieved by this learning method, which has a\nsimilar effect of preventing the model from over-fitting as the dropout. The\noriginal iRBM is also modified to be capable of carrying out discriminative\ntraining. To evaluate the impact of our method on convergence speed of learning\nand the model's generalization ability, several experiments have been performed\non the binarized MNIST and CalTech101 Silhouettes datasets.

The proposed\nmethod in this paper takes advantage of the availability of buck regulators in\nthe battery management system (BMS) to compute the optimal voltage adjustment\nof the individual modules to minimize the effect of stray currents between the\nparallel connected battery modules. Our proposed method recursively computes\nthe optimal current scheduling that balances (equals) each module current and\nmaximize total bus current without violating any of the battery modules\noperating constraints. Recursive implementation guarantees robust operation as\nthe battery modules operating parameters change as the battery pack\n(dis)charges or ages. In order to demonstrate the capability of this method in\nreal battery system, an experimental setup of 3 parallel placed battery modules\nis built. The experimental results validate the feasibility and show the\nadvantages of this current scheduling method in a real battery application,\ndespite the fact that each module may have different impedance, open circuit\nvoltage and charge parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 05:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

This transient charge dynamic mismatch is driven by the negative\ncurvature of the FE free energy landscape. It is also analytically shown that a\nfree energy profile with the negative curvature is the only physical system\nthat can describe transient NC during the two-state switching in a FE\ncapacitor. Furthermore, this transient charge dynamic mismatch is justified by\nthe dependence of external resistance and intrinsic FE viscosity coefficient.\nThe depolarization effect on FE capacitors also shows the importance of\nnegative curvature to transient NC.

Several different power\nconsumptions, including signal transmit power, on-board circuit power and the\npower for UAVs mobility, and the ground user density are taken into account.\nInstead of conventional empirical stochastic models, this paper utilizes a\npattern formation system to track the instable and non-ergodic time-varying\nnature of user density. We show that for a single time-slot, the optimal\nplacement is achieved when the transmit power of UAV-BSs equals their on-board\ncircuit power.

Instead, we use the {\\it\nsimilarity} between two systems, and theoretically make up for the difference\nbetween them. That is, (1) we first show that the strong-coupling theory\ndeveloped by Nozi\\`eres-Schmitt Rink (NSR) can quantitatively explain the\nrecent EoS experiment on a $^6$Li superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS\n(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-unitary limit far below the superfluid phase\ntransition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$. This region is considered to be very\nsimilar to the low density region (crust regime) of a neutron star (where a\nnearly unitary $s$-wave neutron superfluid is expected). (2) We then\ntheoretically compensate the difference that, while the effective range $r_{\\rm\neff}$ is negligibly small in a superfluid $^6$Li Fermi gas, it cannot be\nignored ($r_{\\rm eff}=2.7$ fm) in a neutron star, by extending the NSR theory\nto include effects of $r_{\\rm eff}$. The calculated EoS when $r_{\\rm eff}=2.7$\nfm is shown to agree well with the previous neutron-star EoS in the low density\nregion predicted in nuclear physics. Our idea indicates that an ultracold\natomic gas may more flexibly be used as a quantum simulator for the study of\nother complicated quantum many-body systems, when we use, not only the\nexperimental high tunability, but also the recent theoretical development in\nthis field.

Measured HI surface density\nradial profiles together with optical and rotation curve data from the\nliterature are used to derive a best-fit relation given by\n$j_\\mathrm{b}=qM_\\mathrm{b}^{\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha=0.62\\pm 0.02$ and\n$\\log_{10}q=-3.35\\pm 0.25$. This result is consistent with the\n$j_\\mathrm{b}\\propto M_\\mathrm{b}^{2/3}$ relation that is theoretically\nexpected and also measured by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014) for their full\nsample of THINGS spiral galaxies, yet differs to their steeper relation found\nfor subsets with fixed bulge fraction. The 30 arcsec spatial resolution of the\nHI imaging used in this study is significantly lower than that of the THINGS\nimaging used by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014), yet the results presented in\nthis work are clearly shown to contain no significant systematic errors due to\nthe low-resolution imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 08:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Firstly, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a\nconvex optimization. From the KKT conditions, the optimal analytical expression\nis derived given the fixed source power and RS power. Subsequently, an optimal\npower allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed and presented to further alleviate\nthe effect of Sum-MSE under the total transmit power sum constraint of source\nnode and RS. Simulation results show that the proposed OPA performs better than\nequal power allocation (EPA) in terms of Sum-MSE, and the Sum-MSE performance\ngain grows with deviating $\\rho$ from the value of $\\rho^o$ minimizing the\nSum-MSE, where $\\rho$ is defined as the average ratio of the residual SI\nchannel at RS to the intended channel from source to RS.

The seller of a futures contract commits to deliver, say,\npower, over a certain period, while the classical forward is a financial\nagreement settled on a maturity date. Our purpose is to design a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity\nmarket consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main\nassumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a\nuniversal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the\nmodels which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a\ndensity between a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of\ntraded assets like forward contracts are true $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the\nreal world probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are\nmean-reverting. The Girsanov kernel for such a transformation turns out to be\nstochastic and unbounded in the diffusion part, while in the jump part the\nGirsanov kernel must be deterministic and bounded: thus, in this respect, we\nprove two results on the martingale property of stochastic exponentials. The\nfirst allows to validate measure changes made of two components: an\nEsscher-type density and a Girsanov transform with stochastic and unbounded\nkernel. The second uses a different approach and works for the case of\ncontinuous density. We apply this framework to two models: a generalized\nLucia-Schwartz model and a cross-commodity cointegrated market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 09:47:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 09:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 12:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

For tractability in the analysis, the\northogonal pilots are drawn from Haar distributed random unitary matrices. The\nresulting expression is simple and easy to compute. As shown by the numerical\nsimulations, the asymptotic SINR approximates the finite-size systems\naccurately.

Beyond the well-known\nmodularity measures defining communities, there are criteria based on the\nexistence of similar or identical connection patterns of a node or sets of\nnodes to the remainder of the network. A key notion in this context is that of\nstructurally equivalent or twin nodes, displaying exactly the same connection\npattern to the remainder of the network.\n  The first goal of this paper is to extend this idea to subgraphs of arbitrary\norder of a given network, by means of the notions of T-twin and F-twin\nsubgraphs. This is motivated by the need to provide a systematic approach to\nthe analysis of core-semiperiphery-periphery (CSP) structures, a notion which\nsomehow lacks a formal treatment in the literature. The goal is to provide an\nanalytical framework accommodating and extending the idea that the unique\n(ideal) core-periphery (CP) structure is a 2-partitioned K2. We provide a\nformal definition of CSP structures in terms of core eccentricities and\nperiphery degrees, with semiperiphery vertices acting as intermediaries. The\nT-twin and F-twin notions then make it possible to reduce the large number of\nresulting structures by identifying isomorphic substructures which share the\nconnection pattern to the remainder of the graph, paving the way for the\ndecomposition and enumeration of CSP structures. We compute the resulting CSP\nstructures up to order six.\n  We illustrate the scope of our results by analyzing a subnetwork of the\nnetwork of 1994 metal manufactures trade.

In this paper we construct a new\nforward, analytical, model to estimate the magnetic field caused by a\nhorizontally stratified earth but which approximates the interaction between\neddy currents. This makes it valid for a broader range of parameters than the\ncurrent state of the art. Furthermore, the error with the (numerically\nobtainable) exact result is substantially decreased. We also calculate the\nvertical sensitivity (\"depth of exploration\") of the model and observe that it\nis in good agreement with the values obtained from the exact model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 11:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 08:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

We simulated pollinator extinctions in\npollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed\nstochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological\nmodel (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in\ninteraction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on\npollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us\ndetermining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and\nidentifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger\nsecondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal\nsequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival\nwas more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction\nstrength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most\nsensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We\npredict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is\ncrucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss. Finally, we showed\nthat honeybees and several beetles were keystone species in our communities.\nThis information is of great value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses\nfacing current global change and to identify target species for effective\nconservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 14:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

The\nabundance of galaxy clusters -- measured through a variety of channels -- has\nbeen extensively used to constrain the normalization of the power spectrum: it\nis an important probe as it allows us to test if the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel can indeed accurately describe the evolution of structures across\nbillions of years. It is then quite significant that the Planck satellite has\ndetected, via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, less clusters than expected\naccording to the primary CMB anisotropies. One of the simplest generalizations\nthat could reconcile these observations is to consider models in which dark\nenergy is allowed to cluster, i.e., allowing its sound speed to vary. In this\ncase, however, the standard methods to compute the abundance of galaxy clusters\nneed to be adapted to account for the contributions of dark energy. In\nparticular, we examine the case of clustering dark energy -- a dark energy\nfluid with negligible sound speed -- with a redshift-dependent equation of\nstate. We carefully study how the halo mass function is modified in this\nscenario, highlighting corrections that have not been considered before in the\nliterature. We address modifications in the growth function, collapse\nthreshold, virialization densities and also changes in the comoving scale of\ncollapse and mass function normalization.

To encode prior\ninformation about the input or the linear system, we use Gaussian-process\nmodels. We estimate the model from data using the empirical Bayes approach: the\ninput and the impulse responses of the linear system are estimated using the\nposterior means of the Gaussian-process models given the data, and the\nhyperparameters that characterize the Gaussian-process models are estimated\nfrom the marginal likelihood of the data. We propose an iterative algorithm to\nfind the hyperparameters that relies on the EM method and results in simple\nupdate steps.

In this paper, we introduce constant-weight array codes (CWACs), which\noffer a tradeoff between the rate gain of general constant-weight codes and the\nlow decoding complexity of liftings. CWACs can either be used in the on-shot\nsetting introduced earlier or in a multi-shot approach, where one codeword\nconsists of several messages. The multi-shot approach generalizes the one-shot\napproach and hence allows for higher rate gains. We first give a construction\nof CWACs based on concatenation, which generalizes the traditional erasure\ncodes, and also provide a decoding algorithm for these codes. Since CWACs can\nbe viewed as a generalization of both binary constant-weight codes and\nnonrestricted Hamming metric codes, CWACs thus provide an additional degree of\nfreedom to both problems of determining the maximum cardinality of\nconstant-weight codes and nonrestricted Hamming metric codes.

In this paper we characterize the existence of a certificate of\nnon-negativity for polynomials over a possibly unbounded domain, without the\nuse of the associated quadratic module. Next, we show that the certificate can\nbe used to convergent linear matrix inequality (LMI) hierarchies for PO\nproblems with unbounded feasible sets. Furthermore, by using copositive\npolynomials to certify non-negativity, instead of sos polynomials, the\ncertificate allows the use of a very rich class of convergent LMI hierarchies\nto approximate the solution of general PO problems.

As the large-scale structure is the target\nof current and future observational campaigns, one would ideally like to have\nthe full probability density function of these non-Gaussian fields. The only\nviable way we see to achieve this analytically, at least approximately and in\nthe near future, is via the Edgeworth expansion. We hence rederive this\nexpansion for Fourier modes of non-Gaussian fields and then continue by putting\nit into a wider statistical context than previously done. We show that in its\noriginal form, the Edgeworth expansion only works if the non-Gaussian signal is\naveraged away. This is counterproductive, since we target the\nparameter-dependent non-Gaussianities as a signal of interest. We hence alter\nthe analysis at the decisive step and now provide a roadmap towards a\ncontrolled and unadulterated analysis of non-Gaussianities in structure\nformation (with the Edgeworth expansion).

We derive results concerning the\nexistence of optimal controls and the first-order necessary optimality\nconditions in terms of a variational inequality and the associated adjoint\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 08:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}
