The use of\nhighly-confined plasmons in materials such as graphene provides a promising\nplatform to enhance transition rates in the IR-THz by many orders of magnitude.\nHowever, such enhancements involve near-field plasmon modes or other kinds of\nnear-field coupling like quenching, and it is challenging to use these highly\nconfined modes to harness light in the far-field due to the difficulty of\nplasmonic outcoupling. Here, we propose that through the use of radiative\ncascade chains in multi-level emitters, IR plasmons can be used to enhance far\nfield spectra in the visible and UV range, even at energies greater than 10 eV.\nCombining Purcell-enhancement engineering, graphene plasmonics, and radiative\ncascade can result in a new type of UV emitter whose properties can be tuned by\nelectrically doping graphene. Varying the distance between the emitter and the\ngraphene surface can change the strength of the far-field emission lines by two\norders of magnitude. We also find that the dependence of the far-field emission\non the Fermi energy is potentially extremely sharp at the onset of interband\ntransitions, allowing the Fermi energy to effectively serve as a \"switch\" for\nturning on and off certain plasmonic and far-field emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 16:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

In the LWT-LWSC transition, the\nmodulational instability and resulting creation of plasmon pairs are the\nclassical counterparts of the Cooper instability and creation of Cooper pairs\nin superconducting states. The Bose-Einstein condensation of Cooper pairs in\nsuperconducting states is replaced by the Kuramoto oscillator-entrainment of\nplasmon pairs in a LWSC. The order parameter of the LWSC state, which is\ndefined as the mean field of the plasmon pairs, takes on a significant value,\nwhich clearly indicates that a macroscopic number of plasmon pairs occupy a\nsingle momentum state with an identical phase in the LWSC. The emergence of\nspatiotemporal coherence and the decrease in the phase randomization are\nconsidered as development of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, respectively, indicating that the LWT-LWSC transition is a second\norder phase transition phenomenon.

In\nthis work, we present a technique that addresses such conditioning problems by\nconstructing enhanced finite element spaces based on a cell aggregation\ntechnique. The presented method, called aggregated unfitted finite element\nmethod, is easy to implement, and can be used, in contrast to previous works,\nin Galerkin approximations of coercive problems with conforming Lagrangian\nfinite element spaces.

This task is normally carried out by human\ncoaches, and it needs to be solved automatically in technical applications that\nare to provide automatic coaching (e.g. training environments in VR). However,\nmost coaching systems only provide coarse information on movement quality, such\nas a scalar value per body part that describes the overall deviation from the\ncorrect movement. Further, they are often limited to static body postures or\nrather simple movements of single body parts. While there are many approaches\nto distinguish between different types of movements (e.g., between walking and\njumping), the detection of more subtle errors in a motor performance is less\ninvestigated. We propose a novel approach to classify errors in sports or\nrehabilitation exercises such that feedback can be delivered in a rapid and\ndetailed manner: Homogeneous sub-sequences of exercises are first temporally\naligned via Dynamic Time Warping. Next, we extract a feature vector from the\naligned sequences, which serves as a basis for feature selection using Random\nForests. The selected features are used as input for Support Vector Machines,\nwhich finally classify the movement errors.

We give\na technique for constructing ascending HNN extensions with unbounded depth.\nThis work focuses attention on a class of groups that may contain a group with\nnon-semistable fundamental group at $\\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 17:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The outflow boundary conditions are implemented using an\noutflow zone downstream of the outlet, where particles are moved using an\noutgoing wave equation for the velocity field so that feedback noise from the\noutlet boundary is greatly reduced. For unidirectional flow across the outlet,\nthis condition reduces to Orlanski's wave equation. The performance of the\nmethod is demonstrated through several two-dimensional test problems, including\nunsteady, plane Poiseuille flow, flow between two inclined plates, the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability in a channel, and flow in a constricted conduit,\nand in three-dimensions for turbulent flow in a $90^{\\circ}$ section of a\ncurved square pipe. The results show that spurious waves incident from the\noutlet are effectively absorbed and that steady-state laminar flows can be\nmaintained for much longer times compared to periodic boundary conditions. In\naddition, time-dependent anisotropies in the flow, like fluid recirculations,\nare convected across the outlet in a very stable and accurate manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 17:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

This lag is caused by a\ncombination of the travel time of the flaring plasma to the optically thin\nradio emitting sections of the jet and the slow rise time of the radio flare.\nWe predict two types of flares: symmetric flares - with the same rise and decay\ntime, which occur for flares whose duration is shorter than both the radiative\nlifetime and the geometric path-length delay timescale; extended flares - whose\nluminosity tracks the power of particle acceleration in the flare, which occur\nfor flares with a duration longer than both the radiative lifetime and\ngeometric delay.

A\nremarkable feature of this new class of models is that they lead to large\nenough negative values of the equation of state at the present epoch,\nconsistent with the observations of accelerated expansion of the universe, from\na very large initial basin of attraction.

At\nfirst glance, deterministic particle methods are incompatible with diffusive\npartial differential equations since initial data given by sums of Dirac masses\nwould be smoothed instantaneously: particles do not remain particles. Inspired\nby classical vortex blob methods, we introduce a nonlocal regularization of our\nvelocity field that ensures particles do remain particles, and we apply this to\ndevelop a numerical blob method for a range of diffusive partial differential\nequations of Wasserstein gradient flow type, including the heat equation, the\nporous medium equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, the Keller-Segel equation,\nand its variants. Our choice of regularization is guided by the Wasserstein\ngradient flow structure, and the corresponding energy has a novel form,\ncombining aspects of the well-known interaction and potential energies. In the\npresence of a confining drift or interaction potential, we prove that\nminimizers of the regularized energy exist and, as the regularization is\nremoved, converge to the minimizers of the unregularized energy. We then\nrestrict our attention to nonlinear diffusion of porous medium type with at\nleast quadratic exponent. Under sufficient regularity assumptions, we prove\nthat gradient flows of the regularized energies converge to solutions of the\nporous medium equation. As a corollary, we obtain convergence of our numerical\nblob method, again under sufficient regularity assumptions. We conclude by\nconsidering a range of numerical examples to demonstrate our method's rate of\nconvergence to exact solutions and to illustrate key qualitative properties\npreserved by the method, including asymptotic behavior of the Fokker-Planck\nequation and critical mass of the two-dimensional Keller-Segel equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 18:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 03:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 23:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 23:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

In particular, the\nelectron-phonon interaction drives phonon-assisted optical absorption across\nthe minimum indirect gap and therefore determines the absorption onset, and it\nalso leads to the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum.

An embedding $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$ of a\ngraph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$ to distinct points\nand the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the\ncorresponding vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and\nvisualization, nearby vertices and edges are often bundled to the same point or\noverlapping arcs, due to data compression or low resolution. This raises the\ncomputational problem of deciding whether a given map $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$\ncomes from an embedding. A map $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$ is a \\textbf{weak\nembedding} if it can be perturbed into an embedding\n$\\psi_\\varepsilon:G\\rightarrow M$ with\n$\\|\\varphi-\\psi_\\varepsilon\\|<\\varepsilon$ for every $\\varepsilon>0$, where\n$\\|.\\|$ is the unform norm. A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing weak\nembeddings has recently been found by Fulek and Kyn\\v{c}l. It reduces the\nproblem to solving a system of linear equations over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. It runs in\n$O(n^{2\\omega})\\leq O(n^{4.75})$ time, where $\\omega\\in [2,2.373)$ is the\nmatrix multiplication exponent and $n$ is the number of vertices and edges of\n$G$. We improve the running time to $O(n\\log n)$. Our algorithm is also\nconceptually simpler: We perform a sequence of \\emph{local operations} that\ngradually \"untangles\" the image $\\varphi(G)$ into an embedding $\\psi(G)$, or\nreports that $\\varphi$ is not a weak embedding. It combines local constraints\non the orientation of subgraphs directly, thereby eliminating the need for\nsolving large systems of linear equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 18:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In this work, symbolic dynamics-based tools\nhave been used to infer an approximate generative Markov model. The time-series\ndata are first symbolized by partitioning the continuous measurement space of\nthe signal and then, the discrete sequential data are modeled using symbolic\ndynamics. In the proposed approach, the size of temporal memory of the symbol\nsequence is estimated from spectral properties of the resulting stochastic\nmatrix corresponding to a first-order Markov model of the symbol sequence.\nThen, hierarchical clustering is used to represent the states of the\ncorresponding full-state Markov model to construct a reduced-order or size\nMarkov model with a non-deterministic algebraic structure. Subsequently, the\nparameters of the reduced-order Markov model are identified from the original\nmodel by making use of a Bayesian inference rule. The final model is selected\nusing information-theoretic criteria. The proposed concept is elucidated and\nvalidated on two different data sets as examples. The first example analyzes a\nset of pressure data from a swirl-stabilized combustor, where controlled\nprotocols are used to induce flame instabilities. Variations in the complexity\nof the derived Markov model represent how the system operating condition\nchanges from a stable to an unstable combustion regime. In the second example,\nthe data set is taken from NASA's data repository for prognostics of bearings\non rotating shafts. We show that, even with a very small state-space, the\nreduced-order models are able to achieve comparable performance and that the\nproposed approach provides flexibility in the selection of a final model for\nrepresentation and learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

Sparsity of this filter, or in\ncontrast, non vanishing of its Fourier transform are instances of such\nassumptions. The main result of this paper shows that blind deconvolution can\nbe solved through nuclear norm relaxation in the case of a fully unknown\nchannel, as soon as this channel is probed through a few $N \\gtrsim \\mu^2_m\nK^{1/2}$ input signals $x_n = C_n m_n$, $n=1,\\ldots,N,$ that are living in\nknown $K$-dimensional subspaces $C_n$ of $\\mathbb{R}^L$.

In the differential pricing scheme, Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs) can exempt data access charges for on content from certain CPs\n(zero-rated) while no exemption is on content from other CPs.

This lies in infra-red/optical\nto ultra-violet bands for low and intermediate peaked blazars. The transition\nfrom synchrotron to inverse Compton emission falls in the X-ray bands for such\nsources. We present the spectral and timing analysis of 14 low and intermediate\nenergy peaked blazars ob- served with XMMNewton spanning 31 epochs. Parametric\nfits to X-ray spectra helps constrain the possible location of transition from\nthe high energy end of the syn- chrotron to the low energy end of the inverse\nCompton emission. In seven sources in our sample, we infer such a transition\nand constrain the break energy in the range 0.6 10 keV. The Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram is used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) shape. It is\nwell described by a power law in a majority of light curves, the index being\nflatter compared to general expectation from AGN, ranging here between 0.01 and\n1.12, possibly due to short observation durations resulting in an absence of\nlong term trends.

The timescale for\nvariability being shorter than synchrotron cooling implies steeper PSD slopes\nwhich are inferred in these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 05:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers are routinely used for camera\npose estimation, provided that a good quality set of 2D-3D feature\ncorrespondences are known beforehand. However, finding optimal correspondences\nbetween 2D key-points and a 3D point-set is non-trivial, especially when only\ngeometric (position) information is known. Existing approaches to the\nsimultaneous pose and correspondence problem use local optimisation, and are\ntherefore unlikely to find the optimal solution without a good pose\ninitialisation, or introduce restrictive assumptions. Since a large proportion\nof outliers are common for this problem, we instead propose a globally-optimal\ninlier set cardinality maximisation approach which jointly estimates optimal\ncamera pose and optimal correspondences. Our approach employs branch-and-bound\nto search the 6D space of camera poses, guaranteeing global optimality without\nrequiring a pose prior. The geometry of SE(3) is used to find novel upper and\nlower bounds for the number of inliers and local optimisation is integrated to\naccelerate convergence. The evaluation empirically supports the optimality\nproof and shows that the method performs much more robustly than existing\napproaches, including on a large-scale outdoor data-set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 08:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

So\nfar, seed mass variation was investigated by two classes of studies: one class\nfocuses on species varying in seed mass within communities, while the second\nfocuses on variation between communities, most often with respect to resource\ngradients. Here, we develop a model capable of simultaneously explaining\nvariation in seed mass within and between communities. The model describes\nresource competition (for both soil and light resources) in annual communities\nand incorporates two fundamental aspects: light asymmetry (higher light\nacquisition per unit biomass for larger individuals) and growth allometry\n(negative dependency of relative growth rate on plant biomass). Results show\nthat both factors are critical in determining patterns of seed mass variation.\nIn general, growth allometry increases the reproductive success of small-seeded\nspecies while light asymmetry increases the reproductive success of\nlarge-seeded species. Increasing availability of soil resources increases light\ncompetition, thereby increasing the reproductive success of large-seeded\nspecies and ultimately the community (weighted) mean seed mass. An unexpected\nprediction of the model is that maximum variation in community seed mass (a\nmeasure of functional diversity) occurs under intermediate levels of soil\nresources. Extensions of the model incorporating size-dependent seed survival\nand disturbance also show patterns consistent with empirical observations.\nThese overall results suggest that the mechanisms captured by the model are\nimportant in determining patterns of species and functional diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 08:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 07:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 09:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

In a typical data parallelism approach,\nthe local workers push the latest updates of all the parameters to the\nparameter server and pull all merged parameters back periodically. However,\nwith the increasing size of DNN models and the large number of workers in\npractice, this typical data parallelism cannot achieve satisfactory training\nacceleration, since it usually suffers from the heavy communication cost due to\ntransferring huge amount of information between workers and the parameter\nserver. In-depth understanding on DNN has revealed that it is usually highly\nredundant, that deleting a considerable proportion of the parameters will not\nsignificantly decline the model performance. This redundancy property exposes a\ngreat opportunity to reduce the communication cost by only transferring the\ninformation of those significant parameters during the parallel training.\nHowever, if we only transfer information of temporally significant parameters\nof the latest snapshot, we may miss the parameters that are insignificant now\nbut have potential to become significant as the training process goes on.

Contrary to other planetary\nlayers, the atmosphere is sensitive to both gravitational and thermal forcings,\nthrough a complex dynamical coupling involving the effects of Coriolis\nacceleration and characteristics of the atmospheric structure. These key\nphysics are usually not taken into account in modelings used to compute the\nevolution of planetary systems, where tides are described with parametrised\nprescriptions.

We vary\nlocal interactions by using three different particle shapes: discrete circular\ngrains (monomers), pairs of grains bonded together (dimers), and groups of\nthree bonded in a triangle (trimers). We find that dimers substantially\nstrengthen the pillar and the degree of this effect is determined by\norientational order in the initial condition. In addition, while the three\nparticle shapes form void regions at distinct rates, we find that anisotropies\nin the local amorphous structure remain robust through the definition of a\nmetric that quantifies packing anisotropy. Finally, we highlight connections\nbetween local deformation rates and local structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

The basis of the diversity of wing margin shapes remains unknown,\ndespite the fact that gene networks governing the Drosophila wing development\nhave been well characterised. Among the different types of wing margin shapes,\nsmoothly curved contour is the most frequently found and implies the existence\nof a highly organised, multicellular mechanical structure. Here, we developed a\nmechanical model for diversified insect wing margin shapes, in which\nnon-uniform bending stiffness of the wing margin is considered.

Given a network of stochastic control systems,\nwe give conditions on the simultaneous existence of disturbance bisimilar\nabstractions to every component allowing for compositional abstraction of the\nnetwork system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

A popular strategy for energy saving is duty\ncycling. However, when in energy saving mode, users cannot communicate with\neach other. The side effects of duty cycling are twofold. On the one hand, duty\ncycling may reduce the number of usable contacts for delivering messages,\nincreasing intercontact times and delays. On the other hand, duty cycling may\nbreak long contacts into smaller contacts, thus also reducing the capacity of\nthe opportunistic network. Despite the potential serious effects, the role\nplayed by duty cycling in opportunistic networks has been often neglected in\nthe literature. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we propose a general\nmodel for deriving the pairwise contact and intercontact times measured when a\nduty cycling policy is superimposed on the original encounter process\ndetermined only by node mobility. The model we propose is general, i.e., not\nbound to a specific distribution of contact and intercontact times, and very\naccurate, as we show exploiting two traces of real human mobility for\nvalidation. Using this model, we derive several interesting results about the\nproperties of measured contact and intercontact times with duty cycling: their\ndistribution, how their coefficient of variation changes depending on the duty\ncycle value, how the duty cycling affects the capacity and delay of an\nopportunistic network. The applicability of these results is broad, ranging\nfrom performance models for opportunistic networks that factor in the duty\ncycling effect, to the optimisation of the duty cycle to meet a certain target\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 12:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

The different quantities that can\nand should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as\nwell as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this\ncontext. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital\ncameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and\nwealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain\nfull spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period\nof minutes, with colour information in three bands.

The acquisition of all-sky information is\ndesirable, as zenith-only information does not provide an adequate\ncharacterization of a site. Nevertheless, zenith-only single-band one-channel\ndevices such as the Sky Quality Meter continue to be a viable option for\nlong-term studies of night sky brightness and for studies conducted from a\nmoving platform.

This work addresses this problem\nby introducing ANSAC, a RANSAC-based estimator that accounts for noise by\nadaptively using more than the minimal number of correspondences required to\ngenerate a hypothesis. ANSAC estimates the inlier ratio (the fraction of\ncorrect correspondences) of several ranked subsets of candidate correspondences\nand generates hypotheses from them. Its hypothesis-generation mechanism\nprioritizes the use of subsets with high inlier ratio to generate high-quality\nhypotheses. ANSAC uses an early termination criterion that keeps track of the\ninlier ratio history and terminates when it has not changed significantly for a\nperiod of time.

In the self-interested routing policy each agent selects a path that\noptimizes its own utility, while the system-optimum routing agents are assigned\npaths with the goal of maximizing system performance. This paper considers a\nscenario where a centralized network manager wishes to optimize utilities over\nall agents, i.e., implement a system-optimum routing policy. In many real-life\nscenarios, however, the system manager is unable to influence the route\nassignment of all agents due to limited influence on route choice decisions.\nMotivated by such scenarios, a computationally tractable method is presented\nthat computes the minimal amount of agents that the system manager needs to\ninfluence (compliant agents) in order to achieve system optimal performance.\nMoreover, this methodology can also determine whether a given set of compliant\nagents is sufficient to achieve system optimum and compute the optimal route\nassignment for the compliant agents to do so. Experimental results are\npresented showing that in several large-scale, realistic traffic networks\noptimal flow can be achieved with as low as 13% of the agent being compliant\nand up to 54%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 15:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

By\ncombining the phenomenological analyses with the perturbative calculations, we\nfind the following results: (a) the large decay rates around $10^{-5}$ to\n$10^{-6}$ of the $B \\to a_1 b_1$ decays dominated by the longitudinal\npolarization(except for the $B^+ \\to b_1^+ a_1^0$ mode) are predicted and\nbasically consistent with those in the QCD factorization(QCDF) within errors,\nwhich are expected to be tested by the Large Hadron Collider and Belle-II\nexperiments.

This phenomenon, known as\nvacuum arc, causes catastrophic surface modifications and constitutes a major\nlimiting factor not only for modern electron sources, but also for many\nlarge-scale applications such as particle accelerators, fusion reactors etc.\nAlthough vacuum arcs have been studied thoroughly, the physical mechanisms that\nlead from intense electron emission to plasma ignition are still unclear. In\nthis article, we give insights to the atomic scale processes taking place in\nmetal nanotips under intense field emission conditions. We use multi-scale\natomistic simulations that concurrently include field-induced forces, electron\nemission with finite-size and space-charge effects, Nottingham and Joule\nheating. We find that when a sufficiently high electric field is applied to the\ntip, the emission-generated heat partially melts it and the field-induced force\nelongates and sharpens it. This initiates a positive feedback thermal runaway\nprocess, which eventually causes evaporation of large fractions of the tip. The\nreported mechanism can explain the origin of neutral atoms necessary to\ninitiate plasma, a missing key process required to explain the ignition of a\nvacuum arc. Our simulations provide a quantitative description of in the\nconditions leading to runaway, which shall be valuable for both field emission\napplications and vacuum arc studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 17:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 12:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 08:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Thus, we propose\nand validate an equilibration protocol based on simulated tempering in which\nthe simulation takes a random walk through temperature space, allowing the\nsystem to break out of metastable configurations and hence become decorrelated\nform its initial configuration.
