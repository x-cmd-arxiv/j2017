From a mechanical\nviewpoint, residual stresses are classically modelled through the introduction\nof a virtual incompatible state that collects the local relaxed states around\neach material point. In this work, we instead employ an alternative approach\nbased on a strain energy function that constitutively depends only on the\ndeformation gradient and the residual stress tensor. In particular, our\nobjective is to study the morphological stability of an incompressible sphere,\nmade of a neo-Hookean material and subjected to given distributions of residual\nstresses. Firstly, we perform a linear stability analysis on the pre-stressed\nsolid sphere using the method of incremental deformations. The marginal\nstability conditions are given as a function of a control parameter, being the\ndimensionless variable that represents the characteristic intensity of the\nresidual stresses.

Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of\ntopological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal\nalgebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs.

Then, we focus on\nthe axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the\nfirst complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits.\n  The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a\ncomputationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be\nread as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an\noperational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with\ngeneralisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the\ndefinition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 17:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 07:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

A particularly interesting situation\noccurs when the inner binary in a compact triple system is eclipsing. This is\nbecause the stellar interaction, typically resulting in precession of orbital\nplanes, may be observable as a variation of depth of the eclipses on a long\ntimescale. Aims: We aim to present a novel method to determine compact triples\nusing publicly available photometric data from large surveys. Here we apply it\nto eclipsing binaries (EBs) in Magellanic Clouds from OGLE III database.\nMethods: We analyzed light curves (LCs) of 26121 LMC and 6138 SMC EBs with the\ngoal to identify those for which the orbital inclination varies in time.\nArchival LCs of the selected systems, when complemented by our own observations\nwith Danish 1.54m telescope, were thoroughly analyzed using the PHOEBE program.\nTime dependence of the EB's inclination was described using the theory of\norbital-plane precession. By observing the parameter-dependence of the\nprecession rate, we were able to constrain the third companion mass and its\norbital period around EB. Results: We identified 58 candidates of new compact\ntriples in Magellanic Clouds. This is the largest published sample of such\nsystems so far. Eight of them were analyzed thoroughly and physical parameters\nof inner binary were determined together with an estimation of basic\ncharacteristics of the third star.

However, the majority of routers on the Internet are closed-source.\nHence, there is no straightforward way to analyze them. Specifically, one\ncannot easily identify deviations of a router's routing functionality from the\nrouting protocol's standard. Such deviations (either deliberate or inadvertent)\nare particularly important to identify since they may degrade the security or\nresiliency of the network.\n  A model-based testing procedure is a technique that allows to systematically\ngenerate tests based on a model of the system to be tested; thereby finding\ndeviations in the system compared to the model. However, applying such an\napproach to a complex multi-party routing protocol requires a prohibitively\nhigh number of tests to cover the desired functionality. We propose efficient\nand practical optimizations to the model-based testing procedure that are\ntailored to the analysis of routing protocols. These optimizations allow to\ndevise a formal black-box method to unearth deviations in closed-source routing\nprotocols' implementations. The method relies only on the ability to test the\ntargeted protocol implementation and observe its output.

We search for deviations in the OSPF\nimplementation of Cisco. Our evaluation identified numerous significant\ndeviations that can be abused to compromise the security of a network.

As for applications, data-intensive analytics like MapReduce,\nHadoop, and Dryad fit into this setting, where the set of servers is\nheterogeneous for different task types, so the pair of task type and server\ndetermines the processing rate of the task. The load balancing algorithm used\nin such frameworks is an example of affinity scheduling which is desired to be\nboth robust and delay optimal at high loads when hot-spots occur. Fluid model\nplanning, the MaxWeight algorithm, and the generalized $c\\mu$-rule are among\nthe first algorithms proposed for affinity scheduling that have theoretical\nguarantees on being optimal in different senses, which will be discussed in the\nrelated work section.

We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging\nobservations of decimetric fiber bursts, which occurred during the rise phase\nof a long-duration eruptive flare on 2012 March 3, as obtained by the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array in 1--2 GHz.

Such a drawback of BN motivates us to\nexplore recently proposed weight normalization algorithms (WN algorithms), i.e.\nweight normalization, normalization propagation and weight normalization with\ntranslated ReLU. These algorithms don't slow-down training iterations and were\nexperimentally shown to outperform BN on relatively small networks and\ndatasets. However, it is not clear if these algorithms could replace BN in\npractical, large-scale applications. We answer this question by providing a\ndetailed comparison of BN and WN algorithms using ResNet-50 network trained on\nImageNet. We found that although WN achieves better training accuracy, the\nfinal test accuracy is significantly lower ($\\approx 6\\%$) than that of BN.\nThis result demonstrates the surprising strength of the BN regularization\neffect which we were unable to compensate for using standard regularization\ntechniques like dropout and weight decay.

And indeed,\nessentially all the graph properties ${\\cal P}$ for which removal lemmas with\nreasonable bounds were obtained, are such that every graph satisfying ${\\cal\nP}$ has a small regular partition. So in some sense, a barrier for obtaining an\nefficient removal lemma for property ${\\cal P}$ was having an efficient\nregularity lemma for graphs satisfying ${\\cal P}$.\n  In this paper we consider the property of being induced $C_4$-free, which\nalso suffers from the fact that a graph might satisfy this property but still\nhave only regular partitions of tower-type size.

It is\nfirst shown that Berry's phase (and its generalization) for the Weyl model $H\n=v_{F} \\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot \\vec{p}(t)$ assumes a monopole form at the exact\nadiabatic limit but deviates from it off the adiabatic limit and vanishes in\nthe high frequency limit of the Fourier transform of $\\vec{p}(t)$ for bounded\n$|\\vec{p}(t)|$. An effective action, which is consistent with the non-adiabatic\nlimit of Berry's phase, combined with the Bjorken-Johnson-Low prescription\ngives normal equal-time space-time commutators and no chiral anomaly. In\ncontrast, an effective action with a monopole at the origin of the momentum\nspace, which describes Berry's phase in the precise adiabatic limit but fails\noff the adiabatic limit, gives anomalous space-time commutators and a covariant\nanomaly to the gauge current. We regard this anomaly as an artifact of the\npostulated monopole and not a consequence of Berry's phase. As for the recent\napplication of the chiral anomaly to the description of effective Weyl fermions\nin condensed matter and nuclear physics, which is closely related to the\nformulation of lattice chiral fermions, we point out that the chiral anomaly\nfor each species doubler separately vanishes for a finite lattice spacing,\ncontrary to the common assumption. Instead a general form of pair creation\nassociated with the spectral flow for the Dirac sea with finite depth takes\nplace. This view is supported by the Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, which defines a\nsingle Weyl fermion without doublers on the lattice and gives a well-defined\nindex (anomaly) even for a finite lattice spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 10:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The effect of blurring increases with an\nincrease in window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an\nadaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and\ncalculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are\nconverted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied\nas neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater\nlevel than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as\nsimilar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the\nserial-in-parallel-out shift register. The outputs of shift registers are used\nas input to the selector switches of an averaging circuit making this an\nadaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter.

The\nprevious works suggest that both blue-bands and red-bands photometry works for\nthe SED-fitting. Either blue-domained or red-domained SED-fitting usually lead\nto the unreliable or biased results. Meanwhile, it seems that extending the\nwavelength coverage could be helpful. Since the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ({\\it\nGALEX}) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) provide the FUV/NUV and\nmid-infrared $W1$/$W2$ band data, we extend the SED-fitting to a wider\nwavelength coverage.

Developing\nan estimation algorithm often begins by assuming a statistical model for the\nmeasured data, i.e. a probability density function (pdf) which if correct,\nfully characterizes the behaviour of the collected data/measurements.\nExperience with real data, however, often exposes the limitations of any\nassumed data model since modelling errors at some level are always present.\nConsequently, the true data model and the model assumed to derive the\nestimation algorithm could differ. When this happens, the model is said to be\nmismatched or misspecified. Therefore, understanding the possible performance\nloss or regret that an estimation algorithm could experience under model\nmisspecification is of crucial importance for any SP practitioner. Further,\nunderstanding the limits on the performance of any estimator subject to model\nmisspecification is of practical interest. Motivated by the widespread and\npractical need to assess the performance of a mismatched estimator, the goal of\nthis paper is to help to bring attention to the main theoretical findings on\nestimation theory, and in particular on lower bounds under model\nmisspecification, that have been published in the statistical and econometrical\nliterature in the last fifty years.

In this paper, we propose a serious game design that uses\nsystem-generated security questions with the aim of improving the usability of\nfallback authentication. For this purpose, we adopted the popular picture-based\n\"4 Pics 1 word\" mobile game. This game was selected because of its use of\npictures and cues, which previous psychology research found to be crucial to\naid memorability. This game asks users to pick the word that relates to the\ngiven pictures. We then customized this game by adding features which help\nmaximize the following memory retrieval skills: (a) verbal cues - by providing\nhints with verbal descriptions, (b) spatial cues - by maintaining the same\norder of pictures, (c) graphical cues - by showing 4 images for each challenge,\n(d) interactivity/engaging nature of the game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 08:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the\nentire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text\nstructure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when\nthe length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this\npaper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for\nlong text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own\nhigh-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the\nguidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all\ngeneration steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the\nextracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to\nguide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on\nsynthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that\nLeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the\nperformance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any\nsupervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only\nthrough the interaction between Manager and Worker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 13:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 18:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Like other\nXPCI methods, EI enables the retrieval of absorption, refraction and\nultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) signals. However, current retrieval\nalgorithms require three input frames, which have so far been acquired under as\nmany different illumination conditions, in separate exposures. These\nillumination conditions can be achieved by deliberately misaligning the set-up\nin different ways. Each one of these misaligned configurations can then be used\nto record frames containing a mixture of the absorption, refraction and\nscattering signals. However, this acquisition scheme involves lengthy exposure\ntimes, which can also introduce errors to the retrieved signals. Such errors\nhave, so far, been mitigated by careful image acquisition and analysis.\nHowever, further reduction to image acquisition time and errors due to sample\nmask/sample movement can increase the advantages offered by the EI technique,\nand enable targeting more challenging applications.

Currently, freeform optics and waveguides are used to design near-eye\nvisors, but these structures are complex and their field of view is limited\nwhen the visor is placed near the eye. In this paper, we propose a flat,\nfreeform near-eye visor which uses a sub-wavelength patterned metasurface\nreflector. The visor design imparts a spatial phase profile on a projected\ndisplay pattern and can be implemented using a micron-scale thick metasurface.\nAs the resulting metaform visor relies on diffraction, it can preserve a large\nfield of view (77.3{\\deg} both horizontally and vertically) when placed only\n2.5 cm away from the eye. We simulate the metasurface visor to estimate the\nmodulation transfer function, and find that the projected image quality is\nsufficiently high for human vision. While the design of the metasurface is\ninitially performed via ray optics, using full-wave finite-difference\ntime-domain simulation we validate a scaled version of our visor design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 16:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}
