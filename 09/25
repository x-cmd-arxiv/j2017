This problem naturally arises in the context of distributed\nstorage systems as the node repair problem [7]. The constructions of\nexact-repairable MDS codes with optimal repair-bandwidth require working with\nlarge sub-packetization levels, which restricts their employment in practice.\n  This paper presents constructions for MDS codes that simultaneously provide\nboth small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. In particular,\nthis paper presents two general approaches to construct exact-repairable MDS\ncodes that aim at significantly reducing the required sub-packetization level\nat the cost of slightly sub-optimal repair bandwidth. The first approach gives\nMDS codes that have repair bandwidth at most twice the optimal\nrepair-bandwidth. Additionally, these codes also have the smallest possible\nsub-packetization level $\\ell = O(r)$, where $r$ denotes the number of parity\nblocks. This approach is then generalized to design codes that have their\nrepair bandwidth approaching the optimal repair-bandwidth at the cost of\ngraceful increment in the required sub-packetization level. The second approach\ntransforms an MDS code with optimal repair-bandwidth and large\nsub-packetization level into a longer MDS code with small sub-packetization\nlevel and near-optimal repair bandwidth. For a given $r$, the obtained codes\nhave their sub-packetization level scaling logarithmically with the code\nlength. In addition, the obtained codes require field size only linear in the\ncode length and ensure load balancing among the intact code blocks in terms of\nthe information downloaded from these blocks during the exact reconstruction of\na code block.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 16:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

We describe the generating functions for\neach set of patterns including the fixed-point-free case, $\\sigma(i)\\neq i$ for\nall $i.$ Notating $M\\mathcal{I}_n(\\pi)$ as the generating function for the\nmajor index over the avoidance class of involutions associated to $\\pi$ we\nparticularly present an independent determination that $M\\mathcal{I}_n(321)$ is\nthe $q$-analogue for the central binomial coefficient that first appeared in a\npaper by Barnebei, Bonetti, Elizalde and Silimbani. A shorter proof is\npresented that establishes a connection to core, a central topic in poset\ntheory. We also prove that\n$M\\mathcal{I}_n(132;q)=q^{\\binom{n}{2}}M\\mathcal{I}_n(213;q^{-1})$ and that the\nsame symmetry holds for the larger class of permutations conjecturing that the\nsame equality is true for involutions and permutations given any pair of\npatterns of the form $k(k-1)\\dots 1(k+1)(k+2)\\dots m$ and $12\\dots (k-1)\nm(m-1)\\dots k$, $k\\leq m$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 20:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

However, when outcomes are binary, current\nmethods for estimating multiplicative and additive SNMM parameters suffer from\nvariation dependence between the causal parameters and the non-causal nuisance\nparameters.

The standard rejuvenation mechanism, in which a\nlow- to intermediate-mass companion to a neutron star fills its Roche lobe\nbetween central hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition, is the most\nplausible formation mechanism. We have investigated whether the observed\npopulation can realistically be formed via this mechanism. We used the\nCambridge STARS code to make models of Case B RLOF with Reimers' mass loss from\nthe donor. We find that the range of initial orbital periods required to\nproduce the currently observed range of orbital periods of MSPs is extremely\nnarrow. To reduce this fine tuning, we introduce a companion enhanced wind\n(CEW) that strips the donor of its envelope more quickly so that systems can\ndetach at shorter periods.

Because significant mass is lost\nowing to a CEW we expect some binary pulsars to accrete less than the 0.1Msun\nneeded to spin them up to millisecond periods. This can account for mildly\nrecycled pulsars present along the entire Mc-Porb relation. Systems with Pspin\n> 30ms are consistent with this but too few of these mildly recycled pulsars\nhave yet been observed to make a significant comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 01:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Existing\nmethods generally adopt a two-stage learning framework: The first stage is to\nlocalize the discriminative regions of objects, and the second is to encode the\ndiscriminative features for training classifiers. However, these methods\ngenerally have two limitations: (1) Separation of the two-stage learning is\ntime-consuming.

Existing methods requires full payment\nfrom SU, which blocked many potential \"buyers\", and thus limited the PU's\nexpected income. To better improve PUs' revenue from spectrum trading in a CRN,\nwe introduce a financing contract, which is similar to a sealed non-cash\nauction that allows SU to do a financing. Unlike previous mechanism designs in\nCRN, the financing contract allows the SU to only pay part of the total amount\nwhen the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the\nspectrum is released and utilized, the SU pays the rest of payment, known as\nthe installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum.\nThe way the financing contract carries out and the sealed non-cash auction\nworks similarly. Thus, contract theory is employed here as the mathematical\nframework to solve the non-cash auction problem and form mutually beneficial\nrelationships between PUs and SUs.

As an implication, electrical conductivity (longitudinal) has been\nstudied within an effective kinetic theory description of hot QCD in the\npresence of the strong magnetic field. The hot QCD equation of state (EoS),\ndependence entering through the effective coupling and quasi-parton\ndistribution function, found to have a significant impact on the longitudinal\nelectrical conductivity in strong magnetic field background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 05:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Biosignals\nare non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable tool\nto analyze them. It is well understood that Gaussian chirplet function is\ncritical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet\ntransform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well\naccepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to\nbio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that\nthe power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been\nfully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In\nthis paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the \"coarse-refinement\"\nscheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the\nmatching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We\nemphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which\nis important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong\nbackground noise.

This article focuses on the application of Machine Learning\ntechniques for Networking (MLN), which can not only help solve the intractable\nold network questions but also stimulate new network applications. In this\narticle, we summarize the basic workflow to explain how to apply the machine\nlearning technology in the networking domain. Then we provide a selective\nsurvey of the latest representative advances with explanations on their design\nprinciples and benefits. These advances are divided into several network design\nobjectives and the detailed information of how they perform in each step of MLN\nworkflow is presented. Finally, we shed light on the new opportunities on\nnetworking design and community building of this new inter-discipline. Our goal\nis to provide a broad research guideline on networking with machine learning to\nhelp and motivate researchers to develop innovative algorithms, standards and\nframeworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 06:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 05:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

We\ndevelop a general framework to address these questions, using collision theory\nto establish a baseline expected rate of interaction based on proximity. We\ntest the models using data from harvester ant colonies. A colony uses feedback\nfrom interactions inside the nest to regulate foraging activity.

It views\neach available relative motion as a block element to reconstruct one matrix so\nas to approximate the low rank matrix, where global motions can be recovered\nfor multi-view registration. However, this approach is sensitive to the\nsparsity of the reconstructed matrix and it treats all block elements equally\nin spite of their varied reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes an\neffective approach for multi-view registration by the weighted LRS\ndecomposition. Based on the anti-symmetry property of relative motions, it\nfirstly proposes a completion strategy to reduce the sparsity of the\nreconstructed matrix. The reduced sparsity of reconstructed matrix can improve\nthe robustness of LRS decomposition. Then, it proposes the weighted LRS\ndecomposition, where each block element is assigned with one estimated weight\nto denote its reliability. By introducing the weight, more accurate\nregistration results can be recovered from the estimated low rank matrix with\ngood efficiency.

Among\nexisting covert channels stands the domain name system (DNS) protocol. Although\nthe detection of covert channels over the DNS has been thoroughly studied in\nthe last decade, previous research dealt with a specific subclass of covert\nchannels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection is\nnot undermined, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware\nremained overlooked. The goal of this study is to propose a method for\ndetecting both tunneling and low-throughput data exfiltration over the DNS.\nTowards this end, we propose a solution composed of a supervised feature\nselection method, and an interchangeable, and adjustable anomaly detection\nmodel trained on legitimate traffic. In the first step, a one-class classifier\nis applied for detecting domain-specific traffic that does not conform with the\nnormal behavior. Then, in the second step, in order to reduce the false\npositive rate resulting from the attempt to detect the low-throughput data\nexfiltration we apply a rule-based filter that filters data exchange over DNS\nused by legitimate services. Our solution was evaluated on a medium-scale\nrecursive DNS server logs, and involved more than 75,000 legitimate uses and\nalmost 2,000 attacks. Evaluation results shows that while DNS tunneling is\ncovered with at least 99% recall rate and less than 0.01% false positive rate,\nthe detection of low throughput exfiltration is more difficult. While not\npreventing it completely, our solution limits a malware attempting to avoid\ndetection with at most a 1kb/h of payload under the limitations of the DNS\nsyntax (equivalent to five credit cards details, or ten user credentials per\nhour) which reduces the effectiveness of the attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 09:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 03:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

A\nhybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The\nprobabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance.\nFor probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the\nprobability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in\nterms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network\ncalculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival\ntraffic for mmWave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service\ncapability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The\nderived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated\nthrough simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given average\nsystem gain, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme\nexhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For\ninstance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification, given high\naverage system gain and arrival rate, while it could be the worst option,\notherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of\nindependent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the\nperformance gain is related to the arrival rate and average system gain,\njointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize\nthe delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and\nsystem service capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 10:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 15:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

Often close to their star, they receive an intense UV photons flux that\ntriggers important photodissociation processes. The T dependency of VUV\nabsorption cross sections are poorly known, leading to an undefined uncertainty\nin atmospheric models. Similarly, data measured at low T similar to that of the\nhigh atmosphere of Mars, Venus, and Titan are often lacking. Our aim is to\nquantify the T dependency of the abs. cross section of important molecules in\nplanetary atmospheres. We want to provide both high-resolution data at T\nprevailing in these media and a simple parameterization of the absorption in\norder to simplify its use in photochemical models. This study focuses on carbon\ndioxide. We performed experimental measurements of CO$_2$ absorption cross\nsection with synchrotron radiation for the wavelength range (115--200nm). For\nlonger wavelengths (195--230nm), we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5m Jobin-Yvon\nspectrometer. We used these data in our 1D thermo-photochemical model in order\nto study their impact on the predicted atmospheric compositions. The cross\nsection of CO$_2$ increases with T. It can be separated in two parts: a\ncontinuum and a fine structure superimposed on the continuum. The variation of\nthe continuum of absorption can be represented by the sum of three gaussian\nfunctions. Using data at high T in thermo-photochemical models modifies\nsignificantly the abundance and the photodissociation rates of many species, in\naddition to CO$_2$, such as methane and ammonia. These deviations have an\nimpact on synthetic transmission spectra, leading to variations of up to 5 ppm.\nWe present a full set of HR ($\\Delta \\lambda$=0.03nm) absorption cross sections\nof CO$_2$ from 115 to 230nm for T ranging from 150 to 800K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 10:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Although it is not yet clear what the\ncorrect notion of a free semialgebraic set is, we review and extend some\nresults that count against a full free projection theorem. For example, it is\nundecidable whether a free statement holds for all matrices of at least one\nsize. We then prove a weak version of the projection theorem: projections along\nlinear and separated variables yields a semi-algebraically parametrised free\nsemi-algebraic set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 11:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The hardness of OPF stems\nfrom two issues: (1) non-convexity and (2) combinatoric constraints (e.g.,\ndiscrete power extraction constraints). The recent advances in providing\nsufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation of OPF can address\nthe issue of non-convexity. To complete the understanding of OPF, this paper\npresents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the convex-relaxed\nOPF with discrete demands as combinatoric constraints, which has a provably\nsmall parameterized approximation ratio (also known as PTAS algorithm).\nTogether with the sufficient conditions on the exactness of the convex\nrelaxation, we provide an efficient approximation algorithm to solve OPF with\ndiscrete demands, when the underlying network is radial with a fixed size and\none feeder. The running time of PTAS is $O(n^{4m/\\epsilon}T)$, where $T$ is the\ntime required to solve a convex relaxation of the problem, and $m, \\epsilon$\nare fixed constants.

A\ntext-based ontology authoring approach can be successful only when it is\ncombined with an effective method for extracting ontological axioms from text.\nExtracting axioms from unrestricted English input is a substantially\nchallenging task due to the richness of the language. Controlled natural\nlanguages (CNLs) have been proposed in this context and these tend to be highly\nrestrictive. In this paper, we propose a new CNL called TEDEI (TExtual\nDEscription Identifier) whose grammar is inspired by the different ways OWL-DL\nconstructs are expressed in English. We built a system that transforms TEDEI\nsentences into corresponding OWL-DL axioms. Now, ambiguity due to different\npossible lexicalizations of sentences and semantic ambiguity present in\nsentences are challenges in this context. We find that the best way to handle\nthese challenges is to construct axioms corresponding to alternative\nformalizations of the sentence so that the end-user can make an appropriate\nchoice. The output is compared against human-authored axioms and in substantial\nnumber of cases, human-authored axiom is indeed one of the alternatives given\nby the system.

A relative distance comparison is a\nstatement of the form \"item A is closer to item B than to item C\". However,\nmany existing clustering algorithms that use relative distances are rather\ncomplex. They are often based on a two-step approach, where the relative\ndistances are first used to learn either a distance matrix, or an embedding of\nthe items, and then some standard clustering method is applied in a second\nstep. In this paper we argue that it should be possible to compute a clustering\ndirectly from relative distance comparisons. Our ideas are built upon existing\nwork on correlation clustering, a well-known non-parametric approach to\nclustering. The technical contribution of this work is twofold. We first define\na novel variant of correlation clustering that is based on relative distance\ncomparisons, and hence suitable for human computation.

The method\nidentifies six clusters that exhibit distinct morphology, vertical structure,\nand preferred latitudes of occurrence. These correspond to areas dominated by\ndeep convective cells; low contrast areas, some including thinner and thicker\nclouds possibly associated with baroclinic instability; regions with possible\nisolated thin cirrus clouds; darker areas due to thinner low level clouds or\nclearer skies due to downwelling, or due to absorbing particles; and fields of\nrelatively shallow cumulus clouds.

Recently, the diffraction-limited\nimage quality afforded by space-based telescopes and by Adaptive Optics (AO)\ncorrected instruments on ground based-telescope, have increased the relative\nimportance of the error terms induced by optical distortions. In particular,\nvariable distortions present in Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optics (MCAO) data\nare limiting the astrometry and photometry accuracy of such high resolution\ninstruments. From there, the ability to deal with those phenomenon had become a\ncritical issue for high-precision studies. We present in this paper an optimal\nmethod of distortion correction for high angular resolution images. Based on a\nprior-knowledge of the static distortion the method aims to correct the\ndynamical distortions specifically for each observation set and each frame. The\nmethod follows an inverse problem approach based on the work done by Gratadour\net al. 2005 on image re-centering, and we aim to generalized it to any kind of\ndistortion mode. The complete formalism of a Weighted Least Square\nminimization, as well as a detailed characterization of the error budget are\npresented. In particular we study the influence of different parameters such as\nthe number of frames and the density of the field (sparse or crowed images), of\nthe noise level, and of the aliasing effect. Finally, we show the first\napplication of the method on real observations collected with the Gemini MCAO\ninstrument, GeMS/GSAOI.

This conscious state is combining the few concepts\nconstituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately conscious of at\na particular moment. We claim that this architectural and\ninformation-processing constraint corresponds to assumptions about the joint\ndistribution between high-level concepts. To the extent that these assumptions\nare generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with\nthem), they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A\nlow-dimensional thought or conscious state is analogous to a sentence: it\ninvolves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high\nprobability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over\nhigh-level concepts) which has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where\nthe dependencies captured by each factor of the factor graph involve only very\nfew variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function.

Uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) deals with the estimation of statistics of the system\nresponse, given a computational model of the system and a probabilistic model\nof its inputs. In engineering applications it is common to assume that the\ninputs are mutually independent or coupled by a Gaussian or elliptical\ndependence structure (copula). In this paper we overcome such limitations by\nmodelling the dependence structure of multivariate inputs as vine copulas. Vine\ncopulas are models of multivariate dependence built from simpler pair-copulas.\nThe vine representation is flexible enough to capture complex dependencies.\nThis paper formalises the framework needed to build vine copula models of\nmultivariate inputs and to combine them with virtually any UQ method. The\nframework allows for a fully automated, data-driven inference of the\nprobabilistic input model on available input data. The procedure is exemplified\non two finite element models of truss structures, both subject to inputs with\nnon-Gaussian dependence structures. For each case, we analyse the moments of\nthe model response (using polynomial chaos expansions), and perform a\nstructural reliability analysis to calculate the probability of failure of the\nsystem (using the first order reliability method and importance sampling).\nReference solutions are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.

In fact, the proof that we have developed in this paper is\na rather simple algebraic proof being made straightforward, above all, by the\nintroduction of two novel algebraic tools. Indeed, on the one hand, we\nintroduce the notion of delta-distribution which merely stands for the\ndifference of two arbitrary probability distributions, and which mainly serves\nto alleviate the sign constraint inherent to a traditional probability\ndistribution. On the other hand, we develop an approximation framework of\ngeneral discrete functions by means of an orthogonal projection expressing in\nterms of linear combinations of function margins with respect to a given\ncollection of point subsets, though, we rather exploit the latter approach for\nthe purpose of modeling locally consistent sets of discrete functions from a\nglobal perspective. After that, as a first step, we develop from scratch the\nexpectation optimization framework which is nothing else than a reformulation,\non stochastic grounds, of the convex-hull approach, as a second step, we\ndevelop the traditional LP relaxation of such an expectation optimization\napproach, and we show that it enables to solve the MAP inference problem in\ngraphical models under rather general assumptions. Last but not least, we\ndescribe an algorithm which allows to compute an exact MAP solution from a\nperhaps fractional optimal (probability) solution of the proposed LP\nrelaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 15:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

So far, major ground-based CMB polarization experiments are located\nin the southern hemisphere.Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB\nPolarization Telescope (AliCPT) in Tibetan Plateau to measure CMB B mode\npolarization and detect the PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT include two\nstages, the first one is to build a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1) and\nthe second one is to have a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of\nabout 6000m (AliCPT-2).
