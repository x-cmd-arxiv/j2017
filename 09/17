This feature, common to many gyrencephalic\nspecies including humans, has attracted recent attention from soft matter\nphysicists. It occurs due to inhomogeneous, and predominantly tangential,\ngrowth of the cortex, which causes circumferential compression, leading to a\nbifurcation of the solution path to a folded configuration. The problem can be\nframed as one of buckling in the regime of linearized elasticity. However, the\nbrain is a very soft solid, which is subject to large strains due to\ninhomogeneous growth. As a consequence, the morphomechanics of the developing\nbrain demonstrates an extensive post-bifurcation regime. Nonlinear elasticity\nstudies of growth-driven brain folding have established the conditions\nnecessary for the onset of folding, and for its progression to configurations\nbroadly resembling gyrencephalic brains. The reference, unfolded,\nconfigurations in these treatments have a high degree of symmetry--typically,\nellipsoidal. Depending on the boundary conditions, the folded configurations\nhave symmetric or anti-symmetric patterns. However, these configurations do not\napproximate the actual morphology of, e.g., human brains, which display\nunsymmetric folding. More importantly, from a neurodevelopmental standpoint,\nmany of the unsymmetric sulci and gyri are notably robust in their locations.\nHere, we initiate studies on the physical mechanisms and geometry that control\nthe development of primary sulci and gyri.

When the\nphenomena of mode mixing occur, as a result of the EMD sifting process, the\nIMFs can lose their physical meaning hindering the interpretation of the\nresults of the analysis. In the paper, \"One or Two frequencies?

Compared to the fractional derivative, the fractal derivative is\nsimpler, and it is faster in numerical evaluations. In this paper, the fractal\nderivative is employed to build the modified-Bloch equation that is a\nfundamental method to describe the spin magnetization evolution affected by\nfractional diffusion, Larmor precession, and relaxation. An equivalent form of\nthe fractal derivative is proposed to convert the fractional diffusion\nequation, which can then be combined with the precession and relaxation\nequations to get the modified-Bloch equation.

Despite the conditional Gaussianity, these nonlinear\nsystems contain many strong non-Gaussian features such as intermittency and\nfat-tailed probability density functions (PDFs). The algorithms involve a\nhybrid strategy that requires only a small number of samples $L$ to capture\nboth the transient and the equilibrium non-Gaussian PDFs with high accuracy.\nHere, a conditional Gaussian mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an\nextremely efficient parametric method is combined with a judicious Gaussian\nkernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional subspace. Rigorous\nanalysis shows that the mean integrated squared error in the recovered PDFs in\nthe high-dimensional subspace is bounded by the inverse square root of the\ndeterminant of the conditional covariance, where the conditional covariance is\ncompletely determined by the underlying dynamics and is independent of $L$.\nThis is fundamentally different from a direct application of kernel methods to\nsolve the full PDF, where $L$ needs to increase exponentially with the\ndimension of the system and the bandwidth shrinks. A detailed comparison\nbetween different methods justifies that the efficient statistically accurate\nalgorithms are able to overcome the curse of dimensionality. It is also shown\nwith mathematical rigour that these algorithms are robust in long time provided\nthat the system is controllable and stochastically stable. Particularly,\ndynamical systems with energy-conserving quadratic nonlinearity as in many\ngeophysical and engineering turbulence are proved to have these properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 00:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

It is often relevant\nto analyze the relationships between pairs of views by multi-view component\nanalysis techniques such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). However, data\nmay easily exhibit nonlinear relations, which CCA cannot reveal. We aim to\ninvestigate the usefulness of nonlinear multi-view relations to characterize\nmulti-view data in an explainable manner. To address this challenge, we propose\na method to characterize globally nonlinear multi-view relationships as a\nmixture of linear relationships. A clustering method, it identifies partitions\nof observations that exhibit the same relationships and learns those\nrelationships simultaneously. It defines cluster variables by multi-view rather\nthan spatial relationships, unlike almost all other clustering methods.\nFurthermore, we introduce a supervised classification method that builds on our\nclustering method by employing multi-view relationships as discriminative\nfactors. The value of these methods resides in their capability to find useful\nstructure in the data that single-view or current multi-view methods may\nstruggle to find. We demonstrate the potential utility of the proposed approach\nusing an application in clinical informatics to detect and characterize slow\nbleeding in patients whose central venous pressure (CVP) is monitored at the\nbedside. Presently, CVP is considered an insensitive measure of a subject's\nintravascular volume status or its change.

Recent developments of\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces aiming for scalable applications use random\ndistribution of roughness, such as spray coating and etched process. However,\nmost of previous analyses of the interaction between flows and superhydrophobic\nsurfaces studied periodic geometries that are economically feasible only in\nlab-scale experiments. We conduct direct numerical simulations of turbulent\nflows over randomly patterned interfaces considering a range of texture widths\n$w^+\\approx 4-26$, and solid fractions $\\phi_s=11\\%$ to $25\\%$. Slip and\nno-slip boundary conditions are implemented in a pattern, modeling the presence\nof gas-liquid interfaces and solid elements. Our results indicate that slip of\nrandomly distributed textures under turbulent flows are about $30\\%$ less than\nthose of surfaces with aligned features of the same size. In the small texture\nsize limit $w^+\\approx 4$, the slip length of the randomly distributed textures\nin turbulent flows is well described by a previously introduced Stokes flow\nsolution of randomly distributed shear-free holes. By comparing DNS results for\npatterned slip and no-slip boundary against the corresponding homogenized slip\nlength boundary conditions, we show that turbulent flows over randomly\ndistributed posts can be represented by an isotropic slip length in streamwise\nand spanwise direction. The average pressure fluctuation on gas pocket is\nsimilar to that of the aligned features with the same texture size and gas\nfraction, but the maximum interface deformation at the leading edge of the\nroughness element is about twice larger when the textures are randomly\ndistributed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 03:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 23:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems\nto compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system\nconfiguration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning\nprocesses active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the\nhomeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer\nthan conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an\nultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,\nthat can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long\ntime scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights\nof all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences,\nto preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose controls the global\ngain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing\nrate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales. To\nvalidate the proposed scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage synaptic\nscaling homeostatic plasticity circuit in a standard 0.18 $\\mu$m Complementary\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of\ndynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. The\ncircuit occupies a silicon area of 84 $\\mu$m x 22 $\\mu$m and consumes\napproximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply voltage. We present experimental\nresults from the homeostatic circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured\nto exhibit time scales of up to 100 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable\nleakage current that can be scaled down to 0.45 atto-Amperes (2.8 electrons/s).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 19:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Our approach in this paper is statistical when we focused\non large groups of asteroids like dynamical families and taxonomic classes, and\nthe data were not sufficient for individual models.\n  Aims.

Geometrical frustration is shown\nto lead to at least two critical points: Starting from the strong-$J$ limit,\nwhere almost local Kondo screening dominates and where the system is a\nnonmagnetic Kondo insulator, antiferromagnetic correlations between\nnearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor local spins become stronger and\nstronger, until at $J^{\\rm dim}_{\\rm c} \\approx 0.89t$ frustration is\nalleviated by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and a\ncorresponding transition to a dimerized state.

The major reasons for high delay include partial\nconnectivity of networks as can be seen in many types of ad hoc wireless\nnetworks with frequent network partitions, long propagation time as experienced\nin inter-planetary and deep space networks, and frequent link disruptions due\nto the mobility of nodes as observed in terrestrial wireless network\nenvironments. Experimenting network architectures, protocols, and mobility\nmodels in such real-world scenarios is difficult due to the complexities\ninvolved in the network environment. Therefore, in this document, we present\nthe documentation of an Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim)\nversion 0.1, capable of simulating urban road network environments with DTN\ncharacteristics including mobility models and routing protocols. The mobility\nmodels included in this version of UDTNSim are (i) Stationary Movement, (ii)\nSimple Random Movement, (iii) Path Type Based Movememt, (iv) Path Memory Based\nMovement, (v) Path Type with Restricted Movement, and (vi) Path Type with Wait\nMovement. In addition to mobility models, we also provide three routing and\ndata hand-off protocols: (i) Epidemic Routing, (ii) Superior Only Handoff, and\n(iii) Superior Peer Handoff. UDTNSim v0.1 is designed using object-oriented\nprogramming approach in order to provide flexibility in addition of new\nfeatures to the DTN environment.

The first, employs the angular velocity and the flap angle states\n(a variable that is not easy to measure) and uses a backstepping technique to\ndesign a robust compensator (BRC) to \\textbf{\\textit{actively}} suppress the\ndisturbance induced tracking error. 2. The second exploits the inherent damping\npresent in the helicopter dynamics leading to a structure preserving,\n\\textbf{\\textit{passively}} robust controller (SPR), which is free of angular\nvelocity and flap angle feedback. The BRC controller is designed to be robust\nin the presence of two types of uncertainties: structured and unstructured. The\nstructured disturbance is due to uncertainty in the rotor parameters, and the\nunstructured perturbation is modeled as an exogenous torque acting on the\nfuselage. The performance of the controller is demonstrated in the presence of\nboth types of disturbances through numerical simulations. In contrast, the SPR\ntracking controller is derived such that the tracking error dynamics inherits\nthe natural damping characteristic of the helicopter.

A particular MOR technique to obtain a reduced\norder model (ROM) is balanced truncation (BT), a method which has been\nextensively studied for deterministic linear systems. As so-called type I BT it\nhas already been extended to bilinear equations, an important subclass of\nnonlinear systems. We provide an alternative generalisation of the linear\nsetting to bilinear systems which is called type II BT. The Gramians that we\npropose in this context contain information about the control. It turns out\nthat the new approach delivers energy bounds which are not just valid in a\nsmall neighbourhood of zero. Furthermore, we provide an $H_\\infty$-error bound\nwhich so far is not known when applying type I BT to bilinear systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 12:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

We extend the theory of algebraic\nlaminations dual to trees, as developed by Coulbois, Hilion, Lustig and\nReynolds, to the context of free products; this also gives us an opportunity to\ngive a unified account of this theory. We first show that any $\\mathbb{R}$-tree\nwith dense orbits in the boundary of the corresponding outer space can be\nreconstructed as a quotient of the boundary of the group by its dual\nlamination. We then describe the dual lamination in terms of a band complex on\ncompact $\\mathbb{R}$-trees (generalizing Coulbois-Hilion-Lustig's compact\nheart), and we analyze this band complex using versions of the Rips machine and\nof the Rauzy-Veech induction. An important output of the theory is that the\nabove map from the boundary of the group to the $\\mathbb{R}$-tree is 2-to-1\nalmost everywhere.\n  A key point for our intended application is a unique duality result for\narational trees. It says that if two trees have a leaf in common in their dual\nlaminations, and if one of the trees is arational and relatively free, then\nthey are equivariantly homeomorphic.\n  This statement is an analogue of a result in the free group saying that if\ntwo trees are dual to a common current and one of the trees is free arational,\nthen the two trees are equivariantly homeomorphic. However, we notice that in\nthe setting of free products, the continuity of the pairing between trees and\ncurrents fails. For this reason, in all this paper, we work with laminations\nrather than with currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 13:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 21:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

However, RANS simulations are known to be unreliable in many\nflows of engineering relevance, which is largely caused by model-form\nuncertainties associated with the Reynolds stresses. Recently, a\nmachine-learning approach has been proposed to assist RANS modeling by building\na functional mapping from mean flow features to discrepancies in RANS modeled\nReynolds stresses as compared to high-fidelity data. However, it remains a\nchallenge to represent discrepancies in the Reynolds stress eigenvectors in\nmachine learning due to the requirements of spatial smoothness,\nframe-independence, and realizability. In this work, we propose three schemes\nfor representing perturbations to the eigenvectors of RANS modeled Reynolds\nstresses: (1) discrepancy-based Euler angles, (2) direct-rotation-based Euler\nangles, and (3) unit quaternions. We compare these metrics by performing a\npriori and a posteriori tests on two canonical flows: fully developed turbulent\nflows in a square duct and massively separated flows over periodic hills. The\nresults demonstrate that the direct-rotation-based Euler angles representation\nlacks spatial smoothness while the discrepancy-based Euler angles\nrepresentation lacks frame-independence, making them unsuitable for being used\nin machine-learning-assisted turbulence modeling. In contrast, the\nrepresentation based on unit quaternion satisfies all the requirements stated\nabove, and thus it is an ideal choice in representing the perturbations\nassociated with the eigenvectors of Reynolds stress tensors. This finding has\nclear importance for uncertainty quantification and machine learning in\nturbulence modeling and for data-driven computational mechanics in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 15:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

We obtain\nthermodynamic quantities of the system such as pressure, temperature and Gibbs\nfree energy in an extended phase space. We complete the analogy of the\nnonlinear dilaton black holes with Van der Waals liquid-gas system. We work in\nthe canonical ensemble and hence we treat the charge of the black hole as an\nexternal fixed parameter. Moreover, we calculate the critical values of\ntemperature, volume and pressure and show they depend on dilaton coupling\nconstant as well as nonlinear parameter. We also investigate the critical\nexponents and find that they are universal and independent of the dilaton and\nnonlinear parameters, which is an expected result. {Finally, we explore the\nphase transition of nonlinear dilaton black holes by studying the Gibbs free\nenergy of the system. We find that in case of $T>T_c$, we have no phase\ntransition. When $T=T_c$, the system admits a second order phase transition,\nwhile for $T=T_{\\rm f}<T_c$ the system experiences a first order transition.\nInterestingly, for $T_{\\rm f}<T<T_c$ we observe a \\textit{zeroth order} phase\ntransition in the presence of dilaton field. This novel \\textit{zeroth order}\nphase transition is occurred due to a finite jump in Gibbs free energy which is\ngenerated by dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant, $\\alpha$, for a certain\nrange of pressure.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 08:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 10:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

An usual way to generate a thick\nbraneworld model relies in coupling a bulk scalar field to higher dimensional\nwarped gravity. Quite recently, a novel braneworld was generated with the aid\nof a tachyonic bulk scalar field, having several remarkable properties. It\ncomprises a regular and stable solution that contains a relevant 3--brane with\nde Sitter induced metric, arising as an exact solution to the 5D field\nequations, describing the inflationary eras of our Universe. Besides, it is\n{\\it asymptotically flat}, despite of the presence of a negative 5D\ncosmological constant, which is an interesting feature that contrasts with most\nof the known, asymptotically either dS or AdS models. Moreover, it encompasses\na graviton spectrum with a single massless bound state, accounting for 4D\ngravity localized on the brane, separated from the continuum of Kaluza-Klein\nmassive graviton modes by a mass gap that makes the 5D corrections to Newton's\nlaw to decay exponentially. Finally, gauge, scalar and fermion fields are also\nshown to be localized on this braneworld. In this work, we show that this\ntachyonic braneworld allows for a nontrivial solution with a vanishing 5D\ncosmological constant that preserves all the above mentioned remarkable\nproperties with a less amount of parameters, constituting an important\ncontribution to the construction of a realistic cosmological braneworld model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 03:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Modelling the detection of tilt in these illusions and their\nstrengths as they are perceived is a challenging task computationally and leads\nto development of techniques that match with human performance. In this study,\nwe present a predictive and quantitative approach for modeling foveal and\nperipheral vision in the induced tilt in Caf\\'e Wall illusion in which parallel\nmortar lines between shifted rows of black and white tiles appear to converge\nand diverge. A bioderived filtering model for the responses of retinal/cortical\nsimple cells to the stimulus using Difference of Gaussians is utilized with an\nanalytic processing pipeline introduced in our previous studies to quantify the\nangle of tilt in the model. Here we have considered visual characteristics of\nfoveal and peripheral vision in the perceived tilt in the pattern to predict\ndifferent degrees of tilt in different areas of the fovea and periphery as the\neye saccades to different parts of the image. The tilt analysis results from\nseveral sampling sizes and aspect ratios, modelling variant foveal views are\nused from our previous investigations on the local tilt, and we specifically\ninvestigate in this work, different configurations of the whole pattern\nmodelling variant Gestalt views across multiple scales in order to provide\nconfidence intervals around the predicted tilts. The foveal sample sets are\nverified and quantified using two different sampling methods.

However, it is extremely sensitive to the\npredetermined parameters and length of time series and it may yield an\ninaccurate estimation of entropy or cause undefined entropy when the length of\ntime series is too short. In this paper the Sigmoid-based refined composite\nmultiscale fuzzy entropy (SRCMFE) is introduced to improve the robustness of\ncomplexity measurement of MFE for short time series analysis. Also SRCMFE is\nused to quantify the dynamical properties of mechanical vibration signals and\nbased on that a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach is proposed by\ncombining SRCMFE with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for\nfeature dimension and variable predictive models based class discrimination\n(VPMCD) for mode classification. In the proposed method, SRCMFE firstly is\nemployed to extract the complexity characteristic from vibration signals of\nrolling bearing and t-SNE for feature dimension reduction is utilized to obtain\na low dimensional manifold characteristic.
