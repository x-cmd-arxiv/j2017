High performance numerical flow and transport\nsimulations of solute breakthrough at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium\nevidence marked deviations from the hydrodynamic dispersion paradigm and\nidentifies two distinct regimes. The first regime is characterized by a broad\ndistribution of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is\ncharacterized by diffusive mass transfer into low-velocity region in the wake\nof solute grains. These mechanisms are quantified systematically in the\nframework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements\n(particles) of the transported material quantity. The model is parameterized\nwith the characteristics of the porous medium under consideration and captures\nboth pre-asymptotic regimes.

Provided that sphalerons are fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, the values of the baryon and lepton asymmetries are\nrelated to each other. Usually, this relation is used to find the value of the\nbaryon asymmetry at the time of the sphaleron freeze-out. To put in other\nwords, the formula which is valid only when the sphalerons are fast, is applied\nat the moment when they are actually switched off.

In this context, Volker\nStrassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication,\nintroduced in 1986 the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the\nasymptotic restriction problem for a family of tensors $X$, closed under direct\nsum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to the reals that\nare monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under\ndirect sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named\nspectral points. Strassen created the support functionals, which are spectral\npoints for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors.\n  Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors.\nThe construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open\nproblem for more than thirty years. We construct for the first time a family of\nnontrivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, using quantum\nentropy and covariants: the quantum functionals. In the process we connect the\nasymptotic spectrum to the quantum marginal problem and to the entanglement\npolytope.\n  To demonstrate the asymptotic spectrum, we reprove (in hindsight) recent\nresults on the cap set problem by reducing this problem to computing asymptotic\nspectrum of the reduced polynomial multiplication tensor, a prime example of\nStrassen.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel JED algorithm and corresponding VLSI designs for\nlarge single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless systems that use\nconstant-modulus constellations. The proposed algorithm is referred to as\nPRojection Onto conveX hull (PrOX) and relies on biconvex relaxation (BCR),\nwhich enables us to efficiently compute an approximate solution of the\nmaximum-likelihood JED problem. Since BCR solves a biconvex problem via\nalternating optimization, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for\nPrOX. We design a scalable, high-throughput VLSI architecture that uses a\nlinear array of processing elements to minimize hardware complexity.

The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be\nunchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative\nabundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To assess the impact\nof disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic\nchemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of\nchemical species over time. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical\nevolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few\ntimes $10^{5}$ yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H$_{2}$O and the\nO$_{2}$ icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major\nelemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional\n\"stepfunction\" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as\ndefined by sharp changes at icelines of H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$ and CO) evolves over\ntime, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K),\ngaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{2}$ and other\nmore complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{2}$ and CO\nthermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature\nthan suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is\nionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the\natmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed\natmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have\nformed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and\nimplemented into planet formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 17:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Black hole (BH) spin orientations are one of the\ncleanest discriminators of formation history, with BHs in dynamically formed\nbinaries in dense stellar environments expected to have spins distributed\nisotropically, in contrast to isolated populations where stellar evolution is\nexpected to induce BH spins preferentially aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum. In this work we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to\ncharacterizing the spin properties of LIGO's BBH population. Using measurements\nof the effective spin of the binaries, which is LIGO's best constrained spin\nparameter, we introduce a simple parameter to quantify the fraction of the\npopulation that is isotropically distributed, regardless of the spin magnitude\ndistribution of the population. Once the orientation characteristics of the\npopulation have been determined, we show how measurements of effective spin can\nbe used to directly constrain the underlying BH spin magnitude distribution.\nAlthough we find that the majority of the current effective spin measurements\nare too small to be informative, with LIGO's four BBH candidates we find a\nslight preference for an underlying population with aligned spins over one with\nisotropic spins (with an odds ratio of 1.1). We argue that it will be possible\nto distinguish symmetric and anti-symmetric populations at high confidence with\ntens of additional detections, although mixed populations may take\nsignificantly more detections to disentangle. We also derive preliminary spin\nmagnitude distributions for LIGO's black holes, under the assumption of aligned\nor isotropic populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 18:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Employing a suite of dust models encompassing a\nvariety of physical effects, we simulate observations of a future seven-band\nCMB experiment to assess the impact of these complexities on parametric\ncomponent separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that\nminimize the `model errors' caused by fitting simple parametric models to more\ncomplex `true' foreground spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find\nthat: (a) fits employing a simple two parameter modified blackbody (MBB) dust\nmodel tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized CMB signal in\nthe presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB\nmodels with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but\nnon-negligible biases can remain, and can be hard to detect; and (c) line of\nsight effects, which give rise to frequency decorrelation, and the presence of\niron grains are the most problematic complexities in the dust emission for\nrecovering the true CMB signal.

The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of\nthe general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity\n(DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic\nframework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest\nabout DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8%\nof tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity.\nThe strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and\nobesity. Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity, and diet and\nobesity DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO\ntopics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with Diabetes, excluding the\nDDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer.\nThe non-DDEO subtopics for Diet included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities,\nweight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for Exercise\nincluded computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for\nObesity included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social\nmedia users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be\nutilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social\nscientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to\ndiabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 19:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

However, a detailed study of these\nregions, which includes $\\sim 36$ globular clusters (GCs) and thousands of open\nclusters is by no means an easy challenge. High differential reddening and\nsevere crowding along the line of sight makes highly hamper to reliably\ndistinguish stars belonging to different populations and/or systems. Aims: The\naim of this study is to separate stars that likely belong to the Galactic GC\nNGC 6544 from its surrounding field by means of proper motion (PM) techniques.\nMethods: This work was based upon a new astrometric reduction method optimized\nfor images of the VVV survey. Results: Photometry over the six years baseline\nof the survey allowed us to obtain a mean precision of $\\sim0.51$ mas/yr, in\neach PM coordinate, for stars with Ks < 15 mag. In the area studied here,\ncluster stars separate very well from field stars, down to the main sequence\nturnoff and below, allowing us to derive for the first time the absolute PM of\nNGC 6544. Isochrone fitting on the clean and differential reddening corrected\ncluster color magnitude diagram yields an age of $\\sim$ 11-13 Gyr, and\nmetallicity [Fe/H] = -1.5 dex, in agreement with previous studies restricted to\nthe cluster core. We were able to derive the cluster orbit assuming an\naxisymmetric model of the Galaxy and conclude that NGC 6544 is likely a halo\nGC. We have not detected tidal tail signatures associated to the cluster, but a\nremarkable elongation in the galactic center direction has been found. The\nprecision achieved in the PM determination also allows us to separate bulge\nstars from foreground disk stars, enabling the kinematical selection of bona\nfide bulge stars across the whole survey area. Our results show that VVV data\nis perfectly suitable for this kind of analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 19:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

CB7CB and\nother nematic dimers are of interest due to their tendency to adopt bent\nconfigurations and to form two states possessing a modulated nematic director\nstructure, namely, the twist bend nematic, NTB, and the oblique helicoidal\ncholesteric, ChOH, which occurs when the achiral dimer is doped with a chiral\nadditive and exposed to an external electric or magnetic field.

A\nclassic result from auction theory by Bulow and Klemperer [9], states that the\nCompetition Complexity of VCG, in the case of n i.i.d. buyers and a single\nitem, is 1, i.e., it is better to recruit one extra buyer and run a second\nprice auction than to learn exactly the buyers' underlying distribution and run\nthe revenue-maximizing auction tailored to this distribution.\n  In this paper we study the Competition Complexity of dynamic auctions.\nConsider the following setting: a monopolist is auctioning off m items in m\nconsecutive stages to n interested buyers. A buyer realizes her value for item\nk in the beginning of stage k. We prove that the Competition Complexity of\ndynamic auctions is at most 3n, and at least linear in n, even when the buyers'\nvalues are correlated across stages, under a monotone hazard rate assumption on\nthe stage (marginal) distributions. We also prove results on the number of\nadditional buyers necessary for VCG at every stage to be an\n{\\alpha}-approximation of the optimal revenue; we term this number the\n{\\alpha}-approximate Competition Complexity. As a corollary we provide the\nfirst results on prior-independent dynamic auctions. This is, to the best of\nour knowledge, the first non-trivial positive guarantees for simple ex-post IR\ndynamic auctions for correlated stages.\n  A key step towards proving bounds on the Competition Complexity is getting a\ngood benchmark/upper bound to the optimal revenue.

In this\nregard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate higher\npenetration of RES. Microgrids are the key components of the smart grids.\nMicrogrids allow integration of various distributed energy resources (DER) such\nas the distributed generation (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) into the\ndistribution system and hence remove or delay the need for distribution\nexpansion. One of the crucial requirements for utilities is to ensure that the\nsystem reliability is maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology.\nTherefore, this paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing\nprioritized loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation\nmethod. The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability\nevaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through Monte-\nCarlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the reliability\nenhancement of the overall system in the presence of the microgrid topology. In\nparticular, the highest priority load has the largest improvement in the\nreliability indices.

Our approach consists of two stages, joint\ntraining and specialization training. During the joint training stage, a neural\nnetwork policy is trained with minimal information to disambiguate the motor\nskills. This forces the policy to learn a common representation of the\ndifferent tasks. Then, during the specialization training stage we selectively\nsplit the weights of the policy based on a per-weight metric that measures the\ndisagreement among the multiple tasks. By splitting part of the control policy,\nit can be further trained to specialize to each task. To update the control\npolicy during learning, we use Trust Region Policy Optimization with\nGeneralized Advantage Function (TRPOGAE). We propose a modification to the\ngradient update stage of TRPO to better accommodate multi-task learning\nscenarios. We evaluate our approach on three continuous motor skill learning\nproblems in simulation: 1) a locomotion task where three single legged robots\nwith considerable difference in shape and size are trained to hop forward, 2) a\nmanipulation task where three robot manipulators with different sizes and joint\ntypes are trained to reach different locations in 3D space, and 3) locomotion\nof a two-legged robot, whose range of motion of one leg is constrained in\ndifferent ways.

The\ngas distributions show various structures as well, including clumps and arcs\nformed from spiral arms. In models with lower gas surface densities, vortices\nand smooth spiral arms form in the gas distribution, but the dust is too weakly\ncoupled to the gas to be significantly perturbed.

CTA is an explorer\nof the extreme universe, probing environments from the immediate neighbourhood\nof black holes to cosmic voids on the largest scales.

With 99 telescopes on the southern site and 19 telescopes on\nthe northern site, flexible operation will be possible, with sub-arrays\navailable for specific tasks. CTA will have important synergies with many of\nthe new generation of major astronomical and astroparticle observatories.\nMulti-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches combining CTA data with those\nfrom other instruments will lead to a deeper understanding of the broad-band\nnon-thermal properties of target sources.\n  The CTA Observatory will be operated as an open, proposal-driven observatory,\nwith all data available on a public archive after a pre-defined proprietary\nperiod. Scientists from institutions worldwide have combined together to form\nthe CTA Consortium. This Consortium has prepared a proposal for a Core\nProgramme of highly motivated observations.

Motivation for the development of\nsuch methods can be found, for instance, in the fields of chemical kinetics and\nsystems biology. It is known that the dynamical behavior of biochemical systems\nis often intrinsically stiff representing a serious challenge for their\nnumerical approximation. The naive extension of stiff deterministic solvers to\nstochastic integration often yields numerical solutions with either\nimpractically large relaxation times or incorrectly resolved covariance. In\nthis paper, we propose a splitting heuristic which helps to resolve some of\nthese issues. The proposed integrator contains a number of unknown parameters\nwhich are estimated for each particular problem from the moment equations of\nthe corresponding linearized system. We show that this method is able to\nreproduce the exact mean and variance of the linear scalar test equation and\ndemonstrates a good accuracy for the arbitrarily stiff systems at least in the\nlinear case.

Two sorts of trapped modes in the ring array\nhave been identified: the BCR trapped modes which correspond to the bound modes\nbelow the light line at the edge of the first Brillouin zone in the\ncorresponding planar structure (namely the infinite linear chain); the\nquasi-BIC trapped modes corresponding to the bound states in the continuum\nsupported in the infinite linear chain. According to the whispering gallery\ncondition, the BCR trapped modes can be supported in the ring array only when\nthe number of dielectric elements N is even, while the quasi-BIC ones always\nexist no matter whether N is odd or even. For both two kind of trapped modes,\nthe lowest one of each kind possesses the highest Q factor, which are ~105 for\nBCR kind and ~1011 for quasi-BIC kind with N=16 respectively, and the radiation\nloss increases dramatically as the structural resonance increases. Finally, the\nbehavior of the Q factor with N is explained numerically for the lowest one of\neach kind of trapped modes. The Q factor scales as Q~exp(0.662N) for the\nquasi-BIC trapped mode and Q~exp(0.325N) for the BCR one. Intriguingly, the Q\nfactor of the quasi-BIC trapped mode can be as large as ~105 even at N=8.\nCompared to the finite linear chain, the structure of ring array exhibits\noverwhelming advantage in Q factor with the same N because there is no\narray-edge radiation loss in the ring array. We note that the principles can\ncertainly be extended to particles of other shapes (such as nanospheres,\nnanodisks, and many other experimentally feasible geometries).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 04:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Program specialization, parallelization and\ncohesion measurement are examples of such applications. These applications can\nbenefit from an incremental static slicing method in which a significant extent\nof the computations for slicing with respect to one criterion could be reused\nfor another. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental slicing of\nfunctional programs. We first present a non-incremental version of the slicing\nalgorithm which does a polyvariant analysis 1 of functions. Since polyvariant\nanalyses tend to be costly, we compute a compact context-independent summary of\neach function and then use this summary at the call sites of the function. The\nconstruction of the function summary is non-trivial and helps in the\ndevelopment of the incremental version. The incremental method, on the other\nhand, consists of a one-time pre-computation step that uses the non-incremental\nversion to slice the program with respect to a fixed default slicing criterion\nand processes the results further to a canonical form. Presented with an actual\nslicing criterion, the incremental step involves a low-cost computation that\nuses the results of the pre-computation to obtain the slice. We have\nimplemented a prototype of the slicer for a pure subset of Scheme, with pairs\nand lists as the only algebraic data types. Our experiments show that the\nincremental step of the slicer runs orders of magnitude faster than the\nnon-incremental version. We have also proved the correctness of our incremental\nalgorithm with respect to the non-incremental version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 07:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

This article first gives a brief introduction to the\ntransportation data, and surveys the state-of-the-art prediction methods. Then,\nwe verify whether or not the prediction performance is able to be improved by\nfitting actual data to optimize the parameters of the prediction model which is\nused to predict the traffic flow. Such verification is conducted by comparing\nthe optimized time series prediction model with the normal time series\nprediction model. This means that in the era of big data, accurate use of the\ndata becomes the focus of studying the traffic flow prediction to solve the\ncongestion problem.

Although powerful deep neural networks\n(DNNs) techniques can be applied to artificially synthesize speech waveform,\nthe synthetic speech quality is low compared with that of natural speech. One\nof the issues causing the quality degradation is an over-smoothing effect often\nobserved in the generated speech parameters. A GAN introduced in this paper\nconsists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and\ngenerated samples, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. In the\nproposed framework incorporating the GANs, the discriminator is trained to\ndistinguish natural and generated speech parameters, while the acoustic models\nare trained to minimize the weighted sum of the conventional minimum generation\nloss and an adversarial loss for deceiving the discriminator. Since the\nobjective of the GANs is to minimize the divergence (i.e., distribution\ndifference) between the natural and generated speech parameters, the proposed\nmethod effectively alleviates the over-smoothing effect on the generated speech\nparameters. We evaluated the effectiveness for text-to-speech and voice\nconversion, and found that the proposed method can generate more natural\nspectral parameters and $F_0$ than conventional minimum generation error\ntraining algorithm regardless its hyper-parameter settings. Furthermore, we\ninvestigated the effect of the divergence of various GANs, and found that a\nWasserstein GAN minimizing the Earth-Mover's distance works the best in terms\nof improving synthetic speech quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 12:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

In this theoretical paper on calcium and\nxenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization\navalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons\nfrom the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier\nfor ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant\ncations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric\nfield. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed\nelectrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact\nionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away.\nThe dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the\nslingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a\ndependence of the dopants' ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we\ndevelop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of\ndopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the\nHe atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the\ndistribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays\nbetween the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for\ncalcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to\ndeshield the dopant ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 14:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Thus, how\nto inhibit the tribocharging and the tribodischarging has caused wide public\nconcern. Because the discharge caused by the electrical breakdown of the\nambient gas is generally accompanied with the generation of light, we\ninvestigated here the tribocharging and the tribodischarging by observing the\nlight emitted during friction. We found that the position reversal of the\nfriction pair has a dramatic impact on the intensity of the tribo-induced\nlight. Experimental results show that an intense light is produced when a\nstationary Al2O3 disk is sliding on a rotating SiO2 disk, but only a weak light\nis observed for the case of a stationary SiO2 disk and a rotating Al2O3 disk.\nThis means that the process of the tribocharging and the tribodischarging can\nbe significantly influenced owing to the change in the relative position of the\nfriction couple. The experimentally measured polarities of the tribo-induced\ncharge on the friction surfaces further indicated that the strong discharging\noccurs when the rotating surface is negatively charged. The reason for the\ndifference in the intensity of the tribocharging and tribodischarging can be\nattributed to the combined effects of the contact potential difference and the\ntemperature gradient between the contacting surfaces on the charge transfer\nwhen friction. Finally, a simple, low cost, yet effective approach, i.e., just\nkeep the friction partner whose surface is tribo-induced negatively charged as\nthe stationary one, can be utilized to suppress the intensity of the\ntribocharging and the tribodischarging.

A\nsimple model of this multiverse is elaborated: Assuming closed space geometry,\nthe origin of the multiverse can be explained by quantum tunneling from\nnothing; subuniverses are supposed to emerge from local fluctuations of\nseparate inflation fields. The standard concept of tunneling from nothing is\nextended to the effect that in addition to an inflationary scalar field, matter\nis also generated, and that the tunneling leads to an (unstable) equilibrium\nstate.

In particular we show that by applying suitable conformal\ntransformations to existing self-complementary planar structures like\nlogarithmic spirals, the constant input impedance property is considerably\nimproved, specially in the low frequency domain, where it usually fails due to\nthe large wavelength involved. The effect of the conformal transformation is to\nbring infinity up to a finite distance and, in a way, to imprison the otherwise\ninfinite structure in a compact region. This procedure enables to perform a\nmore intelligent truncation with the aim to capture some of the properties left\nbehind in the cutting, and to design realistic ultra width-band antennas with a\nmore controlled value of the input impedance in the whole operation range. Due\nto the fact that the tools here developed find their roots in the differential\ngeometry of curved manifolds, they are quite general and also suitable for\ndealing with 3D-antennas of arbitrary shape, curvature and size, as well as\nwith other systems in which the effects of truncation play a crucial role in\ndefining physical properties of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 20:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

It\nincludes cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS systems, all of which use\nelectromagnetic radio waves with frequencies ranging from typically 100 MHz to\na few GHz. However, several long-standing challenges with standard radio-wave\nwireless transmission still exist, including keeping secure transmission of\ndata from potential compromise. Here, we demonstrate wireless information\ntransfer using a line-of-sight optical architecture with a micromechanical\nelement. In this fundamentally new approach, a laser beam encoded with\ninformation impinges on a nonlinear micromechanical resonator located a\ndistance from the laser. The force generated by the radiation pressure of the\nlaser light on the nonlinear micromechanical resonator produces a sideband\nmodulation signal, which carries the precise information encoded in the subtle\nchanges in the radiation pressure. Using this, we demonstrate data and image\ntransfer with one hundred percent fidelity with a single 96 micron by 270\nmicron silicon resonator element in an optical frequency band. This mechanical\napproach relies only on the momentum of the incident photons and is therefore\nable to use any portion of the optical frequency banda band that is 10,000\ntimes wider than the radio frequency band. Our line-of-sight architecture using\nhighly scalable micromechanical resonators offers new possibilities in wireless\ncommunication. Due to their small size, these resonators can be easily arrayed\nwhile maintaining a small form factor to provide redundancy and parallelism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 16:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Thus, applying DBSs into the\ncellular network has great potential to increase the throughput of the network\nand improve Quality of Service (QoS) of Mobile Users (MUs). In this paper, we\nfocus on how to place the DBS (i.e., jointly determining the location and the\nassociation coverage of a DBS) in order to improve the QoS in terms of\nminimizing the total average latency ratio of MUs by considering the energy\ncapacity limitation of the DBS.

Existing models for learning embeddings from the crowd typically\nmake simplifying assumptions such as all individuals estimate similarity using\nthe same criteria, the list of criteria is known in advance, or that the crowd\nworkers are not influenced by the data that they see.
