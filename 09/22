To analyze this vulnerability, we study\ncyber-physical attacks that affect both the power grid physical infrastructure\nand its underlying Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.

We leverage the algebraic properties of the AC power flows to introduce\nthe efficient EXPOSE Algorithm for detecting line failures and recovering\nvoltages inside that attacked area after such an attack. The EXPOSE Algorithm\noutperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting line failures using\npartial information under the AC power flow model in terms of scalability and\naccuracy. The main advantages of the EXPOSE Algorithm are that its running time\nis independent of the size of the grid and number of line failures, and that it\nprovides accurate information recovery under some conditions on the attacked\narea. Moreover, it approximately recovers the information and provides the\nconfidence of the solution when these conditions do not hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 16:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

In this paper, we\nset up an analogue of the strong connectivity theory for bidirected graphs\nregarding directed trails, motivated by factor theory. We define the new\nconcepts of {\\em circular connectivity} and {\\em circular components} as\ngeneralizations of the strong connectivity and strong components. In our main\ntheorem, we characterize the inner structure of each circular component; we\ndefine a certain binary relation between vertices in terms of the circular\nconnectivity and prove that this relation is an equivalence relation. The\nnontrivial aspect of this structure arises from directed trails starting and\nending with the same sign, and is therefore characteristic to bidirected graphs\nthat are not digraphs. This structure can be considered as an analogue of the\ngeneral Kotzig-Lov\\'asz decomposition, a known canonical decomposition in\n$1$-factor theory. From our main theorem, we also obtain a new result in\n$b$-factor theory, namely, a $b$-factor analogue of the general Kotzig-Lov\\'asz\ndecomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 16:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

Despite the existence of\nseveral novel vehicular applications in the literature, there still exists a\nsignificant gap between resources needed for a variety of vehicular (in\nparticular, data-dominant, latency-sensitive, and computationally-heavy)\napplications and the capabilities of already-in-market vehicles. To address\nthis gap, different smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches have been proposed that\nutilize the external computational/storage resources to enable new\napplications. However, their acceptance and application domain are still very\nlimited due to programability, wireless connectivity, and performance\nlimitations, along with several security/privacy concerns.

Additionally, contaminating light from both binary companions and\nunassociated stars can significantly bias the results of planet\ncharacterisation studies, but can be corrected for if the properties of the\ncontaminating star are known. We search for binary companions to known\ntransiting exoplanet host stars, in order to determine the multiplicity\nproperties of hot Jupiter host stars. We also characterise unassociated stars\nalong the line of sight, allowing photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nthe planetary system to be corrected for contaminating light. We analyse lucky\nimaging observations of 97 Southern hemisphere exoplanet host stars, using the\nTwo Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54m telescope. For each detected\ncompanion star, we determine flux ratios relative to the planet host star in\ntwo passbands, and measure the relative position of the companion. The\nprobability of each companion being physically associated was determined using\nour two-colour photometry. A catalogue of close companion stars is presented,\nincluding flux ratios, position measurements, and estimated companion star\ntemperature. For companions that are potential binary companions, we review\narchival and catalogue data for further evidence. For WASP-77AB and WASP-85AB,\nwe combine our data with historical measurements to determine the binary\norbits, showing them to be moderately eccentric and inclined to the line of\nsight and planetary orbital axis. Combining our survey with the similar Friends\nof Hot Jupiters survey, we conclude that known hot Jupiter host stars show a\ndeficit of high mass stellar companions compared to the field star population;\nhowever, this may be a result of the biases in detection and target selection\nby ground-based surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 18:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 09:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Vibronic spectra can be computed\nwithin the Franck-Condon approximation for small dyes in solution using an\nimplicit solvent model. However, implicit solvent models neglect specific\nsolute-solvent interactions and provide only an approximate treatment of\nsolvent polarization effects. Furthermore, temperature-dependent solvent\nbroadening effects are often only accounted for using a broadening parameter\nchosen to match experimental spectra. On the other hand, ensemble approaches\nprovide a straightforward way of accounting for solute-solvent interactions and\ntemperature-dependent broadening effects by computing vertical excitation\nenergies obtained from an ensemble of solute-solvent conformations.

Because of this, many works have focused on developing\nsynthesis procedures for specific fragments of LTL, with an easier synthesis\nproblem. In this work, we focus on Safety LTL, defined here to be the\nUntil-free fragment of LTL in Negation Normal Form~(NNF), and shown to express\na fragment of safe LTL formulas. The intrinsic motivation for this fragment is\nthe observation that in many cases it is not enough to say that something\n\"good\" will eventually happen, we need to say by when it will happen. We show\nhere that Safety LTL synthesis is significantly simpler algorithmically than\nLTL synthesis. We exploit this simplicity in two ways, first by describing an\nexplicit approach based on a reduction to Horn-SAT, which can be solved in\nlinear time in the size of the game graph, and then through an efficient\nsymbolic construction, allowing a BDD-based symbolic approach which\nsignificantly outperforms extant LTL-synthesis tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 19:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 03:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

At the\nsame time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic\nmosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene\nflow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient\npopulations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting\ndemographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted\nindividuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions,\npotentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a\nmodel of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by\ndispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is\nsubject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired\nby salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in\nterms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The\nresults of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving\npopulations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear\neffects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and\nthe time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that\nintermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that\nincreased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are\nlow, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that\ndensity-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate\nbiomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important\nramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both\nnatural and anthropogenic disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 21:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

Notwithstanding a\nmounting body of literature on the two competing paradigms, a clear\nunderstanding of their relationship is still lacking. In this study we deploy\nan effective impedance of the scalar wave equation as a lens for comparison and\nestablish a low-frequency, long-wavelength (LF-LW) dispersive expansion of the\nWillis effective model, including terms up to the second order. Despite the\nintuitive expectation that such obtained effective impedance coincides with its\ntwo-scale counterpart, we find that the two descriptions differ by a modulation\nfactor which is, up to the second order, expressible as a polynomial in\nfrequency and wavenumber. We track down this inconsistency to the fact that the\ntwo-scale expansion is commonly restricted to the free-wave solutions and thus\nfails to account for the body source term which, as it turns out, must also be\nhomogenized -- by the reciprocal of the featured modulation factor. In the\nanalysis, we also (i) reformulate for generality the Willis' effective\ndescription in terms of the eigenfunction approach, and (ii) obtain the\ncorresponding modulation factor for dipole body sources, which may be relevant\nto some recent efforts to manipulate waves in metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 22:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Spectroscopy of these systems\nhas been scarce, whereas theoretical arguments suggest that radiation pressure\non dust grains somehow inhibits star formation. Here, we harness an accelerated\nMonte Carlo radiation transport scheme to report a radiation hydrodynamical\nsimulation of super star cluster formation in turbulent clouds. We find that\nradiation pressure reduces the global star formation efficiency by 30-35%, and\nthe star formation rate by 15-50%, both relative to a radiation-free control\nrun. Overall, radiation pressure does not terminate the gas supply for star\nformation and the final stellar mass of the most massive cluster is $\\sim\n1.3\\times10^6\\,M_\\odot$. The limited impact as compared to in idealized\ntheoretical models is attributed to a radiation-matter anti-correlation in the\nsupersonically turbulent, gravitationally collapsing medium. In isolated\nregions outside massive clusters, where the gas distribution is less disturbed,\nradiation pressure is more effective in limiting star formation. The resulting\nstellar density at the cluster core is $\\ge\n10^{8}\\,M_{\\odot}\\,\\textrm{pc}^{-3}$, with stellar velocity dispersion $\\gtrsim\n70\\,\\text{km}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. We conclude that the super star cluster nucleus\nis propitious to the formation of very massive stars via dynamical core\ncollapse and stellar merging.

For the practitioner dealing with large and complex\nnonlinear response surfaces, its advantages include a matrix-free formulation\nand the lack of a requirement to prespecify a confining regression basis.\nAlthough flexible in fitting the mean, BART has been limited by its reliance on\na constant variance error model. This homoscedastic assumption is unrealistic\nin many applications. Alleviating this limitation, we propose HBART, a\nnonparametric heteroscedastic elaboration of BART. In BART, the mean function\nis modeled with a sum of trees, each of which determines an additive\ncontribution to the mean. In HBART, the variance function is further modeled\nwith a product of trees, each of which determines a multiplicative contribution\nto the variance. Like the mean model, this flexible, multidimensional variance\nmodel is entirely nonparametric with no need for the prespecification of a\nconfining basis. Moreover, with this enhancement, HBART can provide insights\ninto the potential relationships of the predictors with both the mean and the\nvariance.

This involved a study of mechanisms of human\nspeech production, a review of techniques in speech synthesis, and analysis of\ntests used to evaluate the effectiveness of synthesized speech. It was\ndetermined that a diphone synthesis system was the most effective choice for\nthe scope of this project. A method of automatically identifying and extracting\ndiphones from prompted speech was designed, allowing for the creation of a\ndiphone database by a speaker in less than 40 minutes. CMUdict was used to\ndetermine the pronunciation of known words. A system for smoothing the\ntransitions between diphone recordings was designed and implemented. CMUdict\nwas then used to train a maximum-likelihood prediction system to determine the\ncorrect pronunciation of unknown English language alphabetic words. Then, a\nPart Of Speech tagger was designed to find the lexical class of words within a\nsentence.\n  A method of altering the pitch, duration, and volume of the produced voice\nover time was designed, being a combination of the TD-PSOLA algorithm and a\nnovel approach referred to as Unvoiced Speech Duration Shifting. This minimises\ndistortion of the voice when shifting the pitch or duration, while maximising\ncomputational efficiency by operating in the time domain. This approach was\nused to add correct lexical stress to vowels within words. A text tokenisation\nsystem was developed to handle arbitrary text input, allowing pronunciation of\nnumerical input tokens and use of appropriate pauses for punctuation. Methods\nfor further improving sentence level speech naturalness were discussed.\nFinally, the system was tested with listeners for its intelligibility and\nnaturalness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 00:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

We propose a\nhybrid network security scheme including intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and\nhoneypots scattered throughout the network. This combines the advantages of two\nsecurity technologies. A honeypot is an activity-based network security system,\nwhich could be the logical supplement of the passive detection policies used by\nIDSs. This integration forces us to balance security performance versus cost by\nscheduling device activities for the proposed system. By formulating the\nscheduling problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (DEC-POMDP), decisions are made in a distributed manner at each device\nwithout requiring centralized control. The partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP) is a useful choice for controlling stochastic systems. As a\ncombination of two Markov models, POMDPs combine the strength of hidden Markov\nModel (HMM) (capturing dynamics that depend on unobserved states) and that of\nMarkov decision process (MDP) (taking the decision aspect into account).\nDecision making under uncertainty is used in many parts of business and\nscience.We use here for security tools.We adopt a high-quality approximation\nsolution for finite-space POMDPs with the average cost criterion, and their\nextension to DEC-POMDPs.

Upon\nfurther increase of pressure up to 36.6 GPa, SnSe-Cmcm phase is transformed to\nCsCl-type SnSe-Pm3m phase, which remains stable at even higher pressures. A\nmetallic compound with different stoichiometry, Sn3Se4-I43d, is found to be\nthermodynamically stable from 18 GPa to 70 GPa. Known semiconductor tin\ndiselenide SnSe2-P3m1 phase is found to be thermodynamically stable from\nambient pressure up to 18 GPa. Initially being semiconducting, it experiences\nmetalization at pressures above 8 GPa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 02:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

However, the\nuse of these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers\nwho have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service\ndisruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against\nrailways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of\nFDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor\nmeasurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack -- that (i)\nmaximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local\nvoltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To\ncounteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a\nbad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on\nunique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection\nsystem can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current\nmeasurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS,\nattack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system\nfeatures an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative\nrates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive\nsimulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS\nsetup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected\neffectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 02:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

Guided Local\nSearch (GLS) can improve the efficiency of local search. By changing the guide\nfunction, GLS guides a local search to escape from locally optimal solutions\nand find better solutions. The key component of GLS is its penalizing mechanism\nwhich determines which feature is selected to penalize when the search is\ntrapped in a locally optimal solution. The original GLS penalizing mechanism\nonly makes use of the cost and the current penalty value of each feature. It is\nwell known that many combinatorial optimization problems have a big valley\nstructure, i.e., the better a solution is, the more the chance it is closer to\na globally optimal solution. This paper proposes to use big valley structure\nassumption to improve the GLS penalizing mechanism. An improved GLS algorithm\ncalled Elite Biased GLS (EB-GLS) is proposed. EB-GLS records and maintains an\nelite solution as an estimate of the globally optimal solutions, and reduces\nthe chance of penalizing the features in this solution.

Specifically, we propose that the p-value be\ndemoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be\nconsidered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior\nevidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world\ncosts and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research\ndomain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to \"ban\"\np-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such\nmeasures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should\nnot take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it\nseldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other\npurely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can\nbe implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical\ndecision making more broadly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 03:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:09:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 15:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Thus,\nthe plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during\ntime evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold\nplasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma.

In this work we take a first step towards\nthe latter goal, by proving the first positive results regarding the\nderandomization of $TC^0$ circuits of depth $d>2$.\n  Our first main result is a quantified derandomization algorithm for $TC^0$\ncircuits with a super-linear number of wires. Specifically, we construct an\nalgorithm that gets as input a $TC^0$ circuit $C$ over $n$ input bits with\ndepth $d$ and $n^{1+\\exp(-d)}$ wires, runs in almost-polynomial-time, and\ndistinguishes between the case that $C$ rejects at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs\nand the case that $C$ accepts at most $2^{n^{1-1/5d}}$ inputs.

Although\nthis may appear to be an optimal decision, based on a rational appraisal of\ncost and benefits to the individual, it exposes the population to subsequent\noutbreaks. We investigate if voluntary vaccination can emerge in a an\nintegrated model of an epidemic spreading on a social network of rational\nagents that make informed decisions whether to be vaccinated.

Near\nthe epidemic threshold ($R_0\\approx1$) the use of local prevalence information\ncan result in a dichotomous response in final vaccine coverage.

Over open oceans, altimeter\nreturn waveforms generally correspond to the Brown model, and by inversion,\nestimated shape parameters provide mean surface height and wind speed. However,\nin coastal areas or over inland waters, the waveform shape is often distorted\nby land influence, resulting in peaks or fast decaying trailing edges. As a\nresult, derived sea surface heights are then less accurate and waveforms need\nto be reprocessed by sophisticated algorithms. To this end, this work suggests\na novel Spatio-Temporal Altimetry Retracking (STAR) technique. We show that\nSTAR enables the derivation of sea surface heights over the open ocean as well\nas over coastal regions of at least the same quality as compared to existing\nretracking methods, but for a larger number of cycles and thus retaining more\nuseful data. Novel elements of our method are (a) integrating information from\nspatially and temporally neighboring waveforms through a conditional random\nfield approach, (b) sub-waveform detection, where relevant sub-waveforms are\nseparated from corrupted or non-relevant parts through a sparse representation\napproach, and (c) identifying the final best set of sea surfaces heights from\nmultiple likely heights using Dijkstra's algorithm.

In this paper, we study\nthe influence of a set of blind pre-processing methods on the face detection\nrate using the Viola-Jones algorithm.

Many methods for\nlighting invariant and deblurring are used in order to improve the detection\naccuracy. We want to avoid using blind pre-processing methods that may obstruct\nthe face detector. To that end, we perform two sets of experiments. The first\nset is performed to avoid any blind pre-processing method that may hurt the\nface detector. The second set is performed to study the effect of the selected\npre-processing methods on images that suffer from hard conditions. We present\ntwo manners of applying the pre-processing method to the image prior to being\nused by the Viola-Jones face detector. Four different datasets are used to draw\na coherent conclusion about the potential improvement caused by using prior\nenhanced images. The results demonstrate that some of the pre-processing\nmethods may hurt the accuracy of Viola-Jones face detection algorithm.

Massive MIMO has been\nproved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially\nmultiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential\nlimitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which\narises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by\nreusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot\ncontamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot\nsequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative\nmethod, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data\nsymbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot\ncontamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using\nmaximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE.\nTo this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a\npractical random BS deployment.

A key IV\nidentification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV\ncannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the\nexposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic\nlevel of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally\naffect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion\nrestriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we\nintroduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the\nexclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in MR\nliterature.

This thesis concerns an approach to\ntest such models known as \"Effective Theory of Dark Energy\" . It applies to all\nmodels where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of\nfreedom, called \"scalar-tensor theories\". In Chapter 1 I summarise the most\ngeneral class of such theories currently known, called \"Degenerate higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor\" (DHOST) theories. In Chapter 2, I introduce the effective theory\nof dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the\ngravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 analyses in details\nthe stability of different classes of theories. Notably, I show that the most\ngeneral class of theories free from instabilities reduces to the so-called\nHorndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories, up to a non minimal coupling to\nmatter. Another goal of the thesis is to study the observable effects of\ndeviations from ${\\Lambda}$CDM. In Chapter 5, I consider the possibility of an\ninteraction between dark matter and dark energy and I analyse the constraining\npower of future surveys on the free parameters of the theory. Chapter 6 focuses\non the observational effects of theories where a kinetic mixing between matter\nand the scalar field exists. This gives a peculiar and potentially observable\neffect, namely the weakening of gravity at large scale structure scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 14:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

We distinguish between local symmetry operations which commute with the\nHamiltonian, and those which do not commute due to an asymmetric coupling to\nthe surrounding sites. While valuable as a computational tool for versatile\ndiscrete systems with locally symmetric structures, the approach provides in\nparticular a unified, intuitive, and efficient route to the flexible design of\ncompact localized states at desired energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 15:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 15:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

From the Schwinger boson calculations,\nwe find that the evolution from the uniform HS phase for spin-1/2 Hida model to\nthe TS phase for spin-1 KHA happens through two quantum phase transitions: 1)\nthe spontaneous dimerization transition at $J_F/J_A \\sim -0.28$ from the\nuniform HS to D-HS phase, and 2) the moment formation transition at $J_F/J_A\n\\sim -1.46$, across which the pair of spin-1/2's on every FM bond begin to\nexpress as a bound moment that tends to spin-1 for large negative $J_F$'s. The\nTS ground state of spin-1 KHA is thus adiabatically connected to the D-HS\nground state of the Hida model.

Phys. 345 (2017), 58-73), the translation\ninvariance property of the phaseless far-field pattern can be broken by using\ninfinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves as the incident\nfields at a fixed frequency. In this paper, we prove that the obstacle and the\nindex of refraction of an inhomogeneous medium can be uniquely determined by\nthe phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely many sets of\nsuperpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a fixed\nfrequency under the condition that the obstacle is a priori known to be a\nsound-soft or non-absorbing impedance obstacle and the index of refraction $n$\nof the inhomogeneous medium is real-valued and satisfies that either $n-1\\ge\nc_1$ or $n-1\\le-c_1$ in the support of $n-1$ for some positive constant $c_1$.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first uniqueness result in inverse\nscattering with phaseless far-field data. Our proofs are based essentially on\nthe limit of the normalized eigenvalues of the far-field operators which is\nalso established in this paper by using a factorization of the far-field\noperators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 04:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The study is carried out under two\ndifferent situations, drawing the same conclusion. No matter in the energy\ntransfer process or in the mass transfer process inside the system, when\nnonextensive parameter q is more than unity, the total entropy is bounded; on\nthe contrary, when this parameter is less than unity, the total entropy is\nunbounded. There are proofs in both theory and observation that the q is always\nmore than unity. So the Tsallis entropy in self-gravitating system generally\nexhibits a bounded property. This indicates the existence of global maximum of\nTsallis entropy. It is possible for self-gravitating systems to evolve to\nthermodynamically stable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 03:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}
