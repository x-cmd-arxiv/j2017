In\nthe context of this toy model, a general formalism is presented for SU(N)\ntheories. The sign problem that the theory displays is a genuine one, stemming\nfrom a (quark) chemical potential. Three stationary points are present in the\noriginal (real) domain of integration, so that contributions from all the\nthimbles associated to them are to be taken into account: we show how\nsemiclassical computations can provide hints on the regions of parameter space\nwhere this is absolutely crucial. Known analytical results for the chiral\ncondensate and the Polyakov loop are correctly reproduced: this is in\nparticular trivial at high values of the number of flavors N_f. In this regime\nwe notice that the single thimble dominance scenario takes place (the dominant\nthimble is the one associated to the identity). At low values of N_f\ncomputations can be more difficult. It is important to stress that this is not\nat all a consequence of the original sign problem (not even via the residual\nphase). The latter is always under control, while accidental, delicate\ncancelations of contributions coming from different thimbles can be in place in\n(restricted) regions of the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 16:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 23:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

A\ncommon mechanism is peak pricing (PP), where consumers pay reduced (increased)\nprices for electricity during periods of low (high) demand, and its simplicity\nallows consumers to understand how their consumption affects costs. However,\nnew consumer technologies like internet-connected smart thermostats simplify\nreal-time pricing (RP), because such devices can automate the tradeoff between\ncosts and consumption. These devices enable consumer choice under RP by\nabstracting this tradeoff into a question of quality of service (e.g., comfort)\nversus price. This paper uses a principal-agent framework to design PP and RP\nrates for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) to address adverse\nselection due to variations in consumer comfort preferences. We formulate the\npricing problem as a stochastic bilevel program, and numerically solve it by\nreformulation as a mixed integer program (MIP). Last, we compare the\neffectiveness of different pricing schemes on reductions of peak load or load\nvariability.

The aim of\nthis paper is to generalize the works of Ali-Akbar Bromideh by proposing a\nhypothesis testing based on Bregman divergence in order to improve the process\nof choice of the model. Our aproach differs from him. After observing n data\npoints of unknown density f ; we firstly measure the closness between the bias\nreduced kernel density estimator and the first estimated candidate model.\nSecondly between the bias reduced kernel density estimator and the second\nestimated candidate model. In these two cases Bregman Divergence (BD) and the\nbias reduced kernel estimator [3] focuses on improving the con- vergence rates\nof kernel density estimators are used. Our testing procedure for model\nselection is thus based on the comparison of the value of model selection test\nstatistic to critical values from a standard normal table. We establish the\nasymptotic properties of Bregman divergence estimator and approximations of the\npower functions are deduced. The multi-step MLE process will be used to\nestimate the parameters of the models. We explain the applicability of the BD\nby a real data set and by the data generating process (DGP). The Monte Carlo\nsimulation and then the numerical analysis will be used to interpret the\nresult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 17:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

One possible formation scenario for HJs is\nhigh-eccentricity (high-e) migration, in which the planet forms at much larger\nradii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism, and migrates to its\ncurrent orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider\nhigh-e migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular\nclusters (GCs), in which encounters with passing stars can excite planets to\nthe high eccentricities needed to initiate migration. We study this process via\nMonte Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet system including the\neffects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted\nthree-body code.

The simulated galaxies have more extended morphologies and larger\nsizes when measured using rest-frame optical B-band light than rest-frame UV\nlight; sizes measured from stellar mass surface density are even larger. The UV\nmorphologies are usually dominated by several small, bright young stellar\nclumps that are not always associated with significant stellar mass. The B-band\nlight traces stellar mass better than the UV, but it can also be biased by the\nbright clumps. At all redshifts, galaxy size correlates with stellar\nmass/luminosity with large scatter. The half-light radii range from 0.01 to 0.2\narcsec (0.05-1 kpc physical) at fixed magnitude. At z>5, the size of galaxies\nat fixed stellar mass/luminosity evolves as (1+z)^{-m}, with m~1-2. For\ngalaxies less massive than M_star~10^8 M_sun, the ratio of the half-mass radius\nto the halo virial radius is ~10% and does not evolve significantly at z=5-10;\nthis ratio is typically 1-5% for more massive galaxies. A galaxy's \"observed\"\nsize decreases dramatically at shallower surface brightness limits. This effect\nmay account for the extremely small sizes of z>5 galaxies measured in the\nHubble Frontier Fields. We provide predictions for the cumulative light\ndistribution as a function of surface brightness for typical galaxies at z=6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 04:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

The late-stage planet accretion models typically\nmake arbitrary assumptions about planetesimals and pebbles distribution while\nthe dust evolution models predict that planetesimal formation is only possible\nat some orbital distances. We want to test the importance of water snow line\nfor triggering formation of the first planetesimals during the gas-rich phase\nof protoplanetary disk, when cores of giant planets have to form. We connect\nprescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice\nevaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water\nvapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single,\none-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. We find that processes\ntaking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two\nways. First, due to the change of sticking properties between wet and dry\naggregates, there is a \"traffic jam\" inside of the snow line that slows down\nthe fall of solids onto the star. Second, ice evaporation and outward diffusion\nof water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance of icy pebbles\nthat trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of\nthe snow line. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial\ndrift and thus requires particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a\nfavorable location where planetesimal formation is possible for a wide range of\nconditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This process is\nparticularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and\nincreased initial dust-to-gas ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

A natural idea is that the dynamo mechanism in superflaring\nstars differs in some respect from that in the Sun. We search for a difference\nin the dynamo-related parameters between superflaring stars and the Sun to\nsuggest a dynamo-mechanism as close as possible to the conventional\nsolar/stellar dynamo but capable of providing much higher magnetic energy.\nDynamo based on joint action of differential rotation and mirror asymmetric\nmotions can in principle result in excitation of two types of magnetic fields.\nFirst of all, it is well-known in solar physics dynamo waves. The point is that\nanother magnetic configuration with initial growth and further stabilisation is\nalso possible for excitation. For comparable conditions, magnetic field\nstrength of second configuration is much larger rather of the first one just\nbecause dynamo do not spend its efforts for periodic magnetic field inversions\nbut use its for magnetic field growth. We analysed available data from the\nKepler mission concerning the superflaring stars in order to find tracers of\nanomalous magnetic activity. Starting from the recent paper, we find that\nanti-solar differential rotation or anti-solar sign of the mirror-asymmetry of\nstellar convection can provide the desired strong magnetic field in dynamo\nmodels. We confirm this concept by numerical models of stellar dynamos with\ncorresponding governing parameters. We conclude that the proposed mechanism can\nplausibly explain the superflaring events at least for some cool stars,\nincluding binaries, subgiants and, possibly, low-mass stars and young rapid\nrotators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 18:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Magnetic dilution is shown here to tune the ratio of these magnetic\ninteractions, thus providing deeper insight into this unconventional\nantiferromagnet. Dilution of the Fe^{3+} lattice in Fe3PO4O3 was accomplished\nby substituting non-magnetic Ga^{3+} to form the solid solution series\nFe_{3-x}Ga_xPO4O3 with $x = 0.012, 0.06, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5$.

A continuous decrease of the both the helical pitch length and the\ndomain size is observed with increasing dilution up to at least $x = 0.25$,\nwhile for $x \\ge 0.5$, the compounds lack long range magnetic order entirely.\nThe decrease in the helical pitch length with increasing $x$ can be\nqualitatively understood by reduction of the ratio of $J_2/J_1$ in the\nHeisenberg model, consistent with mean field considerations. Intriguingly, the\nmagnetic correlation length in the $ab$ plane remains nearly equal to the pitch\nlength for each value of $x \\le 0.25$, showing that the two quantities are\nintrinsically connected in this unusual antiferromagnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 19:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

In this paper, we use Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to represent the\nendmember variability. We show, given the GMM starting premise, that the\ndistribution of the mixed pixel (under the linear mixing model) is also a GMM\n(and this is shown from two perspectives). The first perspective originates\nfrom the random variable transformation and gives a conditional density\nfunction of the pixels given the abundances and GMM parameters. With proper\nsmoothness and sparsity prior constraints on the abundances, the conditional\ndensity function leads to a standard maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem which\ncan be solved using generalized expectation maximization. The second\nperspective originates from marginalizing over the endmembers in the GMM, which\nprovides us with a foundation to solve for the endmembers at each pixel. Hence,\nour model can not only estimate the abundances and distribution parameters, but\nalso the distinct endmember set for each pixel. We tested the proposed GMM on\nseveral synthetic and real datasets, and showed its potential by comparing it\nto current popular methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 20:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 21:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We model the interactions in terms of a Stackelberg game, where\ncompanies set their prices and consumers respond by choosing their demands. We\nshow that the underlying game has a unique equilibrium at which the companies\nmaximize their revenues while the consumers maximize their utilities subject to\ntheir local constraints. Closed-form expressions are provided for the optimal\nstrategies of all players. Based on these solutions, a power allocation game\nhas been formulated, which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash\nequilibrium, for which closed-form expressions are also provided. This\nequilibrium is found under the assumption that companies can freely allocate\ntheir power across the time horizon, but we also demonstrate that it is\npossible to relax this assumption. We further provide a fast distributed\nalgorithm for the computation of all optimal strategies using only local\ninformation. We also study the effect of variations in the number of periods\n(subdivisions of the time horizon) and the number of consumers. As a\nconsequence, we are able to find an appropriate company-to-consumer ratio when\nthe number of consumers participating in demand response exceeds some\nthreshold. Furthermore, we show, both analytically and numerically, that the\nmulti-period scheme provides incentives for energy consumers to participate in\ndemand response, compared to the single-period framework studied in the\nliterature.

Precisely, we show that the $L^{p}$ norm (the\nslightly stronger $\\dot{B}^{0}_{p,1}$ one in fact) of global solutions with the\ncritical regularity, decays like $t^{-d(\\frac{1}{p}-\\frac{1}{4})}$ for\n$t\\rightarrow\\infty$. In particular, taking $p=2$ and $d=3$ goes back to the\nclassical time decay $t^{-\\frac{3}{4}}$. We derive new estimates which are used\nto deal with the strong coupling between the magnetic field and fluid dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 06:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

However, there are three main problems\nabout this kind of pooling method. First, the histogram-based pooling method\nbinarizes the feature maps and leads to inevitable discriminative information\nloss. Second, it is difficult to effectively combine other visual cues into a\ncompact representation, because the simple concatenation of various visual cues\nleads to feature representation inefficiency. Third, the dimensionality of\nhistogram-based output grows exponentially with the number of feature maps\nused. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel shallow network\nmodel, named as PCANet-II. Compared with the histogram-based output, the second\norder pooling not only provides more discriminative information by preserving\nboth the magnitude and sign of convolutional responses, but also dramatically\nreduces the size of output features. Thus we combine the second order\nstatistical pooling method with the shallow network, i.e., PCANet. Moreover, it\nis easy to combine other discriminative and robust cues by using the second\norder pooling. So we introduce the binary feature difference encoding scheme\ninto our PCANet-II to further improve robustness.

Much effort has\nbeen devoted to addressing this issue by improving the scalability of\nmultiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as Pareto-based,\ndecomposition-based, and indicator-based approaches. Different from current\nwork, we propose a novel algorithm in this paper called AnD, which consists of\nan angle-based selection strategy and a shift-based density estimation\nstrategy. These two strategies are employed in the environmental selection to\ndelete the poor individuals one by one. Specifically, the former is devised to\nfind a pair of individuals with the minimum vector angle, which means that\nthese two individuals share the most similar search direction. The latter,\nwhich takes both the diversity and convergence into account, is adopted to\ncompare these two individuals and to delete the worse one. AnD has a simple\nstructure, few parameters, and no complicated operators. The performance of AnD\nis compared with that of seven state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary\nalgorithms on a variety of benchmark test problems with up to 15 objectives.\nThe experimental results suggest that AnD can achieve highly competitive\nperformance.

However,\nsince the source and relay simultaneously transmit in FDR, their superimposed\nsignal at the primary receiver should now satisfy the existing interference\nconstraint, which can considerably limit the secondary network throughput. In\nthis regard, relay selection can offer an adequate solution to boost the\nsecondary throughput while satisfying the imposed interference limit.

We\nshow that multiple configurations, parameterised by the minimal distance\nbetween the resonator and the waveguide, can lead to critical coupling.

We use positive operator-valued measures to analyse the dynamics\ngenerated by the ancilla-based measurements. Using this framework we prove that\nspecial observables exist for which measurement backaction is of no concern, so\nthat dynamic correlations of these can be obtained without making use of\nancillas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 12:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 09:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

This suggests\nthat, to forecast the motion of COD images, it is sufficient to forecast the\nflow. The latter, in turn, can be accomplished by fitting a parametric model of\nthe fluid flow to the COD images observed in the past. Namely, the learning\nphase of the algorithm is composed of the following steps: (i) given a sequence\nof COD images, the snapshots of the optical flow are estimated from two\nconsecutive COD images; (ii) these snapshots are then assimilated into a\nNavier-Stokes Equation (NSE), i.e. an initial velocity field for NSE is\nselected so that the corresponding NSE' solution is as close as possible to the\noptical flow snapshots. The prediction phase consists of utilizing a linear\ntransport equation, which describes the propagation of COD images in the fluid\nflow predicted by NSE, to estimate the future motion of the COD images. The\nalgorithm has been tested on COD images provided by two geostationary\noperational environmental satellites from NOAA serving the west-hemisphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 12:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

This wave function obeys the Huygens-Fresnel principle\naccording to which the electron wave scattering by a system of two centers is\naccompanied by generation of two spherical waves; their interaction creates a\ndiffraction pattern far from the target. Each of the Huygens waves, in turn, is\na superposition of the partial spherical waves with different orbital angular\nmomenta l and their projections m. The amplitudes of these partial waves are\ndefined by the corresponding phases of electron elastic scattering by an\nisolated atomic potential.

In $\\gamma$-ray\nspectroscopy, this is accomplished frequently by measuring the intensity of\nfull-energy primary transition peaks and correcting the intensities for\nexperimental artifacts, such as detection efficiencies and angular\ncorrelations. Implicit in this procedure is the assumption that full-energy\npeaks do not overlap with any secondary peaks, escape peaks, or environmental\nbackgrounds. However, for complex $\\gamma$-ray cascades, this is often not the\ncase. Furthermore, this technique is difficult to adapt for coincidence\nspectroscopy, where intensities depend not only on the detection efficiency,\nbut also the detailed decay scheme. We present a method that incorporates the\nintensities of the entire spectrum (e.g., primary and secondary transition\npeaks, escape peaks, Compton continua, etc.) into a statistical model, where\nthe transition intensities and branching ratios can be determined using\nBayesian statistical inference.

However,\nformal mixed-criticality models have traditionally been characterized by two\nimpractical assumptions: once \\textit{any} high-criticality task overruns,\n\\textit{all} low-criticality tasks are suspended and \\textit{all other}\nhigh-criticality tasks are assumed to exhibit high-criticality behaviors at the\nsame time. In this paper, we propose a more realistic mixed-criticality model,\ncalled the flexible mixed-criticality (FMC) model, in which these two issues\nare addressed in a combined manner. In this new model, only the overrun task\nitself is assumed to exhibit high-criticality behavior, while other\nhigh-criticality tasks remain in the same mode as before. The guaranteed\nservice levels of low-criticality tasks are gracefully degraded with the\noverruns of high-criticality tasks. We derive a utilization-based technique to\nanalyze the schedulability of this new mixed-criticality model under EDF-VD\nscheduling. During runtime, the proposed test condition serves an important\ncriterion for dynamic service level tuning, by means of which the maximum\navailable execution budget for low-criticality tasks can be directly determined\nwith minimal overhead while guaranteeing mixed-criticality schedulability.\nExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the FMC scheme compared with\nstate-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 18:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}
