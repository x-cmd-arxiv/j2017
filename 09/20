Popular\ninference algorithms such as belief propagation (BP) and generalized belief\npropagation (GBP) are intimately related to linear programming (LP) relaxation\nwithin the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. Despite the popularity of these algorithms,\nit is well understood that the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy based on\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) can provide superior guarantees. Unfortunately,\nSOS relaxations for a graph with $n$ vertices require solving an SDP with\n$n^{\\Theta(d)}$ variables where $d$ is the degree in the hierarchy.

In this paper, we propose binary SDP relaxations for MAP inference\nusing the SOS hierarchy with two innovations focused on computational\nefficiency. Firstly, in analogy to BP and its variants, we only introduce\ndecision variables corresponding to contiguous regions in the graphical model.\nSecondly, we solve the resulting SDP using a non-convex Burer-Monteiro style\nmethod, and develop a sequential rounding procedure. We demonstrate that the\nresulting algorithm can solve problems with tens of thousands of variables\nwithin minutes, and outperforms BP and GBP on practical problems such as image\ndenoising and Ising spin glasses.

Such topology presents an obstruction to any Wannier representation,\nnamely, the representation of the electronic states in terms of symmetric,\nexponentially localized Wannier functions. Here, we address the converse\nquestion: Do obstructions to Wannier representation imply stable band topology?\nWe answer this in the negative, pointing out that some bands can also display a\ndistinct type of \"fragile topology.\" Bands with fragile topology do not admit\nany Wannier representation by themselves, but such a representation becomes\npossible once certain additional trivial degrees of freedom are supplied. We\nconstruct a physical model of fragile topology on the honeycomb lattice that\nalso helps resolve a recent puzzle in band theory. This model provides a\ncounterexample to the assumption that splitting of an \"elementary band\nrepresentation\" introduced in [Nature 547, 298--305 (2017)] leads to bands that\nare individually topological. Instead, half of the split bands of our model\nrealizes a trivial band with exponentially localized symmetric Wannier\nfunctions, whereas the second half possess fragile topology.

As\nemerged in the recent picture of the top-down multiphase condensation, the hot\ngaseous halos are tightly linked to all other phases in terms of cospatiality\nand thermodynamics. While hot halos (10^7 K) are perturbed by subsonic\nturbulence, warm (10^4 K) ionized and neutral filaments condense out of the\nturbulent eddies. The peaks condense into cold molecular clouds (< 100 K)\nraining in the core via chaotic cold accretion (CCA). We show all phases are\ntightly linked via the ensemble (wide-aperture) velocity dispersion along the\nline of sight. The correlation arises in complementary long-term AGN feedback\nsimulations and high-resolution CCA runs, and is corroborated by the combined\nHitomi and new IFU measurements in Perseus cluster.

PBH\nbinaries were recently suggested as the possible source of LIGO's first\ndetections. In this paper, we thoroughly revisit existing estimates of the\nmerger rate of PBH binaries. We compute the probability distribution of orbital\nparameters for PBH binaries formed in the early Universe, accounting for tidal\ntorquing by all other PBHs, as well as standard large-scale adiabatic\nperturbations. We then check whether the orbital parameters of PBH binaries\nformed in the early Universe can be significantly affected between formation\nand merger. Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and\ninteractions with other PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard\nDM particles, do not do significant work on nor torque PBH binaries. We\nestimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous\ncalculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the\neccentricity of typical PBH binaries. We also revisit the PBH-binary merger\nrate resulting from gravitational capture in present-day halos, accounting for\nPoisson fluctuations. If binaries formed in the early Universe survive to the\npresent time, as suggested by our analytic estimates, they dominate the total\nPBH merger rate. Moreover, this merger rate would be orders of magnitude larger\nthan LIGO's current upper limits if PBHs make a significant fraction of the\ndark matter. As a consequence, LIGO would constrain ~10-300 Msun PBHs to\nconstitute no more than ~1% of the dark matter.

In a previous work, Phys.\nRev. B 95, 205106 (2017), the effect of disorder on this non-Fermi liquid phase\nwas investigated, assuming that the bandstructure was isotropic, assuming that\nthe conduction and valence bands had the same band mass, and assuming that the\ndisorder preserved exact time-reversal symmetry and statistical isotropy. It\nwas shown that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is unstable to disorder, and\nthat a runaway flow to strong disorder occurs. In this work, we extend that\nanalysis by relaxing the assumption of time-reversal symmetry and allowing the\nelectron and hole masses to differ (but continuing to assume isotropy of the\nlow energy bandstructure). We first incorporate time-reversal symmetry breaking\ndisorder, and demonstrate that there do not appear any new fixed points.\nMoreover, while the system continues to flow to strong disorder,\ntime-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder grows asymptotically more slowly than\ntime-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder, which we therefore expect should\ndominate the strong-coupling phase. We then allow for unequal electron and hole\nmasses. We show that whereas asymmetry in the two masses is irrelevant in the\nclean system, it is relevant in the presence of disorder, such that the\n'effective masses' of the conduction and valence bands should become sharply\ndistinct in the low-energy limit. We calculate the RG flow equations for the\ndisordered interacting system with unequal band masses, and demonstrate that\nthe problem exhibits a runaway flow to strong disorder. Along the runaway flow,\ntime-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder grows asymptotically more rapidly\nthan both time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder and the Coulomb interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 18:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 21:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 10:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 18:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

This finally yields a much smaller total error in the spectral\nprojector results. We show that there exists, in principle, a value of the\nspectral cutoff which would completely eliminate discretization effects in the\ntopological susceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 18:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

These stars formed in well-defined starbursts, although accreted stars\nexhibit sharper and earlier ones. The fraction of accreted stars increases with\ngalactocentric distance, so that at a radius of ~8-10 kpc a fraction of ~40 per\ncent, on average, are detected. Accreted stars are slightly younger, lower\nmetallicity, and more $\\alpha$-enhanced than in situ stars.

The present study extends the\ntheory for estimating CME to ensemble DA methods with domain localization. The\ndomain-localized CME (DL-CME) developed herein is tested for model selection\nwith two models: (i) the Lorenz 40-variable mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics\nmodel (L95); and (ii) the simplified global atmospheric SPEEDY model. The CME\nis compared to the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) as a metric for model\nselection. The experiments show that CME improves systematically over the RMSE,\nand that this skill improvement is further enhanced by applying localization in\nthe estimate of the CME, using the DL-CME. The potential use and range of\napplications of the CME and DL-CME as a model selection metric are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 20:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 12:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

This paper studies learning node\nrepresentations for networks with multiple views, which aims to infer robust\nnode representations across different views. We propose a multi-view\nrepresentation learning approach, which promotes the collaboration of different\nviews and lets them vote for the robust representations. During the voting\nprocess, an attention mechanism is introduced, which enables each node to focus\non the most informative views. Experimental results on real-world networks show\nthat the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for\nnetwork representation learning with a single view and other competitive\napproaches with multiple views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 20:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

Two results substantially undermined the credibility of\nnon-linear theories.

However, these results are unconvincing because they overlook\nthe fact that the distribution of measurement results predicted by non-linear\nquantum mechanics depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that one\nuses. For instance, although the Everett and Copenhagen interpretations agree\non the expression of Born's rule for the outcomes of multiple measurements in\nlinear quantum mechanics, they disagree in non-linear quantum mechanics. We\npresent the range of expressions of Born's rule that can be obtained by\napplying different formulations of quantum mechanics to a class of non-linear\nquantum theories.

In Phase I (coarse), we place a red calibration marker on\nthe end effector and let it randomly move through a set of open-loop\ntrajectories to obtain a large sample set of camera pixels and internal robot\nend-effector configurations. This coarse data is then used to train a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) to learn the coarse transformation bias.

The proposed relational semantics is a uniform\nframework in which also IEL can be modeled. Verification-based intuitionistic\nknowledge formalized in IEL turns out to be a special case of the kind of\nknowledge described by our S5-style systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 23:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 03:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 23:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The sparsity in the angular\ndomain is exploited as a key property to enable the unambiguous blind\nseparation between user's channels. The main advantage of this approach is the\nfact that the overhead due to pilot sequences can be dramatically reduced\nespecially when operating at low SNR per antenna. In addition, as sparsity is\nthe only assumption made about the channel, the proposed method is robust with\nrespect to the statistical properties of the channel and data and allows the\nchannel estimation and the separation of interfering users from adjacent base\nstations to be performed in rapidly time-varying scenarios.

These traits, present\nin most of contemporary metropolis, complicate the definition of cities, a\ncrucial issue considering that objective and comparable metrics are the basic\ninputs needed for the planning and design of sustainable urban environments. In\nthis context, city definitions that respond to administrative or political\ncriteria usually overlook human dynamics, a key factor that could help to make\ncities comparable across the urban fabric of diverse social, cultural and\neconomic realities. Using a technique based on the spectral analysis of complex\nnetworks, we rank places in 11 of the major Chilean urban regions from a\nhigh-resolution human mobility dataset: Official origin-destination (OD)\nsurveys. We propose a method for further distinguishing urban and rural\nland-uses within these regions, by means of a network centrality measure from\nwhich we construct a spectre of geographic places. This spectre, constructed\nfrom the ranking of locations as measured by their approximate number of\nembedded human flows, allows us to probe several urban boundaries. From the\nanalysis of the urban scaling exponent of trips in relation to the population\nacross these city delineations, we identify two clearly distinct scaling\nregimes occurring in urban and rural areas. The comparison of our results with\nland cover derived from remote sensing suggests that, for the case of trips,\nthe scaling exponent in urban areas is close to linear. We conclude with\nestimations for well-formed cities in the Chilean urban system, which according\nto our analysis could emerge from clusters composed by places that capture at\nleast ~138 trips (over the expectation) of the underlying mobility network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 03:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

Due to the large volume and high velocity of these streams, it is\noften more practical to incrementally build a lossy-compressed version of the\ngraph, and use this lossy version to approximately evaluate graph queries.\nChallenges arise when the queries are unknown in advance but are associated\nwith filtering predicates based on edge labels.

This method can be attacked by several\nsteganalysis methods, because it detectably changes statistical and perceptual\ncharacteristics of the cover signal. A typical method for steganalysis of the\nLSB substitution is the histogram attack that attempts to diagnose anomalies in\nthe cover image's histogram. A well-known method to stand the histogram attack\nis the LSB+ steganography that intentionally embeds some extra bits to make the\nhistogram look natural. However, the LSB+ method still affects the perceptual\nand statistical characteristics of the cover signal. In this paper, we propose\na new method for image steganography, called LSB++, which improves over the\nLSB+ image steganography by decreasing the amount of changes made to the\nperceptual and statistical attributes of the cover image. We identify some\nsensitive pixels affecting the signal characteristics, and then lock and keep\nthem from the extra bit embedding process of the LSB+ method, by introducing a\nnew embedding key.

To this end, this paper proposes a Quality Enhancement\nConvolutional Neural Network (QE-CNN) method that does not require any\nmodification of the encoder to achieve quality enhancement for HEVC. In\nparticular, our QE-CNN method learns QE-CNN-I and QE-CNN-P models to reduce the\ndistortion of HEVC I and P frames, respectively. The proposed method differs\nfrom the existing CNN-based quality enhancement approaches, which only handle\nintra-coding distortion and are thus not suitable for P frames. Our\nexperimental results validate that our QE-CNN method is effective in enhancing\nquality for both I and P frames of HEVC videos. To apply our QE-CNN method in\ntime-constrained scenarios, we further propose a Time-constrained Quality\nEnhancement Optimization (TQEO) scheme. Our TQEO scheme controls the\ncomputational time of QE-CNN to meet a target, meanwhile maximizing the quality\nenhancement. Next, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour TQEO scheme from the aspects of time control accuracy and quality\nenhancement under different time constraints.

The MCF allows us\nto estimate the expected value of a metric over time, which for example may be\nthe number of game sessions, number of purchases, total playtime and lifetime\nvalue. Furthermore, the popular retention rate metric is the derivative of this\nestimate applied to the expected number of distinct days played.

Unlike existing graph\nvisualization tools where vertices of a graph may be clustered into a smaller\ncollection of super/virtual vertices, VCExplorer displays a small number of\nactual source graph vertices (called hubs) and summaries of the information\nbetween these vertices. We refer to such a graph as a HA-graph (Hub-based\nAggregation Graph). This allows users to appreciate the relationship between\nthe hubs, rather than super/virtual vertices. Users can navigate through the\nHA- graph by \"drilling down\" into the summaries between hubs to display more\nhubs. We illustrate how the graph aggregation techniques can be integrated into\nthe exploring framework as the consolidated information to users. In addition,\nwe propose efficient graph aggregation algorithms over multiple subgraphs via\ncomputation sharing.

Measured fluxes\nare primarily sensitive to the objects' diameters, but deriving precise sizes\nis somewhat hampered by the uncertain effective emissivity at these\nwavelengths. Following Brown and Butler (2017) who presented ALMA data for four\nbinary TNOs, we report ALMA 1.29 mm measurements of four Centaurs (2002\nGZ$_{32}$, Bienor, Chiron, Chariklo) and two TNOs (Huya and Makemake), sampling\na range of size, albedo and composition. These thermal fluxes are combined with\nmid/far-infrared fluxes to derive the relative emissivity at radio (mm/submm)\nwavelengths, using NEATM and thermophysical models. We reassess earlier thermal\nmeasurements of these and other objects -- including Pluto/Charon and Varuna --\nexploring effects due to non-spherical shape and varying apparent pole\norientation, and show that those can be key for reconciling previous diameter\ndeterminations and correctly estimating the spectral emissivities. We also\nevaluate the possible contribution to thermal fluxes of established (Chariklo)\nor claimed (Chiron) ring systems. As a general conclusion, all the objects,\nexcept Makemake, have radio emissivities significantly lower than unity.\nAlthough the emissivity values show diversity, we do not find any significant\ntrend with physical parameters such as diameter, composition, beaming factor,\nalbedo, or color, but we suggest that the emissivity could be correlated with\ngrain size.

To fulfill this promise, current and future 21-cm\nexperiments need to detect this weak EoR signal in the presence of foregrounds\nthat are several orders of magnitude larger.

We\npropose a new imaging method based on a maximum likelihood framework which\nsolves for the interferometric equation directly on the sphere, or equivalently\nin the $uvw$-domain. The method uses the one-to-one relation between spherical\nwaves and spherical harmonics (SpH). It consistently handles signals from the\nentire sky, and does not require a $w$-term correction. The spherical-harmonics\ncoefficients represent the sky-brightness distribution and the visibilities in\nthe $uvw$-domain, and provide a direct estimate of the spatial power spectrum.\nUsing these spectrally-smooth SpH coefficients, bright foregrounds can be\nremoved from the signal, including their side-lobe noise, which is one of the\nlimiting factors in high dynamics range wide-field imaging.

Pattern-based approaches of temporal pattern\nmining can be exploited to detect and characterize changes exhibited by a\nnetwork over the time, starting from observed snapshots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 08:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

The data\nwere obtained with the GRIS instrument installed at the German GREGOR\ntelescope. A point spread function (PSF) was constructed using prior Mercury\nobservations with GRIS and the information provided by the adaptive optics\nsystem of the GREGOR telescope. The data were then deconvolved from the PSF\nusing a principal component analysis deconvolution method and were analyzed via\nthe NICOLE inversion code. The Si i 1082.7 nm line seems to be in emission in\nthe umbra of the observed sunspot after the effects of scattered light are\nremoved. We show how the spectral line shape of umbral profiles changes\ndramatically with the amount of scattered light. Indeed, the continuum levels\nrange, on average, from 44% of the quiet Sun continuum intensity to about 20%.\nThe inferred levels are in line with current model predictions and empirical\numbral models. Current umbral empirical models are not able to reproduce the\nemission in the deconvolved umbral Stokes profiles. The results of the NLTE\ninversions suggests that to obtain the emission in the Si i 1082.7 nm line, the\ntemperature stratification should first have a hump located at about log tau -2\nand start rising at lower heights when moving into the transition region. This\nis, to our knowledge, the first time the Si i 1082.7 nm line is seen in\nemission in sunspot umbrae. The results show that the temperature\nstratification of current umbral models may be more complex than expected with\nthe transition region located at lower heights above sunspot umbrae. Our\nfinding might provide insights into understanding why the sunspot umbra\nemission in the millimeter spectral range is less than that predicted by\ncurrent empirical umbral models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 08:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

In the present study, we report our direct observation that\nlarge-scale motion is generated by an instability of an `amplified' streaky\nmotion in the outer region (i.e. very-large-scale motion). We design a\nnumerical experiment in turbulent channel flow up to $Re_\\tau\\simeq 2000$ where\na streamwise-uniform streaky motion is artificially driven by body forcing in\nthe outer region computed from the previous linear theory (Hwang \\& Cossu, J.\nFluid Mech., vol. 664, 2015, pp. 51--73). As the forcing amplitude is\nincreased, it is found that an energetic streamwise vortical structure emerges\nat a streamwise wavelength of $\\lambda_x/h\\simeq 1-5$ ($h$ is the half-height\nof the channel). The application of dynamic mode decomposition and the\nexamination of turbulence statistics reveal that this structure is a\nconsequence of the sinuous-mode instability of the streak, a sub-process of the\nself-sustaining mechanism of the large-scale outer structures. It is also found\nthat the statistical features of the vortical structure are remarkably similar\nto those of the large-scale motion in the outer region. Finally, it is proposed\nthat the largest streamwise length of the streak instability determines the\nstreamwise length scale of very-large-scale motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

The theory is based on the use\nof 3-D kinematical conservation laws (KCL), which govern the evolution of a\nsurface in general and a shock front in particular. The 3-D KCL, derived purely\non geometrical considerations, form an under-determined system of conservation\nlaws. In the present paper the 3-D KCL system is closed by using two\nappropriately truncated transport equations from an infinite hierarchy of\ncompatibility conditions along shock rays. The resulting governing equations of\nthis KCL based 3-D shock ray theory, leads to a weakly hyperbolic system of\neight conservation laws with three divergence-free constraints. The\nconservation laws are solved using a Godunov-type central finite volume scheme,\nwith a constrained transport technique to enforce the constraints. The results\nof extensive numerical simulations reveal several physically realistic\ngeometrical features of shock fronts and the complex structures of kink lines\nformed on them. A comparison of the results with those of a weakly nonlinear\nwavefront shows that a weak shock front and a weakly nonlinear wavefront are\ntopologically same. The major important differences between the two are\nhighlighted in the contexts of corrugational stability and converging shock\nfronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

The correlations are expressed in terms of\nassociated charged-hadron yields per J/$\\psi$ trigger. A rapidity gap of at\nleast 1.5 units is required between the trigger J/$\\psi$ and the associated\ncharged hadrons.

Inversions of the spectra were carried out using\nNICOLE. We identified three brightenings of sizes up to 2\"x2\".

However, this MF shared some common properties\nwith flaring active-region fibrils or flaring arch filaments (FAFs): (1) FAFs\nand MFs are both apparent in chromospheric and coronal layers according to the\nAIA channels, and (2) both show flaring arches with lifetimes of about 3.0-3.5\nmin and lengths of about 20\".

During the first\nGyr after the Big Bang, it is widely believed that there was not enough time to\nform AGB stars in high numbers, so that the dust at this epoch is expected to\nbe purely from SNe, or subsequent grain growth in the ISM. The time period\ncorresponding to z ~5-6 is thus expected to display the transition from SN-only\ndust to a mixture of both formation channels as we know it today. Here we aim\nto use afterglow observations of GRBs at redshifts larger than $z > 4$ in order\nto derive host galaxy dust column densities along their line-of-sight and to\ntest if a SN-type dust extinction curve is required for some of the bursts. GRB\nafterglow observations were performed with the 7-channel GROND Detector at the\n2.2m MPI telescope in La Silla, Chile and combined with data gathered with XRT.\nWe increase the number of measured $A_V$ values for GRBs at z > 4 by a factor\nof ~2-3 and find that, in contrast to samples at mostly lower redshift, all of\nthe GRB afterglows have a visual extinction of $A_V$ < 0.5 mag. Analysis of the\nGROND detection thresholds and results from a Monte-Carlo simulation show that,\nalthough we partly suffer from an observational bias against highly\nextinguished sight-lines, GRB host galaxies at 4 < z < 6 seem to contain on\naverage less dust than at z ~ 2. Additionally, we find that all of the GRBs can\nbe modeled with locally measured extinction curves and that the SN-like dust\nextinction curve provides a better fit for only two of the afterglow SEDs. For\nthe first time we also report a photometric redshift of $z = 7.88$ for GRB\n100905A, making it one of the most distant GRBs known to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 13:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 00:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Our objective\nis a general system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in\nEMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial diagnosis, and\ntreatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient.\nMethods: We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and\nconstructed an EMR-based medical knowledge network (EMKN), in which nodes are\nentities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record. Three\nbipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each\ntask. One part of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and\nthe other was the condition to be inferred (e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was\nregarded as a Markov random field to support the inference. Three lazy energy\nfunctions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two\nknowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a\ndistributed representation of medical entities. Three measures were utilized\nfor performance evaluation. Results: On the initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of\nthe test records identified at least one correct disease from top 10\ncandidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%,\nrespectively. These results altogether indicate that the proposed system\noutperformed the baseline methods.

However, accurate and rapid computations of the hydrodynamic\ninteractions between suspended, microscopic components in a soft material is a\nsignificant computational challenge. Here, we present a new method for Brownian\nDynamics simulations of suspended colloidal scale particles subject to an\nimportant class of hydrodynamic constraints with practically linear scaling of\nthe computational cost with the number of particles modeled. Specifically, we\nconsider the \"stresslet\" constraint for which suspended particles resist local\ndeformation. The presented method is an extension of the recently reported\npositively-split formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa\n(RPY) mobility tensor to higher order (dipole) terms in the hydrodynamic\nscattering series [Andrew M. Fiore et al. The Journal of Chemical Physics,\n146(12):124116, 2017]. The hydrodynamic mobility tensor, which is proportional\nto the covariance of particle Brownian displacements, is constructed as an\nEwald sum in a novel way that guarantees the real-space and wave-space sums are\nindependently positive-definite for all possible particle configurations. This\nproperty is leveraged to rapidly sample the Brownian displacements from a\nsuperposition of statistically independent processes with the wave-space and\nreal-space contributions as respective covariances. The cost of computing the\nBrownian displacements in this way is comparable to the cost of computing the\ndeterministic displacements. Addition of a stresslet constraint to the\nover-damped particle equations of motion leads to a stochastic differential\nalgebraic equation (SDAE) of index 1, which is integrated in time using a\nmid-point integration scheme that implicitly produces displacements consistent\nwith the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the constrained system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We provide theoretical results for this problem that motivate natural\nimprovements to recent heuristics.\n  The edge sign prediction problem is related to correlation clustering; a\npositive relationship means being in the same cluster. We consider the\nfollowing model for two clusters: we are allowed to query any pair of nodes\nwhether they belong to the same cluster or not, but the answer to the query is\ncorrupted with some probability $0<q<\\frac{1}{2}$.

To investigate the phenomenon of shape\ncoexistence the RMF calculations are performed within three possible solutions\ni.e. prolate, oblate and spherical configurations. To get a better\nvisualization of nucleon and total matter distribution, two-dimensional contour\nrepresentation of density distribution for $^{291}$119 and $^{303}$119 has been\nmade.

However,\nsevere interference is the major obstacle in UDN. Most of the contributions\ndeal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This paper\nadvocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDN, thanks\nto the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN,\ncentralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission.\nWe summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs.

We investigate this requirement by only relying on\npartial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the\nestimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot\nallocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising\nresearch directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with\nspecial emphasis on the application of the `big data' techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

The classical theory\nof rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic elasticity of\nnetworks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The kinetic theories\nfor vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect experimental measurements\nall indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates is made of polymer strands\nwith a random distribution of length. The polydispersity in strand length is\nexpected to control the mechanical strength of rubber as the overloaded short\nstrands break at small deformations and transfer the load to the longer\nstrands. The purpose of this contribution is to present a simple theory of\nrubber mechanics which takes into account the length distribution of strands\nand its effect on the onset of bulk failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Technically, a general rule-based filter parsing method is\nfist adopted to extract effective information from the original floor plan.\nThen, an image-processing based recovery method is employed to correct\ninformation extracted in the first step.

This two-terminal device is the\nmechanical analogue of the capacitor in a force-current/velocity-voltage\nanalogy. The paper shows that all frequency-response functions that exhibit\nsingularities along the real frequency axis need to be enhanced with the\naddition of a Dirac delta function or with its derivative depending on the\nstrength of the singularity. In this way the real and imaginary parts of the\nenhanced frequency response functions are Hilbert pairs; therefore, yielding a\ncausal time-response function in the time domain. The integral representation\nof the output signals offers an attractive computational alternative given that\nthe constitutive equations of the three-parameter networks examined herein\ninvolve the third derivative of the nodal displacement which may challenge the\nnumerical accuracy of a state-space formulation when the input signal is only\navailable in digital form as in the case of recorded seismic accelerograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 19:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}
