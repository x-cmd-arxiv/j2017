Key technical challenges for their\ndeployment include the presence of limited-resolution front ends and the\nacquisition of channel state information (CSI) at the BSs. This paper\ninvestigates the use of FD-MIMO BSs to provide simultaneously high-rate data\ncommunication and mobile 3D positioning in the downlink. The analysis\nconcentrates on the problem of beamforming design by accounting for imperfect\nCSI acquisition via Time Division Duplex (TDD)-based training and for the\nfinite resolution of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog\nconverter (DAC) at the BSs. Both \\textit{unstructured beamforming} and a\nlow-complexity \\textit{Kronecker beamforming} solution are considered, where\nfor the latter the beamforming vectors are decomposed into separate azimuth and\nelevation components. The proposed algorithmic solutions are based on Bussgang\ntheorem, rank-relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods.\nComprehensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can\neffectively cater to both data communication and positioning services,\nproviding only minor performance degradations as compared to the more\nconventional cases in which either function is implemented. Moreover, the\nproposed low-complexity Kronecker beamforming solutions are seen to guarantee a\nlimited performance loss in the presence of a large number of BS antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2017 16:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Intuitively, if the UAV flies closer to the\nGT, the uplink transmission energy of the GT required to send the target data\ncan be more reduced. However, such UAV movement may consume more propulsion\nenergy of the UAV, which needs to be properly controlled to save its limited\non-board energy. As a result, the transmission energy reduction of the GT is\ngenerally at the cost of higher propulsion energy consumption of the UAV, which\nleads to a new fundamental energy trade-off in Ground-to-UAV (G2U) wireless\ncommunication. To characterize this trade-off, we consider two practical UAV\ntrajectories, namely circular flight and straight flight.

It is based on an antenna-coupled\nsuperconducting micro-bridge embedded in a high-quality factor superconducting\nresonator for a microwave bias and readout with frequency-division multiplexing\nin the GHz range. The micro-bridge is kept below its critical temperature and\nbiased with a microwave current of slightly lower amplitude than the critical\ncurrent of the micro-bridge. The response of the detector is the rate of\nsuperconducting fluctuations, which depends exponentially on the concentration\nof quasiparticles in the micro-bridge. Excess quasiparticles are generated by\nan incident THz signal. Since the quasiparticle lifetime increases\nexponentially at lower operation temperature, the noise equivalent power\nrapidly decreases. This approach allows for large arrays of noise bolometers\noperating above 1 K with sensitivity, limited by 300-K background noise.\nMoreover, the response of the bolometer always dominates the noise of the\nreadout due to relatively large amplitude of the bias current.

A\ndistributed optimization method typically consists of two key components:\ncommunication and computation. More specifically, at every iteration (or every\nseveral iterations) of a distributed algorithm, each node in the network\nrequires some form of information exchange with its neighboring nodes\n(communication) and the computation step related to a (sub)-gradient\n(computation). The standard way of judging an algorithm via only the number of\niterations overlooks the complexity associated with each iteration. Moreover,\nvarious applications deploying distributed methods may prefer a different\ncomposition of communication and computation.\n  Motivated by this discrepancy, in this work we propose an adaptive cost\nframework which adjusts the cost measure depending on the features of various\napplications. We present a flexible algorithmic framework, where communication\nand computation steps are explicitly decomposed to enable algorithm\ncustomization for various applications. We apply this framework to the\nwell-known distributed gradient descent (DGD) method, and show that the\nresulting customized algorithms, which we call DGD$^t$, NEAR-DGD$^t$ and\nNEAR-DGD$^+$, compare favorably to their base algorithms, both theoretically\nand empirically. The proposed NEAR-DGD$^+$ algorithm is an exact first-order\nmethod where the communication and computation steps are nested, and when the\nnumber of communication steps is adaptively increased, the method converges to\nthe optimal solution. We test the performance and illustrate the flexibility of\nthe methods, as well as practical variants, on quadratic functions and\nclassification problems that arise in machine learning, in terms of iterations,\ngradient evaluations, communications and the proposed cost framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2017 20:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 15:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 20:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

The Solovay-Kitaev\nTheorem is a well-known theorem that guarantees the existence of a finite\nsequence of 1-qubit quantum gates approximating an arbitrary unitary matrix in\n$SU(2)$ within specified accuracy $\\varepsilon > 0$. In this note we study a\nquantitative description of this theorem in the following sense. We will work\nwith a universal gate set $T$, a subset of $SU(2)$ such that the group\ngenerated by the elements of $T$ is dense in $SU(2)$. For $\\varepsilon > 0$\nsmall enough, we define $t_{\\varepsilon}$ as the minimum reduced word length\nsuch that every point of $SU(2)$ lies within a ball of radius $\\varepsilon$\ncentered at the points in the dense subgroup generated by $T$.

This framework includes randomized methods with uniform, non-uniform\nor even adaptive sampling strategies, as well as deterministic methods with\nbatch, greedy or cyclic selection rules. Second, the theory of strongly-convex\noptimization was recently generalized to a specific class of non-convex\nfunctions satisfying the so-called Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz condition. To mirror\nthis generalization in the weakly convex case, we introduce the Weak\nPolyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz condition, using which we give global convergence\nguarantees for a class of non-convex functions previously not considered in\ntheory. Additionally, we establish (necessarily somewhat weaker) convergence\nguarantees for an even larger class of non-convex functions satisfying a\ncertain smoothness assumption only. By combining the two abovementioned\ngeneralizations we recover the state-of-the-art convergence guarantees for a\nlarge class of previously known methods and setups as special cases of our\ngeneral framework.

The flexibility of our approach offers a\nlot of potential for future research, as a new block selection procedure will\nhave a convergence guarantee for all objectives considered in our framework,\nwhile a new objective analyzed under our approach will have a whole fleet of\nblock selection rules with convergence guarantees readily available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2017 22:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Different\nmethods have been proposed to satisfy the tradeoff between imperceptibility and\nrobustness as two important characteristics in watermarking while maintaining\nproper data-embedding capacity. Many watermarking methods use image independent\nset of parameters. Different images possess different potentials for robust and\ntransparent hosting of watermark data. To overcome this deficiency, in this\npaper we have proposed a new hierarchical adaptive watermarking framework. At\nthe higher level of hierarchy, complexity of an image is ranked in comparison\nwith complexities of images of a dataset. For a typical dataset of images, the\nstatistical distribution of block complexities is found. At the lower level of\nthe hierarchy, for a single cover image that is to be watermarked, complexities\nof blocks can be found. Local complexity variation (LCV) among a block and its\nneighbors is used to adaptively control the watermark strength factor of each\nblock. Such local complexity analysis creates an adaptive embedding scheme,\nwhich results in higher transparency by reducing blockiness effects. This two\nlevel hierarchy has enabled our method to take advantage of all image blocks to\nelevate the embedding capacity while preserving imperceptibility. For testing\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework, contourlet transform (CT) in\nconjunction with discrete cosine transform (DCT) is used to embed pseudo-random\nbinary sequences as watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed\nframework elevates the performance the watermarking routine in terms of both\nrobustness and transparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 00:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Through empirical evidence, both models have been proven to be\neffective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks such as natural language\nprocessing (Wen et al., 2015), speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2015), and\ntext classification (Yang et al., 2016). Conventionally, like most neural\nnetworks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function\nas its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function\nfor computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by\nintroducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax\nin the final output layer of a GRU model. Furthermore, the cross-entropy\nfunction shall be replaced with a margin-based function. While there have been\nsimilar studies (Alalshekmubarak & Smith, 2013; Tang, 2013), this proposal is\nprimarily intended for binary classification on intrusion detection using the\n2013 network traffic data from the honeypot systems of Kyoto University.\nResults show that the GRU-SVM model performs relatively higher than the\nconventional GRU-Softmax model. The proposed model reached a training accuracy\nof ~81.54% and a testing accuracy of ~84.15%, while the latter was able to\nreach a training accuracy of ~63.07% and a testing accuracy of ~70.75%. In\naddition, the juxtaposition of these two final output layers indicate that the\nSVM would outperform Softmax in prediction time - a theoretical implication\nwhich was supported by the actual training and testing time in the study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 10:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 10:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 07:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 02:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 18:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 06:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

Aims: For the first time, we study the chemical\ncomposition of several Cepheids located in the same populous cluster: NGC 1866,\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To also investigate the chemical\ncomposition of Cepheids at lower metallicity, four targets are located in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC).

Methods:\nWe use canonical spectroscopic analysis to determine the chemical composition\nof Cepheids and provide abundances for a good number of $\\alpha$, iron-peak and\nneutron-capture elements. Results: We find that six Cepheids in the LMC cluster\nNGC 1866 have a very homogeneous chemical composition, also consistent with red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars in the cluster. Period--age relations that include no\nor average rotation indicate that all the Cepheids in NGC 1866 have a similar\nage and therefore belong to the same stellar population.

We experimentally investigate the dynamic properties of\ndust aggregates by low-speed ($\\lesssim 3.2$ m s$^{-1}$) impacts of solid\nprojectiles. Spherical impactors made of glass, steel, or lead are dropped onto\na dust aggregate of packing fraction $\\phi=0.35$ under vacuum conditions. The\nimpact results in cratering or fragmentation of the dust aggregate, depending\non the impact energy. The crater shape can be approximated by a spherical\nsegment and no ejecta are observed. To understand the underlying physics of\nimpacts into dust aggregates, the motion of the solid projectile is acquired by\na high-speed camera. Using the obtained position data of the impactor, we\nanalyze the drag-force law and dynamic pressure induced by the impact. We find\nthat there are two characteristic strengths. One is defined by the ratio\nbetween impact energy and crater volume and is $\\simeq 120$ kPa. The other\nstrength indicates the fragmentation threshold of dynamic pressure and is\n$\\simeq 10$ kPa. The former characterizes the apparent plastic deformation and\nis consistent with the drag force responsible for impactor deceleration. The\nlatter corresponds to the dynamic tensile strength to create cracks. Using\nthese results, a simple model for the compaction and fragmentation threshold of\ndust aggregates is proposed. In addition, the comparison of drag-force laws for\ndust aggregates and loose granular matter reveals the similarities and\ndifferences between the two materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 15:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 12:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Each framework could deal with some meaning phenomena, but none of\nthem fulfills all requirements proposed by applications. A unified semantic\ntheory characterizing all important language phenomena has both theoretical and\npractical significance; however, although many attempts have been made in\nrecent years, no existing theory has achieved this goal yet.\n  This article introduces a new semantic theory that has the potential to\ncharacterize most of the important meaning phenomena of natural language and to\nfulfill most of the necessary requirements for philosophical analysis and for\nNLP applications. The theory is based on a unified representation of\ninformation, and constructs a kind of mathematical model called cognitive model\nto interpret natural language expressions in a compositional manner. It accepts\nthe empirical assumption of Cognitive Semantics, and overcomes most\nshortcomings of Formal Semantics and of Distributional Semantics. The theory,\nhowever, is not a simple combination of existing theories, but an extensive\ngeneralization of classic logic and Formal Semantics. It inherits nearly all\nadvantages of Formal Semantics, and also provides descriptive contents for\nobjects and events as fine-gram as possible, descriptive contents which\nrepresent the results of human cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Sep 2017 13:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}
