As a result, modern science and business face the problem of learning\nfrom unreliable data sets.\n  In this work, we provide a generic approach that is based on\n\\textit{verification} of only few records of the data set to guarantee high\nquality learning outcomes for various optimization objectives. Our method,\nidentifies small sets of critical records and verifies their validity. We show\nthat many problems only need $\\text{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$ verifications, to\nensure that the output of the computation is at most a factor of $(1 \\pm\n\\varepsilon)$ away from the truth. For any given instance, we provide an\n\\textit{instance optimal} solution that verifies the minimum possible number of\nrecords to approximately certify correctness. Then using this instance optimal\nformulation of the problem we prove our main result: \"every function that\nsatisfies some Lipschitz continuity condition can be certified with a small\nnumber of verifications\". We show that the required Lipschitz continuity\ncondition is satisfied even by some NP-complete problems, which illustrates the\ngenerality and importance of this theorem.\n  In case this certification step fails, an invalid record will be identified.\nRemoving these records and repeating until success, guarantees that the result\nwill be accurate and will depend only on the verified records. Surprisingly, as\nwe show, for several computation tasks more efficient methods are possible.\nThese methods always guarantee that the produced result is not affected by the\ninvalid records, since any invalid record that affects the output will be\ndetected and verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 16:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 00:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation\nbetween a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random\nhash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented\nby $k$ $d$-dimensional embeddings vectors and one $k$ dimensional weight\nvector. The final $d$ dimensional representation of the token is the product of\nthe two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are\nselected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of $B$ embedding vectors. Our\nexperiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies\nconsisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need\nto create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary\npruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings\nexhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular\nembeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters\nneeded by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular\nembedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the\nhashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding, hash\nembeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing\nregular embedding types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 16:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The obtained coarse-scale weak formulation includes two types of\nfine-scale contributions.

The second type consists\nof independent fine-scale terms at element interfaces, which we formulate in\nterms of a new fine-scale \"interface model\". We demonstrate for the\none-dimensional Poisson problem that existing discontinuous Galerkin\nformulations, such as the interior penalty method, can be rederived by choosing\nparticular fine-scale interface models. The multiscale formulation thus opens\nthe door for a new perspective on discontinuous Galerkin methods and their\nnumerical properties.

How to estimate the envelope dimension consistently\nis of substantial interest from both theoretical and practical aspects.\nMoreover, very recent advances in the literature have generalized envelope as a\nmodel-free method, which makes selecting the envelope dimension even more\nchallenging. Likelihood-based approaches such as information criteria and\nlikelihood-ratio tests either cannot be directly applied or have no theoretical\njustification. To address this critical issue of dimension selection, we\npropose two unified approaches -- called FG and 1D selections -- for\ndetermining the envelope dimension that can be applied to any envelope models\nand methods. The two model-free selection approaches are based on the two\ndifferent envelope optimization procedures: the full Grassmannian (FG)\noptimization and the 1D algorithm (Cook and Zhang, 2016), and are shown to be\ncapable of correctly identifying the structural dimension with a probability\ntending to 1 under mild moment conditions as the sample size increases. While\nthe FG selection unifies and generalizes the BIC and modified BIC approaches\nthat existing in the literature, and hence provides the theoretical\njustification of them under weak moment condition and model-free context, the\n1D selection is computationally more stable and efficient in finite sample.\nExtensive simulations and a real data analysis demonstrate the superb\nperformance of our proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 16:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 04:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

Dimensionality reduction can alleviate computational load needed to\nprocess these data, in terms of both computing speed and memory usage. In this\narticle, we present image reconstruction results from highly reduced\nradio-interferometric data, following our previously proposed data\ndimensionality reduction method, $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{sing}}$, based on\nstudying the distribution of the singular values of the measurement operator.\nThis method comprises a simple weighted, subsampled discrete Fourier transform\nof the dirty image.

We reconstruct images from well-calibrated VLA data to showcase the\nrobustness of our proposed method down to very low data sizes in a 'real data'\nsetting. We show through comparisons with the conventional reduction method of\ntime- and frequency-averaging, that our proposed method produces more accurate\nreconstructions while reducing data size much further, and is particularly\nrobust when data sizes are aggressively reduced to low fractions of the image\nsize. $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{sing}}$ can function in a block-wise fashion, and\ncould be used in the future to process incoming data by blocks in real-time,\nthus opening up the possibility of performing 'on-line' imaging as the data are\nbeing acquired.

Even more interesting are fractional\nhelical states which have not been observed before and which open the route for\nthe realization of the generalized para fermions quasiparticles. Possessing non\nabelian exchange statistics, these quasiparticles may serve as building blocks\nin topological quantum computing.

By electrostatic gating of different areas of the\nstructure, counter propagating integer, as well as fractional, edge modes,\nbelonging to Landau levels with opposite spins are formed, rendering the modes\nhelical. We demonstrate that due to spin protection, these helical modes remain\nballistic, without observed mixing for large distances. In addition to the\nformation of helical modes, this new platform can be exploited as a rich\nplayground for an artificial induction of compounded fractional edge modes, as\nwell as construction of interferometers based on chiral edge modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 17:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

It\nappears under quite general circumstances including in bulk materials,\nheterostructures and dynamically driven superconducting states. It is therefore\nimportant to understand the nature of odd-w pairing. We present the properties\nof odd-w pairing in bulk materials, including possible microscopic mechanisms,\ndiscuss definitions of the odd-w superconducting order parameter, and the\nunusual Meissner response of odd-frequency superconductors. Next, we present\nhow odd-w pairing is generated in hybrid structures of nearly any sort and\nfocus on its relation to Andreev bound states, spin polarized Cooper pairs, and\nMajorana states. We overview how odd-w pairing can be applied to\nnon-superconducting systems such as ultracold Fermi gases, Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, and chiral spin-nematics.

Aims: To interpret the observed UV spectra of distant galaxies in\nterms of the dominant radiation field and the physical condition of the\ninterstellar medium. Methods: We construct a large grid of photoionization\nmodels and derive new spectral UV line diagnostics using equivalent widths\n(EWs) of CIII]1909, CIV1549 and the line ratios of CIII], CIV, and HeII1640\nrecombination lines. We apply these diagnostics to a sample of 450\nCIII]-emitting galaxies at z=2-4 previously identified in the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey. Results: We show that the average star-forming galaxy (EW(CIII])~2A) is\nwell described by stellar photoionization from single and binary stars. The\ninferred metallicity and ionization parameter is typically Z=0.3-0.5Zsun and\nlogU=-2.7 to -3, in agreement with earlier works at similar redshifts. The\nmodels also indicate an average age of 50-200Myr since the beginning of the\ncurrent star-formation, and an ionizing photon production rate, xi_ion, of\nlog(xi_ion/[Hz/erg])~25.3-25.4. Among the sources with EW(CIII])=10-20A, ~30%\nare likely dominated by AGNs. Their derived metallicity is low, Z=0.02-0.2Zsun,\nand the ionization parameter higher (logU=-1.7). To explain the average UV\nobservations of the strongest but rarest CIII] emitters (EW(CIII])>20A), we\nfind that stellar photoionization is clearly insufficient. A radiation field\nconsisting of a mix of a young stellar population (log(xi_ion/[Hz/erg])~25.7)\nplus an AGN component is required. Furthermore an enhanced C/O abundance ratio\nis needed for metallicities Z=0.1-0.2Zsun and logU=-1.7 to -1.5.

We measured detailed chemical abundances of 14\nelements in four red giant members, from high-resolution (R=25000) spectra that\nfirmly establish Gaia 1 as an object associated with the thick disk.

However, a\nkey challenge to this mechanism is the insider attack problem: censoring agents\ncan impersonate as benign censored clients in order to obtain (and then block)\nsuch secretly shared circumvention proxies.\n  In this paper, we perform a fundamental study on the problem of insider\nattack on proxy-based circumvention systems.

Here we consider the\ncase of the Einstein-Cartan theory as a prototype of theories with\nnon-propagating torsion. In doing so, we study the properties of Killing\nhorizons in the presence of torsion, establish the notion of local causal\nhorizon in Riemann-Cartan spacetimes, and derive the generalised Raychaudhuri\nequation for this kind of geometries. Then, starting with the entropy that can\nbe associated to these local causal horizons, we derive the Einstein-Cartan\nequation by implementing the Clausius equation. We outline two ways of\nproceeding with the derivation depending on whether we take torsion as a\ngeometric field or as a matter field. In both cases we need to add internal\nentropy production terms to the Clausius equation as the shear and twist cannot\nbe taken to be zero a priori for our setup. This fact implies the necessity of\na non-equilibrium thermodynamics treatment for the local causal horizon.\nFurthermore, it implies that a non-zero twist at the horizon will in general\ncontribute to the Hartle-Hawking tidal heating for black holes with possible\nimplications for future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

To address this question we\ngeneralize traditional local community detection in graphs to the setting of\ndynamic networks. Adopting existing static-network approaches in an\n\"aggregated\" graph of all temporal interactions is not appropriate for the\nproblem as dynamic communities may be short-lived and thus lost when mixing\ninteractions over long periods. Hence, dynamic community mining requires the\ndetection of both the community nodes and an optimal time interval in which\nthey are actively interacting.\n  We propose a filter-and-verify framework for dynamic community detection.

The general enumeration problem is then solved\nby obtaining an explicit eigenvalue decomposition of these operators involving\nelliptic functions. By further restricting the intermediate winding angles of\nthe walks to some open interval, the method can be used to count various\nclasses of walks restricted to cones in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ of opening angles that\nare integer multiples of $\\pi/4$.\n  We present three applications of this main result.

It\naddresses two common problems: 1) computing a sum given arbitrary filter\nconditions and 2) identifying the frequent items or heavy hitters in a data\nset. For the former, the sketch provides unbiased estimates with state of the\nart accuracy. It handles the challenging scenario when the data is\ndisaggregated so that computing the per unit metric of interest requires an\nexpensive aggregation. For example, the metric of interest may be total clicks\nper user while the raw data is a click stream with multiple rows per user. Thus\nthe sketch is suitable for use in a wide range of applications including\ncomputing historical click through rates for ad prediction, reporting user\nmetrics from event streams, and measuring network traffic for IP flows.\n  We prove and empirically show the sketch has good properties for both the\ndisaggregated subset sum estimation and frequent item problems. On i.i.d. data,\nit not only picks out the frequent items but gives strongly consistent\nestimates for the proportion of each frequent item. The resulting sketch\nasymptotically draws a probability proportional to size sample that is optimal\nfor estimating sums over the data. For non i.i.d. data, we show that it\ntypically does much better than random sampling for the frequent item problem\nand never does worse. For subset sum estimation, we show that even for\npathological sequences, the variance is close to that of an optimal sampling\ndesign. Empirically, despite the disadvantage of operating on disaggregated\ndata, our method matches or bests priority sampling, a state of the art method\nfor pre-aggregated data and performs orders of magnitude better on skewed data\ncompared to uniform sampling. We propose extensions to the sketch that allow it\nto be used in combining multiple data sets, in distributed systems, and for\ntime decayed aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 20:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

This paper tests for market efficiency by studying the impact of\nglobal financial crisis of 2008 and the recent Chinese crisis of 2015 on stock\nmarket efficiency in emerging stock markets of China and India. The data for\nlast 20 years was collected from both Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE200) and the\nShanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and divided into four sub-periods, i.e.\nbefore financial crisis period (period-I), during recession (period-II), after\nrecession and before Chinese Crisis (periodIII) and from the start of Chinese\ncrisis till date (period- IV).

The number of\nsuch magnetic white dwarfs known is now some hundreds. Fields range in strength\nfrom a few kG to several hundred MG. Almost all the known magnetic white dwarfs\nhave a mean field modulus >= 1 MG. We are trying to fill a major gap in\nobservational knowledge at the low field limit (<= 200 kG) using circular\nspectro-polarimetry.\n  In this paper we report the discovery and monitoring of strong, periodic\nmagnetic variability in two previously discovered \"super-weak field\" magnetic\nwhite dwarfs, WD2047+372 and WD2359-434. WD2047+372 has a mean longitudinal\nfield that reverses between about -12 and +15 kG, with a period of 0.243 d,\nwhile its mean field modulus appears nearly constant at 60 kG. The observations\ncan be intepreted in terms of a dipolar field tilted with respect to the\nstellar rotation axis. WD2359-434 always shows a weak positive longitudinal\nfield with values between about 0 and +12 kG, varying only weakly with stellar\nrotation, while the mean field modulus varies between about 50 and 100 kG. The\nrotation period is found to be 0.112 d using the variable shape of the Halpha\nline core, consistent with available photometry. The field of this star appears\nto be much more complex than a dipole, and is probably not axisymmetric.\n  Available photometry shows that WD2359-434 is a light variable with an\namplitude of only 0.005 mag, our own photometry shows that if WD2047+372 is\nphotometrically variable, the amplitude is below about 0.01 mag.\n  These are the first models for magnetic white dwarfs with fields below about\n100 kG based on magnetic measurements through the full stellar rotation. They\nreveal two very different magnetic surface configurations, and that, contrary\nto simple ohmic decay theory, WD2359-434 has a much more complex surface field\nthan the much younger WD2047+372.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 01:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The model achieved amazing results\nwhen asked to learn one category of object, such as an animal or a vehicle.\nHowever, the performance dropped when multiple categories were fed into the\nmodel.

Risk is generally higher for digital goods in e-commerce.\nHowever, it differs based on product and its popularity, the offer type\n(packaged game, virtual currency to a game or subscription service), storefront\nand geography. Existing fraud policies and models make decisions independently\nfor each transaction based on transaction attributes, payment velocities, user\ncharacteristics, and other relevant information. However, suspicious\ntransactions may still evade detection and hence we propose a broad learning\napproach leveraging a graph based perspective to uncover relationships among\nsuspicious transactions, i.e., inter-transaction dependency. Our focus is to\ndetect suspicious transactions by capturing common fraudulent behaviors that\nwould not be considered suspicious when being considered in isolation. In this\npaper, we present HitFraud that leverages heterogeneous information networks\nfor collective fraud detection by exploring correlated and fast evolving\nfraudulent behaviors. First, a heterogeneous information network is designed to\nlink entities of interest in the transaction database via different semantics.\nThen, graph based features are efficiently discovered from the network\nexploiting the concept of meta-paths, and decisions on frauds are made\ncollectively on test instances. Experiments on real-world payment transaction\ndata from Electronic Arts demonstrate that the prediction performance is\neffectively boosted by HitFraud with fast convergence where the computation of\nmeta-path based features is largely optimized.

Why and\nhow perovskites break down under light irradiation and what happens at the\natomistic level during the degradation still remains unanswered. In this paper,\nwe revealed the fundamental origin and mechanism for irreversible degradation\nof hybrid perovskite materials from our new experimental results and ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We found that the photo-generated\ncharges trapped along the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystal result in\noxygen-induced irreversible degradation in air even in the absence of moisture.\nThe present result, together with our previous experimental finding on the same\ncritical role of trapped charges in the perovskite degradation under moisture,\nsuggests that the trapped charges are the main culprit in both the oxygen- and\nmoisture-induced degradation of perovskite materials. More detailed roles of\noxygen and water molecules were investigated by tracking the atomic motions of\nthe oxygen- or water-covered CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3) perovskite crystal surface with\ntrapped charges via AIMD simulation. In the first few picoseconds of our\nsimulation, trapped charges start disrupting the crystal structure, leading to\na close-range interaction between oxygen or water molecules and the\ncompositional ions of MAPbI3. We found that there are different degradation\npathways depending on both the polarity of the trapped charge and the kind of\ngas molecule. Especially, the deprotonation of organic cations was\ntheoretically predicted for the first time in the presence of trapped anionic\ncharges and water molecules.

With emergence of memristors in VLSI\ntechnologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds\nits second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance\nlevels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data\nstorage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is\npractically limited due to the device variability and implementation\ncomplexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory\ncell consisting of subcells constructed from a memristor and its resistive\nnetwork. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its\nresistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are\nthen connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The\noutput of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input\nvoltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10\nand 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined\nresistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit,\nthis realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output\nlevels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors.\nSimulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on\nthe issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of\nthe cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 06:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are\nrequired. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the\nmeasurement of the 21 cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21 cm\nobservation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point\nsource foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky\nMurchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground\nis evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large\nsurvey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations\nof the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21 cm signal, we employ a\nnumerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation\nhydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the\nforeground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS even in the so-called\n`EoR window'.

Though FPGAs are not designed to operate at a\nfew Kelvin, it is possible to do so on virtue of the extremely high doping\nlevels found in deep-submicron CMOS technology nodes. First, any PCB component,\nthat does not conform with this requirement, is removed. Both the majority of\ndecoupling capacitor types and voltage regulators are not well behaved at\ncryogenic temperatures, asking for an ad-hoc solution to stabilize the FPGA\nsupply voltage, especially for sensitive applications. Therefore, we have\ndesigned a firmware that enforces a constant power consumption, so as to\nstabilize the supply voltage in the interior of the FPGA chip. The FPGA is\npowered with a supply at several meters distance, causing significant IR drop\nand thus fluctuations on the local supply voltage. To achieve the\nstabilization, the variation in digital logic speed, which directly corresponds\nto changes in supply voltage, is constantly measured and corrected for through\na tunable oscillator farm, implemented on the FPGA. The method is versatile and\nrobust, enabling seamless porting to other FPGA families and configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 08:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Unfortunately, these\nsystems support only restrictive middlebox functionalities, and incur\nprohibitively high overheads due to the complex computations involved over the\nencrypted traffic.\n  This motivated the design of Slick --- a secure middlebox framework for\ndeploying high-performance Network Functions (NFs) on untrusted commodity\nservers.

As a consequence of its proof, it is shown that there are\nno complete sets for these classes. We further extend the previous theorem to\ntargets that are reducible to $\\mathbb{Q}$. These non-structure results\nmotivate the study of further restrictions of the Wadge quasi-order. In our\nsecond main theorem, we introduce a combinatorial property that is shown to\ncharacterize those $F_\\sigma$ sets that are reducible to $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is\napplied to construct a minimal set below $\\mathbb{Q}$ and prove its uniqueness\nup to Wadge equivalence. We finally prove several results concerning gaps and\ncardinal characteristics of the Wadge quasi-order and thereby answer questions\nof Brendle and Geschke.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 10:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Interestingly, some pristine Solar System\nmaterials show enrichments in $^{15}$N with respect to the pre-Solar nebula\nvalue. However, it is not yet clear if, and how, these enrichments are linked\nto the past chemical history, due to the limited number of measurements in\ndense star-forming regions. In this respect, dense cores believed to be\nprecursors of clusters containing also intermediate- and high-mass stars are\nimportant targets, as the Solar System was probably born within a rich stellar\ncluster. In this work, we show the results of IRAM-30m observations of the\nJ=1-0 rotational transition of the molecules HCN and HNC, and their\n$^{15}$N-bearing counterparts, towards 27 intermediate/high-mass dense cores\ndivided in three evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass\nprotostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We have also observed the\nDNC(2-1) rotational transition, in order to search for a relation between the\nisotopic ratios D/H and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N. We derive average $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N\nratios of $359\\pm16$ in HCN and of $438\\pm21$ in HNC, with a dispersion of\nabout 150-200.

This result agrees with what found from N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and\nits isotopologues in the same sources, although the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios\nfrom N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ show a dispersion larger than that in HCN/HNC. Moreover, we\nhave found no correlation between D/H and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N in HNC.

This is consistent with models in which drifting\ndust is concentrated into an isolated annulus of terrestrial planetesimals.\nGravitational scattering during terrestrial planet formation causes radial\nspreading, transporting planetesimals from inside 1-1.5 AU out to the belt.\nSeveral times the total current mass in S-types is implanted, with a preference\nfor the inner main belt. C-types are implanted from the outside, as the giant\nplanets' gas accretion destabilizes nearby planetesimals and injects a fraction\ninto the asteroid belt, preferentially in the outer main belt.

We propose novel optimal radio\nresource allocation (RRA) algorithms under different scenarios with\ndeterministic and probabilistic interference violation limits based on a\nperfect and imperfect availability of cross-link channel state information\n(CSI). In particular, we propose a probabilistic approach to mitigate the total\nimposed interference on the primary service under imperfect cross-link CSI. A\nclosed-form mathematical formulation of the cumulative density function (cdf)\nfor the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is formulated\nto evaluate the resultant average spectral efficiency (ASE). Dual decomposition\nis utilized to obtain sub-optimal solutions for the non-convex optimization\nproblems. Through simulation results, we investigate the achievable performance\nand the impact of parameters uncertainty on the overall system performance.\nFurthermore, we present that the developed RRA algorithms can considerably\nimprove the cognitive performance whilst abide the imposed power constraints.\nIn particular, the performance under imperfect cross-link CSI knowledge for the\nproposed `probabilistic case' is compared to the conventional scenarios to show\nthe potential gain in employing this scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 10:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

In the first part of the paper we consider cosmological evolution of\nspaces being the product of two isotropic and spatially curved subspaces. It is\ndemonstrated that the dynamics in $D=2$ (the number of extra dimensions) and $D\n\\geqslant 3$ is different. It was already known that for the $\\Lambda$-term\ncase there is a regime with \"stabilization\" of extra dimensions, where the\nexpansion rate of the three-dimensional subspace as well as the scale factor\n(the \"size\") associated with extra dimensions reach constant value. This regime\nis achieved if the curvature of the extra dimensions is negative. We\ndemonstrate that it take place only if the number of extra dimensions is $D\n\\geqslant 3$. In the second part of the paper we study the influence of initial\nanisotropy. Our study reveals that the transition from Gauss-Bonnet Kasner\nregime to anisotropic exponential expansion (with expanding three and\ncontracting extra dimensions) is stable with respect to breaking the symmetry\nwithin both three- and extra-dimensional subspaces. However, the details of the\ndynamics in $D=2$ and $D \\geqslant 3$ are different. Combining the two\ndescribed affects allows us to construct a scenario in $D \\geqslant 3$, where\nisotropisation of outer and inner subspaces is reached dynamically from rather\ngeneral anisotropic initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 11:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

One\npossibility for Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) searches is to look for\nenergy-dependent delays in the arrival time of very high energy (VHE) photons\ncoming from distant sources such as TeV emitting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),\nmainly blazars. Up to now, observations of flaring AGN have only provided upper\nlimits on LIV energy scale since no significant time-delay was found and\nconfirmed. However, AGN are not perfect sources for such LIV searches because\nintrinsic temporal effects can be produced by emission processes, similarly to\nwhat has been observed with gamma-ray bursts. With the beginning of the\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) operations in the coming decade, significant\nlags should be measured and the question of the origin of these lags will\narise. In particular, propagation effects (LIV) will have to be disentangled\nfrom source-intrinsic effects. A precise time-dependent modeling of blazar\nflares becomes necessary to understand the different origins of these\ntime-delays.

As systems face\ntransactions of inherently different types, ranging from point updates to long\nrunning analytical computations, it is hard to satisfy their individual\nrequirements with a single processing component. Unfortunately, most systems\nnowadays rely on such a single component that implements its parallelism using\nmulti-version concurrency control (MVCC). While MVCC parallelizes short-running\nOLTP transactions very well, it struggles in the presence of mixed workloads\ncontaining long-running scan-centric OLAP queries, as scans have to work their\nway through large amounts of versioned data. To overcome this problem, we\npropose a system, which reintroduces the concept of heterogeneous transaction\nprocessing: OLAP transactions are outsourced to run on separate (virtual)\nsnapshots while OLTP transactions run on the most recent representation of the\ndatabase. Inside both components, MVCC ensures a high degree of concurrency.\nThe biggest challenge of such a heterogeneous approach is to generate the\nsnapshots at a high frequency. Previous approaches heavily suffered from the\ntremendous cost of snapshot creation. In our system, we overcome the\nrestrictions of the OS by introducing a custom system call vm_snapshot, that is\nhand-tailored to our precise needs: it allows fine-granular snapshot creation\nat very high frequencies, rendering the snapshot creation phase orders of\nmagnitudes faster than state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental evaluation\non a heterogeneous workload based on TPC-H transactions and handcrafted OLTP\ntransactions shows that our system enables significantly higher analytical\ntransaction throughputs on mixed workloads than homogeneous approaches. In this\nsense, we introduce a system that accelerates Analytical processing by\nintroducing custom Kernel functionalities: AnKerDB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Laflamme showed that 5 qubits\nare necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model,\nfour different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states\nare orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a\nmeasurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary\ntransformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a\nmeasurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we\nshow that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system\nmap to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error\nwithout perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the\npossible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one\nqubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a\nconsequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single\nerror. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in\na non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an $n$-qubit\nnon-maximally entangled state of the form $a|0>^{n} + b|1>^{n}$, it is always\npossible to correct a single error with fewer than $5n$ qubits, in fact only\n$3n+2$ qubits suffice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 06:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

In all these settings the presence of\nmultiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often\nleads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with\nOpponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the\nanticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning\nrule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the\nanticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the\nencounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and\ntherefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent\nlearning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared\nto a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order\ngradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents\nconverge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA\nagents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning\nalgorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the\nIPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using\nan extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for\nmodel-free RL. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and\nnonlinear function approximators. We apply LOLA to a grid world task with an\nembedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By\nexplicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to\ncooperate out of self-interest.

Based on this\nfact, we propose a novel and flexible neural network binarization method by\nintroducing the concept of layer-wise priority which binarizes parameters in\ninverse order of their layer depth. In each training step, our method selects a\nspecific network layer, minimizes the discrepancy between the original\nreal-valued weights and its binary approximations, and fine-tunes the whole\nnetwork accordingly.

The unit serves as a decisionmaker to adaptively activate\nmaps along certain channels with the solely purpose of optimizing the overall\ntraining loss.

This prospect\nstimulates the development of the theoretical basis for simulating the power\nspectrum of this line. Because of the beam size of the upcoming radio\ntelescopes at high redshifts, most of the theoretical models are focused on the\ninhomogeneities on scales above few comoving megaparsecs. Therefore, smaller\nscales are often neglected and modeled with approximated sub-grid models. In\nthis study we explore whether the perturbations on small scales ($\\lesssim\n1h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$) can affect the 21cm signal on larger scales. Two distinct\nmechanism are discussed. First, we show that during the cosmic dawn small scale\nperturbations regulate the formation time of the first Lyman-alpha Emitters\n(LAE), and consequently the coupling timing of spin and kinetic temperatures.\nDue to the low number density of LAE, the inhomogeneity of coupling includes\nthe shot noise and manifests itself in the observed 21cm power spectrum. Second\nmechanism works during the reionization when the ionized bubbles actively grow\nand overlap. Small scales perturbations affect the galactic properties and\nmerger histories, and consequently the number of ionizing photons produced by\neach galaxy. The ionizing photons bring the perturbations from the galactic\nscales to the scales of ionizing fronts, affecting the 21cm power spectrum. We\nconclude that these two effects introduce stochasticity in the potentially\nobserved 21cm power spectrum and, moreover, might give another perspective into\nthe physics of the first galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Tumbles reorient cells randomly, and cells can drift toward\nattractants or away from repellents by biasing the frequency of these events.\nThe post-tumble swimming directions are typically correlated with those prior,\nas measured by the variance of the reorientation angle distribution. This\nvariance can range from large, in the case of bacteria, to so small that tumble\nevents are imperceptible, as observed in choanoflagellates. This raises the\nquestion of optimality: why is such a range of persistence observed in nature?\nHere we study persistent run-and-tumble dynamics, focusing first on the\noptimisation of the linearised chemotactic response within the two-dimensional\nparameter space of tumble frequency and angular persistence. Although an\noptimal persistence does exist for a given tumble frequency, in the full\nparameter space there is a continuum of optimal solutions. Introducing finite\ntumble times that depend on the persistence can change this picture,\nilluminating one possible method for selecting tumble persistence based on\nspecies-specific reorientation dynamics. Moving beyond linear theory we find\nthat optimal chemotactic strengths exist, and that these maximise reaction when\nswimming in a wrong direction, but have little or no reaction when swimming\nwith even the slightest projection along the chemoattractant gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Toward this goal, we propose a self-supervised learning\ntask, called the music puzzle game, to train neural network models to learn the\nsequential patterns in music. In essence, such a game requires machines to\ncorrectly sort a few multisecond music fragments. In the training stage, we\nlearn the model by sampling multiple non-overlapping fragment pairs from the\nsame songs and seeking to predict whether a given pair is consecutive and is in\nthe correct chronological order. For testing, we design a number of puzzle\ngames with different difficulty levels, the most difficult one being music\nmedley, which requiring sorting fragments from different songs. On the basis of\nstate-of-the-art Siamese convolutional network, we propose an improved\narchitecture that learns to embed frame-level similarity scores computed from\nthe input fragment pairs to a common space, where fragment pairs in the correct\norder can be more easily identified. Our result shows that the resulting model,\ndubbed as the similarity embedding network (SEN), performs better than\ncompeting models across different games, including music jigsaw puzzle, music\nsequencing, and music medley.

The central analytic task in\nthe development of statistical inference in the MapReduce paradigm pertains to\nthe method of combining results yielded from separately mapped data batches.\nOne seminal solution based on the confidence distribution has recently been\nestablished in the setting of maximum likelihood estimation in the literature.\nThis paper concerns a more general inferential methodology based on estimating\nfunctions, termed as the Rao-type confidence distribution, of which the maximum\nlikelihood is a special case. This generalization provides a unified framework\nof statistical inference that allows regression analyses of massive data sets\nof important types in a parallel and scalable fashion via a distributed file\nsystem, including longitudinal data analysis, survival data analysis, and\nquantile regression, which cannot be handled using the maximum likelihood\nmethod. This paper investigates four important properties of the proposed\nmethod: computational scalability, statistical optimality, methodological\ngenerality, and operational robustness. In particular, the proposed method is\nshown to be closely connected to Hansen's generalized method of moments (GMM)\nand Crowder's optimality. An interesting theoretical finding is that the\nasymptotic efficiency of the proposed Rao-type confidence distribution\nestimator is always greater or equal to the estimator obtained by processing\nthe full data once. All these properties of the proposed method are illustrated\nvia numerical examples in both simulation studies and real-world data analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Service deployment involves placement of VNFs and\nin-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain\n(SC). The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is called SC mapping. In a\nWide-Area Network (WAN), a situation may arise where several traffic flows,\ngenerated by many distributed node pairs, require the same SC; then, a single\ninstance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough. SC mapping with\nmultiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex problem,\nsince the sequential traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while accounting\nfor traffic flows in various directions. Our study is the first to deal with\nthe problem of SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize network\nresource consumption. We first propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to solve\nthis problem. Since ILP does not scale to large networks, we develop a\ncolumn-generation-based ILP (CG-ILP) model. However, we find that exact\nmathematical modeling of the problem results in quadratic constraints in our\nCG-ILP. The quadratic constraints are made linear but even the scalability of\nCG-ILP is limited. Hence, we also propose a two-phase column-generation-based\napproach to get results over large network topologies within reasonable\ncomputational times. Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate\nchoice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to a solution very close to\nthe minimum bandwidth consumption. Further, this approach also helps us to\nanalyze the effects of number of VNF replicas and number of NFV nodes on\nbandwidth consumption when deploying these minimum number of SC instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 01:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

Deep\nlearning, which has been successfully applied to various research fields such\nas image classification and voice recognition, provides a new opportunity to\nsignificantly improve the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Although\nseveral deep-learning methods have been developed for secondary structure\nprediction, there is room for improvement. MUFold-SS was developed to address\nthese issues. Results: Here, a very deep neural network, the deep\ninception-inside-inception networks (Deep3I), is proposed for protein secondary\nstructure prediction and a software tool was implemented using this network.\nThis network takes two inputs: a protein sequence and a profile generated by\nPSI-BLAST. The output is the predicted eight states (Q8) or three states (Q3)\nof secondary structures. The proposed Deep3I not only achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance but also runs faster than other tools. Deep3I\nachieves Q3 82.8% and Q8 71.1% accuracies on the CB513 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 20:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Its impact on signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split\nNLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between\ntransmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's\nfor non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations.\nWhen signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation\narises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of\nnonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver\nnoise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short\ntransmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger\ntransmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with\nrespect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains.\nAdditionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio\nand the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that\nsplit NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital\nback-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard\nsingle-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when\ntransmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when\ntransmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56%\non top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm. The\ntheoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 06:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Considering the existence of a\nreasonably stable group of mobile nodes like animals, birds, and mobile assets,\nwe propose a cluster-based cooperative tracking algorithm, where cluster head\ncentrally coordinates resource usage among cluster members.
