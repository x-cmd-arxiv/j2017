An open question is which computational (algorithmic) processes\nare implemented by these hierarchies. One renowned hypothesis is that cortical\nhierarchies implement a model of the world's causal structure and serve to\ninfer environmental states from sensory inputs. This view, which casts\nperception as hierarchical Bayesian inference, has become a highly influential\nconcept in both basic and clinical neuroscience. So far, however, a direct\ncorrespondence between the predicted order of hierarchical Bayesian\ncomputations and the sequence of evoked neuronal activity has not been\ndemonstrated. Here, we present evidence for this correspondence from\nneuroimaging and electrophysiological data in healthy volunteers. Trial-wise\nsequences of hierarchical computations were inferred from participants'\nbehaviour during a social learning task that required multi-level inference\nabout intentions. We found that the temporal sequence of neuronal activity\nmatched the order of computations as predicted by the theory. These findings\nprovide strong evidence for the operation of hierarchical Bayesian inference in\nhuman cortex. Furthermore, our approach offers a novel strategy for the\ncombined computational-physiological phenotyping of patients with disorders of\nperception, such as schizophrenia or autism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 16:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

In this note, assuming that squarks are extremely heavy, we evaluate\nthe next-to-leading order radiative corrections to the two neutral CP-even\nHiggs self-couplings $\\lambda_{H h h}$ and $\\lambda_{h h h}$ and to the partial\ndecay width $\\Gamma(H \\to h h)$ that are most relevant at the LHC.

Recent attempts to improve these properties have\nrelied on metamaterial- (MTM-) inspired open-loop resonators (OLRs) coupled to\ntransmission lines (TLs). Although the strongly resonant properties of the OLR\nsensitively reflect small changes in the environment through a shift in its\nresonance frequency, the resulting sensitivities remain ultimately limited by\nthe level of coupling between the OLR and the TL. This work introduces a novel\nsolution to this problem that employs negative-refractiveindex TL (NRI-TL) MTMs\nto substantially improve this coupling so as to fully exploit its resonant\nproperties. A MTM-infused planar microwave sensor is designed for operation at\n2.5 GHz, and is shown to exhibit a significant improvement in sensitivity and\nlinearity. A rigorous signal-flow analysis (SFA) of the sensor is proposed and\nshown to provide a fully analytical description of all salient features of both\nthe conventional and MTM-infused sensors. Full-wave simulations confirm the\nanalytical predictions, and all data demonstrate excellent agreement with\nmeasurements of a fabricated prototype.

Here, we\npropose that these textures can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements carried out in the presence of an electric field. In crystals with\nhidden polarizations, a uniform electric field produces a staggered magnetic\nfield that points to opposite directions at atomic sites related by spatial\ninversion. As a result, the NMR resonance peak corresponding to inversion\npartner nuclei is split into two peaks. The magnitude of the splitting is\nproportional to the electric field and depends on the orientation of the\nelectric field with respect to the crystallographic axes and the external\nmagnetic field. As a case study, we present a theory of electric-field-induced\nsplitting of NMR peaks for $^{77}$Se, $^{125}$Te and $^{209}$Bi in Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nand Bi$_2$Te$_3$. In conducting samples with current densities of $\\simeq\n10^6\\, {\\rm A/cm}^2$, the splitting for Bi can reach $100\\, {\\rm kHz}$, which\nis comparable to or larger than the intrinsic width of the NMR lines.

Gas accreting from the disc on to the\nstar provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory\nspecies are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios\nderived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of\ndisc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of\nabundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to\nhave lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed\naccretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least\npartially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of\ndisc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile\nspecies carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of\nthe atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular\ncarriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines\nwhile the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main\nfeatures seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a\nfew times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with\nmm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust linkage between\nline ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the\npotential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary\ndiscs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

The minimal\nexamples typically involve Higgs scalars with a large charge with respect to a\n$U(1)$ (e.g. charges $(Z,1)$ in $U(1)^2$ with $Z\\gg 1$). This type of Higgs\nmultiplets play also a key role in clockwork $U(1)$ theories. We study these\nissues in the context of heterotic string theory and find that, while indeed\nthere is no new physics at the standard magnetic WGC scale $\\Lambda\\sim g_{IR}\nM_P$, the string scale is just slightly above, at a scale $\\sim\n\\sqrt{k_{IR}}\\Lambda$. Here $k_{IR}$ is the level of the IR $U(1)$ worldsheet\ncurrent. We show that, unlike the standard magnetic cutoff, this bound is\ninsensitive to subsequent Higgsing. One may argue that this constraint gives\nrise to no bound at the effective field theory level since $k_0$ is model\ndependent and in general unknown. However there is an additional constraint to\nbe taken into account, which is that the Higgsing scalars with large charge $Z$\nshould be part of the string massless spectrum, which becomes an upper bound\n$k_{IR}\\leq k_0^2$, where $k_0$ is the level of the UV currents. Thus, for\nfixed $k_0$, $Z$ cannot be made parametrically large.

Coronagraphy is a promising starlight suppression\ntechnique, providing excellent contrast and throughput for off-axis sources on\nclear apertures. However, the complexity of space- and ground-based telescope\napertures goes on increasing over time, owing to the combination of primary\nmirror segmentation, secondary mirror, and support structures. These\ndiscontinuities in the telescope aperture limit the coronagraph performance. In\nthis paper, we present ACAD-OSM, a novel active method to correct for the\ndiffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a\ncoronagraph. Active methods use one or several deformable mirrors that are\ncontrolled with an interaction matrix to correct for the aberrations in the\npupil. However, they are often limited by the amount of aberrations introduced\nby aperture discontinuities. This algorithm relies on the recalibration of the\ninteraction matrix during the correction process to overcome this limitation.\nWe first describe the ACAD-OSM technique and compare it to the previous active\nmethods for the correction of aperture discontinuities. We then show its\nperformance in terms of contrast and off-axis throughput for static aperture\ndiscontinuities (segmentation, struts) and for some aberrations evolving over\nthe life of the instrument (residual phase aberrations, artifacts in the\naperture, misalignments in the coronagraph design). This technique can now\nobtain the earth-like planet detection threshold of 10^(-10) contrast on any\ngiven aperture over at least a 10% spectral bandwidth, with several coronagraph\ndesigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 18:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue\nsome massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black\nholes.

Finally, we provide empirical evidence that,\nsurprisingly, the number of compatible labelings can actually decrease as n\ngrows, until a test set-dependent threshold is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 19:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 15:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

For the first case, we reduce\nthe problem of simplifying the entries of the Hasse-Witt matrix modulo p to a\nproblem of solving quadratic Diophantine equations. For the second case, we\nextend Bostan et al.'s method for hyperelliptic curves to general superelliptic\ncurves. We believe the methods we describe are asymptotically the most\nefficient known point-counting algorithms for certain families of trinomial\nsuperelliptic curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 20:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

Axons are important to understand neurodegenerative diseases such\nas multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Indeed,\nabnormal accumulation of proteins and organelles in axons is a hallmark feature\nof these diseases. The diffusion in the axons can become to anomalous as a\nresult from this abnormality. In this case the voltage propagation in axons is\naffected. Another hallmark feature of different neurodegenerative diseases is\ngiven by discrete swellings along the axon. In order to model the voltage\npropagation in axons with anomalous diffusion and swellings, in this paper we\npropose a fractional cable equation for general geometry. This generalized\nequation depends on fractional parameters and geometric quantities such as the\ncurvature and torsion of the cable. For a cable with a constant radius we show\nthat the voltage decreases when the fractional effect increases. In cables with\nswellings we find that when the fractional effect or the swelling radius\nincrease, the voltage decreases. A similar behavior is obtained when the number\nof swellings and the fractional effect increase. Moreover, we find that when\nthe radius swelling (or the number of swellings) and the fractional effect\nincrease at the same time, the voltage dramatically decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 20:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of\ngravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the\narguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted\nequations by Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000), there effective spin\nfrequency decrease is coupled with dissipation of unstable mode. This problem,\ninitially stressed by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), is shown to be superficial,\nand arises as a result of definition of the effective spin frequency by\nLindblom et al.

Such broadening has serious\nimplications for many proposals to coherently use Rydberg interactions,\nparticularly Rydberg dressing proposals. The dephasing arises as a runaway\nprocess where the production of the first contaminant atoms facilitates the\ncreation of more contaminant atoms. Here we study the time dependence of this\nprocess with stroboscopic approaches. Using a pump-probe technique, we create\nan excess \"pump\" Rydberg population and probe its effect with a different\n\"probe\" Rydberg transition. We observe a reduced resonant pumping rate and an\nenhancement of the excitation on both sides of the transition as atoms are\nadded to the pump state. We also observe a timescale for population growth\nsignificantly shorter than predicted by homogeneous mean-field models, as\nexpected from a clustered growth mechanism where high-order correlations\ndominate the dynamics. These results support earlier works and confirm that the\ntime scale for the onset of dephasing is reduced by a factor which scales as\nthe inverse of the atom number. In addition, we discuss several approaches to\nminimize these effects of spontaneous broadening, including stroboscopic\ntechniques and operating at cryogenic temperatures. It is challenging to avoid\nthe unwanted broadening effects, but under some conditions they can be\nmitigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 21:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The recently discovered universal I-Love-Q relations, which\nconnect moment of inertia, quadrupole tidal Love number, and spin-induced\nquadrupole moment of compact stars, also underscore the special role of tidal\ndeformation in gravitational wave astronomy. Motivated by the observation that\nsuch relations also prevail in Newtonian stars and crucially depend on the\nstiffness of a star, we consider the tidal Love numbers of Newtonian polytropic\nstars whose stiffness is characterised by a polytropic index $n$. We first\nperturbatively solve the Lane-Emden equation governing the profile of\npolytropic stars through the application of the scaled delta expansion method\nand then formulate perturbation series for the multipolar tidal Love number\nabout the two exactly solvable cases with $n=0$ and $n=1$, respectively. Making\nuse of these two series to form a two-point Pad\\'e approximant, we find an\napproximate expression of the quadrupole tidal Love number, whose error is less\nthan $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ per cent (0.39 per cent) for $n\\in[0,1]$\n($n\\in[0,3]$). Similarly, we also determine the mass moments for polytropic\nstars accurately. Based on these findings, we are able to show that the\nI-Love-Q relations are in general stationary about the incompressible limit\nirrespective of the equation of state (EOS) of a star. Moreover, for the\nI-Love-Q relations, there is a secondary stationary point near $n \\approx\n0.4444$, thus showing the insensitivity to $n$ for $n\\in[0,1]$. Our\ninvestigation clearly tracks the universality of the I-Love-Q relations from\ntheir validity for stiff stars such as neutron stars to their breakdown for\nsoft stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 22:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

A statistical analysis of the spectral matching technique\nis discussed as an alternative to non-detection constraints for estimating SN\nexplosion epochs. The time evolution of spectral lines is presented and\nanalysed in terms of how this differs for SNe of different photometric,\nspectral, and environmental properties: velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths,\ndecline rates, magnitudes, time durations, and environment metallicity. Our\nsample displays a large range in ejecta expansion velocities, from $\\sim9600$\nto $\\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$ at 50 days post explosion with a median H$_{\\alpha}$\nvalue of 7300 km s$^{-1}$.

The standard OCO framework has seen much success for its ability to\nhandle decision-making in dynamic, uncertain, and even adversarial\nenvironments. Nevertheless, our applications of interest present further\nflexibility in OCO via three simple modifications to standard OCO assumptions:\nwe introduce two new concepts of weighted regret and online saddle point\nproblems and study the possibility of making lookahead (anticipatory)\ndecisions.

As noted by previous\nauthors, the ordered AFM phases already show in band theory significant band\ngaps. However, for the disordered PM phases the commonly used band model has\nbeen to assume the macroscopically observed, averaged NaCl structure, where all\ntransition metal sites are forced to be symmetry-equivalent (a monomorphous\ndescription); for the PM phase this forces zero moment on an atom by atom\nbasis, thus producing a gapless PM state, in sharp conflict with experiment.\nInstead, we allow larger NaCl-type supercells where each TM site can have\ndifferent local bonding and spin environments (a polymorphous description) and\nthus the geometric flexibility to acquire symmetry-lowering distortions that\nlower the total energy and can break the symmetry of the d orbitals. The\nexistence of a distribution of different local spin and bonding environments\nallows large on-site magnetic moments to develop spontaneously in the DFT+U\ncalculations leading to significant (1-3 eV) band gaps in the AFM, FM, and PM\nphases of the classic Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. We adapt to the\nspin disordered configurations in the PM phases the \"special quasi-random\nstructure\" whereby supercell approximants which represent the best random\nconfiguration average for finite supercells of a given lattice symmetry are\nconstructed. Thus, avoiding a monomorphous description of the disordered\nmagnetic phases allows even ordinary DFT+U, which represents the N electron\nsystem with a single-determinant wavefunction, to describe the gapping not only\nin the AFM phases but also in the PM phases of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 00:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

In this paper, we study indexing of\ncontinuous spatio-textual queries. There exist several related spatio-textual\nindexes that typically integrate a spatial index with a textual index. However,\nthese indexes usually have a high demand for main-memory and assume that the\nentire vocabulary of keywords is known in advance. Also, these indexes do not\nsuccessfully capture the variations in the frequencies of keywords across\ndifferent spatial regions and treat frequent and infrequent keywords in the\nsame way. Moreover, existing indexes do not adapt to the changes in workload\nover space and time. For example, some keywords may be trending at certain\ntimes in certain locations and this may change as time passes. This affects the\nindexing and searching performance of existing indexes significantly. In this\npaper, we introduce FAST, a Frequency-Aware Spatio-Textual index for continuous\nspatio-textual queries. FAST is a main-memory index that requires up to one\nthird of the memory needed by the state-of-the-art index. FAST does not assume\nprior knowledge of the entire vocabulary of indexed objects. FAST adaptively\naccounts for the difference in the frequencies of keywords within their\ncorresponding spatial regions to automatically choose the best indexing\napproach that optimizes the insertion and search times. Extensive experimental\nevaluation using real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that FAST is up to 3x\nfaster in search time and 5x faster in insertion time than the state-of-the-art\nindexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 04:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 20:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Many\napplications require real-time processing of these streams. For example,\nlocation-based e-coupon and ad-targeting systems enable advertisers to register\nmillions of ads to millions of users. The number of users is typically very\nhigh and they are continuously moving, and the ads change frequently as well.\nHence sending the right ad to the matching users is very challenging. Existing\nstreaming systems are either centralized or are not spatial-keyword aware, and\ncannot efficiently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword\ndata streams. This paper presents Tornado, a distributed spatial-keyword stream\nprocessing system. Tornado features routing units to fairly distribute the\nworkload, and furthermore, co-locate the data objects and the corresponding\nqueries at the same processing units. The routing units use the Augmented-Grid,\na novel structure that is equipped with an efficient search algorithm for\ndistributing the data objects and queries. Tornado uses evaluators to process\nthe data objects against the queries. The routing units minimize the redundant\ncommunication by not sending data updates for processing when these updates do\nnot match any query. By applying dynamically evaluated cost formulae that\ncontinuously represent the processing overhead at each evaluator, Tornado is\nadaptive to changes in the workload. Extensive experimental evaluation using\nspatio-textual range queries over real Twitter data indicates that Tornado\noutperforms the non-spatio-textually aware approaches by up to two orders of\nmagnitude in terms of the overall system throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 04:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

The properties of resonators and their\nemitted energy spectra are studied within the general framework of the Finite\nDifference Time Domain method, requiring supercomputing resources to probe the\ntransient behaviour and interactions among the electromagnetic fields. The\nformal theory of Mie scattering is also extended to develop a cutting-edge,\ncomputationally efficient model for general, multilayer microspheres, which\nrepresents a valuable achievement for the scientific community in its own\nright. The model unifies the approaches in the field of mathematical modelling\nto express the energy spectrum in a single encompassing equation, which is then\napplied in a range of contexts. The gulf between modelling and biological\nresonators is bridged by an in-depth study of the physical characteristics of a\nrange of biological cells, and the selection criteria for viable resonator\ncandidates are developed through a number of detailed feasibility studies.

In the Unruh state for the\nevaporating black holes, the free-fall energy density is found to be negative\ndivergent at the horizon, which is in contrast to the conventional calculations\nperformed in the Kruskal coordinates. We resolve this conflict by invoking that\nthe Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.\nIn the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy\ndensity at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the\ninfinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent\nStefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman\ntemperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is\nsurprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall\nnecessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in\nthe evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely\nblueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing\nHawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed\noriginates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon. So, the\nfirewall and the atmosphere for the Hawking radiation turn out to be\ncompatible, once we discard the fact that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh\nstate originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the\nhorizon. Finally, as a cosmological application, the initial radiation energy\ndensity in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when\ninflation starts. We successfully find the origin of the non-vanishing initial\nradiation energy density in the warm inflation by using the effective Tolman\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 04:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

In this paper, we aim to\nanalyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large ($>0.8$ km$^2$) tundra\nlakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in\nhistorical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale\n$0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google\nEarth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). The G.E.E. is a\ncloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis on over four\ndecades of Landsat data. We developed an image-processing algorithm to segment\nthese maps and images, measure the area and perimeter of each lake, and compute\nthe fractal dimension of the lakes in the images we have studied. Our results\nindicate that as lake size increases, their fractal dimension bifurcates. For\nlakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger\nthan $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in\nsatellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\\sim$100\nkm$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal\ndimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their\narea--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes\nwith a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed.\nPreliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes\nthat were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite\nimagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size\nover time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change\nduring this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as\nrecorded in the historical map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 05:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 20:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The universal cover of K(n) is the\nn-regular tree with bipartite orientation.\n  The paper deals with the representations of the n-regular tree with bipartite\norientation (thus with graded Kronecker modules). The simultaneous\nBernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection at all sinks will be called the shift\nfunctor, and we consider the orbits under this shift functor. Whereas the\nlength of a regular module growths exponentially when we apply the shift\nfunctor repeatedly, the radius of such a module growths just linearly.\n  To any regular shift orbit, we attach a positive integer r (the minimal\nradius of the sink modules in the orbit) and the path in T(n) which starts at\nthe center p of the sink modules in the orbit and ends at the center q of the\nsource modules in the orbit. If r is even, then p has to be a sink, otherwise a\nsource. We call this path the center path of the orbit (since the center of any\nmodule in the orbit lies on this path). If the center path of a shift orbit has\nlength b, then the orbit contains precisely b flow modules, the remaining\nmodules are sink modules and source modules. We use this division in order to\nindex the regular graded Kronecker modules in a coherent way.

In\norder to deploy an AV there are significant steps that must be completed in\nterms of hardware and software. As expected, software components play a key\nrole in the complex AV system and so, at least for safety, we should assess the\ncorrectness of these components.\n  In this paper, we are concerned with the high-level software component(s)\nresponsible for the decisions in an AV. We intend to model an AV capable of\nnavigation; obstacle avoidance; obstacle selection (when a crash is\nunavoidable) and vehicle recovery, etc, using a rational agent. To achieve\nthis, we have established the following stages. First, the agent plans and\nactions have been implemented within the Gwendolen agent programming language.\nSecond, we have built a simulated automotive environment in the Java language.\nThird, we have formally specified some of the required agent properties through\nLTL formulae, which are then formally verified with the AJPF verification tool.\nFinally, within the MCAPL framework (which comprises all the tools used in\nprevious stages) we have obtained formal verification of our AV agent in terms\nof its specific behaviours. For example, the agent plans responsible for\nselecting an obstacle with low potential damage, instead of a higher damage\nobstacle (when possible) can be formally verified within MCAPL. We must\nemphasise that the major goal (of our present approach) lies in the formal\nverification of agent plans, rather than evaluating real-world applications.\nFor this reason we utilised a simple matrix representation concerning the\nenvironment used by our agent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 06:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

For the\nclassification task, 125 features were extracted from the segmented structures,\ndescribing their anatomy and function. Next, a two-stage pipeline for feature\nselection using the LASSO method is developed. A subset of 20 features is\nselected for classification.

However, the envisioned integration\ncreates many new challenges, among which mobility management (MM) is a critical\none. Simply applying existing radio access oriented MM schemes leads to poor\nperformance mainly due to the co-provisioning of radio access and computing\nservices of the MEC-enabled BSs. In this paper, we develop a novel user-centric\nenergy-aware mobility management (EMM) scheme, in order to optimize the delay\ndue to both radio access and computation, under the long-term energy\nconsumption constraint of the user. Based on Lyapunov optimization and\nmulti-armed bandit theories, EMM works in an online fashion without future\nsystem state information, and effectively handles the imperfect system state\ninformation. Theoretical analysis explicitly takes radio handover and\ncomputation migration cost into consideration and proves a bounded deviation on\nboth the delay performance and energy consumption compared to the oracle\nsolution with exact and complete future system information. The proposed\nalgorithm also effectively handles the scenario in which candidate BSs randomly\nswitch on/off during the offloading process of a task. Simulations show that\nthe proposed algorithms can achieve close-to-optimal delay performance while\nsatisfying the user energy consumption constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 08:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

To manage the uncertainty in unstructured\nconditions, the motions learned with our method can be reproduced with an\nimpedance controller. Learning from Demonstration is used because the planning\nof compliant motions in 3-D is computationally intractable. The proposed method\nwill learn an individual compliant motion, many of which can be combined to\nsolve more complex tasks. The method is based on measuring simultaneously the\ndirection of motion and the forces acting on the end-effector. From these\nmeasurements we construct a set of constraints for motion directions which,\nwith correct compliance, result in the observed motion. Constraints from\nmultiple demonstrations are projected into a 2-D angular coordinate system\nwhere their intersection is determined to find a set of feasible desired\ndirections, of which a single motion direction is chosen. The work is based on\nthe assumption that movement in directions other than the desired direction is\ncaused by interaction forces. Using this assumption, we infer the number of\ncompliant axes and, if required, their directions.

Our main observation is that depth images provide\nimportant information about the geometry of the scene. Diverging from the\ntraditional goal of 2D object proposals to provide a high recall (lots of 2D\nbounding boxes near potential objects), we aim for precise 3D proposals. We\nleverage on depth information per frame and multi-view scene information to\nobtain accurate 3D object proposals.

Our online approach can be integrated into SLAM based video\nprocessing for quick 3D object localization.

In this communication is investigated the capability of a\nPMC to act as a phase-shifting wavefront sensor for better control of the\nachieved star extinction ratio in presence of the coronagraphic mask. We\ndiscuss the two main implementations of the phase-shifting process, either\nintroducing phase-shifts in a pupil plane and sensing intensity variations in\nan image plane, or reciprocally.

Crossbar architecture\nwith highly scalable Resistive RAM or RRAM array serving as synaptic weights\nand neuronal drivers in the periphery is an attractive option for SNN.\nRecognition (akin to reading the synaptic weight) requires small amplitude bias\napplied across the RRAM to minimize conductance change. Learning (akin to\nwriting or updating the synaptic weight) requires large amplitude bias pulses\nto produce a conductance change. The contradictory bias amplitude requirement\nto perform reading and writing simultaneously and asynchronously, akin to\nbiology, is a major challenge. Solutions suggested in the literature rely on\ntime-division-multiplexing of read and write operations based on clocks, or\napproximations ignoring the reading when coincidental with writing. In this\nwork, we overcome this challenge and present a clock-less approach wherein\nreading and writing are performed in different frequency domains.

We validate our scheme in\nSPICE circuit simulator by translating a two-layered feed-forward Iris\nclassifying SNN to demonstrate software-equivalent performance.

One of the most common imaging methods for diagnosing this disease is\nX-ray angiography. Diagnosing using these images is usually challenging due to\nnon-uniform illumination, low contrast, presence of other body tissues,\npresence of catheter etc. These challenges make the diagnoses task of\ncardiologists tougher and more prone to misdiagnosis. In this paper we propose\na new automated framework for coronary arteries segmentation, catheter\ndetection and center-line extraction in x-ray angiography images. Our proposed\nsegmentation method is based on superpixels. In this method at first three\ndifferent superpixel scales are exploited and a measure for vesselness\nprobability of each superpixel is determined. A majority voting is used for\nobtaining an initial segmentation map from these three superpixel scales. This\ninitial segmentation is refined by finding the orthogonal line on each ridge\npixel of vessel region. In this framework we use our catheter detection and\ntracking method which detects the catheter by finding its ridge in the first\nframe and traces in other frames by fitting a second order polynomial on it.\nAlso we use the image ridges for extracting the coronary arteries centerlines.\nWe evaluated our method qualitatively and quantitatively on two different\nchallenging datasets and compared it with one of the previous well-known\ncoronary arteries segmentation methods. Our method could detect the catheter\nand reduced the false positive rate in addition to achieving better\nsegmentation results. The evaluation results prove that our method performs\nbetter in a much shorter time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 15:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

I first studied projective measurement as\na thermodynamic process. I evidenced that measurement is responsible for an\nuncontroled variation of the system's energy that I called quantum heat, and\nalso a production of entropy. As a proof of concept, I studied an engine\nextracting work from the measurementinduced quantum fluctuations. Then, I\nextended this formalism to generalized measurements, which allowed to describe\nopen quantum systems (i.e. in contact with reservoirs). I defined work, heat\nand entropy production for single realizations of thermodynamic protocols, and\nretrieved that these quantities obey fluctuation theorems. I applied this\nformalism to the canonical situation of quantum optics, i.e. a Qubit coupled to\na laser and a the vacuum. Finally, I studied a promising platform to test\nQubit's thermodynamics: a hybrid optomechanical system. The formalism developed\nin this thesis is of interest for the quantum thermodynamics community as it\nenables to characterize quantum heat engines and compare their performances to\ntheir classical analogs.

Several correlation matrices\nare produced to search for interesting trends between more than 30 distinct\nlight-curve and spectral properties that characterize the diversity of SNe~II.\nOverall, SNe with higher expansion velocities are brighter, have more rapidly\ndeclining light-curves, shorter plateau durations, and higher $^{56}$Ni masses.\nUsing a larger sample than previous studies, we argue that `$Pd$' - the plateau\nduration from the transition of the initial to `plateau' decline rates to the\nend of the `plateau' - is a better indicator of the hydrogen envelope mass than\nthe traditionally used optically thick phase duration ($OPTd$: explosion epoch\nto end of plateau). This argument is supported by the fact that $Pd$ also\ncorrelates with s$_3$, the light-curve decline rate at late times: lower $Pd$\nvalues correlate with larger s$_3$ decline rates. Large s$_3$ decline rates are\nlikely related to lower envelope masses that enables gamma-ray escape. We also\nfind a significant anticorrelation between $Pd$ and s$_2$ (the plateau decline\nrate), confirming the long standing hypothesis that faster declining SNe~II\n(SNe~IIL) are the result of explosions with lower hydrogen envelope masses and\ntherefore have shorter $Pd$ values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 00:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The Klein\ntransformation for Green's components of the operators $a_{k}$, $b_{m}$ is\nconstructed in an explicit form that enables us to reduce the initial\ncommutation rules for the components to the normal commutation relations of\nordinary Fermi fields. A nontrivial connection between trilinear commutation\nrelations of the unitary quantization scheme and so-called Lie-supertriple\nsystem is analysed. A brief discussion of the possibility of embedding the\nDuffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory into the unitary quantization scheme is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 07:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 08:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 06:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Deployment is done along the straight line joining\na source node and a sink node at an unknown distance from the source. The\nproblem is for a deployment agent to walk from the source to the sink,\ndeploying relays as he walks, given that the distance to the sink is\nexponentially distributed with known mean. As a precursor, we apply the\nmulti-relay channel achievable rate formula to obtain the optimal power\nallocation to relays placed along a line, at fixed locations. This permits us\nto obtain the optimal placement of a given number of nodes when the distance\nbetween the source and sink is given. Numerical work suggests that, at low\nattenuation, the relays are mostly clustered near the source in order to be\nable to cooperate, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and\nwork as repeaters.

In this paper, we propose the idea of combining ensemble mutation\nscheme selection and opposition-based learning concepts to enhance the\ndiversity of population in MDE at mutation and selection stages. The proposed\nalgorithm enhances the diversity of population by generating a random mutation\nscale factor per individual and per dimension, randomly assigning a mutation\nscheme to each individual in each generation, and diversifying individuals\nselection using opposition-based learning. This approach is easy to implement\nand does not require the setting of mutation scheme selection and mutation\nscale factor.
