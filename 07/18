In this paper, we make a case\nthat a fundamental problem that prevents efficient and predictable real-time\ncomputing on multicore is the lack of a proper memory abstraction to express\nmemory criticality, which cuts across various layers of the system: the\napplication, OS, and hardware. We, therefore, propose a new holistic resource\nmanagement approach driven by a new memory abstraction, which we call\nDeterministic Memory. The key characteristic of deterministic memory is that\nthe platform - the OS and hardware - guarantees small and tightly bounded\nworst-case memory access timing. In contrast, we call the conventional memory\nabstraction as best-effort memory in which only highly pessimistic worst-case\nbounds can be achieved. We propose to utilize both abstractions to achieve high\ntime predictability but without significantly sacrificing performance.

Our extensive LDA+DMFT calculations show that\ncorrelation effects on Fe-3d states can almost quantitatively reproduce rather\ncomplicated band structure, which is observed in ARPES, in close vicinity of\nthe Fermi level for FeSe/STO and K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$.

Detailed\nanalysis of the theoretical and experimental quasiparticle bands with respect\nto their origin and orbital composition is performed. It is shown that for\nFeSe/STO system the LDA calculated Fe-3d$_{xy}$ band, renormalized by\nelectronic correlations within DMFT gives the quasiparticle band almost exactly\nin the energy region of the experimentally observed \"replica\" quasiparticle\nband at the M-point.

Although there exist\nautomated techniques that can classify user comments into various topics with\nhigh levels of precision, recent studies have shown that the top apps in the\napp stores do not have customer ratings that directly correlate with the app's\nsuccess. This implies that no single requirements elicitation technique can\ncover the full depth required to produce a successful product and that applying\nalternative requirements gathering techniques can lead to success when these\ntwo are combined. Since user involvement has been found to be the most\nimpactful contribution to project success, in this paper we will explore how\nthe Wizard of Oz (WOz) technique and user reviews available in Google Play, can\nbe integrated to produce a product that meets the demand of more stakeholders\nthan either method alone. To compare the role of early interactive requirements\nspecification and app reviews, we conducted two studies (i) a case study\nanalysis on 13 mobile app development teams who used very early stages\nRequirements Engineering (RE) by applying WOz, and (ii) a study analyzing 40\n(70, 592 reviews) similar mobile apps on Google Play. The results of both\nstudies show that while each of WOz and app review analysis techniques can be\napplied to capture specific types of requirements, an integrated process\nincluding both methods would eliminate the communication gap between users and\ndevelopers at early stages of the development process and mitigates the risk of\nrequirements change in later stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

Quantum coherence has recently\nbeen investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,\nthe finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into\naccount the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively\nunexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as\nthe single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for\nunderstanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance\nof quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental\ngroundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence. We prove\nthat non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as\nthere is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit\nmultilevel coherence in any basis. We provide a simple necessary and sufficient\nanalytical criterion to verify multilevel coherence, which leads to a complete\nclassification for three-level systems. We present the robustness of multilevel\ncoherence, a bona fide quantifier which we show to be numerically computable\nvia semidefinite programming and experimentally accessible via multilevel\ncoherence witnesses. We further verify and lower-bound the robustness of\nmultilevel coherence by performing a semi-device-independent phase\ndiscrimination task, implemented experimentally with four-level probes in a\nphotonic setup. Our results contribute to understanding the operational\nrelevance of genuine multilevel coherence, also by demonstrating the key role\nit plays in enhanced phase discrimination---a primitive for quantum\ncommunication and metrology---and suggest new ways to reliably test the quantum\nbehaviour of physical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 09:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 05:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We have not found any experiments in\nhigh-energy physics that have explicitly ruled out this possibility.

Full spectral fitting techniques are\napplied to the datacubes to obtain the spatially resolved mass growth\nhistories, the time evolution of the star formation rate intensity\n($\\Sigma_{SFR}$), and the local specific star formation rate, over three\ndifferent timescales (30 Myr, 300 Myr, and 1 Gyr).

The K-band spectrum of GOODSN-17940 includes significant\ndetections of the [OII]$\\lambda\\lambda 3726,3729$, [NeIII]$\\lambda3869$, and\nH$\\gamma$ emission lines and a tentative detection of H$\\delta$, indicating\n$z_{\\rm{spec}}=4.4121$. GOODSN-17940 is an actively star-forming $z>4$ galaxy\nbased on its K-band spectrum and broadband spectral energy distribution.

Here, using a Darwin particle-in-cell method, the excitation of\nelectrostatic and whistler instabilities by a gyrating electron beam is studied\nin support of recent laboratory experiments. It is assumed that the total\nplasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$ is larger than the electron cyclotron frequency\n$\\Omega_e$. The fast-growing electrostatic beam-mode waves saturate in a few\nplasma oscillations by slowing down and relaxing the electron beam parallel to\nthe background magnetic field. Upon their saturation, the finite amplitude\nelectrostatic beam-mode waves can resonate with the tail of the background\nthermal electrons and accelerate them to the beam parallel velocity. The\nslower-growing whistler waves are excited in primarily two resonance modes: (a)\nthrough Landau resonance due to the inverted slope of the beam electrons in the\nparallel velocity; (b) through cyclotron resonance by scattering electrons to\nboth lower pitch angles and smaller energies. It is demonstrated that, for a\nfield-aligned beam, the whistler instability can be suppressed by the\nelectrostatic instability due to a faster energy transfer rate between beam\nelectrons and the electrostatic waves. Such a competition of growth between\nwhistler and electrostatic waves depends on the ratio of\n$\\omega_{pe}/\\Omega_e$. In terms of wave propagation, beam-generated\nelectrostatic waves are confined to the beam region whereas beam-generated\nwhistler waves transport energy away from the beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 18:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

We also study uniform covers for 2EC and show that the\neverywhere 15/17 vector can be efficiently written as a convex combination of\n2-edge-connected spanning multigraphs.\n  For a weighted, 3-edge-connected, cubic graph, our results show that if the\neverywhere 2/3 vector is an optimal solution for the subtour linear programming\nrelaxation, then a tour with weight at most 27/19 times that of an optimal tour\ncan be found efficiently. Node-weighted, 3-edge-connected, cubic graphs fall\ninto this category. In this special case, we can apply our tools to obtain an\neven better approximation guarantee.\n  To extend our approach to input graphs that are 2-edge-connected, we present\na procedure to decompose an optimal solution for the subtour relaxation for TSP\ninto spanning, connected multigraphs that cover each 2-edge cut an even number\nof times. Using this decomposition, we obtain a 17/12-approximation algorithm\nfor minimum weight 2-edge-connected spanning subgraphs on subcubic,\nnode-weighted graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 20:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 15:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 18:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 01:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

The disorder is created by\ninteraction of the main fraction of atoms with the second immobilized fraction\ndistributed randomly over the lattice.\n  In low-dimensional systems there is no transition from the Anderson localized\nto the conducting phase, although in the presence of correlations a discrete\nset of extended states can exist. The first part of the thesis is devoted to\nproperties of such states. In the finite size lattices, the presence of those\nstates results in the appearance of `windows of transport' -- energy ranges, in\nwhich the localization length is longer than the system size.The analytical\nmethod of determining the extended states energies for correlations of\ngeneralized $N$-mers type is presented, along with a proof that indeed those\nstates are extended in the infinite system. Subsequently, the way of\nexperimental creation of this type of correlations is proposed, as well as the\ntechnique of generation of the disorder in the tunneling amplitudes, which\nsignificantly enhances tunability of the proposed energy filters.\n  The second part of the thesis describes the method which allows to simulate a\nspecific type of the disorder: random magnetic field. Systems of such a class,\ncreated in a two dimensional lattice using simultaneous fast periodic\nmodulation of the lattice height and interactions with immobilized species, may\nallow in future to investigate the range of topics from the condensed matter\nphysics, for example fractional quantum Hall effect at half-filling.

In addition, the maximum energy\nof acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly in Z, while the energy\nloss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two\npoints tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional\nbi-dimensional analyses, which simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the\nspectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable of incorporating the\nrelative importance of these phenomena. In this paper we propose a\nmulti-dimensional reconstruction of the individual emission spectra (in E,\ndirection, and cross-correlation with nearby putative sources) to study the\nhypothesis that primaries are heavy nuclei subject to GZK photo-disintegration,\nand to determine the nature of the extragalactic sources.

Until\nrecently the debate was purely theoretical, with the process considered to be\ninstantaneous for all practical purposes. This changed with the development of\nultrafast lasers and in particular, the 'attoclock' technique that is used to\nprobe the attosecond dynamics of electrons. Although the initial attoclock\nmeasurements hinted at instantaneous tunnelling, later experiments contradicted\nthose findings, claiming to have measured finite tunnelling times. In each case\nthese measurements were performed with multi-electron atoms. Atomic hydrogen\n(H), the simplest atomic system with a single electron, can be 'exactly'\n(subject only to numerical limitations) modelled using numerical solutions of\nthe 3D-TDSE with measured experimental parameters and acts as a convenient\nbenchmark for both accurate experimental measurements and calculations. Here we\nreport the first attoclock experiment performed on H and find that our\nexperimentally determined offset angles are in excellent agreement with\naccurate 3D-TDSE simulations performed using our experimental pulse parameters.\nThe same simulations with a short-range Yukawa potential result in zero offset\nangles for all intensities. We conclude that the offset angle measured in the\nattoclock experiments originates entirely from electron scattering by the\nlong-range Coulomb potential with no contribution from tunnelling time delay.\nThat conclusion is supported by empirical observation that the electron offset\nangles follow closely the simple formula for the deflection angle of electrons\nundergoing classical Rutherford scattering by the Coulomb potential. Thus we\nconfirm that, in H, tunnelling is instantaneous (with an upperbound of 1.8 as)\nwithin our experimental and numerical uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 00:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

We identify the long relaxation\ntimescale of electrostatic interactions between lipid headgroups and the solute\nto be the principal cause of this difference, and show that this slow process\ncan lead to an erroneous dependence of computed free energy profiles on the\ninitial system configuration. We demonstrate the use of committor analysis to\nvalidate the proper sampling of the presumed transition state, which in our\nsimulations is achieved only in replica exchange calculations. Based on these\nresults we provide some useful guidance to perform and evaluate free energy\ncalculations of membrane permeation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

When executing off-chain\ntransactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain\nwithin bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the\nprotocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal\nfunds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents\nparties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain.\n  We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes\noff-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying\nblockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries,\nprotected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish\noff-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral\nfunds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without\ninteracting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury\nfailures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state\nof treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with\nthreshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction\nthroughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine\nTeechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 12:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 13:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 10:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets including MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet indicate that APE-GAN is\neffective to resist adversarial examples generated from five attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 05:29:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 09:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 03:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

For Ricci flow,\nwe reduce Cheeger-Tian's $\\epsilon$-regularity conjecture to a backward\nPseudolocality estimate. By proving a global backward Pseudolocality theorem,\nwe can prove a global $\\epsilon$-regularity theorem which partially confirms\nCheeger-Tian's conjecture for Ricci flow. Furthermore, as a consequence of the\n$\\epsilon$-regularity, we can show by using the structure theorem of Naber-Tian\n\\cite{NaTi} that a collapsed limit of shrinking Ricci solitons with bounded\n$L^2$ curvature has a smooth Riemannian orbifold structure away from a finite\nnumber of points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 07:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

Soft\nmagnetic particles are placed on a liquid interface, and submitted to a\nmagnetic induction field. An attractive force due to the curvature of the\ninterface around the particles competes with an interaction between magnetic\ndipoles.

For a\nflow Mach number at infinity of 4, a few of these objects (5 - 10) are enough\nto increase the accretion rate about 50% over the accretion rate without\nbodies, even though the gas is adiabatic and the filling factor of the\nobstacles is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 10:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

We consider purely advective transport in heterogeneity scenarios\ncharacterized by broad distributions of heterogeneity length scales and point\nvalues. Particle transport is characterized in terms of the stochastic\nproperties of equidistantly sampled Lagrangian velocities, which are determined\nby the flow and conductivity statistics. The persistence length scales of flow\nand transport velocities are imprinted in the spatial disorder and reflect the\ndistribution of heterogeneity length scales. Particle transitions over the\nvelocity length scales are kinematically coupled with the transition time\nthrough velocity.

This problem naturally\nexists in many real scenarios including large-scale celebrity recognition,\nmovie actor annotation, etc. Our solution contains two components. First, we\nbuild a face feature extraction model, and improve its performance, especially\nfor the persons with very limited training samples, by introducing a\nregularizer to the cross entropy loss for the multi-nomial logistic regression\n(MLR) learning. This regularizer encourages the directions of the face features\nfrom the same class to be close to the direction of their corresponding\nclassification weight vector in the logistic regression. Second, we build a\nmulti-class classifier using MLR on top of the learned face feature extraction\nmodel. Since the standard MLR has poor generalization capability for the\none-shot classes even if these classes have been oversampled, we propose a\nnovel supervision signal called underrepresented-classes promotion loss, which\naligns the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes (a.k.a.\nunderrepresented-classes) to those of the normal classes.

Some of these have been attributed to tsunami events. Doggerland in the\nsouthern North Sea is a submerged landscape thought to have been heavily\naffected by a tsunami such that it was abandoned by Mesolithic human\npopulations at the time of the event. The tsunami was generated by the Storegga\nsubmarine landslide off the Norwegian coast which failed around 8150 years ago.\nAt this time there were also rapid changes in sea level associated with\ndeglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet and drainage of its large proglacial\nlakes, with the largest sea level jumps occurring just prior to the Storegga\nevent. The tsunami affected a large area of the North Atlantic leaving\nsedimentary deposits across the region, from Greenland, through the Faroes, the\nUK, Norway and Denmark. From these sediments, run-up heights of up to 20 metres\nhave been estimated in the Shetland Isles and several metres on mainland\nScotland. However, sediments are not preserved everywhere and so reconstructing\nhow the tsunami propagated across the North Atlantic before inundating the\nlandscape must be performed using numerical models. These models can also be\nused to recreate the tsunami interactions with now submerged landscapes, such\nas Doggerland. Here, the Storegga submarine slide is simulated, generating a\ntsunami which is then propagated across the North Atlantic and used to\nreconstruct the inundation on the Shetlands, Moray Firth and Doggerland. The\nuncertainty in reconstructing palaeobathymetry and the Storegga slide itself\nresults in lower inundation levels than the sediment deposits suggest. Despite\nthese uncertainties, these results suggest Doggerland was not as severely\naffected as previous studies implied. It is suggested therefore that the\nabandonment of Doggerland was primarily caused by rapid sea level rise prior to\nthe tsunami event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 12:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

The most recent version of Maude, version\n2.7.1, provides quite sophisticated unification features, including\norder-sorted equational unification for convergent theories modulo axioms such\nas associativity, commutativity, and identity (ACU). This novel equational\nunification relies on built-in generation of the set of 'variants' of a term\n$t$, i.e., the canonical form of $t \\sigma$ for a computed substitution\n$\\sigma$. Variant generation relies on a novel narrowing strategy called\n'folding variant narrowing' that opens up new applications in formal reasoning,\ntheorem proving, testing, protocol analysis, and model checking, especially\nwhen the theory satisfies the 'finite variant property', i.e., there is a\nfinite number of most general variants for every term in the theory.

Here, we analyze the\ninterplay of short- and long-range Coulomb as well as electron-phonon\ninteractions in NbS$_2$ monolayers. The combination of these interactions\ncauses electronic correlations that are fundamentally different to what would\nbe expected from the interaction terms separately. The fully interacting\nelectronic spectral function resembles the non-interacting band structure but\nwith appreciable broadening. An unexpected coexistence of strong charge and\nspin fluctuations puts NbS$_2$ close to spin and charge order, suggesting\nmonolayer NbS$_2$ as a platform for atomic scale engineering of electronic\nquantum phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 14:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 11:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

The data clearly confirm indications seen\nin earlier data that the source's spectral shape softens as it becomes fainter.\nThe smooth, exponential rollover at high energies present in the first\nobservation evolves to a much more abrupt steepening of the spectrum at $20-30$\nkeV. The continuum evolution can be well described with emission from a\nmagnetized accretion column, modeled using the compmag model modified by an\nadditional Gaussian emission component for the fainter observation. Between the\ntwo observations, the optical depth changes from $0.75\\pm0.04$ to\n$0.56^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$, the electron temperature remains constant, and there is\nan indication that the column decreases in radius. Since the energy resolved\npulse profiles remain virtually unchanged in shape between the two\nobservations, the emission properties of the accretion column, however, reflect\nthe same accretion regime. This conclusion is also confirmed by our result that\nthe energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at ${\\sim}45$\nkeV is independent of the luminosity, implying that the magnetic field in the\nregion in which the observed radiation is produced is the same in both\nobservations. Finally, we also constrain the evolution of the continuum\nparameters with rotational phase of the neutron star. The width of the CRSF\ncould only be constrained for the brighter observation. Based on Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of CRSF formation in single accretion columns, its pulse phase\ndependence supports a simplified fan beam emission pattern. The evolution of\nthe CRSF width is very similar to that of the CRSF depth, which is in\ndisagreement with expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 14:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

A PBD of order $n$ is the distribution of a sum of\n$n$ mutually independent Bernoulli random variables $X_i$, where\n$\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p_i$. The $k$'th power of this distribution, for $k$ in a\nrange $[m]$, is the distribution of $P_k = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{(k)}$, where each\nBernoulli random variable $X_i^{(k)}$ has $\\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(k)}] = (p_i)^k$.\nThe learning algorithm can query any power $P_k$ several times and succeeds in\nlearning all powers in the range, if with probability at least $1- \\delta$:\ngiven any $k \\in [m]$, it returns a probability distribution $Q_k$ with total\nvariation distance from $P_k$ at most $\\epsilon$. We provide almost matching\nlower and upper bounds on query complexity for this problem. We first show a\nlower bound on the query complexity on PBD powers instances with many distinct\nparameters $p_i$ which are separated, and we almost match this lower bound by\nexamining the query complexity of simultaneously learning all the powers of a\nspecial class of PBD's resembling the PBD's of our lower bound. We study the\nfundamental setting of a Binomial distribution, and provide an optimal\nalgorithm which uses $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ samples. Diakonikolas, Kane and Stewart\n[COLT'16] showed a lower bound of $\\Omega(2^{1/\\epsilon})$ samples to learn the\n$p_i$'s within error $\\epsilon$. The question whether sampling from powers of\nPBDs can reduce this sampling complexity, has a negative answer since we show\nthat the exponential number of samples is inevitable. Having sampling access to\nthe powers of a PBD we then give a nearly optimal algorithm that learns its\n$p_i$'s.

Since mcount, and also msum on\npositive numbers, are monotonic in the lattice of set-containment, they\npreserve the fixpoint semantics of Horn Clauses. However, in many applications\nof practical interest, their use can lead to inefficiencies, that can be\neliminated by combining them with max, whereby mcount and msum become the\nstandard count and sum. Therefore, the semantics and optimization techniques of\nDatalog are extended to recursive programs with min, max, count and sum, making\npossible the advanced applications of superior performance and scalability\ndemonstrated by BigDatalog (Shkapsky et al. 2016) and Datalog-MC (Yang et al.\n2017). This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 06:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

This\narchitecture concatenates a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with a\nstandard belief-propagation (BP) decoder. The standard BP decoder is used to\nestimate the coded bits, followed by a CNN to remove the estimation errors of\nthe BP decoder and obtain a more accurate estimation of the channel noise.\nIterating between BP and CNN will gradually improve the decoding SNR and hence\nresult in better decoding performance. To train a well-behaved CNN model, we\ndefine a new loss function which involves not only the accuracy of the noise\nestimation but also the normality test for the estimation errors, i.e., to\nmeasure how likely the estimation errors follow a Gaussian distribution. The\nintroduction of the normality test to the CNN training shapes the residual\nnoise distribution and further reduces the BER of the iterative decoding,\ncompared to using the standard quadratic loss function. We carry out extensive\nexperiments to analyze and verify the proposed framework. The iterative BP-CNN\ndecoder has better BER performance with lower complexity, is suitable for\nparallel implementation, does not rely on any specific channel model or\nencoding method, and is robust against training mismatches. All of these\nfeatures make it a good candidate for decoding modern channel codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In order to obtain accurate\nestimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ\nstatistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a\ntree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions\nabout the evolutionary mechanisms involved.

The analysis of neural synchronization\nnaturally leads to the study of repetitive spiking and consequently to the\nanalysis of coupled neural oscillators. Coupled oscillator theory thus informs\nthe synchronization of spiking neuronal networks. A crucial aspect of coupled\noscillator theory is the phase response curve (PRC), which describes the impact\nof a perturbation to the phase of an oscillator. In neural terms, the\nperturbation represents an incoming synaptic potential which may either advance\nor retard the timing of the next spike. The phase response curves and the form\nof coupling between reciprocally coupled oscillators defines the phase\ninteraction function, which in turn predicts the synchronization outcome\n(in-phase versus anti-phase) and the rate of convergence. We review the two\nclasses of PRC and demonstrate the utility of the phase model in predicting\nsynchronization in reciprocally coupled neural models. In addition, we compare\nthe rate of convergence for all combinations of reciprocally coupled Class I\nand Class II oscillators. These findings predict the general synchronization\noutcomes of broad classes of neurons under both inhibitory and excitatory\nreciprocal coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

In the presence of a flow field, in addition to fluid\nviscous stresses on the particle, nematic-induced elastic stresses are exerted\nas a result of the anchoring conditions.

Segmenting individual trees in natural\ndeciduous forests however remained a challenge because of the complex and\nmulti-layered canopy. In this chapter, we present (i) a robust segmentation\nmethod that avoids a priori assumptions about the canopy structure, (ii) a\nvertical canopy stratification procedure that improves segmentation of\nunderstory trees, (iii) an occlusion model for estimating the point density of\neach canopy stratum, and (iv) a distributed computing approach for efficient\nprocessing at the forest level. When applied to the University of Kentucky\nRobinson Forest, the segmentation method detected about 90% of overstory and\n47% of understory trees with over-segmentation rates of 14% and 2%. Stratifying\nthe canopy improved the detection rate of understory trees to 68% at the cost\nof increasing their over-segmentations to 16%. According to our occlusion\nmodel, a point density of ~170 pt/m-sqr is needed to segment understory trees\nas accurately as overstory trees.

Atm is an\nold-fashioned device. However, it allows us to speak about relativity of\nmotion, principle of equivalence, inertial and non-inertial frames of\nreference, general covariance and invariance under coordinate transformations.\nBesides, it also provides experimental support for our theoretical models. We\nhave started with coordinate transformations and inertial and non inertial\nreference frames followed by the principle of equivalence. The composed Atm was\nworked out in the following. We calculate the acceleration in the machine\napplying Newton's Laws to describe its dynamics in an inertial frame on the\nfixed pulley center and in a non-inertial one on the moving pulley center.\nCoordinate transformations mapping inertial frame solutions in non-inertial\nones and vice-versa allow students catch on relativity concepts and the role\nplayed by general covariance. A comparison between these solutions showed the\nimportance of the principle of equivalence in the evaluation of the intensity\nof gravity locally. In addition, according to this coordinate transformation\nthe non-inertial reference frame equations of motion are equivalent to one\nsingle Atm plus one falling mass. Our results have also shown, in agreement\nwith experimental outcomes, that after movement starts single Atm becomes\nlighter than $m_{3}$ mass, consequently $m_{3}$ mass is falling.
