Yet the impact that pipelining and response\nmultiplexing actually have in estimating HTTP response sizes has not been\nadequately investigated. In this paper we set out to help understand the effect\nof pipelining and response multiplexing in estimating the size of web objects\non the Internet.

We gather evidence on and discuss\nreasons for the limited amount of pipelining and response multiplexing used on\nthe Internet today: only 29% of the HTTP2 web objects we observe are pipelined\nand only 5% multiplexed. We also provide worst case results under different\nattack assumptions and show how effective a simple model for estimating\nresponse sizes from TLS record sizes can be. Our conclusion is that pipelining\nand especially response multiplexing can yield, as expected, a perceivable\nincrease in relative object size estimation error yet the limited extent of\nmultiplexing observed on the Internet today and the relative simplicity of\nattacks to the current pipelining mechanisms hinder their ability to help\nprevent web object size estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 16:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

It is\ndemonstrated that the validity range of such approximation is strictly limited\nto $\\sqrt{s}/\\Lambda > \\exp(\\pi/2) \\simeq 4.81$ and that it converges rather\nslowly when the energy scale approaches this value. The spectral function\nrequired for the proper calculation of the R-ratio is explicitly derived and\nits properties at the higher-loop levels are studied. The developed method of\ncalculation of the spectral function enables one to obtain the explicit\nexpression for the latter at an arbitrary loop level. By making use of the\nderived spectral function the proper expression for the R-ratio is calculated\nup to the five-loop level and its properties are examined. It is shown that the\nloop convergence of the proper expression for the R-ratio is better than that\nof its commonly employed approximation. The impact of the omitted higher-order\n$\\pi^2$-terms on the latter is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 17:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 14:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

On the other hand, the\nwave-particle duality associates a space-time recurrence to the elementary\nparticle energy-momentum. Paraphrasing these two fundamental principles,\nElementary Cycles Theory postulates that every isolated elementary constituent\nof nature (every elementary particle) must be characterized by persistent\nintrinsic space-time periodicity. Elementary particles are the elementary\nreference clocks of Nature. The space-time periodicity is determined by the\nkinematical state (energy and momentum), so that interactions imply\nmodulations, and every system is decomposable in terms of modulated elementary\ncycles. Undulatory mechanics is imposed as constraint \"overdetermining\"\nrelativistic mechanics, similarly to Einstein's proposal of unification.\nSurprisingly this mathematically proves that the unification of quantum and\nrelativistic physics is fully achieved by imposing an intrinsically cyclic (or\ncompact) nature for relativistic space-time coordinates. In particular the\nMinkowskian time must be cyclic. The resulting classical mechanics are in fact\nfully consistent with relativity and reproduces all the fundamental aspects of\nquantum-relativistic mechanics without explicit quantization. This\n\"overdetermination\" just enforces both the local nature of relativistic\nspace-time and the wave-particle duality. It also implies a fully\ngeometrodynamical formulation of gauge interactions which, similarly to gravity\nand general relativity, is inferred as modulations of the elementary space-time\nclocks.

This is perhaps the most basic question faced\nwhen tackling a new supervised learning problem. We present an Evolutionary\nDeep Learning (EDL) algorithm that automatically solves this by identifying the\nquestion type with high accuracy, along with a proposed deep architecture.\nTypically, a significant amount of human insight and preparation is required\nprior to executing machine learning algorithms. For example, when creating deep\nneural networks, the number of parameters must be selected in advance and\nfurthermore, a lot of these choices are made based upon pre-existing knowledge\nof the data such as the use of a categorical cross entropy loss function.\nHumans are able to study a dataset and decide whether it represents a\nclassification or a regression problem, and consequently make decisions which\nwill be applied to the execution of the neural network. We propose the\nAutomated Problem Identification (API) algorithm, which uses an evolutionary\nalgorithm interface to TensorFlow to manipulate a deep neural network to decide\nif a dataset represents a classification or a regression problem. We test API\non 16 different classification, regression and sentiment analysis datasets with\nup to 10,000 features and up to 17,000 unique target values.

The new EMRI model is then\nused to quantify the constraints that LISA observations of EMRIs may be able to\nplace on the deviations, or bumps, on the Kerr metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 18:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 09:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

We give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for general Kuramoto phase models to be gradient or Hamiltonian\nflows in this metric. This allows us to identify several new infinite families\nof hyperbolic gradient or Hamiltonian Kuramoto oscillator networks which\ntherefore have simple dynamics with respect to this geometry.

Following disk formation,\nthe disk likely relaxes into an inner zone characterized by asymmetric field\nconfiguration across the midplane that smoothly transitions to a more symmetric\nouter zone. Angular momentum transport is driven by both MHD winds and laminar\nMaxwell stress, with both accretion and decretion flows present at different\nheights, and modestly asymmetric winds from the two disk sides. With\nanti-aligned field polarity, weakly magnetized disks settle into an asymmetric\nfield configuration with supersonic accretion flow concentrated at one side of\ndisk surface, and highly asymmetric winds between the two disk sides. In all\ncases, the wind is magneto-thermal in nature characterized by mass loss rate\nexceeding the accretion rate. More strongly magnetized disks give more\nsymmetric field configuration and flow structures. Deeper far-UV penetration\nleads to stronger and less stable outflows. Implications for observations and\nplanet formation are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 18:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

It has long been known\nthat dense environments host high fractions of early-type galaxies and low\nfractions of late-type galaxies, indicating that the environment affects the\nstructural evolution of galaxies. In this paper we present an analysis of the\nmorphological composition of red sequence galaxies in a sample of 9 galaxy\nclusters at $0.8<z<1.5$ drawn from the HAWK-I cluster survey (HCS), with the\naim of investigating the evolutionary paths of galaxies with different\nmorphologies. We classify galaxies according to their apparent bulge-to-total\nlight ratio and compare with red sequence galaxies from the lower-redshift\nWINGS and EDisCS surveys. We find that, while the HCS red sequence is dominated\nby elliptical galaxies at all luminosities and stellar masses, the WINGS red\nsequence is dominated by elliptical galaxies only at its bright end\n($M_V<-21.0$ mag), while S0s become the most frequent class at fainter\nluminosities.

In particular, while the\nlocation of the seizure onset area is usually in-variant across seizures in a\nsame patient, the source of traveling (2-3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs)\nduring seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or\nremain stationary at the seizure onset area. In addition, although most focal\nseizures terminate quasi-synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into\ndistinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. To provide a unifying\nperspective on the observed diversity of spatiotemporal dynamics for seizure\nspread and termination, we introduce here the Epileptor neural field model. Two\nmechanisms play an essential role. First, while the slow ictal wavefront\npropagates as a front in excitable neural media, the faster SWDs propagation\nresults from coupled-oscillator dynamics. Second, multiple time scales interact\nduring seizure spread, allowing for low-voltage fast-activity (>10 Hz) to\nhamper seizure spread and for SWD propagation to affect the way a seizure\nterminates. These dynamics, together with variations in short and long-range\nconnectivity strength, play a central role on seizure spread, maintenance and\ntermination. We demonstrate how Epileptor field models incorporating the above\nmechanisms predict the previously reported diversity in seizure spread\npatterns. Furthermore, we confirm the predictions for synchronous or\nasynchronous (clustered) seizure termination in human seizures recorded via\nstereotactic EEG. Our new insights into seizure spatiotemporal dynamics may\nalso contribute to the development of new closed-loop neuromodulation therapies\nfor focal epilepsy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 22:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The reason of this distinctive feature in the semimajor-axis\ndistribution has been theorized to be the result of the stellar evolution\nand/or due to the effect of a different formation/evolution scenario for\nplanets around intermediate-mass stars.

A potential game approach has been applied to addressing\ndistributed implementation of decision making for cooperative sensor planning.\nWhen a sensor network involves a large number of sensing agents, the local\nutility function for a sensing agent is hard to compute, because the local\nutility function depends on the other agents' decisions while each sensing\nagent is inherently faced with limitations in both its communication and\ncomputational capabilities. Accordingly, a local utility function for each\nagent should be approximated to accommodate limitations in information\ngathering and processing. We propose an approximation method for a local\nutility function using only a portion of the decisions of other agents. The\npart of the decisions that each agent considers is called the neighboring set\nfor the agent. The error induced by the approximation is also analyzed, and to\nkeep the error small we propose a neighbor selection algorithm that chooses the\nneighbor set for each agent in a greedy way. The selection algorithm is based\non the correlation information between one agent's measurement selection and\nthe other agents' selections.

We show that the empirical\nmeasure associated to the particle positions at a fixed time $t$ converges to\nan absolutely continuous measure with density $\\psi(\\cdot,t)$, as $N\\to\\infty$.\nThe limit $\\psi$ is solution of a free boundary problem (FBP) when this\nsolution exists.

Some industrial IoT applications require\ningesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently\ningested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems suited\nto multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even\nif they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large\nnumber of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we\nevaluate a single-node multidimensional data store for high-velocity sensor\ndata. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the\nglobal index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized\nkd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and\nrange queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage\nfootprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and\noffers ingress rates two orders of magnitude higher than those of Percona\nServer, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times\ncomparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares\nfavorably in terms of storage footprint. In addition, we evaluate a kd-tree\npartitioning based scheme for grouping incoming streamed data records. Compared\nto a random scheme, this scheme produces less overlap between groups of\nstreamed records, but contrary to what we expected, such reduced overlap does\nnot translate into better query performance. By contrast, the local indices\nprove much more beneficial to query performance. We believe the experience\nreported in this paper is valuable to practitioners and researchers alike\ninterested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 06:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

In many practical applications, one needs to draw inference from one\nor few large sparse networks. The present paper studies hypothesis testing of\ngraphs in this high-dimensional regime, where the goal is to test between two\npopulations of inhomogeneous random graphs defined on the same set of $n$\nvertices. The size of each population $m$ is much smaller than $n$, and can\neven be a constant as small as 1. The critical question in this context is\nwhether the problem is solvable for small $m$.\n  We answer this question from a minimax testing perspective. Let $P,Q$ be the\npopulation adjacencies of two sparse inhomogeneous random graph models, and $d$\nbe a suitably defined distance function. Given a population of $m$ graphs from\neach model, we derive minimax separation rates for the problem of testing $P=Q$\nagainst $d(P,Q)>\\rho$. We observe that if $m$ is small, then the minimax\nseparation is too large for some popular choices of $d$, including total\nvariation distance between corresponding distributions. This implies that some\nmodels that are widely separated in $d$ cannot be distinguished for small $m$,\nand hence, the testing problem is generally not solvable in these cases.\n  We also show that if $m>1$, then the minimax separation is relatively small\nif $d$ is the Frobenius norm or operator norm distance between $P$ and $Q$. For\n$m=1$, only the latter distance provides small minimax separation. Thus, for\nthese distances, the problem is solvable for small $m$. We also present\nnear-optimal two-sample tests in both cases, where tests are adaptive with\nrespect to sparsity level of the graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 07:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 13:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 12:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 13:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Objective: In this paper, we\nreport on our experience with different sampling strategies we employed,\nhighlight ethical issues, and motivate the need to maintain a collection of key\ndemographics about software developers to ease the assessment of the external\nvalidity of studies. Method: Our report is based on data from two studies we\nconducted in the past. Results: Contacting developers over public media proved\nto be the most effective and efficient sampling strategy. However, we not only\ndescribe the perspective of researchers who are interested in reaching goals\nlike a large number of participants or a high response rate, but we also shed\nlight onto ethical implications of different sampling strategies. We present\none specific ethical guideline and point to debates in other research\ncommunities to start a discussion in the software engineering research\ncommunity about which sampling strategies should be considered ethical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 07:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

This makes them also maximally recoverable (MR)\ncodes, another class of locally repairable codes. It is known that MR codes in\ngeneral, and PMDS codes in particular, exist for any set of parameters, if the\nfield size is large enough. Moreover, some explicit constructions of PMDS codes\nare known, mostly (but not always) with a strong restriction on the number of\nerasures that can be corrected per locality group.

The common\napproach is to identify models with different orders and cluster similar modes\ntogether. However, most proposed methods based on this approach suffer from\nhigh-dimensional optimization problems in either the estimation or clustering\nstep. To overcome this problem, this study presents an algorithm for autonomous\nmodal parameter estimation in which the only required optimization is performed\nin a three-dimensional space. To this end, a subspace-based identification\nmethod is employed for the estimation and a non-iterative correlation-based\nmethod is used for the clustering. This clustering is at the heart of the\npaper. The keys to success are correlation metrics that are able to treat the\nproblems of spatial eigenvector aliasing and nonunique eigenvectors of\ncoalescent modes simultaneously. The algorithm commences by the identification\nof an excessively high-order model from frequency response function test data.\nThe high number of modes of this model provide bases for two subspaces: one for\nlikely physical modes and one for its complement dubbed the subspace of noise\nmodes. By employing the bootstrap resampling technique, several subsets are\ngenerated from the same basic dataset and for each of them a model is\nidentified to form a set of models. Then, by correlation analysis, highly\ncorrelated modes of these models which appear repeatedly are clustered together\nand the noise modes are collected in a so-called Trashbox cluster. Stray noise\nmodes attracted to the mode clusters are trimmed away by correlation analysis.\nThe final step is a fuzzy c-means clustering procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 08:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

However, it is impossible or almost impossible to\nrewrite data with such devices. Thus, scale-out storage using such devices\ncannot use standard data-distribution algorithms because they rewrite data for\nmoving between servers constituting the scale-out storage when the server\nconfiguration is changed. Although using rewritable devices for scale-out\nstorage, when server capacity is huge, rewriting data is very hard when server\nconstitution is changed. In this paper, a data-distribution algorithm called\nSequential Checking is proposed, which can be used for scale-out storage\ncomposed of devices that are hardly able to rewrite data. Sequential Checking\n1) does not need to move data between servers when the server configuration is\nchanged, 2) distribute data, the amount of which depends on the server's\nvolume, 3) select a unique server when datum is written, and 4) select servers\nwhen datum is read (there are few such server(s) in most cases) and find out a\nunique server that stores the newest datum from them. These basic\ncharacteristics were confirmed through proofs and simulations. Data can be read\nby accessing 1.98 servers on average from a storage comprising 256 servers\nunder a realistic condition. And it is confirmed by evaluations in real\nenvironment that access time is acceptable. Sequential Checking makes selecting\nscale-out storage using tape or optical devices or using huge capacity servers\nrealistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 10:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

In this work, which is a continuation of a\nrecent study (Paper I), additional models of compact stellar clusters with\ninitial masses $\\lesssim10^5M_\\odot$ and also those with small fractions of\nprimordial binaries ($\\lesssim10$%) are evolved for long term, applying the\ndirect N-body approach, assuming state-of-the-art stellar-wind and\nremnant-formation prescriptions. That way, a substantially broader range of\ncomputed models than that in Paper I is achieved. As in Paper I, the\ngeneral-relativistic BBH mergers continue to be mostly mediated by triples that\nare bound to the clusters rather than happen among the ejected BBHs. In fact,\nthe number of such in situ BBH mergers, per cluster, tend to increase\nsignificantly with the introduction of a small population of primordial\nbinaries. Despite the presence of massive primordial binaries, the merging\nBBHs, especially the in situ ones, are found to be exclusively dynamically\nassembled and hence would be spin-orbit misaligned.

However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown\nquantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical\ntravelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been\nrecognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum\nnetworks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous\nteleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance\non the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or\nterrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a\nglobal-scale \"quantum internet\" is to significantly extend the range for\nteleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite\nplatform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points\non the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons'\npropagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum\nteleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to\na low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up\nto 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric\nturbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a\ncompact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam\ndivergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking\n(APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in\nmutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the\nclassical limit.

By\nconsidering the graphene based superconductor as an entangler device, instead\nof normal (2D) BCS superconductor, we show that the Cooper pair splitting\ncurrent mediated by Crossed Andreev process is amplified compared to its normal\nsuperconductor counterpart. This amplification is attributed to the strong\nsuppression of local normal Andreev reflection process (arising from the Cooper\npair splitting) from the graphene based superconductor to lead via the same\nquantum dot, in comparison to the usual 2D superconductor. Due to the vanishing\ndensity of states at the Dirac point of undoped graphene, a doped graphene\nbased superconductor is considered here and it is observed that Cooper pair\nsplitting current is very insensitive to the doping level in comparison to the\nusual 2D superconductor. The transport process of non-local spin entangled\nelectrons also depends on the type of pairing i.e. whether the electron-hole\npairing is on-site, inter-sublattice or the combination of both. The\ninter-sublattice pairing of graphene causes the maximum non-local Cooper pair\nsplitting current, whereas presence of both pairing reduces the Cooper pair\nsplitting current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 12:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 16:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

On\nthe other hand, some claims that the lack of such stars stems from metal\nenrichment of their surface by accretion of heavy elements from interstellar\nmedium (ISM). We investigate effects of the stellar wind on the metal accretion\nonto low-mass PopIII stars because accretion of the local ISM onto the Sun is\nprevented by the solar wind even for neutrals.

Once\nthe magnetosphere is formed, most of neutral interstellar particles are\nphotoionized before reaching to the stellar surface and are blown away by the\nwind.

In these areas, it is often required to process queries for\nlarge graphs. Some of the most common graph queries are navigational queries.\nThe result of query evaluation is a set of implicit relations between nodes of\nthe graph, i.e. paths in the graph. A natural way to specify these relations is\nby specifying paths using formal grammars over the alphabet of edge labels. An\nanswer to a context-free path query in this approach is usually a set of\ntriples (A, m, n) such that there is a path from the node m to the node n,\nwhose labeling is derived from a non-terminal A of the given context-free\ngrammar. This type of queries is evaluated using the relational query\nsemantics. Another example of path query semantics is the single-path query\nsemantics which requires presenting a single path from the node m to the node\nn, whose labeling is derived from a non-terminal A for all triples (A, m, n)\nevaluated using the relational query semantics. There is a number of algorithms\nfor query evaluation which use these semantics but all of them perform poorly\non large graphs. One of the most common technique for efficient big data\nprocessing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform\ncomputations, but these algorithms do not allow to use this technique\nefficiently. In this paper, we show how the context-free path query evaluation\nusing these query semantics can be reduced to the calculation of the matrix\ntransitive closure. Also, we propose an algorithm for context-free path query\nevaluation which uses relational query semantics and is based on matrix\noperations that make it possible to speed up computations by using a GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 14:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 11:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Since the publication of the classic\nErd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa theorem in 1965, this problem received significant scientific\nattention in the fields of Graph Theory and Algorithm Design. In particular,\nthis problem is one of the first problems studied in the framework of\nParameterized Complexity. The non-uniform fixed-parameter tractability of Cycle\nPacking follows from the Robertson-Seymour theorem, a fact already observed by\nFellows and Langston in the 1980s. In 1994, Bodlaender showed that Cycle\nPacking can be solved in time $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot |V|$ using exponential\nspace. In case a solution exists, Bodlaender's algorithm also outputs a\nsolution (in the same time).

The standard method for modelling the structures that these\nsurveys will observe is to use cosmological perturbation theory for linear\nstructures on horizon-sized scales, and Newtonian gravity for non-linear\nstructures on much smaller scales. We propose a two-parameter formalism that\ngeneralizes this approach, thereby allowing interactions between large and\nsmall scales to be studied in a self-consistent and well-defined way. This uses\nboth post-Newtonian gravity and cosmological perturbation theory, and can be\nused to model realistic cosmological scenarios including matter, radiation and\na cosmological constant. We find that the resulting field equations can be\nwritten as a hierarchical set of perturbation equations. At leading-order,\nthese equations allow us to recover a standard set of Friedmann equations, as\nwell as a Newton-Poisson equation for the inhomogeneous part of the Newtonian\nenergy density in an expanding background. For the perturbations in the\nlarge-scale cosmology, however, we find that the field equations are sourced by\nboth non-linear and mode-mixing terms, due to the existence of small-scale\nstructures. These extra terms should be expected to give rise to new\ngravitational effects, through the mixing of gravitational modes on small and\nlarge scales - effects that are beyond the scope of standard linear\ncosmological perturbation theory. We expect our formalism to be useful for\naccurately modelling gravitational physics in universes that contain non-linear\nstructures, and for investigating the effects of non-linear gravity in the era\nof ultra-large-scale surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 15:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 11:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 13:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 13:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 12:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 16:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 11:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

In a recent work, we considered acknowledgment-based protocols,\nwhere a user gets feedback from the channel only when she attempts\ntransmission. In this case she will learn whether her transmission was\nsuccessful or not. One of the main results of ESA2016 was that no\nacknowledgment-based protocol can be in equilibrium. In fact, it seems that\nmany natural acknowledgment-based protocols fail to prevent users from\nunilaterally switching to persistent protocols that always transmit with\nprobability 1. It is therefore natural to ask how powerful a protocol must be\nso that it can beat persistent deviators.\n  In this paper we consider age-based protocols, which can be described by a\nsequence of probabilities of transmitting in each time step. Those\nprobabilities are given beforehand and do not change based on the transmission\nhistory. We present a 3-player age-based protocol that can prevent users from\nunilaterally deviating to a persistent protocol in order to decrease their\nexpected transmission time. It is worth noting that the answer to this question\ndoes not follow from the results and proof ideas of ESA2016. Our protocol is\nnon-trivial, in the sense that, when all players use it, finite expected\ntransmission time is guaranteed. In fact, we show that this protocol is\npreferable to any deadline protocol in which, after some fixed time, attempt\ntransmission with probability 1 in every subsequent step. An advantage of our\nprotocol is that it is very simple to describe, and users only need a counter\nto keep track of time. Whether there exist $n$-player age-based protocols that\ndo not use counters and can prevent persistence is left as an open problem for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 10:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

These measurements, however, are\ncritical to constrain the nature of sGRB progenitors, their redshift\ndistribution and the $r$-process element enrichment history of the universe.\nHere, we present spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB111117A and measure its\nredshift to be $z = 2.211$. This makes GRB111117A the most distant\nhigh-confidence short duration GRB detected to date. Our spectroscopic redshift\nsupersedes a lower, previously estimated photometric redshift value for this\nburst. We use the spectroscopic redshift, as well as new imaging data to\nconstrain the nature of the host galaxy and the physical parameters of the GRB.\nThe rest-frame X-ray derived hydrogen column density, for example, is the\nhighest compared to a complete sample of sGRBs and seems to follow the\nevolution with redshift as traced by the hosts of long GRBs (lGRBs). The host\nlies in the brighter end of the expected sGRB host brightness distribution at\n$z = 2.211$, and is actively forming stars. Using the host as a benchmark for\nredshift determination, we find that between 43 and 71 per cent of all sGRB\nredshifts should be missed due to host faintness for hosts at $z\\sim2$. The\nhigh redshift of GRB111117A is evidence against a lognormal delay-time model\nfor sGRBs through the predicted redshift distribution of sGRBs, which is very\nsensitive to high-$z$ sGRBs. From the age of the universe at the time of GRB\nexplosion, an initial neutron star (NS) separation of $a_0 < 3.2~R_\\odot$ is\nrequired in the case where the progenitor system is a circular pair of\ninspiralling NSs.

Aims. Within the framework of ideal MHD, the main\naim of this work is to investigate small amplitude incompressible wave modes of\ntwisted magnetic flux tubes with m more or equal 1. The axial magnetic field\nstrength inside and outside the tube will be allowed to vary, to ensure the\nresults will not be restricted to only cold plasma equilibria conditions.\nMethods. The dispersion equation for these incompressible linear MHD wave modes\nwas derived analytically by implementing the long wavelength approximation.\nResults. It is shown, in the long wavelength limit, that both the frequency and\nradial velocity profile of the m = 1 kink mode are completely unaffected by the\nchoice of internal background magnetic twist. However, fluting modes with m\nmore or equal 2 are sensitive to the particular radial profile of magnetic\ntwist chosen. Furthermore, due to background twist, a low frequency cut-off is\nintroduced for fluting modes that is not present for kink modes. From an\nobservational point of view, although magnetic twist does not affect the\npropagation of long wavelength kink modes, for fluting modes it will either\nwork for or against the propagation, depending on the direction of wave travel\nrelative to the sign of the background twist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 23:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The tool of choice in\nthis context is the universal coefficient theorem linking cohomology theories\nwith coefficients that reveal respectively hide certain topological features.\nAs a consequence of these observations, it is shown that the same theorem is\ncapable of linking perturbative with non-perturbative string theoretical\ndomains.

Conventional\nscanning electron microscopic (SEM) is used to fabricate the grating structures\non the silver halide based film (substrate) by exposing the electron beam in\nraster scan fashion. Morphological characterization of the gratings is\nperformed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the period, height and\nprofile depends on the line per frame, beam spot, single line dwell time, beam\ncurrent, and accelerating voltage of the electron beam. Optical transmission\nspectra of 10 micrometer period grating shows a well-defined localized surface\nplasmon resonance (LSPR) dip at ~366 nm wavelength corresponding to gelatin\nembedded silver nanoparticles of the grating structure. As the period of the\ngrating reduces LSPR dip becomes prominent. The maximum first order diffraction\nefficiency (DE) and bandwidth for 10 micrometer period grating are observed as\n4% and 400 nm in 350 nm to 800 nm wavelength range respectively. The DE and\nbandwidth are reduced up to 0.03% and 100 nm for 3.4 micrometer period grating.\nThe profile of DE is significantly flat within the diffraction bandwidth for\neach of the gratings. An assessment of the particular role of LSPR absorption\nand varied grating period in the development of the profile of first order DE\nv/s wavelength are studied. Fabrication of such nano-scale structures in a\nlarge area using conventional SEM and silver halide based films may provide the\nsimple and efficient technique for various optical devices applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 09:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}
