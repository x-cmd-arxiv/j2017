A very\nsimilar physical picture can be used to describe QCD states containing heavy\nquarks as well as light-quarks or gluonic excitations. In this work, we derive\nthe Born--Oppenheimer approximation for QED molecular systems in an effective\nfield theory framework by sequentially integrating out degrees of freedom\nliving at energies above the typical energy scale where the dynamics of the\nheavy degrees of freedom occurs.

In the effective field theory the scaling of all\nthe operators is homogeneous, which facilitates the determination of all the\nrelevant contributions, an observation that may become useful for\nhigh-precision calculations. Using the above case as a guidance, we construct\nunder some conditions an effective field theory for QCD states formed by a\ncolor-octet heavy quark-antiquark pair bound with a color-octet light-quark\npair or excited gluonic state, highlighting the similarities and differences\nbetween the QED and QCD systems.

The effective Liouville shows the\ndynamical breaking of time reversibility. This breaking of reversibility is\nexpressed by the effective Liouville's discrete spectrum having negative\nimaginary parts. This generated dynamics of open quantum systems is capable of\nmemory effects described by a frequency dependence of the spectrum. When memory\neffects can be neglected or smoothed out, the effective Liouville generates the\nwell known semi-group dynamics of open systems in the Markov approximation. The\nspectral analysis of the effective Liouville -with or without memory- allows to\nrepresent the quantum dynamical map and expectation values of physical\nquantities by metric expressions using complex eigenvalues and bi-orthonormal\neigenmodes. The long time dynamics is dominated by the zero-mode, which forms\nthe stationary state of the open system. The relaxation time scale $\\tau$ is\nset by the inverse of the smallest negative imaginary part of the non-vanishing\neffective eigenvalues of the effective Liouville. In generic cases of\nsystem-environment-coupling this time scale $\\tau$ is the relevant scale for\nboth, the relaxation of diagonal elements (populations) and the decay of\noff-diagonal elements (coherences) of an initial density matrix in the\nstationary state's diagonal representation. It also sets the time scale after\nwhich the entropy tends to its stationary value. The effective Liouville and\nits spectral content thus give a framework to study the dynamic breaking of\ntime reversibility, memory effects, decoherence, relaxation to a stationary\nstate and the role of entropy in open quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 19:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

This feature decorrelation is achieved by enforcing an\nexact decorrelation constraint; these models are thus computationally expensive\ndue to the matrix inversion or SVD operations required for exact decorrelation\nat each training iteration. Furthermore, the decorrelation step is often\nseparated from the gradient descent based optimisation, resulting in\nsub-optimal solutions.

Leakage is undesirable as it\ntypically leads to higher out-of-network cost for patient and increases barrier\nfor care coordination, which is particularly problematic for Accountable Care\nOrganization (ACO) as the in-network providers are financially responsible for\npatient quality and outcome. We aim to design a data-driven method to identify\nnaturally occurring provider networks driven by diabetic patient choices, and\nunderstand the relationship among provider composition, patient composition,\nand service leakage pattern. We construct a healthcare provider network based\non patients' historical medical insurance claims. A community detection\nalgorithm is used to identify naturally occurring communities of collaborating\nproviders. Finally, import-export analysis is conducted to benchmark their\nleakage pattern and identify further leakage reduction opportunity. The design\nyields six major provider communities with diverse profiles. Some communities\nare geographically concentrated, while others tend to draw patients with\ncertain diabetic co-morbidities. Providers from the same healthcare institution\nare likely to be assigned to the same community. While most communities have\nhigh within-community utilization and spending, at 85% and 86% respectively,\nleakage still persists. Hence, we utilize a metric from import-export analysis\nto detect leakage, gaining insight on how to minimizing leakage. In conclusion,\nwe identify patient-driven provider organization by surfacing providers who\nshare a large number of patients. By analyzing the import-export behavior of\neach identified community using a novel approach and profiling community\npatient and provider composition we understand the key features of having a\nbalanced number of PCP and specialists and provider heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 21:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

Nevertheless, the complete characterization of the stable\nthroughput region for such system is notoriously difficult, since the\ncomputation of the steady state distribution of the two-dimensional Markov\nChain (MC) model for both finite queues is prohibitively complex. We first\npropose an algorithm to characterize the stable throughput region numerically,\nand show its sheer computational complexity for large queue lengths. To lend\ntractability and explore the nature of design parameters optimization at the\ncognitive node, we next focus on two simpler systems, namely, finite battery\nqueue with infinite relay queue and finite relay queue with infinite battery\nqueue (referred henceforth as dominant system $1$ and $2$, respectively).

HMMER, a suite of bioinformatics tools, is widely\nused for the analysis of homologous protein and nucleotide sequences with high\nsensitivity, based on profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Its latest version,\nHMMER3, introdues a heuristic pipeline to accelerate the alignment process,\nwhich is carried out on central processing units (CPUs) with the support of\nstreaming SIMD extensions (SSE) instructions. Few acceleration results have\nsince been reported based on HMMER3. In this paper, we propose a five-tiered\nparallel framework, CUDAMPF++, to accelerate the most computationally intensive\nstages of HMMER3's pipeline, multiple/single segment Viterbi (MSV/SSV), on a\nsingle graphics processing unit (GPU). As an architecture-aware design, the\nproposed framework aims to fully utilize hardware resources via exploiting\nfiner-grained parallelism (multi-sequence alignment) compared with its\npredecessor (CUDAMPF).

The ultimate goal for them to become an\naugmented reality interface has not yet been attained due to an encumbrance of\ncontrols. Augmented reality involves superimposing interactive computer\ngraphics images onto physical objects in the real world. This survey reviews\ncurrent research issues in the area of human computer interaction for smart\nglasses. The survey first studies the smart glasses available in the market and\nafterwards investigates the interaction methods proposed in the wide body of\nliterature. The interaction methods can be classified into hand-held, touch,\nand touchless input. This paper mainly focuses on the touch and touchless\ninput. Touch input can be further divided into on-device and on-body, while\ntouchless input can be classified into hands-free and freehand. Next, we\nsummarize the existing research efforts and trends, in which touch and\ntouchless input are evaluated by a total of eight interaction goals. Finally,\nwe discuss several key design challenges and the possibility of multi-modal\ninput for smart glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 05:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

In this model, we make the assumption\nthat the dust grains follow the same dynamics as the structures. We perform\nnumerical simulations of test particle trajectories to explore the available\nparameter space, in particular the radial location $R_{0}$ of the dust\nproducing parent body and the size of the dust grains as parameterized by\n$\\beta$ (ratio of stellar wind and radiation pressure forces over gravitation).\nWe consider both the case of a static and an orbiting parent body. We find\nthat, for all considered scenarii, there is always a set of ($R_0, \\beta$)\nparameters able to fit the observed features. The common characteristics of\nthese solutions is that they all require a high value of $\\beta$, of around 6.\nThis means that the star is probably very active and the grains composing the\nstructures are sub-micronic, in order to reach such high $\\beta$ values.

Using a perturbation method, the governing\nequations which depend on one Bond number $Bo$ are derived for a liquid film\nflow down the outside of a horizontal cylinder and a sphere. They can be\nsimplified to one-dimensional form due to the symmetries. The general structure\nof the two-dimensional and axisymmetric capillary waves under high $Bo$\ncondition is focused on. An asymptotic theory is used to solve for the\nfree-surface profiles in the outer and inner region, respectively. Even though\nthe evolution in the outer region is essentially different, there are inherent\nsimilarities in the inner region because the capillary ridges are proved to\ndegenerate into the one-parameter family in high $Bo$ limit. Using appropriate\nnumerical techniques, some parametric studies are performed on the profiles of\nthe capillary waves. The spreading of the front recorded from the outer\nsolutions quantitatively accords with the scaling laws in a top region at early\ntime, but deviates obviously at later time.

It is\nbelieved that those ambiguities will be softened by including more higher-order\nterms. In the paper, to show how the renormalization scheme dependence changes\nwhen more loop terms have been included, we discuss the sensitivity of pQCD\nprediction on the scheme parameters by using the scheme-dependent $\\{\\beta_{m\n\\geq 2}\\}$-terms. We adopt two four-loop examples, $e^+ e^- \\to {\\rm hadrons}$\nand $\\tau$ decays into hadrons, for detailed analysis. Our results show that\nunder the conventional scale setting, by including more-and-more loop terms,\nthe scheme dependence of the pQCD prediction cannot be reduced as efficiently\nas that of the scale dependence. Thus a proper scale-setting approach should be\nimportant to reduce the scheme dependence.

By using supervised information, supervised hashing\ncan significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently, discrete\nsupervised hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in\nsupervised hashing. On one hand, hashing is essentially a discrete optimization\nproblem. Hence, utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete\n(binary) coding procedure can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the\naccuracy. On the other hand, deep hashing, which integrates deep feature\nlearning and hash-code learning into an end-to-end architecture, can enhance\nthe feedback between feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in\ndiscrete supervised hashing is to adopt supervised information to directly\nguide the discrete coding procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to\nadopt the supervised information to directly guide the deep feature learning\nprocedure. However, there have not existed works which can use the supervised\ninformation to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature\nlearning procedure in the same framework. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndeep hashing method, called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH), to address\nthis problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize\nsupervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and\ndeep feature learning procedure, and thus enhance the feedback between these\ntwo important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can\noutperform other state-of-the-art baselines, including both discrete hashing\nand deep hashing baselines, for image retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 15:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

However, while\ndiscussing gravitational waves emitted by an isolated system --typically in a\nlater section-- the relevant modes are extracted using a `projection operator'\nthat is local in physical space.

The main advantage of this kind\nof approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement by introducing\nmore middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n\nstages for the RK method, which is very time and memory consuming for a high\norder method. On the other hand, the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method\ncan be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy using less middle\nstages, once the time derivatives of the flux function is used.The gas kinetic\nscheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the\nsecond-order or third-order GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a\nfamily of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed. As an extension of\nthe previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages\nwill be developed in this paper. Based on the same 5th-order WENO\nreconstruction, the performance of gas kinetic schemes from the 2nd- to the\n5th-order time accurate methods will be evaluated. The results show that the\n5th-order scheme can achieve the theoretical order of accuracy for the Euler\nequations, and present accurate Navier-Stokes solutions as well due to the\ncoupling of inviscid and viscous terms in the GKS formulation. In comparison\nwith Riemann solver based 5th-order RK method, the high order GKS has\nadvantages in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, for all test\ncases. It provides a promising direction for the development of high-order CFD\nmethods for the computation of complex flows, such as turbulence and acoustics\nwith shock interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 15:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Analysis and interpretation of such data represents a challenge: the\ntiming of animal behaviors may be stochastic and modulated by kinematic\nvariables, by the interaction with the environment or with the conspecifics\nwithin the animal group, and dependent on internal cognitive or behavioral\nstate of the individual. Existing models for collective motion typically fail\nto incorporate the discrete, stochastic, and internal-state-dependent aspects\nof behavior, while models focusing on individual animal behavior typically\nignore the spatial aspects of the problem. Here we propose a probabilistic\nmodeling framework to address this gap. Each animal can switch stochastically\nbetween different behavioral states, with each state resulting in a possibly\ndifferent law of motion through space. Switching rates for behavioral\ntransitions can depend in a very general way, which we seek to identify from\ndata, on the effects of the environment as well as the interaction between the\nanimals. We represent the switching dynamics as a Generalized Linear Model and\nshow that: (i) forward simulation of multiple interacting animals is possible\nusing a variant of the Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm; (ii)\nformulated properly, the maximum likelihood inference of switching rate\nfunctions is tractably solvable by gradient descent; (iii) model selection can\nbe used to identify factors that modulate behavioral state switching and to\nappropriately adjust model complexity to data.

The multiscale\nvirtual particle model is proposed for the discretization of biomolecular\ndensity data in different scales. Essentially, the model works as the\ncoarse-graining of the biomolecular structure, so that a delicate balance\nbetween biomolecular geometric representation and computational cost can be\nachieved. To form \"connections\" between these multiscale virtual particles, a\nnew harmonic potential function, which considers the influence from both mass\ndistributions and distance relations, is adopted between any two virtual\nparticles. Unlike the previous ENMs that use a constant spring constant, a\nparticle-dependent spring parameter is used in MVP-ENM. Two independent models,\ni.e., multiscale virtual particle based Gaussian network model (MVP-GNM) and\nmultiscale virtual particle based anisotropic network model (MVP-ANM), are\nproposed. Even with a rather coarse grid and a low resolution, the MVP-GNM is\nable to predict the Debye-Waller factors (B-factors) with considerable good\naccuracy. Similar properties have also been observed in MVP-ANM. More\nimportantly, in B-factor predictions, the mismatch between the predicted\nresults and experimental ones is predominantly from higher fluctuation regions.\nFurther, it is found that MVP-ANM can deliver a very consistent low-frequency\neigenmodes in various scales. This demonstrates the great potential of MVP-ANM\nin the deformation analysis of low resolution data. With the multiscale\nrigidity function, the MVP-ENM can be applied to biomolecular data represented\nin density distribution and atomic coordinates. Further, the great advantage of\nmy MVP-ENM model in computational cost has been demonstrated by using two\npoliovirus virus structures. Finally, the paper ends with a conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 09:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}
