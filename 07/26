The\nmethodology is described, including the ensuing analysis which yields diffusion\nlengths between 70 - 85 um at room temperature for doping concentrations in the\nrange of 5 - 9 x 10^15 cm-3. The analysis also provides insight into the\nminority carrier mobility which is a parameter not commonly reported in the\nliterature. Hole mobilities on the order of 500 - 750 cm2/Vs are reported for\nthe aforementioned doping range, which are comparable albeit longer than the\nmajority hole mobility for the same doping magnitude in p-InGaAs. A radiative\nrecombination coefficient of (0.5-0.2)x10^-10 cm^-3s^-1 is also extracted from\nthe ensuing analysis for an InGaAs thickness of 2.7 um. Preliminary evidence is\nalso given for both heavy and light hole diffusion. The dark current of\nInP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors with 25 and 15 um pitches are then calibrated\nto device simulations and correlated to the extracted diffusion lengths and\ndoping concentrations. An effective Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of between\n90-200 us provides the best fit to the dark current of these structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 17:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

This paper investigates\nlive MVC video streaming over Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The goal is to\nminimize the server bandwidth costs whist ensuring high streaming quality to\npeers. MVC employs intra-view and inter-view prediction structures, which leads\nto a complicated layer dependency relationship. As the peers' outbound\nbandwidth is shared while supplying all the MVC video layers, the bandwidth\nallocation to one MVC layer affects the available outbound bandwidth of the\nother layers. To optimise the utilisation of the peers' outbound bandwidth for\nproviding video layers, a maximum flow based model is proposed which considers\nthe MVC video layer dependency and the layer supplying relationship between\npeers. Based on the model, a layer dependency aware live MVC video streaming\nmethod over a BitTorrent-like P2P network is proposed, named MVP2P. The key\ncomponents of MVP2P include a chunk scheduling strategy and a peer selection\nstrategy for receiving peers, and a bandwidth scheduling algorithm for\nsupplying peers. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, MVP2P is\ncompared with existing methods considering the constraints of peer bandwidth,\npeer numbers, view switching rates, and peer churns.

The model is based on CALPHAD thermodynamics and radiation enhanced\ndiffusion ki- netics. The thermodynamics dictates the compositional and\ntemperature dependence of the free energy reductions that drive precipitation.\nThe model treats both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, where the\nlatter occurs on cascade damage, like dislocation loops.

We clearly see that 3D\natmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses\nentropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the\ndisc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,\npotentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.\nRecycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous\nstudies. However, we also identify an \"inner core\" -- in size $\\approx$ 25% of\nthe Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much\nlower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are\nneeded to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on\nlong time-scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 16:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The proposed WSD algorithm is based\non three main steps. First, a brute-force WSD algorithm is applied to short\ncontext windows (up to 10 words) selected from the document in order to\ngenerate a short list of likely sense configurations for each window. In the\nsecond step, these local sense configurations are assembled into longer\ncomposite configurations based on suffix and prefix matching.

After each word in a collection of documents is\nrepresented as word vector using a pre-trained word embeddings model, a k-means\nalgorithm is applied on the word vectors in order to obtain a fixed-size set of\nclusters. The centroid of each cluster is interpreted as a super word embedding\nthat embodies all the semantically related word vectors in a certain region of\nthe embedding space. Every embedded word in the collection of documents is then\nassigned to the nearest cluster centroid. In the end, each document is\nrepresented as a bag of super word embeddings by computing the frequency of\neach super word embedding in the respective document. We also diverge from the\nidea of building a single vocabulary for the entire collection of documents,\nand propose to build class-specific vocabularies for better performance. Using\nthis kind of representation, we report results on two text mining tasks, namely\ntext categorization by topic and polarity classification. On both tasks, our\nmodel yields better performance than the standard bag of words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 17:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

We find that\nfew physical models lead to transients that occupy these voids. Moreover, we\nfind that only relativistic expansion can produce fast and luminous transients,\nwhile for all other heating sources, events with durations <10 days are dim (>\n-15 mag).

As a consequence, their\ndesign and deployment lacks general principles.\n  In this paper, we focus on first-time badges, which are awarded after a user\ntakes a particular type of action for the first time, and study their causal\neffect by harnessing the delayed introduction of several badges in a popular\nQ&A website. In doing so, we introduce a novel causal inference framework for\nbadges whose main technical innovations are a robust survival-based hypothesis\ntesting procedure, which controls for the utility heterogeneity across users,\nand a bootstrap difference-in-differences method, which controls for the random\nfluctuations in users' behavior over time.

Experimentally assessing the robustness\nof neural networks involves the quixotic venture of testing all the possible\nfailures, on all the possible inputs, which ultimately hits a combinatorial\nexplosion for the first, and the impossibility to gather all the possible\ninputs for the second.\n  In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the expected error of the output\nwhen a subset of neurons crashes.

This paper presents the parallel\ndevelopment for integration by axiomatizing an integral transformation, $s_A:\n!A \\to !A \\otimes A$, in a symmetric monoidal category with a coalgebra\nmodality. When integration is combined with differentiation, the two\nfundamental theorems of calculus are expected to hold (in a suitable sense): a\ndifferential category with integration which satisfies these two theorem is\ncalled a {\\em calculus category\\/}.\n  Modifying an approach to antiderivatives by T. Ehrhard, we define having\nantiderivatives as the demand that a certain natural transformation, $K: !A \\to\n!A$, is invertible. We observe that a differential category having\nantiderivatives, in this sense, is always a calculus category.\n  When the coalgebra modality is monoidal, it is natural to demand an extra\ncoherence between integration and the coalgebra modality. In the presence of\nthis extra coherence we show that a calculus category with a monoidal coalgebra\nmodality has its integral transformation given by antiderivatives and, thus,\nthat the integral structure is uniquely determined by the differential\nstructure.\n  The paper finishes by providing a suite of separating examples.

The mass of the AGB star and the orbital parameters\nof the system are the key factors usually considered when determining how much\nmass is transferred onto the lower-mass main-sequence companion. What is\nusually neglected, however, is the angular momentum of the accreted material,\nwhich should spin up the accreting star. If the star reaches critical rotation,\nfurther accretion should cease until the excess angular momentum is somehow\ndealt with. If the star cannot redistribute or lose the angular momentum while\nthe primary is on the AGB, the amount of mass accreted could be much lower than\notherwise expected. Here we present calculations, based on detailed stellar\nevolution models, of the mass that can be accreted by putative progenitors of\nBa and CEMP stars before they reach critical rotation under the assumption that\nno angular momentum loss occurs during the mass transfer. We consider different\naccretion rates and values of specific angular momentum. The most stringent\nlimits on the accreted masses result from considering accretion from a\nKeplerian accretion disk, which is likely present during the formation of most\nextrinsically-polluted carbon-enriched stars. Our calculations indicate that in\nthis scenario only about 0.05 solar masses of material can be added to the\naccreting star before it reaches critical rotation, which is much too low to\nexplain the chemical enrichment of many Ba and CEMP stars. Either the specific\nangular momentum of the accreted material has to effectively be lower by about\na factor of ten than the Keplerian value, or significant angular momentum\nlosses must occur for substantial accretion to take place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Among other differences between these scenarios, we traced that the\nanalytical structure of the self-energy imposed by the spin of particles\ninvolved in the process is determinant in the behavior of the decay rate with\nthe magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

A simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables cannot be\nprojective, however the strongest possible such measurement can be defined as\nproviding their values at the smallest uncertainty limit. Starting with the\nArthurs and Kelly (AK) protocol for such measurement of position and momentum,\nwe derive a systematic extension to a corresponding weak measurement along\nthree steps: First, a plausible form of the weak measurement operator analogous\nto the Gaussian Kraus operator often used to model a weak measurement of a\nsingle observable is obtained by projecting a na\\\"ive extension (valid for\ncommuting observable) onto the corresponding Gabor space.

To develop\nour adaptive operator compression and multiresolution matrix factorization\nmethods, we first introduce a novel notion of energy decomposition for SPD\nmatrix $A$ using the representation of energy elements. The interaction between\nthese energy elements depicts the underlying topological structure of the\noperator. This concept of decomposition naturally reflects the hidden geometric\nstructure of the operator which inherits the localities of the structure. By\nutilizing the intrinsic geometric information under this Energy framework, we\npropose a systematic operator compression scheme for the inverse operator\n$A^{-1}$. In particular, with an appropriate partition of the underlying\ngeometric structure, we can construct localized basis by using the concept of\ninterior and closed energy.

However, population dynamics inherently generate\nnoise in numbers of individuals and selection acts on various components of the\nindividuals' fitness. In plant species with seed banks, the size of both the\nabove- and below-ground compartments present noise depending on seed production\nand the state of the seed bank. We investigate if this noise has consequences\non 1)~the rate of genetic drift, and 2)~the efficacy of selection. We consider\nfour variants of two-allele Moran-type models defined by combinations of\npresence and absence of noise in above-ground and seed bank compartments. Time\nscale analysis and dimension reduction methods allow us to reduce the\ncorresponding Fokker-Planck equation to a one-dimensional diffusion\napproximation of a Moran model.

Second, we consider that selection\ncan act on four different components of the plant fitness: plant or seed death\nrate, seed production or seed germination. Our striking result is that the\nefficacy of selection for seed death rate or germination rate is reduced by\nseed bank noise, whereas selection occurring on plant death rate or seed\nproduction is not affected. We derive the expected site-frequency spectrum\nreflecting this heterogeneity in selection efficacy between genes underpinning\ndifferent plant fitness components.

In particular,\nwe find that at non-zero low temperatures the Seebeck coefficient and the\nthermoelectric efficiency can be very large on the \"insulating\" side, for\nchemical potentials below the (zero-temperature) localization threshold.\nCorrections to the leading power-law singularity in the zero-temperature\nconductivity are shown to introduce non-universal temperature-dependent\ncorrections to the otherwise universal functions which describe the Seebeck\ncoefficient, the figure of merit and the Wiedemann-Franz ratio.

In each step of the self-consistent GF2 calculation there are two parts:\nthe estimation of the self-energy from the previous step's Green's function,\nand updating the Green's function from the self-energy. The first part formally\nscales as the fifth power of the system size while the second has a much\ngentler cubic scaling.

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid\nprecoder implementation using a small number of phase shifters with quantized\nand fixed phases, i.e., a fixed phase shifter (FPS) implementation, which\nsignificantly reduces the cost and hardware complexity.

While convolutional layers map\nbetween high-order activation tensors, the fully connected layers operate on\nflattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has\nnotable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards\nmultilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We\naddress these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that\npreserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor\nContraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while\npreserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we\nintroduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a\nlow-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output\ntensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors\nend-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters.

Prior works in this domain operate on\na static snapshot of the community, making strong assumptions about the\nstructure of the data (e.g., relational tables), or consider only shallow\nfeatures for text classification.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose probabilistic graphical models\nthat can leverage the joint interplay between multiple factors in online\ncommunities --- like user interactions, community dynamics, and textual content\n--- to automatically assess the credibility of user-contributed online content,\nand the expertise of users and their evolution with user-interpretable\nexplanation. To this end, we devise new models based on Conditional Random\nFields for different settings like incorporating partial expert knowledge for\nsemi-supervised learning, and handling discrete labels as well as numeric\nratings for fine-grained analysis. This enables applications such as extracting\nreliable side-effects of drugs from user-contributed posts in healthforums, and\nidentifying credible content in news communities.\n  Online communities are dynamic, as users join and leave, adapt to evolving\ntrends, and mature over time. To capture this dynamics, we propose generative\nmodels based on Hidden Markov Model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Brownian\nMotion to trace the continuous evolution of user expertise and their language\nmodel over time. This allows us to identify expert users and credible content\njointly over time, improving state-of-the-art recommender systems by explicitly\nconsidering the maturity of users. This also enables applications such as\nidentifying helpful product reviews, and detecting fake and anomalous reviews\nwith limited information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The remaining PNe are almost equally distributed among PNe\nenriched in nitrogen, which we interpret as the progeny of $M > 3.5~M_{\\odot}$\nstars, younger than 250 Myr, and a group of oxygen-rich PNe, descending from\nold ($> 2$ Gyr) low-mass ($M < 1.5~M_{\\odot}$) stars that never became C-stars.\n  This analysis confirms the existence of an upper limit to the amount of\ncarbon which can be accumulated at the surface of carbon stars, probably due to\nthe acceleration of mass loss in the late AGB phases. The chemical composition\nof the present sample suggests that in massive AGB stars of solar (or slightly\nsub-solar) metallicity, the effects of third dredge up combine with hot bottom\nburning, resulting in nitrogen-rich - but not severely carbon depleted -\ngaseous material to be ejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 09:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

In general,a large space of objects is arranged in such a way that,\nwhen a further object is presented as a query, those objects most similar to\nthe query can be efficiently found. Most mechanisms rely upon the triangle\ninequality property of the metric governing the space. The triangle inequality\nproperty is equivalent to a finite embedding property, which states that any\nthree points of the space can be isometrically embedded in two-dimensional\nEuclidean space. In this paper, we examine a class of semimetric space which is\nfinitely four-embeddable in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In mathematics\nthis property has been extensively studied and is generally known as the\nfour-point property. All spaces with the four-point property are metric spaces,\nbut they also have some stronger geometric guarantees. We coin the term\nsupermetric space as, in terms of metric search, they are significantly more\ntractable. Supermetric spaces include all those governed by Euclidean, Cosine,\nJensen-Shannon and Triangular distances, and are thus commonly used within many\ndomains.

This immediately poses the question of whether the RPA is\nalso able to capture the correct physics of strongly correlated solids such as\nMott insulators. Due to strong electron localization, magnetic interactions in\nsuch systems are dominated by superexchange, which in the simplest picture can\nbe regarded as the analogue of static correlation for molecules. In the present\nwork we investigate the performance of the RPA for evaluating both\nsuperexchange and direct exchange interactions in the magnetic solids NiO, MnO,\nNa3Cu2SbO6, Sr2CuO3, Sr2CuTeO6, and a monolayer of CrI3, which are chosen to\nrepresent a broad variety of magnetic interactions.

However, interpretation of such an output is not trivial due\nto the existence of many overlapping bounding boxes. Furthermore, in current\ncaptioning frameworks, the user is not able to involve personal preferences to\nexclude out of interest areas. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep\nlearning architecture for interactive region segmentation and captioning where\nthe user is able to specify an arbitrary region of the image that should be\nprocessed. To this end, a dedicated Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) named\nLyncean FCN (LFCN) is trained using our special training data to isolate the\nUser Intention Region (UIR) as the output of an efficient segmentation. In\nparallel, a dense image captioning model is utilized to provide a wide variety\nof captions for that region. Then, the UIR will be explained with the caption\nof the best match bounding box. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork that provides such a comprehensive output. Our experiments show the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art interactive\nsegmentation methods on several well-known datasets. In addition, replacement\nof the bounding boxes with the result of the interactive segmentation leads to\na better understanding of the dense image captioning output as well as accuracy\nenhancement for the object detection in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 10:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

In a first variant, the approximation is made of simplices that\nare defined in the cubes of a regular grid covering the compact set, from\nboundary points that approximate the intersection between $M$ and the edges of\nthe cubes. All the simplices defined in a cube share the barycentre of the\nboundary points located in the cube and include simplices similarly defined in\ncube facets, and so on recursively. In a second variant, the Kuhn triangulation\nis used to break the cubes into simplices and the approximation is defined in\nthese simplices from the boundary points computed on their edges, with the same\nprinciple. Both the approximation in cubes and in simplices define a separating\nsurface on the whole grid and classifying a point on one side or the other of\nthis surface requires only a small number (at most $d$) of simple tests.

Additionally, a\nwarping transformation is usually required to preserve the signal energy, thus\npreserving orthogonality and being invertible by its adjoint. Initially, the\ndesign of such operators has been motivated by the idea of suitably\ngeneralizing the properties of orthogonal time-frequency decompositions such as\nwavelets and filter banks, hence the energy preservation property was\nessential. Recently, warping operators have been employed for frequency\ndispersion compensation in the Fourier domain or the identification of\nwaveforms similarity in the time domain. For such applications, the energy\npreservation requirement can be given up, thus making warping a special case of\ninterpolation. In this context, the purpose of this work is to provide\nanalytical models and efficient computational algorithms for time warping with\nrespect to piecewise smooth warping maps by transposing and extending a\ntheoretical framework which has been previously introduced for frequency\nwarping.

Recently quantum turbulence in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates was reported [PRL 103, 045310 (2009)], opening up a new\nexperimental system that can be used to study quantum turbulence. A novel\nfeature of this system is that vortex cores now have a finite size. This means\nthat the vortices are no longer one dimensional features in the condensate, but\nthat the radial behaviour and excitations might also play an important role in\nthe study of quantum turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates. In this paper we\ninvestigate these radial modes using a simplified variational model for the\nvortex core. This study results in the frequencies of the radial modes, which\ncan be compared with the frequencies of the thoroughly studied Kelvin modes.\nFrom this comparison we find that the lowest (l=0) radial mode has a frequency\nin the same order of magnitude as the Kelvin modes. However the radial modes\nstill have a larger energy than the Kelvin modes, meaning that the Kelvin modes\nwill still constitute the preferred channel for energy decay in quantum\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The knowledge of these algebras\nis the cornerstone of the classification program of pointed Hopf algebras with\nfinite dimension, or finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension; and their structure\nshould be indispensable for the understanding of the representation theory, the\ncomputation of the various cohomologies, and many other aspects of finite\ndimensional pointed Hopf algebras. These Nichols algebras were classified in\n[H-classif RS] as a notable application of the notions of Weyl groupoid and\ngeneralized root system [H-Weyl gpd,HY]. In the first part of this monograph,\nwe give an overview of the theory of Nichols algebras of diagonal type. This\nincludes a discussion of the notion of generalized root system and its\nappearance in the contexts of Nichols algebras of diagonal type and (modular)\nLie superalgebras. In the second and third part, we describe for each Nichols\nalgebra in the list of [H-classif RS] the following basic information: the\ngeneralized root system; its label in terms of Lie theory; the defining\nrelations found in [A-jems,A-presentation]; the PBW-basis; the dimension or the\nGelfand-Kirillov dimension; the associated Lie algebra as in [AAR2]. Indeed the\nsecond part deals with Nichols algebras related to Lie algebras and\nsuperalgebras in arbitrary characteristic, while the third contains the\ninformation on Nichols algebras related to Lie algebras and superalgebras only\nin small characteristic, and the few examples yet unidentified in terms of Lie\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

However, while drawings are easy for humans to create, they are\nvery challenging for computers to interpret due to their sparsity and\nambiguity. We propose a data-driven approach that tackles this challenge by\nlearning to reconstruct 3D shapes from one or more drawings. At the core of our\napproach is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts occupancy\nof a voxel grid from a line drawing. This CNN provides us with an initial 3D\nreconstruction as soon as the user completes a single drawing of the desired\nshape. We complement this single-view network with an updater CNN that refines\nan existing prediction given a new drawing of the shape created from a novel\nviewpoint. A key advantage of our approach is that we can apply the updater\niteratively to fuse information from an arbitrary number of viewpoints, without\nrequiring explicit stroke correspondences between the drawings. We train both\nCNNs by rendering synthetic contour drawings from hand-modeled shape\ncollections as well as from procedurally-generated abstract shapes. Finally, we\nintegrate our CNNs in a minimal modeling interface that allows users to\nseamlessly draw an object, rotate it to see its 3D reconstruction, and refine\nit by re-drawing from another vantage point using the 3D reconstruction as\nguidance. The main strengths of our approach are its robustness to freehand\nbitmap drawings, its ability to adapt to different object categories, and the\ncontinuum it offers between single-view and multi-view sketch-based modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 11:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 06:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 20:56:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 12:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

In this paper, the effect of grain size on the hardening mechanism\nof Al-Cu nanostructure is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation. Al-Cu\n(50-54% Cu by weight) nanostructure having an average grain size of 4.57 to\n7.26 nm are investigated for tensile simulation at different strain rate using\nembedded atom method (EAM) potential at a temperature of 50~500K. It is found\nthat the failure mechanism of the nanostructure is governed by the temperature,\ngrain size as well as strain rate effect. At the high temperature of 300-500K,\nthe failure strength of Al-Cu nanostructure increases with the decrease of\naverage grain size following Hall-Petch relation. Dislocation motions are\nhindered significantly when the grain size is decreased which play a vital role\non the hardening of the nanostructure. The failure is always found to initiate\nat a particular Al grain due to its weak link and propagates through grain\nboundary (GB) sliding, diffusion, dislocation nucleation and propagation. We\nalso visualize the dislocation density at different grain size to show how the\ndislocation affects the material properties at the nanoscale. These results\nwill further aid investigation on the deformation mechanism of nanostructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 12:14:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 11:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

A second outcome of this research is that we confirm that Herbig Ae\nstars are similar to T Tauri stars in displaying a line polarization effect,\nwhile depolarization is more common among Herbig Be stars. This finding had\nbeen suggested previously to indicate that Herbig Ae stars form in the same\nmanner than T Tauri stars through magnetospheric accretion. It appears that the\ntransition between these two differing polarization line effects occurs around\nthe B7-B8 spectral type. This would in turn not only suggest that Herbig Ae\nstars accrete in a similar fashion as lower mass stars, but also that this\naccretion mechanism switches to a different type of accretion for Herbig Be\nstars. We report that the magnitude of the line effect caused by electron\nscattering close to the stars does not exceed 2%. Only a very weak correlation\nis found between the magnitude of the line effect and the spectral type or the\nstrength of the Halpha line.

More precisely, our models are defined in the\nprobabilistic feature-oriented language QFLAN, a rich domain specific language\n(DSL) for systems with variability defined in terms of features. QFLAN\nspecifications are automatically encoded in terms of a process algebra whose\noperational behavior interacts with a store of constraints, and hence allows to\nseparate system configuration from system behavior. The resulting probabilistic\nconfigurations and behavior converge seamlessly in a semantics based on\ndiscrete-time Markov chains, thus enabling quantitative analysis.

We used Lagrangian tracers to record peak shock\npressures in each material unit. The post-shock temperatures (and the fractions\nof tracers experiencing temperatures above the melting point) for each material\nwere estimated after the passage of the shock wave and after reflections of the\nshock at grain boundaries in the heterogeneous materials. The results showed\nthat shock-darkening, associated with troilite melt and the onset of olivine\nmelt, happened between 40 and 50 GPa - with 52 GPa being the pressure at which\nall tracers in the troilite material reach the melting point. We demonstrate\nthe difficulties of shock heating in iron and also the importance of porosity.\nMaterial impedances, grain shapes and the porosity models available in the\niSALE code are discussed. We also discussed possible not-shock-related triggers\nfor iron melt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 13:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

However,\nfrequent selection of a specific action may reduce its expected reward, while\nabstaining from choosing an action may cause its expected reward to increase.\nSuch non-stationary phenomena are observed in many real world settings such as\npersonalized healthcare-adherence improving interventions and targeted online\nadvertising. Though finding an optimal policy for general models with\nnon-stationarity is PSPACE-complete, we propose and analyze a new class of\nmodels called ROGUE (Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy) bandits, which we\nshow in this paper can capture these phenomena and are amenable to the design\nof effective policies. We first present a consistent maximum likelihood\nestimator for the parameters of these models. Next, we construct finite sample\nconcentration bounds that lead to an upper confidence bound policy called the\nROGUE Upper Confidence Bound (ROGUE-UCB) algorithm. We prove that under proper\nconditions the ROGUE-UCB algorithm achieves logarithmic in time regret, unlike\nexisting algorithms which result in linear regret. We conclude with a numerical\nexperiment using real data from a personalized healthcare-adherence improving\nintervention to increase physical activity. In this intervention, the goal is\nto optimize the selection of messages (e.g., confidence increasing vs.\nknowledge increasing) to send to each individual each day to increase adherence\nand physical activity.

Specializing to nonspinning binaries, we derive the EOB\nevolution equations and compute the binary's radiative multipole moments that\ndetermine the gravitational waves through a decomposition into the fundamental\nfrequencies of the motion. The major differences between our treatment and the\nquasi-Keplerian approach often used in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations are\nthat the orbital parameters describe strong-field dynamics, and that expressing\nthe multipole moments in terms of the frequencies simplifies the calculations\nand also results in an unambiguous orbit-averaging operation. While our\ndescription of the conservative dynamics is fully relativistic, we limit\nexplicit derivations in the radiative sector to 1.5PN order for simplicity.\nThis already enables us to establish methods for computing both instantaneous\nand hereditary contributions to the gravitational radiation in EOB coordinates\nthat have straightforward extensions to higher PN order.

It was\nrecently shown that, for monotone bistable systems, this problem admits\neasy-to-implement open-loop solutions in terms of temporal pulses (i.e., step\nfunctions of fixed length and fixed magnitude). In this paper, we develop this\nidea further and formulate a problem of convergence to an equilibrium from an\narbitrary initial point.

Changing the initial\npoint to an arbitrary state allows to build closed-loop, event-based or\nopen-loop policies for the switching/convergence problems.

Entity linking is one of the major tasks in natural\nlanguage understanding from tweets and it associates entity mentions in text to\ncorresponding entries in knowledge bases in order to provide unambiguous\ninterpretation and additional con- text. State-of-the-art techniques have\nfocused on linking explicitly mentioned entities in tweets with reasonable\nsuccess. However, we argue that in addition to explicit mentions i.e. The movie\nGravity was more ex- pensive than the mars orbiter mission entities (movie\nGravity) can also be mentioned implicitly i.e. This new space movie is crazy.\nyou must watch it!. This paper introduces the problem of implicit entity\nlinking in tweets. We propose an approach that models the entities by\nexploiting their factual and contextual knowledge. We demonstrate how to use\nthese models to perform implicit entity linking on a ground truth dataset with\n397 tweets from two domains, namely, Movie and Book. Specifically, we show: 1)\nthe importance of linking implicit entities and its value addition to the\nstandard entity linking task, and 2) the importance of exploiting contextual\nknowledge associated with an entity for linking their implicit mentions. We\nalso make the ground truth dataset publicly available to foster the research in\nthis new research area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The\ncommunication graph is a clique with limited edge bandwidth: each two nodes\n(not necessarily neighbours in the input graph) can exchange $O(\\log n)$ bits.\n  As in previous works, the key part of the MST algorithm is an efficient\nConnected Components (CC) algorithm.

Attention is focussed on the local slip\nboundary condition at the liquid-gas interface, which is equivalent to the\neffect of a gas cavity on liquid flow. The system is characterized by a large\nviscosity contrast between liquid and gas, $\\mu/\\mu_g \\gg 1$. We interpret\nearlier results, namely the dependence of the local slip length on the flow\ndirection, in terms of a tensorial local slip boundary condition and relate the\neigenvalues of the local slip length tensor to the texture parameters, such as\nthe width of the groove, $\\delta$, and the local depth of the groove, $e(y,\n\\alpha)$. The latter varies in the direction $y$, orthogonal to the orientation\nof stripes, and depends on the bevel angle of groove's edges, $\\pi/2 - \\alpha$,\nat the point, where three phases meet. Our theory demonstrates that when\ngrooves are sufficiently deep their eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor\ndepend only on $\\mu/\\mu_g$, $\\delta$, and $\\alpha$, but not on the depth. The\neigenvalues of the local slip length of shallow grooves depend on $\\mu/\\mu_g$\nand $e(y, \\alpha)$, although the contribution of the bevel angle is moderate.\nIn order to assess the validity of our theory we propose a novel approach to\nsolve the two-phase hydrodynamic problem, which significantly facilitates and\naccelerates calculations compared to conventional numerical schemes. The\nnumerical results show that our simple analytical description obtained for\nlimiting cases of deep and shallow grooves remains valid for various\nunidirectional textures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 15:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 10:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 18:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 21:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

The crystalline orientation at each\npoint in the sample is determined by analysis of the diffraction pattern, a\nprocess known as pattern indexing. A recent development in pattern indexing is\nthe use of a brute-force approach, whereby diffraction patterns are simulated\nfor a large number of crystalline orientations, and compared against the\nexperimentally observed diffraction pattern in order to determine the most\nlikely orientation. Whilst this method can robust identify orientations in the\npresence of noise, it has very high computational requirements. In this\narticle, the computational burden is reduced by developing a method for\nnearly-optimal sampling of orientations. By using the quaternion representation\nof orientations, it is shown that the optimal sampling problem is equivalent to\nthat of optimally distributing points on a four-dimensional sphere. In doing\nso, the number of orientation samples needed to achieve a indexing desired\naccuracy is significantly reduced.

In TDC, the intra-layer neurons of a DSNN are trained to map\ninput spike trains to a higher dimension of spike trains called a\nfeature-domain, and the output neurons are trained to build the desired spike\ntrains by processing the spike timing of intralayer neurons. The DSNN\nperformance was examined in a jittered spike train classification task which\nshows more than 92\\% accuracy in classifying different spike trains. The DSNN\nperformance is comparable with the recurrent multi-layer neural networks and\nsurpasses a single-layer DSNN with a 22\\% margin.
