The Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model simulates how\nrandom geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong\nclustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce\nan important feature of real complex networks, which is the community\norganization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently\ndeveloped to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by\nforcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have variable level\nof attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be\nexplicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real\napplications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model that,\ndifferently from GPA, forces heterogeneous angular node attractiveness by\nsampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability\ndistribution, for instance a mixture of Gaussians. The nPSO differs from GPA in\nother three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of\ncommunities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network\ntemperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After\nseveral tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate\nnetworks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a\nrealistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 17:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

In\norder to resolve local features and to obtain converged results, typically the\nnumber of degrees of freedom needed is much larger than the rank of the\nspectral projector. This leads to significant cost in terms of both computation\nand storage. In this paper, we develop a method to construct a basis set that\nis adaptive to the given differential operator. The basis set is systematically\nimprovable, and the local features of the projector is built into the basis\nset. As a result the required number of degrees of freedom is only a small\nconstant times the rank of the projector. The construction of the basis set\nuses a randomized procedure, and only requires applying the differential\noperator to a small number of vectors on the global domain, while each basis\nfunction itself is supported on strictly local domains and is discontinuous\nacross the global domain. The spectral projector on the global domain is\nsystematically approximated from such a basis set using the discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) method. The global construction procedure is very flexible, and\nallows a local basis set to be consistently constructed even if the operator\ncontains a nonlocal potential term. We verify the effectiveness of the globally\nconstructed adaptive local basis set using one-, two- and three-dimensional\nlinear problems with local potentials, as well as a one dimensional nonlinear\nproblem with nonlocal potentials resembling the Hartree-Fock problem in quantum\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 21:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 13:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In the first approach the\npairing term is restricted by a cutoff energy to the neighborhood of the Fermi\nsurface, whereas in the second approach the pairing term is extended to the\nwhole Brillouin zone. We explore their difference by considering two minimal\nmodels for the Weyl metal. For a model giving a single pair of Weyl pockets,\nboth two approaches give a partly-gapped (fully-gapped) bulk spectrum for small\n(large) pairing amplitude. However, for very small cutoff energy, a portion of\nthe Fermi surface can be completely unaffected by the pairing term in the first\napproach. For the other model giving two pairs of Weyl pockets, while the bulk\nspectrum for the first approach can be fully gapped, the one from the second\napproach has a robust line node, and the surface states are also changed\nqualitatively by the pairing. We elucidate the above differences by topological\narguments and analytical analyses. A factor common to both of the two models is\nthe tilting of the Weyl cones which leads to asymmetric normal state band\nstructure with respect to the Weyl nodes.

In thermal AdS\nbackground, the holographic entanglement entropy leads to $\\Delta S=0$ for\narbitrary $\\ell$. We compute the next-to-leading order contributions to $\\Delta\nS$ in the large central charge CFT at both high and low temperatures. In both\ncases we show that $\\Delta S$ is strictly positive except for $\\ell = 0$ or\n$\\ell = L$. This turns out to be true for any 2D CFT. In calculating the single\ninterval entanglement entropy in a thermal state, we develop new techniques to\nsimplify the computation. At a high temperature, we ignore the finite size\ncorrection such that the problem is related to the entanglement entropy of\ndouble intervals on a complex plane. As a result, we show that the leading\ncontribution from a primary module takes a universal form. At a low\ntemperature, we show that the leading thermal correction to the entanglement\nentropy from a primary module does not take a universal form, depending on the\ndetails of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 21:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 08:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

The theory is based\non the integration-through-transients (ITT) formalism and hence provides a\nstarting point for the calculation of non-equilibrium averages in\nactive-Brownian particle systems. The ABP are characterized by a\nself-propulsion velocity $v_0$, and by their translational and rotational\ndiffusion coefficients, $D_t$ and $D_r$. The theory treats both the\ntranslational and the orientational degrees of freedom of ABP explicitly. This\nallows to study the effect of self-propulsion of both weak and strong\npersistence of the swimming direction, also at high densities where the\npersistence length $\\ell_p=v_0/D_r$ is large compared to the typical\ninteraction length scale. While the low-density dynamics of ABP is\ncharacterized by a single P\\'eclet number, $Pe=v_0^2/D_rD_t$, close to the\nglass transition the dynamics is found to depend on $Pe$ and $\\ell_p$\nseparately. At fixed density, increasing the self-propulsion velocity causes\nstructural relaxatino to speed up, while decreasing the persistence length\nslows down the relaxation. The theory predicts a non-trivial\nidealized-glass-transition diagram in the three-dimensional parameter space of\ndensity, self-propulsion velocity and rotational diffusivity. The active-MCT\nglass is a nonergodic state where correlations of initial density fluctuations\nnever fully decay, but also an infinite memory of initial orientational\nfluctuations is retained in the positions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 01:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved\nsignificant successes for image classification, texture classification remains\na difficult problem since textures usually do not contain enough information\nregarding the shape of object. In image processing, texture classification has\nbeen traditionally studied well with spectral analyses which exploit repeated\nstructures in many textures. Since CNNs process images as-is in the spatial\ndomain whereas spectral analyses process images in the frequency domain, these\nmodels have different characteristics in terms of performance. We propose a\nnovel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which integrates a spectral analysis into\nCNNs. Our insight is that the pooling layer and the convolution layer can be\nviewed as a limited form of a spectral analysis. Based on this insight, we\ngeneralize both layers to perform a spectral analysis with wavelet transform.\nWavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is lost in\nconventional CNNs but useful in texture classification.

However,\nrecently it was shown, that the self-field critical current of thin-film\nsuperconductors is indeed a fundamental property governed only by the London\npenetration depth. Here we reconsider the definition of critical current and\nresolve the apparent contradiction. We measure the field distribution across\nthe width of 2G high-Tc superconducting tapes as the transport current is\nincreased to Ic. We identify a threshold current, Ic_surfB, at which two\nphysical events occur simultaneously: (i) an abrupt crossover from non-linear\nto linear dependence of the local surface magnetic flux density, Bsurf, as a\nfunction of transport current measured at any point on the superconductor\nsurface.

In order to scale, they distribute query processing\namong many nodes, where each node holds and searches over a subset of the index\ncalled shard. Responses from some nodes occasionally fail to arrive within a\nreasonable time-interval due to various reasons, such as high server load and\nnetwork congestion. Search engines typically need to respond in a timely\nmanner, and therefore skip such tail latency responses, which causes\ndegradation in search quality. In this paper, we tackle response misses due to\nhigh tail latencies with the goal of maximizing search quality.\n  Search providers today use redundancy in the form of Replication for\nmitigating response misses, by constructing multiple copies of each shard and\nsearching all replicas. This approach is not ideal, as it wastes resources on\nsearching duplicate data. We propose two strategies to reduce this waste.\nFirst, we propose rSmartRed, an optimal shard selection scheme for replicated\nindexes. Second, when feasible, we propose to replace Replication with\nRepartition, which constructs independent index instances instead of exact\ncopies. We analytically prove that rSmartRed's selection is optimal for\nReplication, and that Repartition achieves better search quality compared to\nReplication. We confirm our results with an empirical study using two\nreal-world datasets, showing that rSmartRed improves recall compared to\ncurrently used approaches. We additionally show that Repartition improves over\nReplication in typical scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Then,\nwe numerically evaluate the performance of CUCB-$\\kappa$ and CTS in a\nreal-world movie recommendation problem, where the actions correspond to\nrecommending a set of movies, the arms correspond to the edges between the\nmovies and the users, and the goal is to maximize the total number of users\nthat are attracted by at least one movie. Our numerical results complement our\ntheoretical findings on bounded regret. Apart from this problem, our results\nalso directly apply to the online influence maximization (OIM) problem studied\nin numerous prior works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 09:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Although there are many studies describing the typical\nHaversian system in mammals, there are few studies conducted on bones from\nnon-mammalian species. The objective of the current study was to investigate\nthe existence of the typical Haversian system in compact bones from reptiles\nand birds. Materials and Methods: Femora were collected from geckos, Nile\nmonitors, sparrows, ducks and geese. Samples were then, fixed in 10%\nparaformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin or Von Kossa and then examined using light microscopy.\nResults: The current study showed different histological structures of compact\nbones from studied species and an absence of the typical Haversian system seen\nin mammals. The compact bone of geckos was mostly avascular, while Nile monitor\nbone was highly vascular. Sparrow bone showed one side vascular and the other\nside avascular. The vascularity was represented by primary vascular canals\nsurrounded by a few irregularly arranged osteocytes inside their lacunae\nforming primary osteons. Bone tissue from ducks and geese were similar and were\ncomposed mostly of dense Haversian tissue, while some areas had primary\nosteons. Conclusion: The compact bone microstructure in some reptile and bird\nspecies lack the typical Haversian system described in mammals.

M. Purcell showed that a body has to perform non-reciprocal motion in\norder to propel itself in a highly viscous environment.

In\nthe present study, we are proposing a new artificial swimmer called the one\nhinge swimmer. Here we will show that flexibility plays a crucial role in the\nbreakdown of Scallop theorem in the case of one-hinge swimmer or\ntwo-dimensional scallop at low Reynolds number. To model a one-hinge artificial\nswimmer, we use bead spring model for two arms joined by a hinge with bending\npotential for the arms in order to make them semi-flexible.

We find that the 3mm masers lie in an X-shaped locus\nconsisting of four arms, with blue-shifted emission in the south and east arms\nand red-shifted emission in the north and west arms. Comparisons with previous\nimages of the 28SiO v=1,2, J=1-0 transitions at 7mm (observed in 2001-2002)\nshow that the bulk of the J=2-1 transition emission follows the streamlines of\nthe J=1-0 emission and exhibits an overall velocity gradient consistent with\nthe gradient at 7mm. While there is spatial overlap between the 3mm and 7mm\ntransitions, the 3mm emission, on average, lies at larger projected distances\nfrom Source I (~44 AU compared with ~35 AU for 7mm). The spatial overlap\nbetween the v=1, J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions is suggestive of a range of\ntemperatures and densities where physical conditions are favorable for both\ntransitions of a same vibrational state. However, the observed spatial offset\nbetween the bulk of emission at 3mm and 7mm possibly indicates different ranges\nof temperatures and densities for optimal excitation of the masers.

Slow-rate sensing enables to achieve energy saving by\nreducing network load. In addition, choosing a slower sensing period than the\nlongest round-trip time delay can avoid packet disorder. On the other hand, a\nslow-rate sensing usually degrades control performance in a conventional\ncontrol framework. Therefore, including dual-rate control techniques can be\nuseful to maintain the desired performance, since the controller is able to\ngenerate a fast-rate control signal from a slow-rate sensing signal. A\ndual-rate PID controller is used, which can be split into two parts: a\nslow-rate PI controller is located at the remote side (with no permanent\ncommunication to the plant) and a fast-rate PD controller, at the local side\n(close to the plant, sensor, and inside the actuator, which can offer a low\ncomputation power). In addition, at the remote side, where a powerful\ncomputation device is located, a prediction stage is included in order to\ngenerate the packet of future, estimated slow-rate control actions to be sent\nto the local side. At this side, these actions are converted to fast-rate ones\nand used when a packet does not arrive due to the network-induced delay or due\nto occurring dropouts. The control proposal is able to reach the nominal\n(no-dropout, no-delay) performance despite the existence of time-varying delays\nand packet dropouts. Via real-time control for a Cartesian robot, results\nclearly reveal the superiority of the control approach compared to a previous\nauthors\\' proposal, where the time-varying delays are faced by means of a gain\nscheduling control strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 10:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Recent studies\nshow that most protein enzymes have rich stochastic dynamics of transitions\nbetween the multitude of conformation substates that make up their native\nstate. This dynamics often manifests itself in fluctuating rates of the\ncatalyzed processes and the presence of short-term memory. For such stochastic\ndynamics, after dividing the free energy into operational and organizational\nenergy, we proved the generalized fluctuation theorem, which leads to the\nextension of the second law of thermodynamics to include two competing\nfunctions of process: dissipation and information. Computer simulation of the\ncourse of catalyzed processes taking place on the model network of substates,\nexpressed in jumps of unit values at random moments of time, indicates the\npossibility of negative dissipation of the organizational free energy at the\nexpense of information temporarily stored in memory, i.e. the behavior like\nMaxwell's demon.

For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as\nan analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a\nslow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to\naccelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of\nquantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is\ntrained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the\nprior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are\nthen immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations\nare available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift\ndistribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in\nprevious work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic\nABC. It uses, however, only 20\\% of the number of simulations compared to basic\nABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other\nproblems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is\nto the final posterior.

The so-called Barbarian asteroids share peculiar, but common\npolarimetric properties, probably related to both their shape and composition.\nThey are named after (234) Barbara, the first on which such properties were\nidentified.

We used light-curve inversion technique in\norder to determine the sidereal rotation periods of 15 asteroids and the con-\nvergence to a stable shape and pole coordinates for 8 of them.

This is, to date,\nthe largest sample assembled of VLBI detected sources in the sub-mJy regime.\nThe input sample was taken from previous observations with the Very Large Array\n(VLA). We present the catalogue with additional multiwavelength information. We\nfind a detection fraction of 20%, considering only those sources from the input\ncatalogue which were in principle detectable with the VLBA (2361). As a\nfunction of redshift, we see no evolution of the detection fraction over the\nredshift range 0.5<z<3. In addition, we find that faint radio sources typically\nhave a greater fraction of their radio luminosity in a compact core: ~70% of\nthe sub-mJy sources detected with the VLBA have more than half of their total\nradio luminosity in a VLBI-scale component, whereas this is true for only ~30%\nof the sources that are brighter than 10 mJy. This suggests that fainter radio\nsources differ intrinsically from brighter ones. Across our entire sample, we\nfind the predominant morphological classification of the host galaxies of the\nVLBA detected sources to be early type (57%), although this varies with\nredshift and at z>1.5 we find that spiral galaxies become the most prevalent\n(48%). We demonstrate that wide-field VLBI observations, together with new\ncalibration methods such as multi-source self-calibration and mosaicing, result\nin information which is difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 12:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The effects of degenerate\nplasma pressure and number density of hot and cold electron fluids, nonplanar\ngeometry, and positively charged static ions are responsible to modify the\nfundamental properties of EASWs. It is also observed that the properties of\nplanar mB shocks are quite different from those of nonplanar mB shocks. The\nfindings of the present investigation should be useful in understanding the\nnonlinear phenomena associated with nonplanar EAWs in both space and laboratory\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 12:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

The library is reduced to a\ndictionary of temporal bases, where each profile is approximated by a sparse\nlinear combination of the bases. Image reconstruction is formulated as\nestimation of concentration profiles and sparse model coefficients with a fixed\nsparsity level. Simulations are performed to evaluate modeling error, and error\nstatistics in kinetic parameter estimation in presence of noise. Retrospective\nunder-sampling experiments are performed on a brain tumor DCE digital reference\nobject (DRO) at different signal to noise levels (SNR=20-40) at (k-t) space\nunder-sampling factor (R=20), and 12 brain tumor in- vivo 3T datasets at\n(R=20-40). The approach is compared against an existing compressed sensing\nbased temporal finite-difference (tFD) reconstruction approach.\n  Results: Simulations demonstrate that sparsity levels of 2 and 3 model the\nlibrary profiles from the Patlak and extended Tofts-Kety (ETK) models,\nrespectively. Noise sensitivity analysis showed equivalent kinetic parameter\nestimation error statistics from noisy concentration profiles, and model\napproximated profiles.

The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and\nresult in local variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the\nX-ray flux from the inner disc in the case of black holes, or from the surface\nin the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical explanation of fast\nvariability belongs to the description of the diffusion process.

Emphasis is given to the results obtained in the\nlast decade, and focus will be mainly on the experimental work performed\nconcerning the influence of transfer channels on fusion cross sections and the\nhindrance phenomenon far below the barrier. Indeed, early data of sub-barrier\nfusion taught us that cross sections may strongly depend on the low-energy\ncollective modes of the colliding nuclei, and, possibly, on couplings to\ntransfer channels. The coupled-channels (CC) model has been quite successful in\nthe interpretation of the experimental evidences. Fusion barrier distributions\noften yield the fingerprint of the relevant coupled channels. Recent results\nobtained by using radioactive beams are reported. At deep sub-barrier energies,\nthe slope of the excitation function in a semi-logarithmic plot keeps\nincreasing in many cases and standard CC calculations over-predict the cross\nsections.

In the first\nstage, a convolutional encoder-decoder sub-network is employed to reconstruct\nthe background images and encode rich prior knowledge of background scenes. In\nthe second stage, the reconstructed background and current frame are input into\na multi-channel fully-convolutional sub-network (MCFCN) for accurate foreground\nsegmentation. In the two-stage CNN, the reconstruction loss and segmentation\nloss are jointly optimized. The background images and foreground objects are\noutput simultaneously in an end-to-end way. Moreover, by incorporating the\nprior semantic knowledge of foreground and background in the pre-training\nprocess, our method could restrain the background noise and keep the integrity\nof foreground objects at the same time.

Even though the\ntopic of refugees evidently plays a large role in online and offline politics\nof the affected countries, the fact that protests against refugees stem from\nthe right-wight political spectrum has lead to corresponding media to be shared\nin a decentralized fashion, making an analysis of the underlying social and\nmediatic networks difficult.

However, in relational\nlearning and other non-i.i.d domains, goals can also be defined over sets of\ninstances. For example, a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be\nconsistent with the transitivity property: if is-a(x_1, x_2) and is-a(x_2, x_3)\nhold, is-a(x_1, x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for\nderiving an inconsistency loss, measuring the degree to which the model\nviolates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The\ntraining objective is defined as a minimax problem, where an adversary finds\nthe most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss,\nand the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the\ninconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method\nthat can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any\nneural link predictor, with complexity independent of the domain size.

A custom deep learning\nnetwork was then designed and trained with the compensated images to digitally\nstain (i.e. highlight) 6 tissue layers of the ONH. The accuracy of our\nalgorithm was assessed (against manual segmentations) using the Dice\ncoefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. We further studied how compensation\nand the number of training images affected the performance of our algorithm.\n  Results: For images it had not yet assessed, our algorithm was able to\ndigitally stain the retinal nerve fiber layer + prelamina, the retinal pigment\nepithelium, all other retinal layers, the choroid, and the peripapillary sclera\nand lamina cribrosa. For all tissues, the mean dice coefficient was $0.84 \\pm\n0.03$, the mean sensitivity $0.92 \\pm 0.03$, and the mean specificity $0.99 \\pm\n0.00$. Our algorithm performed significantly better when compensated images\nwere used for training. Increasing the number of images (from 10 to 40) to\ntrain our algorithm did not significantly improve performance, except for the\nRPE.\n  Conclusion. Our deep learning algorithm can simultaneously stain neural and\nconnective tissues in ONH images. Our approach offers a framework to\nautomatically measure multiple key structural parameters of the ONH that may be\ncritical to improve glaucoma management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 15:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Nevertheless some of the most\ninteresting phenomena in physics are often associated with non-analytic\nbehavior in the coupling constant and the existence of nontrivial quantum\ncondensates. It is therefore possible that pathologies encountered in the case\nof gravity are more likely the result of inadequate analytical treatment, and\nnot necessarily a reflection of some intrinsic insurmountable problem. The\nnonperturbative treatment of quantum gravity via the Regge-Wheeler lattice path\nintegral formulation reveals the existence of a new phase involving a\nnontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate, and a new set of scaling exponents\ncharacterizing both the running of G and the long-distance behavior of\ninvariant correlation functions. The appearance of such a gravitational\ncondensate is viewed as analogous to the (equally nonperturbative) gluon and\nchiral condensates known to describe the physical vacuum of QCD. The resulting\nquantum theory of gravity is highly constrained, and its physical predictions\nare found to depend only on one adjustable parameter, a genuinely\nnonperturbative scale xi in many ways analogous to the scaling violation\nparameter Lambda MSbar of QCD.

Previous inversion techniques for multiscale\nproblems seek a coarse-grid media properties, e.g., permeability and\nconductivity, and by doing so, they assume that there exists a homogenized\nrepresentation of the underlying fine-scale permeability field on a coarse\ngrid. Generally such assumptions do not hold for highly heterogeneous fields,\ne.g., fracture media or channelized fields, where the width of channels are\nvery small compared to the coarse-grid sizes. In these cases, grid refinement\ncan lead to many degrees of freedom, and thus unattractive to apply. The\nproposed algorithm is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method\n(GMsFEM), which uses local spectral problems to identify non-localized\nfeatures, i.e., channels (high-conductivity inclusions that connect the\nboundaries of the coarse-grid block). The inclusion of these features in the\ncoarse space enables one to achieve a good accuracy. The approach is valid\nunder the assumption that the solution can be well represented in a\nreduced-dimensional space by multiscale basis functions. In practice, these\nbasis functions are non-observable as we do not identify the fine-scale\nfeatures of the permeability field. Our inversion algorithm finds the\ndiscretization parameters of the resulting system. By doing so, we identify the\nappropriate coarse-grid parameters representing the permeability field instead\nof fine-grid permeability field.
