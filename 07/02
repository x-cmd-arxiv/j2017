Our approach is guided by\nseveral empirical observations: First and foremost, Anderson localization is a\npre-requisite for observing these nonequilibrium phenomena. Secondly, sluggish\nrelaxation appears to favor Anderson-insulators with relatively large\nFermi-energies (hence proportionally large disorder). These observations\nmotivated us to consider a way to measure the underlying disorder in a\nrealistic Anderson insulator. Optical study using a series of amorphous\nindium-oxide (In_{x}O) establish a simple connection between\ncarrier-concentration and the disorder necessary to approach the\nmetal-insulator transition from the insulating side. This is used to estimate\nthe typical magnitude of the quenched potential-fluctuation in the\nelectron-glass phase of this system. The implications of our findings on the\nslow dynamics of Anderson-insulators are discussed.

The study includes the evolution of\nthe system resistivity during and after the thermal-treatment, the changes in\nthe conductance-noise, and accompanying changes in the optical properties. The\nsample resistance is used to monitor the system dynamics during the annealing\nperiod as well as the relaxation that ensues after its termination.

In particular, Facebook pages are increasingly used by businesses,\nbrands, and organizations to connect with multitudes of users worldwide. As the\nnumber of likes of a page has become a de-facto measure of its popularity and\nprofitability, an underground market of services artificially inflating page\nlikes, aka like farms, has emerged alongside Facebook's official targeted\nadvertising platform. Nonetheless, there is little work that systematically\nanalyzes Facebook pages' promotion methods. Aiming to fill this gap, we present\na honeypot-based comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via\nFacebook advertising and from popular like farms. First, we analyze likes based\non demographic, temporal, and social characteristics, and find that some farms\nseem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their\noperations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users'\nbehavior. Next, we look at fraud detection algorithms currently deployed by\nFacebook and show that they do not work well to detect stealthy farms which\nspread likes over longer timespans and like popular pages to mimic regular\nusers. To overcome their limitations, we investigate the feasibility of\ntimeline-based detection of like farm accounts, focusing on characterizing\ncontent generated by Facebook accounts on their timelines as an indicator of\ngenuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a range of features, grouped\ninto two main categories: lexical and non-lexical. We find that like farm\naccounts tend to re-share content, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and\nmore often generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users.\nUsing relevant lexical and non-lexical features, we build a classifier to\ndetect like farms accounts that achieves precision higher than 99% and 93%\nrecall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2017 18:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 07:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

As in the case of binary black holes, GWs generated\nby BNS consist of inspiral, merger, and post-merger components. Detecting the\nlatter is important because it encodes information about the nuclear equation\nof state (EOS) in a regime that cannot be probed prior to merger. The\npost-merger signal, however, can be observed by current detectors only out to~\n10 Mpc. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations showing that the dominant\npost-merger signal (the 22 mode) from individual events will likely not be\nobservable even with the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer (CE), assuming\na full year of operation, the latest merger rates, and a detection threshold\nwith signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For this reason, we propose two methods that\nstack the post-merger signal from multiple events to boost the detection\nprobability. The first method follows a commonly-used practice of multiplying\nthe Bayes factors of individual events. The second method relies on an\nassumption that the mode phase can be determined from the inspiral waveform, so\nthat coherent mode stacking of the data from different events becomes possible.\nBoth methods significantly improve the chances of detecting the dominant\npost-merger signal, making a detection very likely after a year of observation\nwith CE for certain EOS. We also show that in terms of detection, coherent\nstacking is more efficient in accumulating confidence. Moreover, assuming a 22\nmode is detected with CE via stacking, we estimate through a Fisher analysis\nthat the peak frequency can be measured to a statistical error of ~ 4-20 Hz for\ncertain equations of state. Such an error corresponds to a NS radius\nmeasurement of ~ 15-56 m, a fractional relative error ~ 4 %, suggesting that\nsystematic errors from theoretical modeling (~ 100 m) may dominate the error\nbudget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2017 21:14:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 15:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 22:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

In particular, data-driven approaches such\nas dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and its generalization, the extended-DMD\n(EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD\nimproves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of\ndictionary of observables that spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the\nKoopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the\nsolution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman\nformalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying\nthe method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve\nconvergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult\nfor high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ\nideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an\niterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable\ndictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing\noscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky PDE as examples, we show that our\nalgorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the\nproblem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to\nchoose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy we\nrequire fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries.

Finding an isolated low mass wide binary\nsystem in the earliest stage of formation, before tidal evolution could occur,\nwould prove that turbulent fragmentation is a viable mechanism for (very) low\nmass wide binaries. Here we report high resolution ALMA observations of a known\nwide-separation protostellar binary, showing that each component has a\ncircumstellar disk. The system is too young to have evolved from a close binary\nand the disk axes are misaligned, providing strong support for the turbulent\nfragmentation model.

This leaves a\nparticular opportunity for the lowest asymmetric state to replace the symmetric\nstates as the ground state.

The prior is named I-prior. For\nthe present model, it is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the\nFisher information, and mean chosen a priori (e.g., 0). The I-prior has the\nintuitively appealing property that the more information is available about a\nlinear functional of the regression function, the larger its prior variance,\nand, broadly speaking, the less influential the prior is on the posterior.\nUnlike the Jeffreys prior, it can be used in high dimensional settings.

The\npresent work is intended to extend this technique in studying crack problems\nwithin couple-stress elasticity, i.e. within a theory accounting for effects of\nmicrostructure. This extension is not an obvious one since rotations and\ncouple-stresses are involved in the theory employed to analyze the crack\nproblems. Here, the technique is introduced to study the case of a mode I\ncrack. Due to the nature of the boundary conditions that arise in couple-stress\nelasticity, the crack is modeled by a continuous distribution of climb\ndislocations and constrained wedge disclinations (the concept of \"constrained\nwedge disclination\" is first introduced in the present work). These\ndistributions create both standard stresses and couple stresses in the body. In\nparticular, it is shown that the mode-I case is governed by a system of coupled\nsingular integral equations with both Cauchy-type and logarithmic kernels. The\nnumerical solution of this system shows that a cracked solid governed by\ncouple-stress elasticity behaves in a more rigid way (having increased\nstiffness) as compared to a solid governed by classical elasticity. Also, the\nstress level at the crack-tip region is appreciably higher than the one\npredicted by classical elasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 13:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

From a broad range of experimental\nfeatures, supported by theoretical modelling, we find that the main ingredients\nfor the effect to arise are the spatial phase-separation of metallic and\ninsulating regions during the MIT and the coupling of lattice strain to the\nlocal critical temperature of the phase transition. We conclude that the\nemergent memory effect originates from phase boundaries at the\nreversal-temperature leaving `scars` in the underlying lattice structure,\ngiving rise to a local increase in the transition temperature. The universality\nand robustness of the effect shed new light on the MIT in complex oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 14:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

We\nexplicitly focus on overloaded scenarios in which the number of transmitting\nantennas is insufficient to neutralize all inter-group interference. Such\nscenarios are becoming increasingly relevant in the light of growing\nlow-latency content delivery demands, and also commonly appear in multibeam\nsatellite systems. We derive performance limits of classical beamforming\nstrategies using DoF analysis unveiling their limitations; for example, rates\nsaturate in overloaded scenarios due to inter-group interference. To tackle\ninterference, we propose a strategy based on degraded beamforming and\nsuccessive interference cancellation. While the degraded strategy resolves the\nrate-saturation issue, this comes at a price of sacrificing all spatial\nmultiplexing gains. This motivates the development of a unifying strategy that\ncombines the benefits of the two previous strategies. We propose a beamforming\nstrategy based on rate-splitting (RS) which divides the messages intended to\neach group into a degraded part and a designated part, and transmits a\nsuperposition of both degraded and designated beamformed streams. The\nsuperiority of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through DoF analysis.\nFinally, we solve the RS beamforming design problem and demonstrate significant\nperformance gains through simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 15:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

In this paper, we study the characterization of mmWave air-to-ground\n(AG) channels for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular,\nwe use ray tracing simulations using Remcom Wireless InSite software to study\nthe behavior of AG mmWave bands at two different frequencies: 28~GHz and\n60~GHz. Received signal strength (RSS) and root mean square delay spread\n(RMS-DS) of multipath components (MPCs) are analyzed for different UAV heights\nconsidering four different environments: urban, suburban, rural, and over sea.\nIt is observed that the RSS mostly follows the two ray propagation model along\nthe UAV flight path for higher altitudes. This two ray propagation model is\naffected by the presence of high rise scatterers in urban scenario. Moreover,\nwe present details of a universal serial radio peripheral (USRP) based channel\nsounder that can be used for AG channel measurements for mmWave (60 GHz) UAV\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2017 23:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 20:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

It has been commonly used to study the effectiveness\nof medical treatments or the lifespan of a population. However, survival\nanalysis can potentially leak confidential information of individuals in the\ndataset. The state-of-the-art techniques apply ad-hoc privacy-preserving\nmechanisms on publishing results to protect the privacy. These techniques\nusually publish sanitized and randomized answers which promise to protect the\nprivacy of individuals in the dataset but without providing any formal\nmechanism on privacy protection. In this paper, we propose private mechanisms\nfor parametric survival analysis with Weibull distribution. We prove that our\nproposed mechanisms achieve differential privacy, a robust and rigorous\ndefinition of privacy-preservation. Our mechanisms exploit the property of\nlocal sensitivity to carefully design a utility function which enables us to\npublish parameters of Weibull distribution with high precision. Our\nexperimental studies show that our mechanisms can publish useful answers and\noutperform other differentially private techniques on real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 03:29:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 01:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

Moreover, much faster AM processes, in\ncombination with the geometric versatility of AM, will enable entirely new\nworkflows for product design and customization. We present the design and\nvalidation of a desktop-scale extrusion AM system that achieves far greater\nbuild rate than benchmarked commercial systems. This system, which we call\nFastFFF, is motivated by our recent analysis of the rate-limiting mechanisms to\nconventional fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. The FastFFF system\nmutually overcomes these limits, using a nut-feed extruder, laser-heated\npolymer liquefier, and servo-driven parallel gantry system to achieve high\nextrusion force, rapid filament heating, and fast gantry motion, respectively.\nThe extrusion and heating mechanisms are contained in a compact printhead that\nreceives a threaded filament and augments conduction heat transfer with a\nfiber-coupled diode laser. The prototype system achieves a volumetric build\nrate of 127 cm3/hr, which is 7-fold greater than commercial desktop FFF\nsystems, at comparable resolution; the maximum extrusion rate of the printhead\nis ~14-fold greater (282 cm3/hr). The performance limits of the printhead and\nmotion systems are characterized, and the tradeoffs between build rate and\nresolution are assessed and discussed. The combination of high-speed motion and\nhigh deposition rate achieved by the FastFFF technology also poses challenges\nand opportunities for toolpath optimization and real-time deposition control.\nHigh-speed desktop printing raises the possibility of new use cases and\nbusiness models for AM, where handheld parts are built in minutes rather than\nhours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 15:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}
