In this work we derive the distributions of\neigenvalues and eigenvectors in the special but important case of $m \\times m$\nsymmetric random matrices, $D$, observed with isotropic matrix-variate Gaussian\nnoise. The properties of these distributions depend strongly on the symmetries\nof the mean tensor/matrix, $\\bar D$.

We apply these results to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with\n$m=3$, addressing an important problem of detecting the symmetries of the\ndiffusion tensor, and seeking an experimental design that could potentially\nyield an isotropic Gaussian distribution. In the 3-dimensional case, when the\nmean tensor is spherically symmetric and the noise is Gaussian and isotropic,\nthe asymptotic distribution of the first three eigenvalue central moment\nstatistics is simple and can be used to test for isotropy.

At the population-based context, the formulated optimization\nmodels are reduced to a simple detection problem for each thinker (particle).\nAccording to the assigned thinking mode to each thinker and her/his\nmeasurements of corresponding dialectic with other candidate particles, they\ndeterministically decide to interact with a thinker in maximum dialectic with\ntheir theses. The position of a thinker at maximum dialectic is known as an\navailable antithesis among the existing solutions. The dialectical interactions\nat each ideological community are distinguished by meaningful distributions of\nstep-sizes for each thinking mode.

In contrast, common\n'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in\nthe literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution\n>100 solar masses, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged\nsolution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to\norders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are\nadjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that\nindividually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently\nhigh resolution. However, in both idealized single-SN simulations and\ncosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much\nfaster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 18:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 05:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

We explore this question by studying the dynamics\nof the momentum distribution function in a dipolar quantum Newton's cradle\nconsisting of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms.

These interactions provide tunability of both the strength of the\nintegrability-breaking perturbation and the nature of the near-integrable\ndynamics. We provide the first experimental evidence that thermalization close\nto a strongly interacting integrable point occurs in two steps:\nprethermalization followed by near-exponential thermalization. Exact numerical\ncalculations on a two-rung lattice model yield a similar two-timescale process,\nsuggesting that this is generic in strongly interacting near-integrable models.\nMoreover, the measured thermalization rate is consistent with a parameter-free\ntheoretical estimate, based on identifying the types of collisions that\ndominate thermalization. By providing tunability between regimes of integrable\nand nonintegrable dynamics, our work sheds light both on the mechanisms by\nwhich isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, and on the temporal\nstructure of the onset of thermalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 19:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 00:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 21:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Around low-mass stars, the HZ is much closer to the star than for\nSun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity of the\nstar forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the\nplanet. Under these conditions the effects of tidal heating, distortion\ntorques, and stellar perturbations become important considerations for exomoon\nhabitability.\n  Utilizing a model that considers both dynamical and tidal interactions\nsimultaneously, we performed a computational investigation into exomoon\nevolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars ($\\lesssim 0.6\\ M_{\\odot}$).\nWe show that dwarf stars with masses $\\lesssim 0.2\\ M_{\\odot}$ cannot host\nhabitable exomoons within the stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the\nmoon. Perturbations from a central star may continue to have deleterious\neffects in the HZ up to $\\approx 0.5\\ M_{\\odot}$, depending on the host\nplanet's mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to\nheating concerns, torques due to tidal and spin distortion can lead to the\nrelatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons of giant planets\nin HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable\nsurfaces. In cases with lower intensity tidal heating the stellar perturbations\nmay have a positive influence on exomoon habitability by promoting long-term\nheating and possibly extending the HZ for exomoons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 20:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Most existing methods exploit local\nregions within spatial manipulation to perform matching in local\ncorrespondence. However, they essentially extract \\emph{fixed} representations\nfrom pre-divided regions for each image and perform matching based on the\nextracted representation subsequently. For models in this pipeline, local finer\npatterns that are crucial to distinguish positive pairs from negative ones\ncannot be captured, and thus making them underperformed. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep multiplicative integration gating function, which answers\nthe question of \\emph{what-and-where to match} for effective person re-id. To\naddress \\emph{what} to match, our deep network emphasizes common local patterns\nby learning joint representations in a multiplicative way. The network\ncomprises two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract convolutional\nactivations, and generates relevant descriptors for pedestrian matching. This\nthus, leads to flexible representations for pair-wise images. To address\n\\emph{where} to match, we combat the spatial misalignment by performing\nspatially recurrent pooling via a four-directional recurrent neural network to\nimpose spatial dependency over all positions with respect to the entire image.\nThe proposed network is designed to be end-to-end trainable to characterize\nlocal pairwise feature interactions in a spatially aligned manner. To\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method, extensive experiments are conducted\nover three benchmark data sets: VIPeR, CUHK03 and Market-1501.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 23:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 06:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 23:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

We investigate the\nincentives of an MNO for offering some of her resources to an MVNO instead of\nusing the resources for her own End-Users (EUs). We consider a market with one\nMNO and one MVNO, and a continuum of undecided EUs. Two cases for EUs are\nconsidered: (i) when EUs need to choose either the MNO or the MVNO, and (ii)\nwhen EUs have an outside option. In each of these cases, we consider a\nnon-cooperative framework of sequential game and a cooperative framework of\nbargaining game. We characterize the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE) and\nNash Bargaining Solution (NBS) of the sequential and bargaining games,\nrespectively. We show that in the non-cooperative framework, SPNE assumes two\nforms: (i) the MNO invests minimally on her infrastructure and the MVNO leases\nall the newly invested resources and (ii) the MNO invests more on her\ninfrastructure, the MVNO leases only part of these resources to the MVNO, and\nthe MNO uses the rest herself to attract EUs. Thus, in both, the MNO generates\nrevenue indirectly through the MVNO. In addition to that, in (ii), the MNO\ngenerates revenue directly from the EUs. We also prove that in the bargaining\nframework, the MVNO either reserves all the resources or no resources from the\nMNO, and the MNO's investments are guided by whether EUs have an outside\noption. If they don't, then the MNO invests as little as possible on her\ninfrastructure.

Consider a team of $n$ cooperating robots\ntraveling along predetermined closed and disjoint trajectories. Each robot\nneeds to periodically communicate information to nearby robots. At places where\ntwo trajectories are within range of each other, a communication link is\nestablished, allowing two robots to exchange information, provided they are\n\"synchronized\", i.e., they visit the link at the same time. In this setting a\ncommunication graph is defined and a system of robots is called\n\\emph{synchronized} if every pair of neighbors is synchronized.\n  If one or more robots leave the system, then some trajectories are left\nunattended. To handle such cases in a synchronized system, when a live robot\narrives to a communication link and detects the absence of the neighbor, it\nshifts to the neighboring trajectory to assume the unattended task. If enough\nrobots leave, it may occur that a live robot enters a state of\n\\emph{starvation}, failing to permanently meet other robots during flight. To\nmeasure the tolerance of the system under this phenomenon we define the\n\\emph{$k$-resilience} as the minimum number of robots whose removal may cause\n$k$ surviving robots to enter a state of starvation. We show that the problem\nof computing the $k$-resilience is NP-hard if $k$ is part of the input, even if\nthe communication graph is a tree.

Varied methods and search strategies have been proposed,\neach of which is trained and optimized for specific models, topologies, and\nmodel parameters. Further, as LHC keeps excluding all expected candidates for\nnew physics, the need for a generic method/tool that is capable of finding the\nunexpected can not be understated. In this paper, we propose one such method\nthat relies on the philosophy that all anomalous objects are $\\it{not}$\nstandard-objects. The anomaly finder, we suggest, simply is a collection of\nvetoes that eliminate all standard-objects up to a pre-determined acceptance\nrate. Any event containing at least one anomalous object (that passes all these\nvetoes), can be identified as a candidate for new physics. Subsequent offline\nanalyses can determine the nature of the anomalous object as well as of the\nevent, paving a robust way to search for these new physics scenarios in a\nmodel-independent fashion. Further, since the method relies on learning only\nthe standard-objects, for which control samples are readily available from\ndata, one can build the analysis in an entirely data-driven way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 01:46:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 04:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 08:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 10:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

In turn, modern\njobs are often designed to run on any number of cores. However, to effectively\nleverage these multi-core chips, one must address the question of how many\ncores to assign to each job. Given that jobs receive sublinear speedups from\nadditional cores, there is an obvious tradeoff: allocating more cores to an\nindividual job reduces the job's runtime, but in turn decreases the efficiency\nof the overall system. We ask how the system should schedule jobs across cores\nso as to minimize the mean response time over a stream of incoming jobs.\n  To answer this question, we develop an analytical model of jobs running on a\nmulti-core machine. We prove that EQUI, a policy which continuously divides\ncores evenly across jobs, is optimal when all jobs follow a single speedup\ncurve and have exponentially distributed sizes. EQUI requires jobs to change\ntheir level of parallelization while they run. Since this is not possible for\nall workloads, we consider a class of \"fixed-width\" policies, which choose a\nsingle level of parallelization, k, to use for all jobs. We prove that,\nsurprisingly, it is possible to achieve EQUI's performance without requiring\njobs to change their levels of parallelization by using the optimal fixed level\nof parallelization, k*. We also show how to analytically derive the optimal k*\nas a function of the system load, the speedup curve, and the job size\ndistribution.\n  In the case where jobs may follow different speedup curves, finding a good\nscheduling policy is even more challenging. We find that policies like EQUI\nwhich performed well in the case of a single speedup function now perform\npoorly.

We consider\ncontractual load shedding and generation re-dispatch as exemplary emergency\nactions. To achieve computational efficiency and scalability, this novel\nformulation of the robust corrective action optimization is stated in terms of\nvoltages and currents, as opposed to standard formulation in terms of power\nflows and voltages. The current-voltage formulation is natural for expressing\nvoltage and thermal transmission line constraints, and its major advantage is\nin the linearity of the power flow equations. The complexity of the\ncurrent-voltage formulation, which is mainly related to the transformation of\nvoltages and currents into active and reactive power injections, can be largely\navoided by stating the cost function directly in terms of currents and using\nlinearized or robust estimates for load and generation constraints.

In this work we present an automatic\npre-processor that preforms these stages - AutOMP (Automatic OpenMP). AutOMP\nrecognize all the variables assignments inside a loop. These variables will be\nprivate unless the assignment is of an array element which depend on the loop\nindex variable. Afterwards, AutOMP finds the places where threads\nsynchronization is needed, and which reduction operator is to be used. At last,\nthe program provides the parallelization command to be used for parallelizing\nthe loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 11:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

First, we consider a class of centralized coded caching schemes\nutilizing general uncoded placement and a specific coded delivery strategy,\nwhich are specified by a general file partition parameter. Then, we formulate\nthe coded caching design optimization problem over the considered class of\nschemes with 2^K2^N variables to minimize the average load by optimizing the\nfile partition parameter under an arbitrary file popularity.

The local BSP\nfeatures are encoded by LLC (Locality-constrained Linear Coding) and fused with\nthree different global features. Our visual feature is robust to deformable\nshapes and our approach is able to recognise the category of unknown clothing\nin unconstrained and random configurations. We integrated the category\nrecognition pipeline with a stereo vision system, clothing instance detection,\nand dual-arm manipulators to achieve an autonomous sorting system. To verify\nthe performance of our proposed method, we build a high-resolution RGBD\nclothing dataset of 50 clothing items of 5 categories sampled in random\nconfigurations (a total of 2,100 clothing samples). Experimental results show\nthat our approach is able to reach 83.2\\% accuracy while classifying clothing\nitems which were previously unseen during training. This advances beyond the\nprevious state-of-the-art by 36.2\\%. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach\nin an autonomous robot sorting system, in which the robot recognises a clothing\nitem from an unconstrained pile, grasps it, and sorts it into a box according\nto its category. Our proposed sorting system achieves reasonable sorting\nsuccess rates with single-shot perception.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 13:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Therefore, a combination between the SCM and a designated Memory\nAllocation Manager (MAM) that will allow the programmer to manually control the\ndifferent memories in the memory hierarchy will be likely to achieve a new\nlevel of performance for memory-aware data structures. Although the manual MAM\nseems to be the optimal approach for multi-level memory hierarchy management,\nthis technique is still very far from being realistic, and the chances that it\nwould be implemented in current codes using High Performance Computing (HPC)\nplatforms is quite low. This premise means that the most reasonable way to\nintroduce the SCM into any usable and popular memory system would be by\nimplementing an automated version of the MAM using the fundamentals of paging\nalgorithms, as used for two-level memory hierarchy. Our hypothesis is that\nachieving appropriate transferability between memory levels may be possible\nusing ideas of algorithms employed in current virtual memory systems, and that\nthe adaptation of those algorithms from a two-level memory hierarchy to an\nN-level memory hierarchy is possible. In order to reach the conclusion that our\nhypothesis is correct, we investigated various paging algorithms, and found the\nones that could be adapted successfully from two-level memory hierarchy to an\nN-level memory hierarchy. We discovered that using an adaptation of the Aging\npaging algorithm to an N-level memory hierarchy results in the best\nperformances in terms of Hit/Miss ratio. In order to verify our hypothesis we\nbuild a simulator called \"DeMemory simulator\" for analyzing our algorithms as\nwell as for other algorithms that will be devised in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 13:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Precisely, the paper features a\nnew theorem, which states that the Rao-Fisher information metric of any\nlocation-scale model, defined on a Riemannian manifold, is a warped Riemannian\nmetric, whenever this model is invariant under the action of some Lie group.\nThis theorem is a valuable tool in finding the expression of the Rao-Fisher\ninformation metric of location-scale models defined on high-dimensional\nRiemannian manifolds. Indeed, a warped Riemannian metric is fully determined by\nonly two functions of a single variable, irrespective of the dimension of the\nunderlying Riemannian manifold. Starting from this theorem, several original\ncontributions are made. The expression of the Rao-Fisher information metric of\nthe Riemannian Gaussian model is provided, for the first time in the\nliterature. A generalised definition of the Mahalanobis distance is introduced,\nwhich is applicable to any location-scale model defined on a Riemannian\nmanifold. The solution of the geodesic equation is obtained, for any Rao-Fisher\ninformation metric defined in terms of warped Riemannian metrics. Finally,\nusing a mixture of analytical and numerical computations, it is shown that the\nparameter space of the von Mises-Fisher model of $n$-dimensional directional\ndata, when equipped with its Rao-Fisher information metric, becomes a Hadamard\nmanifold, a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold of negative sectional\ncurvature, for $n = 2,\\ldots,8$. Hopefully, in upcoming work, this will be\nproved for any value of $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 13:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

In the absence of inertial\neffects, it is well known that the generic initial Kuramoto ensemble relaxes to\nthe phase-locked states asymptotically (emergence of complete synchronization)\nin a large coupling regime. Similarly, even for the presence of inertial\neffects, similar collective behaviors are observed numerically for generic\ninitial configurations in a large coupling strength regime.

The first and second degrees of\nquantum coherence of relic photons are then computed beyond the effective\nhorizon defined by the evolution of the susceptibility. In the zero-delay limit\nthe Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations exhibit a super-Poissonian statistics\nwhich is however different from the conventional results of the single-mode\napproximation customarily employed, in quantum optics, to classify the\ncoherence properties of visible light. While in the case of large-scale\ncurvature perturbations the degrees of quantum coherence coincide with the\nnaive expectation of the single-mode approximation, the net degree of\nsecond-order coherence computed for the relic photons diminishes thanks to the\neffect of the polarizations. We suggest that the Hanbury Brown-twiss\ncorrelations are probably the only tool to assess the quantum or classical\norigin of the large-scale magnetic fluctuations and of the corresponding\ncurvature perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 14:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

It represents by itself a\nBose-Einstein condensate consisting of enormous amount of virtual\nparticle-antiparticle pairs emerging and disappearing in an infinitely ongoing\ndance. Flowing of this medium in the non-relativistic limit is described by the\nmodified Navier-Stokes equation along with the continuity equation. The first\nequation admits the splitting on to two coupled equations. They are the quantum\nHamilton-Jacobi equation and the equation for vorticity. The quantum\nHamilton-Jacoby equation paired with the continuity equation can be reduced to\nthe \\Schrodinger equation. These two equations representing the kernel of the\nBohmian mechanics give finding bundle of the Bohmian trajectories. Whereas the\nvorticity equation gives solutions for vortices moving along such trajectories.\nAs the result we come to the de Broglie's interpretation of quantum mechanics\naccording to which there is a pilot-wave guiding the particle (in our case it\nis a vortex clot) from a source up to its detection along an optimal path that\nis the Bohmian trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 07:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

Previous work has\nshown that nonlinear interactions among counterpropagating Alfven waves---or\nAlfven wave collisions---are the fundamental building block of astrophysical\nplasma turbulence and naturally generate current sheets in the strongly\nnonlinear limit. A nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation of a strong Alfven wave\ncollision is used to examine the damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations\nand the associated energization of particles that occurs in self-consistently\ngenerated current sheets. A simple model explains the flow of energy due to the\ncollisionless damping and the associated particle energization, as well as the\nsubsequent thermalization of the particle energy by collisions. The net\nparticle energization by the parallel electric field is shown to be spatially\nintermittent, and the nonlinear evolution is essential in enabling that spatial\nnon-uniformity. Using the recently developed field-particle correlation\ntechnique, we show that particles resonant with the Alfven waves in the\nsimulation dominate the energy transfer, demonstrating conclusively that Landau\ndamping plays a key role in the spatially intermittent damping of the\nelectromagnetic fluctuations and consequent energization of the particles in\nthis strongly nonlinear simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 17:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We propose a Bayesian method to\ninfer the posterior probability of uncertain links in the network, and we\nderive closed form equations for these probabilities.
