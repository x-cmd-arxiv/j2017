An integro-differential equation is obtained for the time evolution\nof this quadratic-exponential functional, which is compared with the original\nquantum risk-sensitive performance criterion employed previously for\nmeasurement-based quantum control and filtering problems. Using multi-point\nGaussian quantum states for the past history of the system variables and their\nfirst four moments, we discuss a quartic approximation of the cost functional\nand its infinite-horizon asymptotic behaviour. The computation of the\nasymptotic growth rate of this approximation is reduced to solving two\nalgebraic Lyapunov equations.

We present results which show how one can\neffectively reduce the error rate associated with a noisy quantum channel, by\ncounteracting its detrimental effects with another form of noise. In\nparticular, we consider the effect of adding on top of a purely Markovian\n(Lindblad) dynamics, a more general form of dissipation, which we refer to as\ngeneralized-Markovian noise. This noise has an associated memory kernel and the\nresulting dynamics is described by an integro-differential equation. The\noverall dynamics are characterized by decay rates which depend not only on the\noriginal dissipative time-scales, but also on the new integral kernel. We find\nthat one can engineer this kernel such that the overall rate of decay is\nlowered by the addition of this noise term. We illustrate this technique for\nthe case where the bare noise is described by a dephasing Pauli channel. We\nanalytically solve this model, and show that one can effectively double (or\neven triple) the length of the channel, whilst achieving the same fidelity,\nentanglement, and error threshold. We numerically verify this scheme can also\nbe used to protect against thermal Markovian noise (at non-zero temperature),\nwhich models spontaneous emission and excitation processes.

Deep learning, however, with its carefully designed hierarchical\nstructure, is able to combine hidden features to form more representative\nfeatures for pattern recognition. In this paper, we proposed sparse deep\nnonnegative matrix factorization models to analyze complex data for more\naccurate classification and better feature interpretation. Such models are\ndesigned to learn localized features or generate more discriminative\nrepresentations for samples in distinct classes by imposing $L_1$-norm penalty\non the columns of certain factors. By extending one-layer model into\nmulti-layer one with sparsity, we provided a hierarchical way to analyze big\ndata and extract hidden features intuitively due to nonnegativity. We adopted\nthe Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm to accelerate the computing\nprocess with the convergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$ after $k$ steps iteration. We\nalso analyzed the computing complexity of our framework to demonstrate their\nefficiency. To improve the performance of dealing with linearly inseparable\ndata, we also considered to incorporate popular nonlinear functions into this\nframework and explored their performance. We applied our models onto two\nbenchmarking image datasets, demonstrating our models can achieve competitive\nor better classification performance and produce intuitive interpretations\ncompared with the typical NMF and competing multi-layer models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

Although it is natural to make these\nassumptions as a starting point for further research, removing them or even\nacknowledging that such removal should happen is more challenging for some of\nthese concepts than for others. Probabilistic argumentation is one of the\napproaches that can be harnessed for more accurate user modelling. The\nepistemic approach allows us to represent how much a given argument is believed\nby a given person, offering us the possibility to express more than just three\nagreement states. It is equipped with a wide range of postulates, including\nthose that do not make any restrictions concerning how initial arguments should\nbe viewed, thus potentially being more adequate for handling beliefs of the\npeople that have not fully disclosed their opinions in comparison to Dung's\nsemantics. The constellation approach can be used to represent the views of\ndifferent people concerning the structure of the framework we are dealing with,\nincluding cases in which not all relations are acknowledged or when they are\nseen differently than intended. Finally, bipolar argumentation frameworks can\nbe used to express both positive and negative relations between arguments. In\nthis paper we describe the results of an experiment in which participants\njudged dialogues in terms of agreement and structure. We compare our findings\nwith the aforementioned assumptions as well as with the constellation and\nepistemic approaches to probabilistic argumentation and bipolar argumentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 14:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

The second-order models are thus more\ndescriptive (e.g., they have been used to model variable mixtures of\nbehaviorally-different traffic, like car/truck traffic, autonomous/human-driven\ntraffic, etc.), but are much more complex. The second-order node problem is a\nparticularly complex problem, as it requires the resolution of discontinuities\nin traffic density and mixture characteristics, and solving of throughflows for\narbitrary numbers of input and output roads to a node (in other words, this is\nan arbitrary-dimensional Riemann problem with two conserved quantities).

Accordingly,\ncentrality measures may fail to faithfully extract the importance of nodes in\nthe presence of uncertainty. To mitigate these problems, we suggest a\nstatistical approach based on graphon theory: we introduce formal definitions\nof centrality measures for graphons and establish their connections to\nclassical graph centrality measures.

Early deidentification methods relying on image blurring or\npixelization were replaced in recent years with techniques based on formal\nanonymity models that provide privacy guaranties and at the same time aim at\nretaining certain characteristics of the data even after deidentification. The\nlatter aspect is particularly important, as it allows to exploit the\ndeidentified data in applications for which identity information is irrelevant.\nIn this work we present a novel face deidentification pipeline, which ensures\nanonymity by synthesizing artificial surrogate faces using generative neural\nnetworks (GNNs). The generated faces are used to deidentify subjects in images\nor video, while preserving non-identity-related aspects of the data and\nconsequently enabling data utilization. Since generative networks are very\nadaptive and can utilize a diverse set of parameters (pertaining to the\nappearance of the generated output in terms of facial expressions, gender,\nrace, etc.), they represent a natural choice for the problem of face\ndeidentification. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform\nexperiments using automated recognition tools and human annotators. Our results\nshow that the recognition performance on deidentified images is close to\nchance, suggesting that the deidentification process based on GNNs is highly\neffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 18:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

We demonstrate the near-field\ncapability of the instrument through the comparison of time-resolved polar Kerr\nimages of magnetization dynamics within a microscale NiFe rectangle acquired\nusing both near-field and focused TRSKM techniques at a wavelength of 800 nm.\nThe flux-closure domain state of the in-plane equilibrium magnetization\nprovided the maximum possible dynamic polar Kerr contrast across the central\ndomain wall, and enabled an assessment of the magneto-optical spatial\nresolution of each technique. Line profiles extracted from the Kerr images\ndemonstrate that the near-field spatial resolution was enhanced with respect to\nthat of the focused Kerr images. Furthermore, the near-field polar Kerr signal\n(~1 mdeg) was more than half that of the focused Kerr signal, despite the\npotential loss of probe light due to internal reflections within the AFM tip.\nWe have confirmed the near-field operation by exploring the influence of the\ntip-sample separation, and have determined the spatial resolution to be ~550 nm\nfor an aperture with a sub-wavelength diameter of 400 nm.

With a\nbackground magnetic field, the differential rotation winds up and amplifies the\nfield, and previous work where large mode amplitudes were considered suggests\nthat the amplification may damp out the instability. A background magnetic\nfield, however, turns the saturated time-independent perturbations\ncorresponding to adding differential rotation into perturbations whose\ncharacteristic frequencies are of order the Alfv\\'en frequency.

A gradual transition from impactful to\nsmooth entry is observed as the wedge angle decreases. After submersion, diving\nwedges experience significantly smaller drag forces (two-fold smaller) than\nimmersed wedges.

Class\nimbalance happens when the data categories are not equally represented, i.e.,\nat least one category is minority compared to other categories. It can cause\nlearning bias towards the majority class and poor generalization. Concept drift\nis a change in the underlying distribution of the problem, and is a significant\nissue specially when learning from data streams. It requires learners to be\nadaptive to dynamic changes.\n  Class imbalance and concept drift can significantly hinder predictive\nperformance, and the problem becomes particularly challenging when they occur\nsimultaneously. This challenge arises from the fact that one problem can affect\nthe treatment of the other. For example, drift detection algorithms based on\nthe traditional classification error may be sensitive to the imbalanced degree\nand become less effective; and class imbalance techniques need to be adaptive\nto changing imbalance rates, otherwise the class receiving the preferential\ntreatment may not be the correct minority class at the current moment.\nTherefore, the mutual effect of class imbalance and concept drift should be\nconsidered during algorithm design.\n  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the areas of\nclass imbalance learning and concept drift in order to encourage discussions\nand new collaborations on solving the combined issue of class imbalance and\nconcept drift. It provides a forum for international researchers and\npractitioners to share and discuss their original work on addressing new\nchallenges and research issues in class imbalance learning, concept drift, and\nthe combined issues of class imbalance and concept drift.

We show how to address this challenge by using principled model selection\ntechniques to empirically evaluate theoretical mortality models. We test nine\ndifferent theoretical models of old-age death rates by fitting them to 360\nhigh-quality datasets on cohort mortality above age 80.

The surface abundances of CEMP-s stars are\nthus commonly assumed to reflect the nucleosynthesis output of the first AGB\nstars. We have previously shown that, for this to be the case, some physical\nmechanism must counter atomic diffusion in these nearly fully radiative stars,\nwhich otherwise leads to surface abundance anomalies clearly inconsistent with\nobservations. Here we take into account angular momentum accretion by these\nstars. We compute in detail the evolution of typical CEMP-s stars from the\nZAMS, through the mass accretion, and up the RGB for a wide range of specific\nangular momentum of the accreted material, corresponding to rotation velocities\nbetween about 0.3 and 300 km/s. We find that only for specific angular momentum\nabove 1e+17 cm2/s (rotation velocities above 20 km/s) angular momentum\naccretion directly causes chemical dilution of the accreted material. This\ncould nevertheless be relevant to CEMP-s stars, which are observed to rotate\nmore slowly, if they undergo continuous angular momentum loss akin to\nsolar-like stars. In models with rotation velocities characteristic of CEMP-s\nstars, rotational mixing primarily serves to inhibit atomic diffusion, such\nthat the maximal surface abundance variations (with respect to the composition\nof the accreted material) prior to first dredge-up remain within about 0.4 dex\nwithout thermohaline mixing or about 0.5-1.5 dex with thermohaline mixing. Even\nin models with the lowest rotation velocities (under a km/s), rotational mixing\nis able to severely inhibit atomic diffusion, compared to non-rotating models.\nWe thus conclude that it offers a natural solution to the problem posed by\natomic diffusion and cannot be neglected in models of CEMP-s stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 23:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

As in thermal convection downflows are colder than upflows, the\ninhomogeneity of the dissipation potentially changes the convection structure.\nOur investigation on the inhomogeneity of the dissipation shows the following.\n1. More dissipation is seen around the bottom of the calculation domain, and\nthis tendency is promoted with the magnetic field. 2.

We call relation a triplet of the form (subject, predicate,\nobject) where the predicate is typically a preposition (eg.

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First,\nwe design strong yet flexible visual features that encode the appearance and\nspatial configuration for pairs of objects. Second, we propose a\nweakly-supervised discriminative clustering model to learn relations from\nimage-level labels only.

To\novercome limitations of existing methods and incorporate the temporal\ninformation of traffic video, we design a novel FCN-rLSTM network to jointly\nestimate vehicle density and vehicle count by connecting fully convolutional\nneural networks (FCN) with long short term memory networks (LSTM) in a residual\nlearning fashion.

We have analyzed\nX-ray burst spectra from the LMXB 4U 1608-52, with the aim of studying how the\ndifferent persistent emission components react to the bursts. During some\nbursts in the soft spectral state we find that there are two variable\ncomponents; one corresponding to the burst blackbody component and another\noptically thick Comptonized component. We interpret the latter as the spreading\nlayer between the NS surface and the accretion disc, which is not present\nduring the hard state bursts. We propose that the spectral changes during the\nsoft state bursts are driven by the spreading layer that could cover almost the\nentire NS in the brightest phases due to the enhanced radiation pressure\nsupport provided by the burst, and that the layer subsequently returns to its\noriginal state during the burst decay. When deriving the NS mass and radius\nusing the soft state bursts two assumptions are therefore not met: the NS is\nnot entirely visible and the burst emission is reprocessed in the spreading\nlayer, causing distortions of the emitted spectrum. For these reasons the NS\nmass and radius constraints using the soft state bursts are different compared\nto the ones derived using the hard state bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 07:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Passive mode-locking technique is a key step to realize\nthe ultrafast soliton fiber lasers. However, the booting dynamics of the\nsoliton fiber lasers have not yet been well understood. Herein, we reveal the\nsoliton buildup dynamics of ultrafast fiber lasers operating both in anomalous\nand net-normal dispersion regimes. Based on the advanced experimental\nmethodologies of spatio-temporal reconstruction and dispersive Fourier\ntransform (DFT), the soliton booting dynamics are analyzed in the time and\nspectral domains. It was found that the booting dynamics of conventional and\ndissipative solitons operating in the anomalous and net-normal dispersion\nregimes, respectively, are different from each other due to the different pulse\nshaping mechanisms. In particular, the spectral interference pattern with\nstrong relaxation oscillation behavior was observed near the mode-locking\ntransition for conventional soliton, while no relaxation oscillation of\nspectral pattern was obtained for dissipative soliton. We firstly revealed that\nthe spectral pattern distributions are induced by the transient structured\nsoliton formation during the pulse shaping from the noise background. The\nexperimental results were verified by the theoretical simulations. The obtained\nresults would provide a general guideline for understanding the soliton booting\ndynamics in ultrafast fiber lasers, and will prove to be fruitful to the\nvarious communities interested in solitons and fiber lasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 08:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

Each country is then assigned a vector\nspecifying the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate\noutput is then used in to construct a network of countries based on information\ntheoretical metrics where the links capture similar vectorial patterns in the\ntopic distributions. Topology of the networks is then analyzed through network\nproperties like density, path length and clustering. Finally, we identify\nspecific topological features of our networks using the map equation framework\nto detect communities in our networks of countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 10:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

But,\nour results suggest that SBM, whose computational time is high, cannot in\ngeneral overcome the Cannistraci-Hebb (CH) network automaton model that is a\nsimple local-learning-rule of topological self-organization proved as the\ncurrent best local-based and parameter-free deterministic rule for\nlink-prediction.

Intermittent convective mixing at the convective\nboundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical\nanalysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science.\nIn this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a\none-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from\nmulti-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star.

We perform spin torque\nferromagnetic resonance measurements on Py/CuPt bilayer and find that as the Pt\nconcentration increases, the spin Hall angle of CuPt alloy increases. Moreover,\nonly 28% Pt in CuPt alloy can give rise to a spin Hall angle close to that of\nPt. We further extract the spin Hall resistivity of CuPt alloy for different Pt\nconcentrations and find that the contribution of skew scattering is larger for\nlower Pt concentrations, while the side-jump contribution is larger for higher\nPt concentrations. From technological perspective, since the CuPt alloy can\nsustain high processing temperatures and Cu is the most common metallization\nelement in the Si platform, it would be easier to integrate the CuPt alloy\nbased spintronic devices into existing Si fabrication technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 15:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

We study the\nimpact of the deformation of Dirac cone on dynamical gap generation. When a\nuniaxial strain is applied to graphene, the Dirac cone is made elliptical in\nthe equal-energy plane and the fermion velocity becomes anisotropic. The\napplied uniaxial strain has two effects: it decreases the fermion velocity; it\nincreases the velocity anisotropy. After solving the Dyson-Schwinger gap\nequation, we show that dynamical gap generation is promoted by the former\neffect, but is suppressed by the latter one. For suspended graphene, we find\nthat the systems undergoes an excitonic insulating transition when the strain\nis roughly 7.34$\\%$. We also solve the gap equation in case the Dirac cone is\ntiled, which might be realized in the organic material\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$I$_{3}$, and find that the tilt of Dirac cone can\nsuppress dynamical gap generation. It turns out that the geometry of the Dirac\ncone plays an important role in the formation of excitonic pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 15:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

To address this, we devise a recurrent scale\napproximation (RSA) to compute feature map once only, and only through this map\ncan we approximate the rest maps on other levels. At the core of RSA is the\nrecursive rolling out mechanism: given an initial map at a particular scale, it\ngenerates the prediction at a smaller scale that is half the size of input. To\nfurther increase efficiency and accuracy, we (a): design a scale-forecast\nnetwork to globally predict potential scales in the image since there is no\nneed to compute maps on all levels of the pyramid. (b): propose a landmark\nretracing network (LRN) to trace back locations of the regressed landmarks and\ngenerate a confidence score for each landmark; LRN can effectively alleviate\nfalse positives caused by the accumulated error in RSA. The whole system can be\ntrained end-to-end in a unified CNN framework. Experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed algorithm is superior against state-of-the-art methods on face\ndetection benchmarks and achieves comparable results for generic proposal\ngeneration.

It takes advantage of a widely-observed\nphenomenon in photodetector devices: a nonlinear, irradiance-dependent\nphotoresponse. This means that the output from a sensor is dependent on the\ntotal number of photons incident and the size of the area in which they fall.\nWith a certain arrangement of sensor and lens, this phenomenon will cause the\noutput of the sensor to change based on how far in or out of focus an object\nis. We call this the FIP effect. Here we demonstrate how to use the FIP effect\nfor distance measurements. We show that this technique works with different\nsensor materials, device types, as well as visible and near infrared light. In\nprinciple, any sensor exhibiting a photoresponse that depends nonlinearly on\nirradiance could be used with the FIP technique. It is our belief that the FIP\ntechnique can become an important method for measuring distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

We develop a\nrenormalization group theory for a prototypical network on a regular grid,\nwhere individual links switch stochastically between active and inactive\nstates. The question whether a given source node can communicate with a\ndestination node along paths of active links is equivalent to a percolation\nproblem. Our theory maps the temporal existence of multi-hop paths on an\neffective two-state Markov process. We show analytically how this Markov\nprocess converges towards a memory-less Bernoulli process as the hop distance\nbetween source and destination node increases. Our work extends classical\npercolation theory to the dynamic case and elucidates temporal correlations of\nmessage losses. Quantification of temporal correlations has implications for\nthe design of wireless communication and control protocols, e.g. in\ncyber-physical systems such as self-organized swarms of drones or smart traffic\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 08:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

The design of\nsuch aerial networks is however different compared to cellular 2D networks, as\nantennas from the drones are looking down, and the channel model becomes\nheight-dependent. In this paper, we study the effect of antenna patterns and\nheight-dependent shadowing. We consider a random network topology to capture\nthe effect of dynamic changes of the flying base stations. First we\ncharacterize the aggregate interference imposed by the co-channel neighboring\ndrones. Then we derive the link coverage probability between a ground user and\nits associated drone base station. The result is used to obtain the optimum\nsystem parameters in terms of drones antenna beamwidth, density and altitude.\nWe also derive the average LoS probability of the associated drone and show\nthat it is a good approximation and simplification of the coverage probability\nin low altitudes up to 500 m according to the required\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}
