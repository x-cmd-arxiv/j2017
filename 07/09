Unlike the typical wired scenarios\nstudied in the networking literature in which entire files are typically\ncached, recent research has suggested that fractional caching at the BSs of a\nwireless system can be beneficial. This paper investigates the benefits of\nfractional caching in a scenario with a cloud processor connected via a\nwireless fronthaul link to a BS, which serves a number of mobile users on a\nwireless downlink channel using orthogonal spectral resources. The fronthaul\nand downlink channels occupy orthogonal frequency bands.

An analytical\nframework based on theory of Markov chains with rewards is provided that\nenables the optimization of fractional edge caching at the BSs.

Further, we discuss a few algorithmic enhancements based on\nthe sequential bound-tightening procedure as a presolve step, where we observe\nthe importance of solving piecewise relaxations compared to basic convex\nrelaxations to speed-up the convergence of the algorithm to global optimality.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our disjunctive formulations and the\nalgorithm on well-known benchmark problems (including Pooling and Blending\ninstances) from MINLPLib and compare with state-of-the-art global optimization\nsolvers. With this novel approach, we solve several large-scale instances which\nare, in some cases, intractable by the global optimization solver. We also\nshrink the best known optimality gap for one of the hard, generalized pooling\nproblem instance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jul 2017 01:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 01:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 22:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Optimization-based approaches, such as\nModel Predictive Control (MPC), can provide such optimal policies, but their\ncomputational complexity is generally unacceptable for real-time\nimplementation. To address this problem, we propose a fast integrated planning\nand control framework that combines learning- and optimization-based approaches\nin a two-layer hierarchical structure. The first layer, defined as the \"policy\nlayer\", is established by a neural network which learns the long-term optimal\ndriving policy generated by MPC. The second layer, called the \"execution\nlayer\", is a short-term optimization-based controller that tracks the reference\ntrajecotries given by the \"policy layer\" with guaranteed short-term safety and\nfeasibility. Moreover, with efficient and highly-representative features, a\nsmall-size neural network is sufficient in the \"policy layer\" to handle many\ncomplicated driving scenarios. This renders online imitation learning with\nDataset Aggregation (DAgger) so that the performance of the \"policy layer\" can\nbe improved rapidly and continuously online.

MLRs are useful for both researchers and\npractitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and\n-practice in a given area. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct\nSLR studies in SE. However, given the facts that several phases of MLRs differ\nfrom those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process\nand source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially\nuseful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present\nguidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR\nguidelines, we benefit from three inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE,\n(2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other\nfields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. All\nderived guidelines are discussed in the context of three examples MLRs as\nrunning examples (two from SE and one MLR from the medical sciences). Results:\nThe resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in\nSE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting\nof the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast\nset of recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other\nfields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.\nConclusion: Having been developed on the basis of three types of solid\nexperience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines support researchers to\neffectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jul 2017 10:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 20:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 05:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 08:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Gating\ncurrents of the voltage sensor are now known to depend on the back-and-forth\nmovements of positively charged arginines through the hydrophobic plug of a\nvoltage sensor domain. Transient movements of these permanently charged\narginines, caused by the change of transmembrane potential, further drag the S4\nsegment and induce opening/closing of ion conduction pore by moving the S4-S5\nlinker. The ion conduction pore is a separate device from the voltage sensor,\nlinked (in an unknown way) by the mechanical motion and electric field changes\nof the S4-S5 linker. This moving permanent charge induces capacitive current\nflow everywhere. Everything interacts with everything else in the voltage\nsensor so everything must interact with everything else in its mathematical\nmodel, as everything does in the whole protein. A PNP-steric model of arginines\nand a mechanical model for the S4 segment are combined using energy variational\nmethods in which all movements of charge and mass satisfy conservation laws of\ncurrent and mass. The resulting 1D continuum model is used to compute gating\ncurrents under a wide range of conditions, corresponding to experimental\nsituations. Chemical-reaction-type models based on ordinary differential\nequations cannot capture such interactions with one set of parameters. Indeed,\nthey may inadvertently violate conservation of current. Conservation of current\nis particularly important since small violations (<0.01%) quickly (<< 10-6\nseconds) produce forces that destroy molecules.

Under the SML model, products are partitioned into two levels, to\ncapture differences in attractiveness, brand awareness and, or visibility of\nthe products in the market. When a consumer is presented with an assortment of\nproducts, she first considers products in the first level and, if none of them\nis purchased, products in the second level are considered. This model is a\nspecial case of the Perception-Adjusted Luce Model (PALM) recently proposed by\nEchenique et al (2018). It can explain many behavioural phenomena such as the\nattraction, compromise, similarity effects and choice overload which cannot be\nexplained by the MNL model or any discrete choice model based on random\nutility. In particular, the SML model allows violations to regularity which\nstates that the probability of choosing a product cannot increase if the offer\nset is enlarged.\n  This paper shows that the seminal concept of revenue-ordered assortment sets,\nwhich contain an optimal assortment under the MNL model, can be generalized to\nthe SML model. More precisely, the paper proves that all optimal assortments\nunder the SML are revenue-ordered by level, a natural generalization of\nrevenue-ordered assortments that contains, at most, a quadratic number of\nassortments. As a corollary, assortment optimization under the SML is\npolynomial-time solvable.

We conclude that the regions reflect features of\nfragmentation and hadronization of partons through the string dynamics. The\nnuclear transparency results in negligible influence of the medium in the III\nregion ($p_T >17-20 GeV/c$), which has highest $p_T$ values.

The increase in string\ndensity in this region could lead to fusion of strings, appearance of a new\nstring and collective behaviour of the partons in the most central collisions.\nThese phenomena can explain anomalous behaviour of the Nuclear Modification\nFactor in the II region.
