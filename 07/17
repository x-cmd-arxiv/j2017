Usually, it is developed and mastered in interaction, both\npositive and negative, with other more operational existing domains. Few\nreasoning mechanisms have been proposed to account for the interplay of\ndifferent conceptual domains and the transfer of information from one to\nanother. Analogical reasoning is one, blending is another. This paper presents\na new mechanism, called 'tunnel effect', that may explain, in part, how\nscientists and students reason while constructing a new conceptual domain. One\nexperimental study with high school students and analyses from the history of\nscience, particularly about the birth of classical thermodynamics, provide\nevidence and illustrate this mechanism. The knowledge organization, processes\nand conditions for its appearance are detailed and put into the perspective of\na computational model. Specifically, we put forward the hypothesis that two\nlevels of knowledge, notional and conceptual, cooperate in the scientific\ndiscovery process when a new conceptual domain is being built. The type of\nconceptual learning that can be associated with tunnel effect is discussed and\na thorough comparison is made with analogical reasoning in order to underline\nthe main features of the new proposed mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 16:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies\nalso show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass.

Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the\nmean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies.

For this purpose,\nthe conventional Navier-Stokes equations have been numerically solved using the\nfinite volume method on non-staggered grid, while employing the second-order\nvelocity slip condition at the wall with $C_1=1$. The results indicate that\nalthough the magnitude of local velocity slip at the wall is always greater\nthan that for the fully-developed section, the local wall shear stress,\nparticularly for higher $Kn$ and $C_2$, could be considerably lower than its\nfully-developed value. This effect, which is more prominent for lower $Re$,\nsignificantly affects the local and the fully-developed incremental pressure\ndrop number $K(x)$ and $K_{fd}$, respectively.

The\nsubjectiveness causes at least two problems. First, no single video summarizer\nfits all users unless it interacts with and adapts to the individual users.\nSecond, it is very challenging to evaluate the performance of a video\nsummarizer.\n  To tackle the first problem, we explore the recently proposed query-focused\nvideo summarization which introduces user preferences in the form of text\nqueries about the video into the summarization process. We propose a memory\nnetwork parameterized sequential determinantal point process in order to attend\nthe user query onto different video frames and shots. To address the second\nchallenge, we contend that a good evaluation metric for video summarization\nshould focus on the semantic information that humans can perceive rather than\nthe visual features or temporal overlaps. To this end, we collect dense\nper-video-shot concept annotations, compile a new dataset, and suggest an\nefficient evaluation method defined upon the concept annotations. We conduct\nextensive experiments contrasting our video summarizer to existing ones and\npresent detailed analyses about the dataset and the new evaluation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 23:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

However, these graph kernels use\nhandcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are\nhampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation,\nin this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn\ndata-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's\nembeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence,\nthey could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification,\nclustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our\nexperiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that\ngraph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering\naccuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 05:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

More recently, hardness results for problems in P were achieved\nusing reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions such as: Strong Exponential\nTime Hypothesis (SETH), 3SUM and All-Pairs Shortest-Paths (APSP). According to\nthese assumptions, many graph theoretic problems do not admit truly\nsubquadratic algorithms, nor even truly subcubic algorithms (Williams and\nWilliams, FOCS 2010 and Abboud, Grandoni, Williams, SODA 2015). A central\ntechnique used to tackle the difficulty of the above mentioned problems is\nfixed-parameter algorithms for polynomial-time problems with polynomial\ndependency in the fixed parameter (P-FPT). This technique was introduced by\nAbboud, Williams and Wang in SODA 2016 and continued by Husfeldt (IPEC 2016)\nand Fomin et al. (SODA 2017), using the treewidth as a parameter. Applying this\ntechnique to clique-width, another important graph parameter, remained to be\ndone. In this paper we study several graph theoretic problems for which\nhardness results exist such as cycle problems (triangle detection, triangle\ncounting, girth, diameter), distance problems (diameter, eccentricities, Gromov\nhyperbolicity, betweenness centrality) and maximum matching. We provide\nhardness results and fully polynomial FPT algorithms, using clique-width and\nsome of its upper-bounds as parameters (split-width, modular-width and\n$P\\_4$-sparseness). We believe that our most important result is an ${\\cal\nO}(k^4 \\cdot n + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum matching where $k$\nis either the modular-width or the $P\\_4$-sparseness. The latter generalizes\nmany algorithms that have been introduced so far for specific subclasses such\nas cographs, $P\\_4$-lite graphs, $P\\_4$-extendible graphs and $P\\_4$-tidy\ngraphs.

However, the feature maps in the lower layers close to the input\nwhich are responsible for detecting small objects in a single stage detector\nhave a problem of insufficient representation power because they are too\nshallow. There is also a structural contradiction that the feature maps have to\ndeliver low-level information to next layers as well as contain high-level\nabstraction for prediction.

However, the first version supported only an analysis period of one day.\nThis paper describes the lessons learned while extending the simulation period\nfrom one day to one week. One important issue is ensuring realistic start times\nof activities. Due to differences between the realized trip durations during\nthe simulation and the trip durations assumed when creating the activity\nschedule, the realized activity schedule and the planned activity schedule may\ndeviate from each other at some point in time during simulation. A suitable\nrescheduling strategy is needed to prevent this. Another issue is the different\nbehavior at weekends, when more joint activities take place than on weekdays,\nresulting in an increased share of trips made using the mode car as passenger.\nIf a mode choice model that takes availability of ride-sharing opportunities\ninto account is used, it can be difficult to reproduce the correct modal split\nwithout modeling explicitly these joint activities. When modeling travel demand\nfor a week, it is also important to account for infrequent long-distance trips.\nWhile the share of these trips is low, the total number is not negligible. It\nseems that these long-distance trips are not well covered by the destination\nchoice model used for the day-to-day trips, indicating the need for a\nlong-distance trip model of infrequent events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 09:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

We consider the strongest model of\nMobile Byzantine failures to date: agents are moved arbitrarily by an\nomniscient adversary from a server to another in order to deviate their\ncomputation in an unforeseen manner. When a server is infected by an Byzantine\nagent, it behaves arbitrarily until the adversary decides to move the agent to\nanother server. Previous approaches considered asynchronous servers with\nsynchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding impossibility results), and\nsynchronous servers with synchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding optimal\nsolutions for regular register implementation, even in the case where servers\nand agents periods are decoupled). We consider the remaining open case of\nsynchronous servers with unsynchronized agents, that can move at their own\npace, and change their pace during the execution of the protocol. Most of our\nfindings relate to lower bounds, and characterizing the model parameters that\nmake the problem solvable. It turns out that unsynchronized mobile Byzantine\nagent movements requires completely new proof arguments, that can be of\nindependent interest when studying other problems in this model. Additionally,\nwe propose a generic server-based algorithm that emulates a regular register in\nthis model, that is tight with respect to the number of mobile Byzantine agents\nthat can be tolerated. Our emulation spans two awareness models: servers with\nand without self-diagnose mechanisms. In the first case servers are aware that\nthe mobile Byzantine agent has left and hence they can stop running the\nprotocol until they recover a correct state while in the second case, servers\nare not aware of their faulty state and continue to run the protocol using an\nincorrect local state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 09:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

It is shown that each field-provoked\n$\\mu$-level in the chain spectrum gives birth to the $\\mu$-subband of\nfield-independent levels due to the electron-transfer interaction in the\ndirection perpendicular to $E_e$. The level spacing and hence, the width of\n$\\mu$-subbands $E^0_{\\rm bw}$, is dictated by the conductor length, the hopping\nintegral $t$, and by the lattice constant $a$. Another principal result is that\nthe levels, which are within the energy interval $0.5E^0_{\\rm bw}$ on either\nsides of the spectrum (that is the edge spectrum), correspond to the\ndelocalized states which are extended in the direction perpendicular to the\nelectric field. In this direction, the electron spectrum width $E^{\\perp}_{\\rm\nbw}$ is larger by $E^0_{\\rm bw}$ than the spectrum width in the field direction\n$E^{\\parallel}_{\\rm bw}$. Several special cases of the interrelation between\nthe electron energy versus applied voltage are identified, when the spacing\nbetween the $\\mu$-subband centers is equal either to integer or fraction ($>1$)\nportion of dimensionless $\\varepsilon$. Otherwise, the level spacing is shown\nto be irregular and, depending on $N$, $\\cal N$, and $\\varepsilon$, it can be\nequal to any portion of $\\varepsilon$.

We recall that $K/k$ is modular if for every $n \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$,$K^{p^n}$ and $k$ are $k\\cap K^{p^ n}$-linearly disjoint. A natural\ngeneralization of this notion is to say that $K/k$ is $lq$-modular if $K$ is\nmodular over a finite extension of $k$. Our main objective is to extend in\ndefinite form the results and definitions of the $lq$-modularity that have\nalready been obtained in the case limited by the finiteness condition imposed\non $[k :k^p]$ in a rather general framework (framework of extensions of finite\nsize called also $q$-finite extensions).First, by means of invariants, we\ncharacterize the $lq$-modularity of a $q$-finite extension. Next, we show that\nany intersection of a $q$-finite extensions covering $k$ or $K$ preserves the\n$lq$-modularity. We also prove that any $q$-finite extension $ K/k $ contains a\ngreater $lq$-modular and relatively perfect sub-extension. In particular, this\nresult is very useful for defining the modularity of order $i$ linked to a\n$q$-finite extension $ K/k $.Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for $K/k$ to be $i$-modular. Certainly, the modularity level of $ K /\nk $ never exceeds the sizeof $K/k$. Notably, we explicitly describe the\nextension $K/k $ whose degree of modularity is the size of $ K / k $. In the\nend, we examine a particular decomposition of $ K/k $ defined by inverse\nchaining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 11:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

Aiming to\nuncover the explosion mechanism and origin of the asymmetric, centrally filled\nX-ray morphology of W49B, we have performed spatially resolved X-ray\nspectroscopy and a search for potential point sources. We report new candidate\npoint sources inside W49B. The Chandra X-ray spectra from W49B are\nwell-characterized by two-temperature gas components ($\\sim 0.27$ keV +\n0.6--2.2 keV). The hot component gas shows a large temperature gradient from\nthe northeast to the southwest and is over-ionized in most regions with\nrecombination timescales of 1--$10\\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The Fe element\nshows strong lateral distribution in the SNR east, while the distribution of\nSi, S, Ar, Ca is relatively smooth and nearly axially symmetric. Asymmetric\nType-Ia explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf well-explains the\nabundance ratios and metal distribution of W49B, whereas a jet-driven explosion\nand normal core-collapse models fail to describe the abundance ratios and large\nmasses of iron-group elements. A model based on a multi-spot ignition of the\nwhite dwarf can explain the observed high $M_{\\rm Mn}/M_{\\rm Cr}$ value\n(0.8--2.2). The bar-like morphology is mainly due to a density enhancement in\nthe center, given the good spatial correlation between gas density and X-ray\nbrightness. The recombination ages and the Sedov age consistently suggest a\nrevised SNR age of 5--6 kyr. This study suggests that despite the presence of\ncandidate point sources projected within the boundary of this SNR, W49B is\nlikely a Type-Ia SNR, which suggests that Type-Ia supernovae can also result in\nmixed-morphology SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 11:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

However, rigorously defined or not, the notion of coherence or\ndecoherence has already been used by the community for decades since the advent\nof quantum theory. Intuitively, the definitions of coherence and decoherence\nshould be the two sides of the same coin. Therefore, a natural question is\nraised: how can the conventional decoherence processes, such as the von\nNeumann-L\\\"{u}ders (projective) measurement postulation or partially dephasing\nchannels, fit into the bigger picture of the recently established theoretic\nframework?

New hierarchical measures of coherence are proposed for the\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurement and their relationship with measurement-dependent\ndiscord is addressed.

We\nare given a set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $\\mathcal{B}$ of balls from some\nmetric space, and a positive integer $U$ that represents the capacity of each\nof the balls in $\\mathcal{B}$.

Search-based APR is one of the most\nimportant categories among these techniques. Existing researches focus on the\ndesign of effective mutation operators and searching algorithms to better find\nthe correct patch. Despite various efforts, the effectiveness of these\ntechniques are still limited by the search space explosion problem. One of the\nkey factors attribute to this problem is the quality of fault spaces as\nreported by existing studies. This motivates us to study the importance of the\nfault space to the success of finding a correct patch. Our empirical study aims\nto answer three questions. Does the fault space significantly correlate with\nthe performance of search-based APR? If so, are there any indicative\nmeasurements to approximate the accuracy of the fault space before applying\nexpensive APR techniques? Are there any automatic methods that can improve the\naccuracy of the fault space? We observe that the accuracy of the fault space\naffects the effectiveness and efficiency of search-based APR techniques, e.g.,\nthe failure rate of GenProg could be as high as $60\\%$ when the real fix\nlocation is ranked lower than 10 even though the correct patch is in the search\nspace. Besides, GenProg is able to find more correct patches and with fewer\ntrials when given a fault space with a higher accuracy. We also find that the\nnegative mutation coverage, which is designed in this study to measure the\ncapability of a test suite to kill the mutants created on the statements\nexecuted by failing tests, is the most indicative measurement to estimate the\nefficiency of search-based APR. Finally, we confirm that automated generated\ntest cases can help improve the accuracy of fault spaces, and further improve\nthe performance of search-based APR techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

How can an\nAI system explore and learn without making a single mistake that harms humans\nor otherwise causes serious damage? For model-free reinforcement learning,\nhaving a human \"in the loop\" and ready to intervene is currently the only way\nto prevent all catastrophes. We formalize human intervention for RL and show\nhow to reduce the human labor required by training a supervised learner to\nimitate the human's intervention decisions. We evaluate this scheme on Atari\ngames, with a Deep RL agent being overseen by a human for four hours. When the\nclass of catastrophes is simple, we are able to prevent all catastrophes\nwithout affecting the agent's learning (whereas an RL baseline fails due to\ncatastrophic forgetting). However, this scheme is less successful when\ncatastrophes are more complex: it reduces but does not eliminate catastrophes\nand the supervised learner fails on adversarial examples found by the agent.\nExtrapolating to more challenging environments, we show that our implementation\nwould not scale (due to the infeasible amount of human labor required).

Our model, LRML (\\textit{Latent Relational Metric Learning})\nis a novel metric learning approach for recommendation.

This helps\nto alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learing\napproaches. This enables not only better performance but also a greater extent\nof modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of\ninteractions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn\nto attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The\nmemory-based attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction,\nmaking the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this\ncan be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation\nfor each user-item interaction. The proposed architecture demonstrates the\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML\noutperforms other metric learning models by $6\\%-7.5\\%$ in terms of Hits@10 and\nnDCG@10 on large datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens20M.

Nevertheless, it is now\nunderstood that the use of non-reversible Markov chains can be beneficial in\nmany contexts. In particular, the recently-proposed Bouncy Particle Sampler\nleverages a continuous-time and non-reversible Markov process and empirically\nshows state-of-the-art performances when used to explore certain probability\ndensities; however, its implementation typically requires the computation of\nlocal upper bounds on the gradient of the log target density.\n  We present the Discrete Bouncy Particle Sampler, a general algorithm based\nupon a guided random walk, a partial refreshment of direction, and a\ndelayed-rejection step. We show that the Bouncy Particle Sampler can be\nunderstood as a scaling limit of a special case of our algorithm. In contrast\nto the Bouncy Particle Sampler, implementing the Discrete Bouncy Particle\nSampler only requires point-wise evaluation of the target density and its\ngradient. We propose extensions of the basic algorithm for situations when the\nexact gradient of the target density is not available. In a Gaussian setting,\nwe establish a scaling limit for the radial process as dimension increases to\ninfinity. We leverage this result to obtain the theoretical efficiency of the\nDiscrete Bouncy Particle Sampler as a function of the partial-refreshment\nparameter, which leads to a simple and robust tuning criterion. A further\nanalysis in a more general setting suggests that this tuning criterion applies\nmore generally.

We thoroughly analyzed a dedicated\nXMM-Newton observation of shrapnel G by producing background-subtracted and\nexposure-corrected maps in different energy ranges, which we complemented with\na spatially resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray emission. The fragment\npresents a bowshock-like shape with its anti-apex pointing to the center of the\nremnant. Its X-ray spectrum is best fit by a thermal plasma out of equilibrium\nof ionization with low O and Fe, roughly solar Ne and Mg, and a significantly\nhigh Si abundance, which is required to fit a very clear Si line at ~1.85 keV.\nIts chemical composition and spectral properties are compatible with those of\nshrapnel A, which is located on the opposite side of the remnant. As a\nconsequence of the nucleosynthesis, pieces of Si-rich shrapnel are expected to\noriginate in deeper layers of the progenitor star compared to ejecta with\nlower-Z elements. A high velocity and density contrast with respect to the\nsurrounding ejecta are necessary to make shrapnel A and G overtake the forward\nshock. The line connecting shrapnel A and G crosses almost exactly the\nexpansion center of the remnant, strongly suggesting a Si-rich jet-counterjet\nstructure, reminiscent of that observed in the young remnant Cas A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 15:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

However, large variations in\nvalues are often seen when comparing A-b sets from various researchers. Values\nof b typically range from 1.25 to 1.55 for both stratiform and convective\nevents. The values of A approximately fall into three groups: 150 to 200 for\nconvective, 200 to 400 for stratiform, and 400 to 500 for convective. Computing\nthe A-b parameters using the gamma DSD, coupled with a modified drop terminal\nvelocity model, vD(D) = vT(D) - w, where D is drop diameter, vT(D) is still air\ndrop terminal velocity, and w is an estimate of vertical velocity of the air\nwell above the disdrometer, shows an interesting result.

A-b\nsets derived from a Joss Waldvogel (JW) disdrometer and DSD data acquired near\nAthalassa, Cyprus, using selected 24 hour data sets from 2011 to 2014, are\ncompared to the above models.

The convective rainfall is further separated into\ntwo groups: A-b pairs that fall to the left of the stratiform pairs and pairs\nthat fall to the right. This procedure is repeated with data from other\nresearchers that corresponds to seasonal averages. In all cases, the three\nvertical groupings of the A-b parameter plot seem to correlate to DSD\nsimulations where various values of positive and negative vertical velocities\nare used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 15:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a\nmodel-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the\nselected support. In this work we formalize the notion of refitting and provide\noracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of\nthe most widely used refitting techniques which is based on Least-Squares may\nbring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator\nmight be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises\nfrom the fact that the Least-Squares refitting considers only the support of\nthe Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this\nend we define a sign consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure,\npreserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle\ninequalities for such estimators.

Bregman Lasso has a fruitful\nproperty to converge to the Sign-Least-Squares refitting (Least-Squares with\nsign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We\nadditionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal\ndesign, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method.

First we show that in weighted TAP, we\ncan restrict our attention to trees which are binary and where all the non-tree\nedges go between two leaves of the tree. We then give two different top-down\ncoloring algorithms. Both algorithms differ from known techniques for a\n3/2-approximation in unweighted TAP and current attempts to reach a\n3/2-approximation for weighted TAP.\n  The first algorithm we describe always gives a 2-approximation for any\nfeasible fractional solution to the natural edge cover LP. When the fractional\nsolution is such that all the edges with non-zero weight are at least $\\alpha$,\nthen this algorithm achieves a $2/(1+\\alpha)$-approximation. We propose a new\nconjecture on extreme points of LP relaxations for the problem, which if true,\nwill lead to a constructive proof of an integrality gap of at most 3/2 for\nweighted TAP. In the second algorithm, we introduce simple valid constraints to\nthe edge cover LP. In this algorithm, we focus on deficient edges, edges\ncovered to an extent less than 4/3 in the fractional solution. We show that for\nfractional feasible solutions, deficient edges occur in node-disjoint paths in\nthe tree. When the number of such paths is at most two, we give a top-down\ncoloring algorithm which decomposes 3/2 times the fractional solution into a\nconvex combination of integer solutions. We believe our algorithms will be\nuseful in eventually resolving the integrality gap of linear programming\nformulations for TAP.\n  We also investigate a variant of TAP where each edge in the solution must be\ncovered by a cycle of length three.

We then modify\nthe hybrid model so that when a parton in a jet shower splits, its two\noffspring are initially treated as unresolved, and are only treated as two\nseparate partons losing energy independently after they are separated by a\ndistance $L_{\\rm res}$. This modification delays the quenching of partons with\nintermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final\nstate with $p_T$ in the several GeV range.

Following the plastic deformation, in a perfectly\nisotropic system, the shell is theoretically neutrally stable, owning a\ncontinuous manifold of stable cylindrical shapes corresponding to the rotation\nof the axis of maximal curvature. Small imperfections render the actual\nstructure bistable, giving preferred orientations. A three-parameter\npiezoelectric actuation, exerted through micro-fiber-composite actuators,\nallows us to add a small perturbation to the plastic inelastic curvature and to\ncontrol the direction of maximal curvature. This actuation law is designed\nthrough a geometrical analogy based on a fully non-linear inextensible\nuniform-curvature shell model. We report on the fabrication, identification,\nand experimental testing of a prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe piezoelectric actuators in controlling its shape. The resulting motion is\nan apparent rotation of the shell, controlled by the voltages as in a\n\"gear-less motor\", which is, in reality, a precession of the axis of principal\ncurvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 21:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

We show that the evolution of the variance may be used as a direct\nmeasure of the quantum stochasticity of the radiation reaction and determine\nthe parameter regime where this is observable. For example, stochastic emission\nresults in a 25% increase in the standard deviation of the energy spectrum of a\nGeV electron beam, 1 fs after it collides with a laser pulse of intensity 10^21\nW/cm^2.

Their\ncrucial feature is irregular driven scattering between asymptotic regions\nsupporting periodic (as opposed to free) motion. With all binary\nspatio-temporal symmetries broken, scattering in punchets typically generates\ndirected currents. We here study the underlying nonlinear transport mechanisms,\nfrom chaotic scattering to the parameter dependence of the currents, in three\ntypes of Hamiltonian models, (i) with spatially periodic potentials where only\nin the driven scattering region, spatial and temporal symmetries are broken,\nand (ii), spatially asymmetric (ratchet) potentials with a driving that only\nbreaks time-reversal invariance. As more realistic models of laser-irradiated\nsurfaces, we consider (iii), a driving in the form of a running wave confined\nto a compact region by a static envelope. In this case, the induced current can\neven run against the direction of wave propagation, drastically evidencing of\nits nonlinear nature.

As a result,\nnetworks that are similar in terms of global topological properties may differ\nnoticeably at a local level. In the context of power grids, this phenomenon of\nthe impact of local structure has been recently documented in fragility\nanalysis and power system classification. At the same time, most studies of\npower system networks still tend to focus on global topological measures of\npower grids, often failing to unveil hidden mechanisms behind vulnerability of\nreal power systems and their dynamic response to malfunctions. In this paper a\npilot study on motif-based analysis of power grid robustness under various\ntypes of intentional attacks is presented, with the goal of shedding light on\nlocal dynamics and vulnerability of power systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 17:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Traditional axisymmetric\nshape equation is with the turning radius as the variable. Here we study the\nshape equation with the tangential angle as the variable.
