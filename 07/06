Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically\nstruggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming\nexpertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data\ncompletion tasks using programming-by-example (PBE) and a very lightweight\nsketching approach. Given a formula sketch (e.g., AVG($?_1$, $?_2$)) and a few\ninput-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to\nautomate the desired data completion task.

The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads\nto a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that\nare consistent with the examples.

Previous work on link prediction has focused on\nshallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs.

In this work, we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer\nconvolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art\nresults for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly\nparameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with\n8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is\nparticularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree -- which are\ncommon in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and\nYAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer\nfrom test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being\npresent in the test set -- however, the extent of this issue has so far not\nbeen quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model\ncan achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k.

We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties.

A gradient in the\nelastic properties can be built from a single material, varying gradually the\nbulk porosity of the material or its geometrical structure. However, if such a\ngradient is built into the material at production, damage or wearing over time\nmight expose unwanted elastic properties. Here, we implement a design principle\nfor a spatially inhomogeneous material based on topological band-theory for\nmechanical systems. The resulting inhomogeneity is stable against wearing and\neven cutting the material in half. We show how, by creating a periodic elastic\nmaterial with topological properties, one can create an intrinsically polar\nbehavior, where a face with a given surface normal is stiff while its opposing\nface is soft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

In particular, fluctuations are determined by the average number of\nparticles within a distance $h$ from the boundary of the window. We first\ncompute special expectations and bounds in $d$ dimensions, and then illustrate\nthe range of behavior of $h$ versus window size $L$ by analyzing three\ndifferent types of simulated two-dimensional pixel pattern - where particle\npositions are stored as a binary digital image in which pixels have value\nzero/one if empty/contain a particle. The first are random binomial patterns,\nwhere pixels are randomly flipped from zero to one with probability equal to\narea fraction. These have long-ranged density fluctuations, and simulations\nconfirm the exact result $h=L/2$. Next we consider vacancy patterns, where a\nfraction $f$ of particles on a lattice are randomly removed. These also display\nlong-range density fluctuations, but with $h=(L/2)(f/d)$ for small $f$. For a\nhyperuniform system with no long-range density fluctuations, we consider\nEinstein patterns where each particle is independently displaced from a lattice\nsite by a Gaussian-distributed amount. For these, at large $L$, $h$ approaches\na constant equal to about half the root-mean-square displacement in each\ndimension. Then we turn to grayscale pixel patterns that represent simulated\narrangements of polydisperse particles, where the volume of a particle is\nencoded in the value of its central pixel. And we discuss the continuum limit\nof point patterns, where pixel size vanishes. In general, we thus propose to\nquantify particle configurations not just by the scaling of the density\nfluctuation spectrum but rather by the real-space spectrum of $h(L)$ versus\n$L$.

This\nlength permits a direct connection to the nature of disorder in the spatial\nconfiguration of the particles, and provides a way to diagnose the degree of\nhyperuniformity in terms of the scaling of $h$ and its value in comparison with\nestablished bounds. Here, this approach is generalized for extended particles,\nwhich are larger than the image resolution and can lie partially inside and\npartially outside the measuring windows. The starting point is an expression\nfor the volume fraction variance in terms of four distinct volumes: that of the\nparticle, the measuring window, the mean-squared overlap between particle and\nregion, and the region over which particles have non-zero overlap with the\nmeasuring window. After establishing limiting behaviors, computational methods\nare developed for both continuum and pixelated particles. Exact results are\npresented for particles of special shape, and for measuring windows of special\nshape. Comparison is made for other particle shapes, using simulated Poisson\npatterns. And the effects of polydisersity and image errors are discussed. For\nsmall measuring windows, both particle shape and spatial arrangement affect the\nform of the variance. For large regions, the variance scaling depends only on\narrangement but particle shape sets the numerical proportionality. The combined\nunderstanding permit the measured variance to be translated to the spectrum of\nhyperuniformity lengths versus region size, as the quantifier of spatial\narrangement.

The proposed Coherent vorticity\npreserving (CvP) LES methodology is based on the evaluation of the ratio of the\ntest-filtered to resolved (or grid-filtered) enstrophy $\\sigma$. Values of\n$\\sigma$ close to 1 indicate low sub-test-filter turbulent activity, justifying\nlocal deactivation of the SGS dissipation. The intensity of the SGS dissipation\nis progressively increased for $\\sigma < 1$ which corresponds to a small-scale\nspectral broadening.

The pursued goal was to\nimprove the short-term and long-term stability of the systems, and enable a\nuser-friendly and more versatile operation of the instrument. The first upgrade\ninvolved the modernization of the frequency comb. The Fabry-Perot cavities were\nadjusted to filter to a repetition frequency of 8GHz. A technologically matured\nphotonic crystal fiber was implemented for spectral broadening. The second,\nquite recent upgrade was performed on the optics feeding the sunlight into a\nsingle-mode fiber connected to the spectrograph. A motorized translation stage\nwas deployed to allow the automated selection of three different fields-of-view\nwith diameters of 1\", 3\", and 10\" for the analysis of the solar spectrum. The\nsuccessful upgrades allow for long-term observations of up to several hours per\nday with a stable spectral accuracy of 1 m/s limited by the spectrograph.\nStable, user-friendly operation of the instrument is supported. The selection\nof the pre-aligned fiber to change the field of view can now be done within\nseconds.

However, no observational evidence of\nthe presence of particles of PeV energies in SNRs has yet been found. The young\nhistorical SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) appears as one of the best candidates to\nstudy acceleration processes. Between December 2014 and October 2016 we\nobserved Cas A with the MAGIC telescopes, accumulating 158 hours of\ngood-quality data. We derived the spectrum of the source from 100 GeV to 10\nTeV. We also analysed $\\sim$8 years of $Fermi$-LAT to obtain the spectral shape\nbetween 60 MeV and 500 GeV. The spectra measured by the LAT and MAGIC\ntelescopes are compatible within the errors and show a clear turn off (4.6\n$\\sigma$) at the highest energies, which can be described with an exponential\ncut-off at $E_c = 3.5\\left(^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\\right)_{\\textit{stat}}\n\\left(^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\\right)_{\\textit{sys}}$ TeV. The gamma-ray emission from 60\nMeV to 10 TeV can be attributed to a population of high-energy protons with\nspectral index $\\sim$2.2 and energy cut-off at $\\sim$10 TeV. This result\nindicates that Cas A is not contributing to the high energy ($\\sim$PeV)\ncosmic-ray sea in a significant manner at the present moment. A one-zone\nleptonic model fails to reproduce by itself the multi-wavelength spectral\nenergy distribution. Besides, if a non-negligible fraction of the flux seen by\nMAGIC is produced by leptons, the radiation should be emitted in a region with\na low magnetic field (B$\\lessapprox$100$\\mu$G) like in the reverse shock.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 21:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

More\nrecently, the possible co-existence of a first family composed of \"normal\"\nneutron stars with a second family of strange quark stars has been proposed as\na solution of problems related to the maximum mass and to the minimal radius of\nthese compact stellar objects. In this paper we study the mass distribution of\ncompact objects formed in binary systems and the relative fractions of quark\nand neutron stars in different subpopulations. We incorporate the strange quark\nstar formation model provided by the two-families scenario and we perform a\nlarge-scale population synthesis study in order to obtain the population\ncharacteristics. In our model, below a critical gravitational mass\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M$ only normal (hadron) neutron stars exist. Then in\nthe mass range $(M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M) \\leqslant M \\leqslant\nM_\\mathrm{max}^H$ strange quark stars and neutron stars coexist. Finally, above\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ all compact objects are strange quark stars. We argue that\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is in the range $\\sim 1.5-1.6 M_\\odot$. According to our\nresults, the main channel for strange quark star formation in binary systems is\naccretion from a secondary companion on a neutron star.This opens the\npossibility of having explosive GRB-like phenomena not related to supernovae\nand not due to the merger of two neutron stars. The enhancement in the number\nof compact objects in the co-existence mass range $(M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M)\n\\leqslant M \\leqslant M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is not very pronounced. The number of\ndouble strange quark star's systems is rather small with only a tiny fraction\nwhich merge within a Hubble time. This drastically limits the flux of\nstrangelets produced by the merger, which turns out to be compatible with all\nlimits stemming from Earth and lunar experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 21:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 19:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

Rather than privilege a single\ndefinition, we seek to resolve both within the particular domain of employment\ndiscrimination. To this end, we construct a dual labor market model composed of\na Temporary Labor Market, in which firm strategies are constrained to ensure\ngroup-level fairness, and a Permanent Labor Market, in which individual worker\nfairness is guaranteed. We show that such restrictions on hiring practices\ninduces an equilibrium that Pareto-dominates those arising from strategies that\nemploy statistical discrimination or a \"group-blind\" criterion. Individual\nworker reputations produce externalities for collective reputation, generating\na feedback loop termed a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Our model produces its own\nfeedback loop, raising the collective reputation of an initially disadvantaged\ngroup via a fairness intervention that need not be permanent. Moreover, we show\nthat, contrary to popular assumption, the asymmetric equilibria resulting from\nhiring practices that disregard group-fairness may be immovable without\ntargeted intervention. The enduring nature of such equilibria that are both\ninequitable and Pareto inefficient suggest that fairness interventions are of\ncritical importance in moving the labor market to be more socially just and\nefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 22:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

We successfully detect the ring-like azimuthal polarized\nemission at 3.1 mm.

Furthermore, the morphology of\nthe polarization vectors at 3.1 mm is completely different from those at 1.3\nmm. We interpret that the polarization at 3.1 mm to be dominated by the grain\nalignment with the radiative flux producing azimuthal polarization vectors,\nwhile the self-scattering dominates at 1.3 mm and produces the polarization\nvectors parallel to the minor axis of the disk. By modeling the total\npolarization fraction with a single grain population model, the maximum grain\nsize is constrained to be $100{\\rm~\\mu m}$, which is smaller than the previous\npredictions based on the spectral index between ALMA at 3 mm and VLA at 7 mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 01:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The proposed architecture has one generative network, and two\ndiscriminative networks. The generative network mainly evaluates the visual\nquality of the generated images for steganography, and the discriminative\nnetworks are utilized to assess their suitableness for information hiding.\nDifferent from the existing work which adopts Deep Convolutional Generative\nAdversarial Networks, we utilize another form of generative adversarial\nnetworks. By using this new form of generative adversarial networks,\nsignificant improvements are made on the convergence speed, the training\nstability and the image quality. Furthermore, a sophisticated steganalysis\nnetwork is reconstructed for the discriminative network, and the network can\nbetter evaluate the performance of the generated images. Numerous experiments\nare conducted on the publicly available datasets to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 02:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 02:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 04:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 02:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

In\nthis paper, we aim to tackle this problem via an economic approach.\n  Modeled naively, the underlying optimization problem may be non-convex and\nthus hard to compute. To this end, we use a so-called \"ironing\" technique to\nconvert the problem into an equivalent convex optimization one via a clean\nMarkov decision process (MDP) formulation, where the states are the driver\ndistributions and the decision variables are the prices for each pair of\nlocations.

We characterize\nthe optimal solution of the MDP by a primal-dual analysis of a corresponding\nconvex program.

We introduce quantum tomography\nto collider physics with the illustration of the angular distribution of lepton\npairs. The tomographic method bypasses much of the field-theoretic formalism to\nconcentrate on what can be observed with experimental data, and how to\ncharacterize the data. We provide a practical, experimentally-driven guide to\nmodel-independent analysis using density matrices at every step. Comparison\nwith traditional methods of analyzing angular correlations of inclusive\nreactions finds many advantages in the tomographic method, which include\nmanifest Lorentz covariance, direct incorporation of positivity constraints,\nexhaustively complete polarization information, and new invariants free from\nframe conventions. For example, experimental data can determine the\n$entanglement$ $entropy$ of the production process, which is a\nmodel-independent invariant that measures the degree of coherence of the\nsubprocess. We give reproducible numerical examples and provide a supplemental\nstandalone computer code that implements the procedure. We also highlight a\nproperty of $complex$ $positivity$ that guarantees in a least-squares type fit\nthat a local minimum of a $\\chi^{2}$ statistic will be a global minimum: There\nare no isolated local minima. This property with an automated implementation of\npositivity promises to mitigate issues relating to multiple minima and\nconvention-dependence that have been problematic in previous work on angular\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 05:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

In order to\nobtain a more general and complete view of the orbital structure of the\ndynamical system our exploration takes place in both planar (2D) and the\nspatial (3D) version of the Hill problem. For the 2D system we numerically\nintegrate large sets of initial conditions in several types of planes, while\nfor the system with three degrees of freedom, three-dimensional distributions\nof initial conditions of orbits are examined. For distinguishing between\nordered and chaotic bounded motion the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method is\nused.

The both $L$(PAH)/$L$(IR) and\n$L$(Br$\\alpha$)/$L$(IR) ratios are not strongly dependent on galaxy type and\ndust temperature. The relative weakness of the two ratios could be attributed\nto destruction of PAH, a lack of UV photons exciting PAH molecules or ionising\nhydrogen gas, extremely high dust attenuation, or active galactic nucleus\ncontribution to the $L$(IR). Although we cannot determine the cause of the\ndecreases of the luminosity ratios, a clear correlation between them implies\nthat they are related with each other.

To tackle this issue, existing works\nhave proposed various scheduling algorithms which exploit redundancy wherein a\njob runs on multiple servers until the first completes. In this paper, we\nexplore the impact of variability in the machine service capacity and adopt a\nrigorous analytical approach to design scheduling algorithms using redundancy\nand checkpointing. We design several online scheduling algorithms which can\ndynamically vary the number of redundant copies for jobs. We also provide new\ntheoretical performance bounds for these algorithms in terms of the overall job\nflowtime by introducing the notion of a speedup function, based on which a\nnovel potential function can be defined to enable the corresponding competitive\nratio analysis. In particular, by adopting the online primal-dual fitting\napproach, we prove that our SRPT+R Algorithm in a non-multitasking cluster is\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-speed, $\\ O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$-competitive.

To\ndemonstrate the potential of improving EE by jointly optimizing resource\nallocation for both services by harnessing both future average channel gains\nand current instantaneous channel gains, we optimize a two-timescale policy\nwith perfect prediction, by taking orthogonal frequency division multiple\naccess system serving RT and video-on-demand (VoD) users as an example.\nConsidering that fine-grained prediction for every user is with high cost, we\npropose a heuristic policy that only needs to predict the median of average\nchannel gains of VoD users. Simulation results show that the optimal policy\noutperforms relevant counterparts, indicating the necessity of the joint\noptimization for both services and for two timescales. Besides, the heuristic\npolicy performs closely to the optimal policy with perfect prediction while\nbecomes superior with large prediction errors.

We have compiled the most extensive list of low-mass\nmembers of the young 25-Myr beta Pictoris association.

Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property\nthat there is no possibility of specifying separately information about\nsparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which\ncan be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic\nregression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes\nsolutions to both of these problems.

Mode-seeking clustering assigns cluster labels by\nassociating data samples with the nearest modes, and estimation of density\nridges enables us to find lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. A key\ntechnical challenge both in mode-seeking clustering and density ridge\nestimation is accurate estimation of the ratios of the first- and second-order\ndensity derivatives to the density. A naive approach takes a three-step\napproach of first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives,\nand finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be\nunreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good\ndensity derivative estimator, and division by the estimated density could\nsignificantly magnify the estimation error. To cope with these problems, we\npropose a novel estimator for the \\emph{density-derivative-ratios}. The\nproposed estimator does not involve density estimation, but rather\n\\emph{directly} approximates the ratios of density derivatives of any order.\nMoreover, we establish a convergence rate of the proposed estimator. Based on\nthe proposed estimator, novel methods both for mode-seeking clustering and\ndensity ridge estimation are developed, and the respective convergence rates to\nthe mode and ridge of the underlying density are also established.

We aim at detecting\nbinarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates.\nWe develop a method based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives\nto detect multiple peaks and determine their radial velocities, even when the\npeaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection of extrema (DOE)\ncode have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize\ndetection. This code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line\nspectroscopic binaries (SBn, n>1). We apply this method on the fourth GES\ninternal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342 SB2, 11 SB3 and even\none SB4), including only 9 SB2 known in the literature. This implies that about\n98% of these SBn candidates are new (because of their faint visual magnitude\nthat can reach V=19). Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals\nthat the most probable candidates have indeed a composite spectrum. Among SB2\ncandidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously unknown\nbinaries: 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and 19013257-0027338\nin Berkeley 81.

The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters are reviewed\nin detail to discard false detections. We warn against the use of atmospheric\nparameters for these system components rather than by SB-specific pipelines.\nOur implementation of an automatic detection of spectroscopic binaries within\nthe GES has allowed an efficient discovery of many new multiple systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 10:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

To resolve this problem, we propose a new method\nto decompose and modify the motions using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT).\nFirst, HHT decomposes a chromatic signal into \"monochromatic\" signals that are\nthe so-called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using an Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD) [6]. After applying the Hilbert Transform to each IMF, the\ninstantaneous frequencies of the \"monochromatic\" signals can be obtained. The\nHHT has the advantage to analyze non-stationary and nonlinear signals such as\nhuman-joint-motions over FFT or Wavelet transform.\n  In the present paper, we propose a new framework to analyze and extract some\nnew features from a famous Japanese threesome pop singer group called\n\"Perfume\", and compare it with Waltz and Salsa dance. Using the EMD, their\ndance motions can be decomposed into motion (choreographic) primitives or IMFs.\nTherefore we can scale, combine, subtract, exchange, and modify those IMFs, and\ncan blend them into new dance motions self-consistently. Our analysis and\nframework can lead to a motion editing and blending method to create a new\ndance motion from different dance motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 11:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The\nneural sampling hypothesis interprets stochastic neural activity as sampling\nfrom an underlying probability distribution and has been shown to be compatible\nwith biologically observed firing patterns. In many studies, uncorrelated noise\nis used as a source of stochasticity, discounting the fact that cortical\nneurons may share a significant portion of their presynaptic partners, which\nimpacts their computation. This is relevant in biology and for implementations\nof neural networks where bandwidth constraints limit the amount of independent\nnoise. When receiving correlated noise, the resulting correlations cannot be\ndirectly countered by changes in synaptic weights $W$. We show that this is\ncontingent on the chosen coding: when changing the state space from\n$z\\in\\{0,1\\}$ to $z'\\in\\{-1,1\\}$, correlated noise has the exact same effect as\nchanges in $W'$. The translation of the problem to the $\\{-1,1\\}$ space allows\nto find a weight configuration that compensates for the induced correlations.\nFor an artificial embedding of sampling networks, this allows a straightforward\ntransfer between platforms with different bandwidth constraints. The existence\nof the mapping is important for learning. Since in the $\\{-1,1\\}$-coding the\ncorrelated noise can be compensated by parameter changes and the probability\ndistribution can be kept invariant when changing the coding, the distribution\nwill be found in the $\\{0,1\\}$-coding as well during learning, as demonstrated\nin simulations. Conclusively, sampling spiking networks are impervious to noise\ncorrelations when trained. If such computation happens in cortex, network\nplasticity does not need to take account of shared noise inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 12:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

In this work, phonon transport of SbAs monolayer\nis investigated from a combination of first-principles calculations and the\nlinearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It is found that the lattice thermal\nconductivity of SbAs monolayer is lower than ones of both As and Sb monolayers,\nand the corresponding sheet thermal conductance is 28.8 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ at\nroom temperature. Calculated results show that group velocities of SbAs\nmonolayer are between ones of As and Sb onolayers, but phonon lifetimes of SbAs\nare smaller than ones of both As and Sb monolayers. Hence, low lattice thermal\nconductivity in SbAs monolayer is attributed to very small phonon lifetimes.\nUnexpectedly, the ZA branch has very little contribution to the total thermal\nconductivity, only 2.4\\%, which is obviously different from ones of As and Sb\nmonolayers with very large contribution. This can be explained by very small\nphonon lifetimes for ZA branch of SbAs monolayer. The large charge transfer\nfrom Sb to As atoms leads strongly polarized covalent bond, being different\nfrom As or Sb monolayer. The strongly polarized covalent bond of SbAs monolayer\ncan induce stronger phonon anharmonicity than As or Sb monolayer, leading to\nlower lattice thermal conductivity. It is found that isotope scattering\nproduces neglectful effect, and the lattice thermal conductivity with the\ncharacteristic length smaller than 30 nm can reach a decrease of about 47\\%.\nThese results may offer perspectives on tuning lattice thermal conductivity by\nmixture of multi-elements for applications of thermal management and\nthermoelectricity, and motivate further experimental efforts to synthesize\nmonolayer SbAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 12:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

There is a trace map from algebraic\n$K$-theory to topological cyclic homology, and a theorem of\nDundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy asserts that this induces an equivalence of\nrelative theories for nilpotent immersions, which gives a way for computing\n$K$-theory in various situations. The construction of topological cyclic\nhomology is based on genuine equivariant homotopy theory, the use of explicit\npoint-set models, and the elaborate notion of a cyclotomic spectrum.\n  The goal of this paper is to revisit this theory using only\nhomotopy-invariant notions. In particular, we give a new construction of\ntopological cyclic homology. This is based on a new definition of the\n$\\infty$-category of cyclotomic spectra: We define a cyclotomic spectrum to be\na spectrum $X$ with $S^1$-action (in the most naive sense) together with\n$S^1$-equivariant maps $\\varphi_p: X\\to X^{tC_p}$ for all primes $p$.

Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that\nmodifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations\nencoded in the same internal model.

To consider those\nnon-positive definite kernels, in this paper, we aim to build an indefinite\nkernel learning framework for kernel logistic regression. The proposed\nindefinite kernel logistic regression (IKLR) model is analysed in the\nReproducing Kernel Kre\\u{\\i}n Spaces (RKKS) and then becomes non-convex. Using\nthe positive decomposition of a non-positive definite kernel, the derived IKLR\nmodel can be decomposed into the difference of two convex functions.\nAccordingly, a concave-convex procedure is introduced to solve the non-convex\noptimization problem. Since the concave-convex procedure has to solve a\nsub-problem in each iteration, we propose a concave-inexact-convex procedure\n(CCICP) algorithm with an inexact solving scheme to accelerate the solving\nprocess. Besides, we propose a stochastic variant of CCICP to efficiently\nobtain a proximal solution, which achieves the similar purpose with the inexact\nsolving scheme in CCICP. The convergence analyses of the above two variants of\nconcave-convex procedure are conducted. By doing so, our method works\neffectively not only under a deterministic setting but also under a stochastic\nsetting.

This is of prime\nimportance to mitigate the RV signal induced by stellar activity and therefore\nunveil the presence of low-mass exoplanets. The K2 Campaign 7 and 8\nfield-of-views were located in the southern hemisphere, and provided a unique\nopportunity to gather unprecedented simultaneous high precision photometric\nobservation with K2 and high-precision RV measurements with the HARPS\nspectrograph to study the relationship between photometric variability and RV\njitter.

We probe the presence of any meaningful relation between measured\nRV jitter and the simultaneous photometric variation, and also other activity\nindicators (e.g. BIS, FWHM, $logR'_{HK}$, and F8), by evaluating the strength\nand significance of the correlation between RVs and each indicator. We found\nthat for the case of very active stars, strong and significant correlations\nexist between almost all the observables and measured RVs; however, for lower\nactivity levels the correlations become random. Except for the F8 which its\nstrong correlation with RV jitter persists over a wide range of stellar\nactivity level, and thus our result suggests that F8 might be a powerful proxy\nfor activity induced RV jitter. Moreover, we examine the capability of two\nstate-of-the-art modeling techniques, namely the FF' method and SOAP2.0, in\naccurately predicting the RV jitter amplitude using the simultaneous\nphotometric observation.

Most of these are\neffectively \"fabric evolution models\" (FEMs) based on a stress rule connecting\nthe bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and a closed\ntime-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane. This structure\nlikely precludes any adequate closure at second-rank level. Instead, our\nnumerical data suggest that closures involving the coupled evolution of both a\nfabric tensor and a fourth-rank tensor might be reasonably accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 15:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

However,\nsince each clique is localized in some local coordinate system, we are required\nto register them in a global coordinate system. In other words, our approach is\nbased on transforming the localization problem into a problem of registration.\nIn this context, the main contributions are as follows. First, we describe an\nefficient method for partitioning the network into overlapping cliques. Second,\nwe study the problem of registering the localized cliques, and formulate a\nnecessary rigidity condition for uniquely recovering the global sensor\ncoordinates. In particular, we present a method for efficiently testing\nrigidity, and a proposal for augmenting the partitioned network to enforce\nrigidity.
