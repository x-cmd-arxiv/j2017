This article revisits the Kalman filtering and Linear\nQuadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problems, subject to privacy constraints. We\naim to enforce differential privacy, a formal, state-of-the-art definition of\nprivacy ensuring that the output of an algorithm is not too sensitive to the\ndata collected from any single participating agent. A two-stage architecture is\nproposed that first aggregates and combines the individual agent signals before\nadding privacy-preserving noise and post-filtering the result to be published.\nWe show a significant performance improvement offered by this architecture over\ninput perturbation schemes as the number of input signals increases and that an\noptimal static aggregation stage can be computed by solving a semidefinite\nprogram. The two-stage architecture, which we develop first for Kalman\nfiltering, is then adapted to the LQG control problem by leveraging the\nseparation principle.

Reconnection is driven by\nlarge-scale magnetic stresses in interacting current-carrying flux tubes. Our\nmodel relies on development of current-driven instabilities on macroscopic\nscales. These tilt-kink instabilities develop in an initially force-free\nequilibrium of repelling current channels. Using MHD methods we study a 3D\nmodel of repelling and interacting flux tubes in which we simultaneously evolve\ntest particles, guided by electromagnetic fields obtained from MHD. We identify\ntwo stages of particle acceleration; Initially particles accelerate in the\ncurrent channels, after which the flux ropes start tilting and kinking and\nparticles accelerate due to reconnection processes in the plasma. The explosive\nstage of reconnection produces non-thermal energy distributions with slopes\nthat depend on plasma resistivity and the initial particle velocity. We also\ndiscuss the influence of the length of the flux ropes on particle acceleration\nand energy distributions. This study extends previous 2.5D results to 3D\nsetups, providing all ingredients needed to model realistic scenarios like\nsolar flares, black hole flares and particle acceleration in pulsar wind\nnebulae: formation of strong resistive electric fields, explosive reconnection\nand non-thermal particle distributions. By assuming initial energy\nequipartition between electrons and protons, applying low resistivity in\naccordance with solar corona conditions and limiting the flux rope length to a\nfraction of a solar radius we obtain realistic energy distributions for solar\nflares with non-thermal power law tails and maximum electron energies up to 11\nMeV and maximum proton energies up to 1 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 13:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Here we show that the\nradiation of fast radio bursts can be explained as an undulator radiation and\nthe large dispersion measure can be due to a motion effect mainly from the\nrotation of the source which is probably variable stars. In our scenario, the\npulse broadening is near-field effects and the pulse itself represents a\nFresnel diffraction pattern sweeping the observer. Our work is the first\nanalysis of properties of fast radio bursts in the context of a special\nmechanism of the radiation instead of a special propagation environment of the\nradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 18:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

These diverse categories are related by a web of exact functors\nexpressing physical relations between the various objects/pictures. A basic\ntheme of this review is the emphasis on the full web of categories, rather than\non what we can learn from a single description. A second general theme is\nviewing the cluster category as a sort of `categorification' of 't Hooft's\ntheory of quantum phases for a 4d non-Abelian gauge theory. The $S$-duality\ngroup is best described as the auto-equivalences of the full web of categories.\nThis viewpoint leads to a combinatorial algorithm to search for $S$-dualities\nof the given $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.

Known torque\nformulae do not reproduce accurately the torque actually experienced in\nnumerical simulations by low- and intermediate- mass planets in radiative\ndiscs. One of the main reasons for this inaccuracy is that these formulae have\nbeen worked out in two-dimensional analyses.

In particular, we derive the dependence of\nthe Lindblad torque on the temperature gradient, the dependence of the\ncorotation torque on the radial entropy gradient (and work out a suitable\nexpression of this gradient in a three-dimensional disc).

Pertinent physics was addressed recently by applying\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer theory to electrostatics, which is a\nmajor energetic component governing IDP phase properties. RPA accounts for\ncharge patterns and thus has advantages over Flory-Huggins and Overbeek-Voorn\nmean-field theories.

The asymmetry between the two predicted coexisting\nphases with regard to their $\\phi_1/\\phi_2$ ratios for the two sequences\nincreases with increasing mismatch between their charge patterns.

We find that the\n`environmental quenching efficiency', which quantifies the quenched fraction as\nfunction of halo mass, is independent of stellar mass. And this independence is\nthe origin of the stellar mass-independence of density-based quenching\nefficiency, found in previous studies. Considering centrals and satellites\nseparately, we find that the two populations follow similar correlations of\nquenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have\nexperienced similar quenching processes in their host halo. We demonstrate that\nsatellite quenching alone cannot account for the environmental quenching\nefficiency of the total galaxy population and the difference between the two\npopulations found previously mainly arises from the fact that centrals and\nsatellites of the same stellar mass reside, on average, in halos of different\nmass. After removing these halo-mass and stellar-mass effects, there remains a\nweak, but significant, residual dependence on environmental density, which is\neliminated when halo assembly bias is taken into account. Our results therefore\nindicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter that regulates the\nquenching of both centrals and satellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 19:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 08:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

RA is usually realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a\ntrusted party -- verifier -- measures integrity of a potentially compromised\nremote device -- prover. Early work focused on purely software-based and fully\nhardware-based techniques, neither of which is ideal for low-end devices. More\nrecent results have yielded hybrid (SW/HW) security architectures comprised of\na minimal set of features to support efficient and secure RA on low-end\ndevices.\n  All prior RA techniques require on-demand operation, i.e, RA is performed in\nreal time. We identify some drawbacks of this general approach in the context\nof unattended devices: First, it fails to detect mobile malware that enters and\nleaves the prover between successive RA instances. Second, it requires the\nprover to engage in a potentially expensive (in terms of time and energy)\ncomputation, which can be harmful for critical or real-time devices.\n  To address these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of self-measurement\nwhere a prover device periodically (and securely) measures and records its own\nsoftware state, based on a pre-established schedule. A possibly untrusted\nverifier occasionally collects and verifies these measurements. We present the\ndesign of a concrete technique called ERASMUS : Efficient Remote Attestation\nvia Self-Measurement for Unattended Settings, justify its features and evaluate\nits performance. In the process, we also define a new metric -- Quality of\nAttestation (QoA). We argue that ERASMUS is well-suited for time-sensitive\nand/or safety-critical applications that are not served well by on-demand RA.\nFinally, we show that ERASMUS is a promising stepping stone towards handling\nattestation of multiple devices (i.e., a group or swarm) with high mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 20:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

After rejecting sources likely due to active galactic nuclei\nactivity or background sources, I remain with 11 candidates that are presumably\nassociated with galactic disks or star formation regions. At least some of\nthese candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find\n85 sources within 1\" of galactic nuclei. Assuming the radio persistent sources\nare not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band\nlight, the 11 sources imply a 95% confidence upper limit on the space density\nof luminous persistent sources of <5x10^-5 Mpc^-3, and that at any given time\nonly a small fraction of galaxies host a radio luminous persistent source\n(<10^-3 L_*^-1). Assuming persistent sources life time of 100 yr, this implies\na birth rate of <5x10^-7 yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and\nassuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources,\nthis sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of >0.8\nyr^-1. I argue that these 11 candidates are good targets for FRB searches and I\nestimate the FRB event rate from these candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 20:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The\nconfinement in the radial direction results in the quantization of the electron\nmotion with energies determined by the radial $j$ and orbital $m$ quantum\nnumbers. In the external magnetic field the twofold degeneracy with respect to\nthe orbital magnetic quantum number $m$ is lifted which leads to the Fermi wave\nvector mismatch between the paired electrons $(k, j,m,\\uparrow) \\leftrightarrow\n(-k, j,-m,\\downarrow)$. This mismatch is transfered to the nonzero total\nmomentum of the Cooper pairs which results in the formation of FF phase\noccurring sequentially with increasing magnetic field.

A more detailed examination reveals that while\nthe red Trojans and Hildas have nearly identical spectra, less-red Hildas are\nsystematically bluer in the visible and redder in the near-infrared than\nless-red Trojans, indicating a putative broad, shallow absorption feature\nbetween 0.5 and 1.0 $\\mu$m. We argue that the less-red and red objects found in\nboth Hildas and Trojans represent two distinct surface chemistries and\nattribute the small discrepancy between less-red Hildas and Trojans to the\ndifference in surface temperatures between the two regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Such characteristics are\nunprecedented for galaxy catalogues and they enable us to study the evolution\nof GLF and GSMF at $0<z<1$ homogeneously with the same statistically-rich\ndata-set and free of cosmic variance effects. The aim of this study is twofold:\ni) we want to test our method based on the use of photometric-redshift\nprobability density functions against literature results obtained with\nspectroscopic redshifts; ii) we want to shed light on the way galaxies build up\ntheir masses over cosmic time. We find that both the ${\\it i}$-band galaxy\nluminosity and stellar mass functions are characterised by a double-Schechter\nshape at $z<0.2$. Both functions agree well with those based on spectroscopic\nredshifts. The DES GSMF agrees especially with those measured for the GAlaxy\nMass Assembly and the PRism MUlti-object Survey out to $z\\sim1$. At $0.2<z<1$,\nwe find the ${\\it i}$-band luminosity and stellar-mass densities respectively\nto be constant ($\\rho_{\\rm L}\\propto (1+z)^{-0.12\\pm0.11}$) and decreasing\n($\\rho_{\\rm Mstar}\\propto (1+z)^{-0.5\\pm0.1}$) with $z$. This indicates that,\nwhile at higher redshift galaxies have less stellar mass, their luminosities do\nnot change substantially because of their younger and brighter stellar\npopulations. Finally, we also find evidence for a top-down mass-dependent\nevolution of the GSMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

We regard deep feature learning as a series of steps pursuing\nfeature transformation, i.e., projecting the samples from a previous space into\na new one, which tends to select the reliable unlabeled samples with respect to\nthis setting. Specifically, for each unlabeled image instance, we measure its\nreliability by calculating the category variations of feature transformation\nfrom two different neighborhood variation perspectives, and merged them into an\nunified sample mining criterion deriving from Hellinger distance. Then, those\nsamples keeping stable correlation to their neighboring samples (i.e., having\nsmall category variation in distribution) across the successive feature space\ntransformation, are automatically received labels and incorporated into the\nmodel for incrementally training in terms of classification. Our extensive\nexperiments on standard image classification benchmarks (e.g., Caltech-256 and\nSUN-397) demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of effectively\nmining from large-scale unlabeled images, which boosts image classification\nperformance and achieves promising results compared to other semi-supervised\nlearning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 06:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

The new LISA GW mission proposes to use arm length of\n2.5 Gm (1 Gm = 106 km). The TAIJI GW mission proposes to use arm length of 3\nGm. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity, laser frequency noise must be\nsuppressed to below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise,\nacceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have performed the numerical\nsimulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for original LISA, ASTROD-GW\nand eLISA together with a LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 Gm\nusing the CGC 2.7/CGC2.7.1 ephemeris framework. In this paper, we follow the\nsame procedure to simulate the time delay interferometry numerically for the\nnew LISA mission and the TAIJI mission together with LISA-like missions of arm\nlength 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 Gm. The resulting optical path differences of the\nsecond-generation TDI calculated for new LISA, TAIJI, and LISA-like missions or\narm length 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 Gm are well below their respective limits which the\nlaser frequency noise is required to be suppressed. However, for of the first\ngeneration X, Y, and Z TDI configurations, the original requirements need to be\nrelaxed by 3 to 30 fold to be satisfied. For the new LISA and TAIJI, about one\norder of magnitude relaxation would be good and recommended; this could be\nborne on the laser stability requirement in view of recent progress in laser\nstability. Compared with X, Y and Z, the X+Y+Z configuration does have a good\ncancellation of path length differences and could serve as a null string\ndetection check. We compile and compare the resulting differences of various\nTDI configurations due to the different arm lengths for various LISA-like\nmission proposals and for the ASTROD-GW mission proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2017 02:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

However, existing\nrepresentations typically overlook the influence of past experiences on present\npreferences. This study develops, applies and tests a hidden Markov model with\na discrete choice kernel to model and forecast the evolution of individual\npreferences and behaviors over long-range forecasting horizons. The hidden\nstates denote different preferences i.e. modes considered in the choice set,\nand sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The evolutionary path of those\nhidden states is hypothesized to be a first-order Markov process. The framework\nis applied to study the evolution of travel mode preferences, or modality\nstyles, over time, in response to a major change in the public transportation\nsystem. We use longitudinal travel diary from Santiago, Chile. The dataset\nconsists of four one-week pseudo travel diaries collected before and after the\nintroduction of Transantiago, a complete redesign of the public transportation\nsystem in the city.

At the population level,\nthere are significant shifts in the distribution of individuals across modality\nstyles before and after the change in the system, but the distribution is\nrelatively stable in the periods after the change.

The new method uses an\ninterpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) procedure to construct a set of\nnumerical auxiliary basis vectors and a compact approximation of the matrix\nconsisting of products of occupied orbitals represented in a large basis set\nsuch as the planewave basis. Such an approximation allows us to reduce the\nnumber of Poisson solves from $\\Or(N_{e}^2)$ to $\\Or(N_{e})$ when we apply the\nexchange operator to occupied orbitals in an iterative method for solving the\nKohn-Sham equations, where $N_{e}$ is the number of electrons in the system to\nbe studied. We show that the ISDF procedure can be carried out in\n$\\Or(N_{e}^3)$ operations, with a much smaller pre-constant compared to methods\nused in existing approaches. When combined with the recently developed\nadaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator formalism, which reduces the\nnumber of times the exchange operator needs to be updated, the resulting\nACE-ISDF method significantly reduces the computational cost \\REV{associated\nwith the exchange operator} by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to\nexisting approaches for a large silicon system with $1000$ atoms.

We investigate the effect of\ngravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission line profiles and their\nunderlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR\nmodels with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we\nconsidered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various\nsizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables:\n$\\mu^{BLR}$, the total magnification of the broad emission line; $\\mu^{cont}$,\nthe magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and\nwings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the line profile distortions. The\nsimulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently\nobserved in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the\ndifferential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.\nWhile the magnification of the emission line $\\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on\nthe BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\\mu^{cont}$\nsets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile\ndistortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics. We thus built\n(WCI,RBI) diagrams that can serve as diagnostic diagrams to discriminate\nbetween the various BLR models on the basis of quantitative measurements. It\nappears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the\nsize of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that\ncase, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to\nproduce distinctive line profile distortions for a limited number of caustic\nconfigurations, which facilitates their discrimination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

When the\naccretor orbits a Supergiant star, it captures a fraction of the supersonic\nradiatively-driven wind which forms shocks in its vicinity. The amplitude and\nstability of this gravitational beaming of the flow conditions the mass\naccretion rate responsible, in fine, for the X-ray luminosity of those\nSupergiant X-ray Binaries. The capacity of this low angular momentum inflow to\nform a disc-like structure susceptible to be the stage of well-known\ninstabilities remains at stake. Using state-of-the-art numerical setups, we\ncharacterized the structure of a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flow onto a compact\nobject, from the shock down to the vicinity of the accretor, typically five\norders of magnitude smaller. The evolution of the mass accretion rate and of\nthe bow shock which forms around the accretor (transverse structure, opening\nangle, stability, temperature profile) with the Mach number of the incoming\nflow is described in detail. The robustness of those simulations based on the\nHigh Performance Computing MPI-AMRVAC code is supported by the topology of the\ninner sonic surface, in agreement with theoretical expectations. We developed a\nsynthetic model of mass transfer in Supergiant X-ray Binaries which couples the\nlaunching of the wind accordingly to the stellar parameters, the orbital\nevolution of the streamlines in a modified Roche potential and the accretion\nprocess. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by\nthe mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the alpha-force\nmultiplier. Provided scales such as the orbital period are known, we can trace\nback the observables to evaluate the mass accretion rates, the accretion\nmechanism (stream or wind-dominated) and the shearing of the inflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

In this paper, we propose a solution for group\nre-identification that grounds on transferring knowledge from single person\nre-identification to group re-identification by exploiting sparse dictionary\nlearning. First, a dictionary of sparse atoms is learned using patches\nextracted from single person images. Then, the learned dictionary is exploited\nto obtain a sparsity-driven residual group representation, which is finally\nmatched to perform the re-identification.

This very stable\nnon-global-hyperbolicity is the consequence of our open spaces having a\n\"creased end\" i.e., an end diffeomorphic to an exotic ${\\mathbb R}^4$. Open\nmanifolds having an end like this is a typical phenomenon in four dimensions.\n  The construction is based on a collection of results of Gompf and Taubes on\nexotic and self-dual spaces, respectively, as well as applying Penrose'\nnon-linear graviton construction (i.e., twistor theory) to solve the Riemannian\nEinstein's equation. These solutions then are converted into stably\nnon-globally-hyperbolic Lorentzian vacuum solutions. It follows that the\nplethora of vacuum solutions we found cannot be obtained via the initial value\nformulation of the Einstein's equation because they are \"too long\" in a certain\nsense (explained in the text). This different (i.e., not based on the initial\nvalue formulation but twistorial) technical background might partially explain\nwhy the existence of vacuum solutions of this kind have not been realized so\nfar in spite of the fact that, apparently, their superabundance compared to the\nwell-known globally hyperbolic vacuum solutions is overwhelming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 10:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 10:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 10:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

The magnetic isovector\nform factor depends strongly on a low-energy constant of the NLO Lagrangian. If\nit is adjusted such that the corresponding magnetic radius is reproduced, then\nthe results for the corresponding pion-nucleon scattering amplitude (based on\nthe MO equation) agree very well with the RS results. Also in the electric\nsector the Delta degrees of freedom are needed to obtain the correct order of\nmagnitude for the isovector charge and the corresponding electric radius. Yet\nquantitative agreement is not achieved. If the subtraction constant that\nappears in the solution of the MO equation is not taken from nucleon+Delta\nchiral perturbation theory but adjusted such that the electric radius is\nreproduced, then one obtains also in this sector a pion-nucleon scattering\namplitude that agrees well with the RS results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 12:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 15:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Two approaches are mainly followed.\nOn the one hand, there is the widely used, but often criticized, local\napproach, where machine sub-systems locally couple to thermal baths. On the\nother hand, in the more established global approach, thermal baths couple to\nglobal degrees of freedom of the machine. There has been debate as to which of\nthese two conceptually different approaches should be used in situations out of\nthermal equilibrium. Here we compare the local and global approaches against an\nexact solution for a particular class of thermal machines. We consider\nthermodynamically relevant observables, such as heat currents, as well as the\nquantum state of the machine. Our results show that the use of a local master\nequation is generally well justified. In particular, for weak inter-system\ncoupling, the local approach agrees with the exact solution, whereas the global\napproach fails for non-equilibrium situations. For intermediate coupling, the\nlocal and the global approach both agree with the exact solution and for strong\ncoupling, the global approach is preferable. These results are backed by\ndetailed derivations of the regimes of validity for the respective approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 12:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 10:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 12:05:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 10:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes),\nwe observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a)\npredicts the correct steady state, (b) yields the exact asymptotic heat\ncurrents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In\ncontrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node\ncoupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the\nglobal and local approach may be viewed as \\textit{complementary} tools, best\nsuited to different parameter regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 13:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

Namely, the probe\nfield can be transmitted almost totally at resonance. Thus a two-direction\noptical switch is operated and the state for forward (backward) direction is\nset as open (closed). When microwave source is introduced, dressed splitting of\ndark state happens. The probe field is reflected almost completely at resonance\nand the state of the optical switch at forward and backward directions\n(transmitted and reflected channels) is shifted as closed and open,\nrespectively. Moreover, this scheme is much advantageous to realize splitting\nof dark state because weak microwave field induces the coupling between dark\nstate and one sub-level of ground state. While a strong pump laser which\ncouples dark state with an excited level is applied to realize this splitting\nin Ref. [Phys. Rev.

The information on\nsub-wavelength features is carried by evanescent waves, never reaching the\ncamera, thereby posing a hard limit on resolution: the so-called diffraction\nlimit. Modern microscopic methods enable super-resolution, by employing\nflorescence techniques. State-of-the-art localization based fluorescence\nsubwavelength imaging techniques such as PALM and STORM achieve sub-diffraction\nspatial resolution of several tens of nano-meters. However, they require tens\nof thousands of exposures, which limits their temporal resolution. We have\nrecently proposed SPARCOM (sparsity based super-resolution correlation\nmicroscopy), which exploits the sparse nature of the fluorophores distribution,\nalongside a statistical prior of uncorrelated emissions, and showed that\nSPARCOM achieves spatial resolution comparable to PALM/STORM, while capturing\nthe data hundreds of times faster. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical\nformulation of SPARCOM, which in turn leads to an efficient numerical\nimplementation, suitable for large-scale problems. We further extend our method\nto a general framework for sparsity based super-resolution imaging, in which\nsparsity can be assumed in other domains such as wavelet or discrete-cosine,\nleading to improved reconstructions in a variety of physical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 14:38:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

Here we extend\ntheory from non-equilibrium statistical physics to describe the previously\nunaccounted for fat-tailed form of fluctuations in marine invertebrate richness\nthrough the Phanerozoic. Using this theory, known as superstatistics, we show\nthat the simple fact of heterogeneous origination and extinction rates between\nclades and conserved rates within clades is sufficient to account for this\nfat-tailed form. We identify orders and the families they subsume as the\ntaxonomic level at which clades experience inter-clade heterogeneity and within\nclade homogeneity of rates. Following superstatistics we would posit that\norders and families are subsystems in local statistical equilibrium while the\nentire system is not in equilibrium. The separation of timescales between\nbackground origination and extinction within clades compared to the origin of\nmajor ecological and evolutionary innovations leading to new clades allows\nwithin-clade dynamics to reach equilibrium, while between-clade diversification\nis non-equilibrial. This between clade non-equilibrium accounts for the\nfat-tailed nature of the system as a whole. The distribution of shifts in\ndiversification dynamics across orders and families is consistent with niche\nconservatism and pulsed exploration of adaptive landscapes by higher taxa.\nCompared to other approaches that have used simple birth-death processes,\nsimple equilibrial dynamics, or non-linear theories from complexity science,\nsuperstatistics is superior in its ability to account for both small and\nextreme fluctuations in the richness of fossil taxa. Its success opens up new\nresearch directions to better understand the evolutionary processes leading to\nstasis in an adaptive landscape interrupted by innovations that lead to novel\nforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 14:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 19:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 21:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

One common quality function used to\nidentify community structure is modularity. In Hu et al. [SIAM J.

Furthermore, we show that modularity has no convex\nrelaxation satisfying certain natural conditions. We therefore, find a\nmanageable non-convex approximation using a Ginzburg Landau functional, which\nprovably converges to the correct energy in the limit of a certain parameter.\nWe then derive an MBO algorithm with fewer hand-tuned parameters than in Hu et\nal. and which is 7 times faster at solving the associated diffusion equation\ndue to the fact that the underlying discretization is unconditionally stable.\nOur numerical tests include a hyperspectral video whose associated graph has\n2.9x10^7 edges, which is roughly 37 times larger than was handled in the paper\nof Hu et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 15:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 19:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 20:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

In such a framework, a high order weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) methodology and a nonlinear filter are further employed\nto avoid spurious oscillations. High order accuracy in time is realized by\nusing the high order explicit strong-stability-preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta\nmethod.

As their number grows, it becomes necessary to use an\nalgorithm to extract text and numbers instead of a human. Usual methods are\nfocused on regular expressions or on a strict structure in the data, but are\nnot efficient when we have many variations, fuzzy structure or implicit labels.\nIn this paper we introduce SC2T, a totally self-supervised model for\nconstructing vector representations of tokens in semi-structured messages by\nusing characters and context levels that address these issues. It can then be\nused for an unsupervised labeling of tokens, or be the basis for a\nsemi-supervised information extraction system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 12:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

This is a first step towards a\ncomprehensive, multiscale modeling platform for metasurface antennas-large\narrays of metamaterial elements embedded in a waveguide structure that radiates\ninto free-space--in which the detailed electromagnetic responses of\nmetamaterial elements are replaced by polarizable dipoles. We present two\nmethods to extract the effective polarizability of a metamaterial element\nembedded in a one- or two-dimensional waveguide. The first method invokes\nsurface equivalence principles, averaging over the effective surface currents\nand charges within an element to obtain the effective dipole moments; the\nsecond method is based on computing the coefficients of the scattered waves\nwithin the waveguide, from which the effective polarizability can be inferred.\nWe demonstrate these methods on several variants of waveguide-fed metasurface\nelements, finding excellent agreement between the two, as well as with\nanalytical expressions derived for irises with simpler geometries. Extending\nthe polarizability extraction technique to higher order multipoles, we confirm\nthe validity of the dipole approximation for common metamaterial elements. With\nthe effective polarizabilities of the metamaterial elements accurately\ndetermined, the radiated fields generated by a metasurface antenna (inside and\noutside the antenna) can be found self-consistently by including the\ninteractions between polarizable dipoles. The dipole description provides an\nalternative language and computational framework for engineering metasurface\nantennas, holograms, lenses, beam-forming arrays, and other electrically large,\nwaveguide-fed metasurface structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 16:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

In such\nturbulent times, the paper examines the economic impact of migrant'\nremittances, expected to have a countercyclical behavior.

These three relationships held in the short-run.
