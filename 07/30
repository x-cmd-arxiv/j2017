One important realization of this system is at\nthe bottom of rivers, where surface waters of the river permeate the deposited\nsediment and exchange their contents with subsurface waters. Obtaining a\ncomplete picture of this process, known as hyporheic exchange, is important for\nthe understanding and maintenance of water quality and river ecology. Given the\nwide range of length scales (mm to km) and corresponding time scales of\ninterest, reduced-order numerical models (e.g. stochastic particle tracking,\nadvection-dispersion equations) are often used to study the transport of mass\nand momentum in this system. However, the many scales associated with\nsurface/subsurface mixing make the development of a high-fidelity model for\nturbulent scalar transport a formidable challenge. In an effort to capture\ntransport behavior at the pore scale, this work is focused on development of a\ndetailed, three-dimensional flow model for the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of\nturbulent flow over a permeable bed. A rigorous assessment of the computational\nmesh, domain size and turbulence model is performed. Concurrently, the\ndouble-averaging methodology is used to study the large-scale, persistent flow\nbehavior in the presence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity. It is found that\naccurate resolution of the largest turbulent scales is necessary to develop a\ncomplete picture of interfacial transport, and that these large structures are\nfelt deeper within the bed. Additionally, the development of a particle\ntracking software module is detailed. This module provides a foundation for the\nextraction of Lagrangian dispersion information from the LES, which will\neventually be used to physically inform reduced-order models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 16:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

However, the distance of the\noutflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained, which limits\nour understanding of their kinetic power as a cosmic feedback channel.\nTherefore, the impact of AGN outflows on their host galaxies is uncertain.\nHowever, when the density of the outflows is known, their distance can be\nimmediately obtained from their modelled ionization parameter. With the new\nself-consistent PhotoIONization (PION) model in the SPEX code, we are able to\ncalculate detailed level populations, including the ground and metastable\nlevels. This enables us to determine under what physical conditions the\nmetastable levels are significantly populated. We then identify characteristic\nlines from these metastable levels in the 1 -- 2000 {\\AA} wavelength range. In\nthe large density range of $n_H \\in (10^6, 10^{20} m^{-3}$, the metastable\nlevels 2s 2p $(^3P_{0-2})$ in Be-like ions can be significantly populated. For\nB-like ions, merely the first excited level 2s$^2$ 2p $(^2P_{3/2})$ can be used\nas a density probe. For C-like ions, the first two excited levels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$\n($^3P_1$ and $^3P_2$) are better density probes than the next two excited\nlevels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$ ($^1S_0$ and $^1D_2$). Different ions in the same\nisoelectronic sequence cover not only a wide range of ionization parameter, but\nalso a wide range of density. On the other hand, within the same isonuclear\nsequence, less ionized ions probe lower density and smaller ionization\nparameter. Finally, we re-analyzed the high-resolution grating spectra of NGC\n5548 observed with Chandra in January 2002, using a set of PION components to\naccount for the ionized outflow. We derive lower (or upper) limits of plasma\ndensity in five out of six PION components, based on the presence (or absence)\nof the metastable absorption lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 19:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 08:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The topics and their curricular sequences were extracted\nfrom the course syllabi/schedules and represented as a directed weighted graph,\nwhich we call the topic network. Community detection in the topic network\nrevealed seven topic clusters, which matched reasonably with the concept list\npreviously generated by students and educators through the Network Literacy\ninitiative. The minimum spanning tree of the topic network revealed typical\nflows of curricular contents, starting with examples of networks, moving onto\nrandom networks and small-world networks, then branching off to various\nsubtopics from there.

One specific feature of the\n3D organization is known as topologically associating domains (TADs), which are\ndensely interacting, contiguous chromatin regions playing important roles in\nregulating gene expression. A few algorithms have been proposed to detect TADs.\nIn particular, the structure of Hi-C data naturally inspires application of\ncommunity detection methods. However, one of the drawbacks of community\ndetection is that most methods take exchangeability of the nodes in the network\nfor granted; whereas the nodes in this case, i.e. the positions on the\nchromosomes, are not exchangeable. We propose a network model for detecting\nTADs using Hi-C data that takes into account this non-exchangeability. In\naddition, our model explicitly makes use of cell-type specific CTCF binding\nsites as biological covariates and can be used to identify conserved TADs\nacross multiple cell types. The model leads to a likelihood objective that can\nbe efficiently optimized via relaxation.

The most striking feature of the extension is that\nthe DM-nucleon scattering rate can be naturally below its current experimental\nbounds regardless of the higgsino mass, and hence it alleviates the tension\nbetween naturalness and DM experiments. Other interesting features include that\nthe Higgs phenomenology becomes much richer than that of the original NMSSM due\nto the relaxed constraints from DM physics and also due to the presence of\nextra neutrinos, and that the signatures of sparticles at colliders are quite\ndifferent from those with neutralino as DM candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 14:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 08:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 02:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

However, there is a lack of general understanding\nregarding consistency, splitting rules and influence of the censoring\nmechanism. In this paper, we investigate the statistical properties of existing\nmethods from several interesting perspectives. First, we show that traditional\nsplitting rules with censored outcomes rely on a biased estimation of the\nwithin-node failure distribution. To exactly quantify this bias, we develop a\nconcentration bound of the within-node estimation based on non i.i.d. samples\nand apply it to the entire forest. Second, we analyze the entanglement between\nthe failure and censoring distributions caused by univariate splits, and show\nthat without correcting the bias at an internal node, survival tree and forest\nmodels can still enjoy consistency under suitable conditions. In particular, we\ndemonstrate this property under two cases: a finite-dimensional case where the\nsplitting variables and cutting points are chosen randomly, and a\nhigh-dimensional case where the covariates are weakly correlated. Our results\ncan also degenerate into an independent covariate setting, which is commonly\nused in the random forest literature for high-dimensional sparse models.\nHowever, it may not be avoidable that the convergence rate depends on the total\nnumber of variables in the failure and censoring distributions. Third, we\npropose a new splitting rule that compares bias-corrected cumulative hazard\nfunctions at each internal node. We show that the rate of consistency of this\nnew model depends only on the number of failure variables, which improves from\nnon-bias-corrected versions. We perform simulation studies to confirm that this\ncan substantially benefit the prediction error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 15:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 03:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 00:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 03:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Further, real dataset results suggest varying k is a good strategy\nin general (particularly for difficult Tweedie regression problems) and that\nKNN regression ensembles often outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n  These results for k-varying ensembles echo recent theoretical results in\ntopological data analysis, where multidimensional filter functions and\nmultiscale coverings provide stability and performance gains over\nsingle-dimensional filters and single-scale covering. This opens up the\npossibility of leveraging multiscale neighborhoods and multiple measures of\nlocal geometry in ensemble methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 21:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

However, a\nhigh transmittance modulation often sacrifices luminous transmittance which is\nnecessary for commercial and residential applications of this technology. In\nthis study, we explore the potential for synthesis of VO$_2$ films in a matrix\nof metal oxide nanocrystals, using In$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$, and ZnO as diluents.\nWe seek to optimize the annealing conditions to yield desirable optical\nproperties. Although the films diluted with TiO$_2$ and ZnO failed to show\ntransmittance modulation, those diluted with In$_2$O$_3$ exhibited strong\nthermochromism. Our investigation introduces a novel window film consisting of\na 0.93 metal ionic molar ratio VO$_2$-In$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystalline matrix,\ndemonstrating a significant increase in luminous transmittance without any\nmeasurable impact on thermochromic character. Furthermore, solution-processing\nmitigates costs, allowing this film to be synthesized 4x-7x cheaper than\nindustry standards. This study represents a crucial development in film\nchemistry and paves the way for further application of VO$_2$ nanocomposite\nfilms in chromogenic fenestration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 17:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}
