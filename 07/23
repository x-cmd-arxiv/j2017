The main goal of this paper is to explore\nthe emergence, evolution, and origin of low energy monopole strength along the\neven-even calcium isotopes: from 40Ca to 60Ca. The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is\nadopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any\nreliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of\nlow-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is\nbeing filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows. Further, in\ncontrast to experimental findings, a mild softening of the monopole response\nwith increasing mass number is predicted. Beyond 48Ca, a significant amount of\nlow-energy monopole strength emerges as soon as the weak-binding neutron\norbitals (2p and 1f5/2) become populated. The emergence and evolution of\nlow-energy strength is identified with transitions from these weakly-bound\nstates into the continuum. Moreover, given that models with a soft symmetry\nenergy tend to reach the neutron-drip line earlier than their stiffer\ncounterparts, we identify an inverse correlation between the neutron-skin\nthickness and the inverse energy weighted sum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 16:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by\nconsidering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate\nour model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters\nhave a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:\neven when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the\nsimulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the\nother product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this\nbehavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction\non $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters.

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR\nsteering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing\nand extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We\nfurther consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose\nexpectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for\nall two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion,\nthese observables are found to be always less sensitive than Gaussian\nobservables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous variable\nWerner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find\nthat pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to\nreveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of\nnon-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian\nand non-Gaussian states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 16:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

We start by\nconsidering the $3d$ case and note that our solutions belong to the family of\nmaximally symmetric spaces that can be extended to the $d\\geq 4$ case following\nan analogue treatment. These solutions can be divided into two scenarios:\nmaximally symmetric spaces with positive curvature i.e. de Sitter spaces, and\nmaximally symmetric spaces with negative curvature i.e. Anti-de Sitter spaces.\nWe show that between both scenarios there is a {\\it critical point} where the\ncurvature blows up along the flow.

Here we propose a new theory of\nsensorimotor learning that explains these observations.

Unlike most existing deep learning algorithms that learn a global\nor spatial partition-based local representation, our approach performs human\nbody partition, and thus is more robust to pose changes and various human\nspatial distributions in the person bounding box. Our approach shows\nstate-of-the-art results over standard datasets, Market-$1501$, CUHK$03$,\nCUHK$01$ and VIPeR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 07:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

In previous studies, those effects are taken into\naccount by using the so-called Migdal's approach, in which the final state\nionization/excitation are treated separately from the nuclear recoil. In this\npaper, we reformulate the Migdal's approach so that the \"atomic recoil\" cross\nsection is obtained coherently, where we make transparent the energy-momentum\nconservation and the probability conservation.

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances.

This\nproblem becomes especially difficult if the same set of actuators (e.g. a\nsingle rudder) has to be used for roll stabilization and heading control of the\nvessel, so that the roll stabilizing system interferes with the ship autopilot.\nFinding the \"trade-off\" between the concurrent goals of accurate vessel\nsteering and roll stabilization usually reduces to an optimization problem,\nwhich has to be solved in presence of an unknown wave disturbance. Standard\napproaches to this problem (loop-shaping, LQG, $H_{\\infty}$-control etc.)\nrequire to know the spectral density of the disturbance, considered to be a\n\\colored noise\". In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal roll\nstabilization, approximating the disturbance by a polyharmonic signal with\nknown frequencies yet uncertain amplitudes and phase shifts. Linear quadratic\noptimization problems in presence of polyharmonic disturbances can be solved by\nmeans of the theory of universal controllers developed by V.A. Yakubovich. An\noptimal universal controller delivers the optimal solution for any uncertain\namplitudes and phases. Using Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) Toolbox that\nprovides a realistic vessel's model, we compare our design method with\nclassical approaches to optimal roll stabilization. Among three controllers\nproviding the same quality of yaw steering, OUC stabilizes the roll motion most\nefficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 10:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 10:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 17:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 22:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

We define a small and large chemical network which can be used for the\nquantitative simultaneous analysis of molecular emission from the near-IR to\nthe submm.

We use the thermo-chemical disk modeling code ProDiMo and a standard T\nTauri disk model to evaluate the impact of various chemical networks, reaction\nrate databases and sets of adsorption energies on a large sample of chemical\nspecies and emerging line fluxes from the near-IR to the submm wavelength\nrange. Results. We find large differences in the masses and radial distribution\nof ice reservoirs when considering freeze-out on bare or polar ice coated\ngrains. Most strongly the ammonia ice mass and the location of the snow line\n(water) change. As a consequence molecules associated to the ice lines such as\nN2H+ change their emitting region; none of the line fluxes in the sample\nconsidered here changes by more than 25% except CO isotopologues, CN and N2H+\nlines. The three-body reaction N+H2+M plays a key role in the formation of\nwater in the outer disk. Besides that, differences between the UMIST 2006 and\n2012 database change line fluxes in the sample considered here by less than a\nfactor 2 (a subset of low excitation CO and fine structure lines stays even\nwithin 25%); exceptions are OH, CN, HCN, HCO+ and N2H+ lines.

For biomedical applications, it is found that 75% of Gram\npositive and 50% of Gram negative bacteria have been killed, hence bacterial\nproliferation is significantly restricted. Further, the cytotoxicity study\nreveals that the synthesised nanocomposites are non-toxic for both normal\n(HCEC) and cancerous (MCF-7, HEp-2) cell lines which signifies their potential\nas carriers for drug delivery.

For electron transport junctions it is natural to characterize the\nmaterials by their conductance length dependence, $\\beta$. Theoretical\nestimations of $\\beta$ are made employing two primary theories: complex band\nstructure and DFT-NEGF Landauer transport. Both reveal information on $\\beta$\nof individual states; i.e. complex Bloch waves and transmission eigenchannels,\nrespectively. However, it is unclear how the $\\beta$-values of the two\napproaches compare. Here, we present calculations of decay constants for the\ntwo most conductive states as determined by complex band structure and standard\nDFT-NEGF transport calculations for two molecular and one semi-conductor\njunctions. Despite the different nature of the two methods, we find strong\nagreement of the calculated decay constants for the molecular junctions while\nthe semi-conductor junction shows some discrepancies. The results presented\nhere provide a template for studying the intrinsic, channel resolved length\ndependence of the junction through complex band structure of the central\nmaterial in the heterogeneous nano-scale junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 09:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

It gets accumulated in the HSA and its concentration in sera of\npatients may reflect the chronicity of renal failure [1-4]. It is considered\nuremic toxin due to its damaging effect on the renal cells. The high\nconcentrations of CMPF inhibit the binding of other ligands to HSA. Removal of\nCMPF is difficult through conventional hemodialysis due to its strong binding\naffinity. We hypothesized that the competitive inhibition may be helpful in\nremoval of CMPF binding to HSA. A compound with higher HSA binding affinity\nthan CMPF could be useful to prevent CMPF from binding so that CMPF could be\nexcreted by the body through the urine. We studied an active compound\ndihydrothymoquinone/ dithymoquinone (DTQ) found in black cumin seed (Nigella\nsativa), which has higher binding affinity for HSA. Molecular docking\nsimulations were performed to find the binding affinity of CMPF and DTQ with\nHSA. DTQ was found to have higher binding affinity possessing more interactions\nwith the binding residues than the CMPF. We studied the binding pocket\nflexibility of CMPF and DTQ to analyze the binding abilities of both the\ncompounds. We have also predicted the ADME properties for DTQ which shows\nhigher lipophilicity, higher gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, and blood-brain\nbarrier (BBB) permeability. We discovered that DTQ has potential to act as an\ninhibitor of CMPF and can be considered as a candidate for the formation of the\ntherapeutic drug against CMPF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2017 10:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}
