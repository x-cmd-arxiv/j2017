Optoelectromechanical systems, in which microwave and\noptical cavity modes are coupled to a common mechanical oscillator, are a\npromising route towards this goal. In these systems, efficient, low-noise\nconversion is possible using a mechanically dark mode of the fields but the\nconversion bandwidth is limited to a fraction of the cavity linewidth. Here, we\nshow that an array of optoelectromechanical transducers can overcome this\nlimitation and reach a bandwidth that is larger than the cavity linewidth. The\ncoupling rates are varied in space throughout the array so that the\nmechanically dark mode of the propagating fields adiabatically changes from\nmicrowave to optical or vice versa. This strategy also leads to significantly\nreduced thermal noise with the collective optomechanical cooperativity being\nthe relevant figure of merit. Finally, we demonstrate that, quite surprisingly,\nthe bandwidth enhancement per transducer element is largest for small arrays;\nthis feature makes our scheme particularly attractive for state-of-the-art\nexperimental setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 16:07:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 08:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

I\npresent evidence that the NEE affects not just the northern edge, but the whole\nwidth of the belt. It begins with an outbreak of a bright rift that is more\nnortherly and slower-moving than usual; this is often involved with the first\nejection of dark material northwards into the N.

NEBs dark\nformations are usually affected, as they are during individual interactions\nwith rifts at other times; they may be disrupted, or intensified, and they\nusually undergo deceleration. The expansion of the dark NEB to the north occurs\nconcurrently, and is followed by the appearance of new dark 'barges' and white\novals flanking the NEBn jet. The speed of the NEBs dark formations varies with\ntheir mean spacing, consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that they are\nplanetary Rossby waves.

An\neffort has therefore been made in the literature to optimize sensing matrices\nfor optimal recovery using this property. We discover, in the specific case of\noptimizing codes for the CACTI camera, that the popular method of mutual\ncoherence minimization does not produce optimal results: codes designed to\noptimize effective dictionary coherence often perform worse than random codes\nin terms of mean squared reconstruction error.\n  This surprising phenomenon leads us to investigate the reliability of the\ncoherence bound for matrix optimization, in terms of its looseness. We examine,\non simulated data, the looseness of the bound as it propagates across various\nsteps of the inequalities in a derivation leading to the final bound. We then\nsimilarly examine an alternate bound derived by Tang, G. et al, based on the\n$\\ell_1/\\ell_{\\infty}$ notion of sparsity, which is a compromise between\ncoherence and the restricted isometry constant (RIC). Moreover, we also perform\na bound looseness analysis for the RIC as derived by Cai, T. et al. The\nconclusion of these efforts is that coherence optimization is problematic not\nonly because of the coherence bound on the RIC, but also the RIC bound itself.\nThese negative results imply that despite the success of previous work in\ndesigning sensing matrices based on optimization of a matrix quality factor,\none needs to exercise caution in using them for practical sensing matrix\ndesign.\n  We then introduce a paradigm for optimizing sensing matrices that overcomes\nthe looseness of compressed sensing upper bounds using an average case error\napproach.

A key\nadvantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and\nhence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other\ncosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest transmission is\nsensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark\nmatter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate this\nsensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the\nintergalactic medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each\nsimulation starts from initial conditions at the kinematic decoupling era\n(z~1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized gas thermal\nevolution at reionization (z~8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale\nstructure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization.

However, identifying such motifs\nis a challenging problem. Behaviors have a multi-scale structure: the animal\ncan be simultaneously performing a small-scale motif and a large-scale one\n(e.g. \\textit{chewing} and \\textit{feeding}). Motifs are compositional: a\nlarge-scale motif is a chain of smaller-scale ones, folded in (some behavioral)\nspace in a specific manner. We demonstrate an approach which captures these\nstructures, using rat locomotor data as an example. From the same dataset, we\nused a preprocessing procedure to create different versions, each describing\nmotifs of a different scale. We then trained several Hidden Markov Models\n(HMMs) in parallel, one for each dataset version. This approach essentially\nforced each HMM to learn motifs on a different scale, allowing us to capture\nbehavioral structures lost in previous approaches. By comparing HMMs with\nmodels representing different null hypotheses, we found that rat locomotion was\ncomposed of distinct motifs from second scale to minute scale. We found that\ntransitions between motifs were modulated by rats' location in the environment,\nleading to non-Markovian transitions. To test the ethological relevance of\nmotifs we discovered, we compared their usage between rats with differences in\na high-level trait, prosociality. We found that these rats had distinct motif\nrepertoires, suggesting that motif usage statistics can be used to infer\ninternal states of rats. Our method is therefore an efficient way to discover\nmulti-scale, compositional structures in animal behaviors. It may also be\napplied as a sensitive assay for internal states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 16:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 16:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 14:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

We introduce a highly flexible technique to\nsimulate STS measurements by computing the local density of states using\nreal-space Green's functions defined on two-dimensional lattices with as many\nas 100,000 sites. We focus on the following question: to what extent can the\nexperimental results be reproduced when various forms of distributed disorder\nare present? We consider randomly distributed point-like impurities, smooth\n\"Coulombic\" disorder, and disorder arising from random on-site energies and\nsuperconducting gaps. We find an apparent paradox: the QPI peaks in the\nFourier-transformed local density of states appear to be sharper and better\ndefined in experiment than those seen in our simulations. We arrive at a no-go\nresult for smooth-potential disorder since this does not reproduce the QPI\npeaks associated with large-momentum scattering. An ensemble of point-like\nimpurities gets closest to experiment, but this goes hand in hand with impurity\ncores that are not seen in experiment. We also study the effects of possible\nmeasurement artifacts (the \"fork mechanism\"), which turn out to be of\nrelatively minor consequence.

However, standard imitation learning methods assume that the agent\nreceives examples of observation-action tuples that could be provided, for\ninstance, to a supervised learning algorithm. This stands in contrast to how\nhumans and animals imitate: we observe another person performing some behavior\nand then figure out which actions will realize that behavior, compensating for\nchanges in viewpoint, surroundings, object positions and types, and other\nfactors. We term this kind of imitation learning \"imitation-from-observation,\"\nand propose an imitation learning method based on video prediction with context\ntranslation and deep reinforcement learning. This lifts the assumption in\nimitation learning that the demonstration should consist of observations in the\nsame environment configuration, and enables a variety of interesting\napplications, including learning robotic skills that involve tool use simply by\nobserving videos of human tool use.

The DSN model provides a\nsimple, universal yet powerful structure, similar to DNN, to represent any\nknowledge of the world, which is transparent to humans. The conjecture behind\nthe DSN model is that any type of real world objects sharing enough common\nfeatures are mapped into human brains as a symbol. Those symbols are connected\nby links, representing the composition, correlation, causality, or other\nrelationships between them, forming a deep, hierarchical symbolic network\nstructure. Powered by such a structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like\nhumans, because of its unique characteristics. First, it is universal, using\nthe same structure to store any knowledge. Second, it can learn symbols from\nthe world and construct the deep symbolic networks automatically, by utilizing\nthe fact that real world objects have been naturally separated by\nsingularities. Third, it is symbolic, with the capacity of performing causal\ndeduction and generalization. Fourth, the symbols and the links between them\nare transparent to us, and thus we will know what it has learned or not - which\nis the key for the security of an AI system. Fifth, its transparency enables it\nto learn with relatively small data. Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated.\nLast but not least, it is more friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We\npresent the details of the model, the algorithm powering its automatic learning\nability, and describe its usefulness in different use cases.

In particular, it was suggested that the optimal\nlocation for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part\nof cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too\nspeculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a\nsignature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is\ndoomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss\nthe motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that \"biological SETI\"\ninvolves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a\nwell-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms\nof molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting\nthe guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first\nprinciples and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the\ncanonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked\nsystematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,\nwe perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.\nStatistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the\ncode, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison\nanalysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,\nin agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the\ncanonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found\nattributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make\nperfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most\nuniversal codes of culture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

The most immediately apparent approach, using\nstandard Runge-Kutta numerical integration algorithms, suffers from both severe\ninefficiency due to stiffness and the loss of unitarity. After reviewing the\nformalism of continuous unitary transformations and Wegner's original choice\nfor the infinitesimal generator of the flow, we present a number of approaches\nto resolving these issues including a choice of generator which induces what we\ncall the \"uniform tangent decay flow\" and three numerical integrators\nspecifically designed to perform continuous unitary transformations efficiently\nwhile preserving the unitarity of flow. We conclude by applying one of the flow\nalgorithms to a simple calculation that visually demonstrates the many-body\nlocalization transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 18:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 21:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Next to Dirac\nand Weyl systems, these include more exotic phases based on manifold band\ndegeneracies in the bulk electronic structure. The exotic states in topological\nsemimetals are usually protected by some sort of crystal symmetry and the\nintroduction of magnetic order can influence these states by breaking time\nreversal symmetry. Here we show that we can realize a rich variety of different\ntopological semimetal states in a single material, $\\rm CeSbTe$. This compound\ncan exhibit different types of magnetic order that can be accessed easily by\napplying a small field. It allows, therefore, for tuning the electronic\nstructure and can drive it through a manifold of topologically distinct phases,\nsuch as the first nonsymmorphic magnetic topological material with an\neight-fold band crossing at a high symmetry point.

As the stream cools from adiabatic expansion and begins to\nrecombine, the residual self-gravity allows for planetary-mass fragments to\nform along the length of the stream; these fragments are then shot out into the\ngalaxy at range of velocities, with the fastest moving at ~10% c. We determine\nthe phase space distributions of these fragments for a realistic ensemble of\nstellar disruptions, along with the local density of fragments in the solar\nneighborhood. We find that ~$10^7$ fragments produced by Sgr A* accumulate\nwithin the Milky Way over its lifetime, that there are ~$10^7$ fragments that\nlie within 1 Mpc of the Milky Way originating from other galaxies, and that the\nnearest fragment to our Sun is on average 500 pc distant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 18:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

Another common problem with MCMC algorithms is the\nunknown convergence time making predictable fixed-length implementations\nproblematic. When an insufficient number of iterations is used on a slowly\nconverging example, the output LLRs can be unstable and overconfident.\nTherefore, we develop a method to identify rare slowly converging runs and\nmitigate their degrading effects on the soft-output information. This improves\nforward-error-correcting code performance and removes a symptomatic error floor\nin BER plots. Next, pseudo-convergence is identified with a novel way to\nvisualize the internal behavior of the Gibbs sampler.

The Sun is an active star that produces large-scale energetic events\nsuch as solar flares and coronal mass ejections and numerous smaller-scale\nevents such as solar jets. These events are often associated with accelerated\nparticles that can cause emission at radio wavelengths. The reconfiguration of\nthe solar magnetic field in the corona is believed to be the cause of the\nmajority of solar energetic events and accelerated particles. Aims. Here, we\ninvestigate a bright J-burst that was associated with a solar jet and the\npossible emission mechanism causing these two phenomena. Methods. We used data\nfrom the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to observe a solar jet, and radio\ndata from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograph\n(NRH) to observe a J-burst over a broad frequency range (33-173 MHz) on 9 July\n2013 at ~11:06 UT. Results. The J-burst showed fundamental and harmonic\ncomponents and it was associated with a solar jet observed at extreme\nultraviolet wavelengths with SDO. The solar jet occurred at a time and location\ncoincident with the radio burst, in the northern hemisphere, and not inside a\ngroup of complex active regions in the southern hemisphere. The jet occurred in\nthe negative polarity region of an area of bipolar plage. Newly emerged\npositive flux in this region appeared to be the trigger of the jet.\nConclusions. Magnetic reconnection between the overlying coronal field lines\nand the newly emerged positive field lines is most likely the cause of the\nsolar jet.

However, these known results rely crucially on the assumption that\nthe thermal machine is not only exactly preserved in every cycle, but also kept\nuncorrelated from the quantum systems on which it acts. Here we lift this\nrestriction: we allow the machine to become correlated with the microscopic\nsystems on which it acts, while still exactly preserving its own state.\nSurprisingly, we show that this restores the second law in its original form:\nfree energy alone determines the possible state transitions, and the\ncorresponding amount of work can be invested or extracted from single systems\nexactly and without any fluctuations. At the same time, the work reservoir\nremains uncorrelated from all other systems and parts of the machine. Thus,\nmicroscopic machines can increase their efficiency via clever \"correlation\nengineering\" in a perfectly cyclic manner, which is achieved by a catalytic\nsystem that can sometimes be as small as a single qubit (though some setups\nrequire very large catalysts).

By examining the relative deficiencies of\nthe hydrostatic (O, Na, Mg, and Al) and explosive (Si, P, K, and Mn) elements,\nour analysis supports the argument that previous generations of Sgr stars were\nformed with a top-light IMF, one lacking the most massive stars that would\nnormally pollute the ISM with the hydrostatic elements. We use a simple\nchemical evolution model, flexCE to further backup our claim and conclude that\nrecent stellar generations of Fornax and the LMC could also have formed\naccording to a top-light IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

About two dozen of these stellar tidal\ndisruption flares (TDFs) may have been detected in optical transient surveys.\nHowever, explaining the observed properties of these events within the tidal\ndisruption paradigm is not yet possible. This theoretical ambiguity has led\nsome authors to suggest that optical TDFs are due to a different process, such\nas a nuclear supernova or accretion disk instabilities. Here we present a test\nof a fundamental prediction of the tidal disruption event scenario: a\nsuppression of the flare rate due to the direct capture of stars by the black\nhole. Using a recently compiled sample of candidate TDFs with black hole mass\nmeasurements, plus a careful treatment of selection effects in this\nflux-limited sample, we confirm that the dearth of observed TDFs from high-mass\nblack holes is statistically significant. All the TDF impostor models we\nconsider fail to explain the observed mass function; the only scenario that\nfits the data is a suppression of the rate due to direct captures. We find that\nthis suppression can explain the low volumetric rate of the luminous TDF\ncandidate ASASSN-15lh, thus supporting the hypothesis that this flare belongs\nto the TDF family. Our work is the first to present the optical TDF luminosity\nfunction. A steep power law is required to explain the observed rest-frame\ng-band luminosity, $dN/dL_{g} \\propto L_{g}^{-2.5}$.

One of the reasons for their success is the fact that these frameworks\nare able to accurately capture the nature of large-scale computation. In\nparticular, compared to the classic distributed algorithms or PRAM models,\nthese frameworks allow for much more local computation. The fundamental\nquestion that arises in this context is though: can we leverage this additional\npower to obtain even faster parallel algorithms?\n  A prominent example here is the {\\em maximum matching} problem---one of the\nmost classic graph problems. It is well known that in the PRAM model one can\ncompute a 2-approximate maximum matching in $O(\\log{n})$ rounds. However, the\nexact complexity of this problem in the MPC framework is still far from\nunderstood. Lattanzi et al. showed that if each machine has $n^{1+\\Omega(1)}$\nmemory, this problem can also be solved $2$-approximately in a constant number\nof rounds. These techniques, as well as the approaches developed in the follow\nup work, seem though to get stuck in a fundamental way at roughly $O(\\log{n})$\nrounds once we enter the near-linear memory regime. It is thus entirely\npossible that in this regime, which captures in particular the case of sparse\ngraph computations, the best MPC round complexity matches what one can already\nget in the PRAM model, without the need to take advantage of the extra local\ncomputation power.\n  In this paper, we finally refute that perplexing possibility. That is, we\nbreak the above $O(\\log n)$ round complexity bound even in the case of {\\em\nslightly sublinear} memory per machine. In fact, our improvement here is {\\em\nalmost exponential}: we are able to deliver a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation to\nmaximum matching, for any fixed constant $\\epsilon>0$, in $O((\\log \\log n)^2)$\nrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 18:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Slightly perturbing an image in a carefully chosen\ndirection in the image space may cause a trained neural network model to\nmisclassify it. Recently, it was shown that physical adversarial examples\nexist: printing perturbed images then taking pictures of them would still\nresult in misclassification. This raises security and safety concerns.\n  However, these experiments ignore a crucial property of physical objects: the\ncamera can view objects from different distances and at different angles. In\nthis paper, we show experiments that suggest that current constructions of\nphysical adversarial examples do not disrupt object detection from a moving\nplatform. Instead, a trained neural network classifies most of the pictures\ntaken from different distances and angles of a perturbed image correctly. We\nbelieve this is because the adversarial property of the perturbation is\nsensitive to the scale at which the perturbed picture is viewed, so (for\nexample) an autonomous car will misclassify a stop sign only from a small range\nof distances.\n  Our work raises an important question: can one construct examples that are\nadversarial for many or most viewing conditions? If so, the construction should\noffer very significant insights into the internal representation of patterns by\ndeep networks. If not, there is a good prospect that adversarial examples can\nbe reduced to a curiosity with little practical impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 00:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

The application of WVR\nderived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful\nobservations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We\npresent work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can\nact to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data.

The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence\nimprovement in 39 datasets.

Although these improvements are not profound, phase\nstability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher\nfrequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently\nhave poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for\nwhich we find the scaling to be most effective.

Short bars of sub-kiloparsec radius have been hypothesized\nto be an important mechanism for driving gas inflows to small scale, feeding\ncentral BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this\nmechanism, we examine the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence\nof BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to be robust, long-lived structures;\nextremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely destroy such\nbars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in\nlarge-scale outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass $M_{\\rm\nbh}\\sim0.05-0.2\\%$ of the total stellar mass ($M_\\star$) are present. In\nagreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host short bars have\nBHs with a mass fraction less than $0.2\\%M_\\star$. Thus the dissolution of\nshort inner bars is possible, perhaps even frequent, in the universe. An\nimportant implication of this result is that inner bar-driven gas inflows may\nbe terminated when BHs grow to $\\sim0.1\\%M_\\star$.

Practical approaches to this problem involve legacy\napproximations and ad-hoc heuristics that may undermine the efficiency and\nreliability of power system operations, that are ever growing in scale and\ncomplexity.

In this paper, we propose a discriminative\nblock-diagonal low-rank representation (BDLRR) method for recognition. In\nparticular, the elaborate BDLRR is formulated as a joint optimization problem\nof shrinking the unfavorable representation from off-block-diagonal elements\nand strengthening the compact block-diagonal representation under the\nsemi-supervised framework of low-rank representation. To this end, we first\nimpose penalty constraints on the negative representation to eliminate the\ncorrelation between different classes such that the incoherence criterion of\nthe extra-class representation is boosted. Moreover, a constructed subspace\nmodel is developed to enhance the self-expressive power of training samples and\nfurther build the representation bridge between the training and test samples,\nsuch that the coherence of the learned intra-class representation is\nconsistently heightened.

Users are self-interested and aim to maximize their utility\n(defined as their value for the resource fraction they receive minus their\npayment). Starting with the seminal work of Johari and Tsitsiklis [Mathematics\nof Operations Research, 2004], a long list of papers studied the price of\nanarchy (in terms of the social welfare --- the total users' value) of resource\nallocation mechanisms for a variety of allocation and payment rules. Here, we\nfurther assume that each user has a budget constraint that invalidates\nstrategies that yield a payment that is higher than the user's budget. This\nsubtle assumption, which is arguably more realistic, constitutes the\ntraditional price of anarchy analysis meaningless as the set of equilibria may\nchange drastically and their social welfare can be arbitrarily far from\noptimal. Instead, we study the price of anarchy using the liquid welfare\nbenchmark that measures efficiency taking budget constraints into account. We\nshow a tight bound of 2 on the liquid price of anarchy of the well-known Kelly\nmechanism and prove that this result is essentially best possible among all\nmulti-user resource allocation mechanisms. This comes in sharp contrast to the\nno-budget setting where there are mechanisms that considerably outperform Kelly\nin terms of social welfare and even achieve full efficiency. In our proofs, we\nexploit the particular structure of worst-case games and equilibria, which also\nallows us to design (nearly) optimal two-player mechanisms by solving simple\ndifferential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 05:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 17:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 14:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

The\nresults are explained under the basic assumptions of the molecular\nrecombination model. The ERDA hydrogen counts are composed of two distinct\nhydrogen desorption processes, limited by rapid molecular diffusion in the\ninitial stages of irradiation, and as the fluence progresses a slow process\nlimited by diffusion of atomic hydrogen takes over. Which of the aforesaid\nprocesses dominates, is determined by the continuously evolving Hydrogen\nconcentration within the films. The ERDA measurements were also carried out for\nfilms treated with low temperature (300 degrees centigrade) hydrogen plasma\nannealing (HPA). The HPA treated films show an improved diffusion of atomic\nhydrogen, resulting from healing of weak bonds and passivation of dangling\nbonds. Further, upon HPA, films also show evolution of hydrogen with\nsignificantly higher counts, at advanced fluences, relative to the as-deposited\nfilms. These results indicate the potential of HPA towards improved H retention\nin a-SiNx:H films. The study distinguishes clearly the presence of two\ndiffusion processes in a-SiNx:H whose diffusion rates differ by an order of\nmagnitude, with hydrogen radicals not being able to diffuse beyond ~1 nm from\nthe point of their creation.

With the combination of spectral graph method, I\nreveal the essential difference between the global scale models and local scale\nones in structure clustering, i.e., different optimization on Euclidean (or\nspatial) distances and sequential (or genomic) distances. More specifically,\nclusters from global scale models optimize Euclidean distance relations. Local\nscale models, on the other hand, result in clusters that optimize the genomic\ndistance relations. For a biomolecular data, Euclidean distances and sequential\ndistances are two independent variables, which can never be optimized\nsimultaneously in data clustering. However, sequence scale in my SeqMM can work\nas a tuning parameter that balances these two variables and deliver different\nclusterings based on my purposes. Further, my SeqMM is used to explore the\nhierarchical structures of chromosomes. I find that in global scale, the\nFiedler vector from my SeqMM bears a great similarity with the principal vector\nfrom principal component analysis, and can be used to study genomic\ncompartments. In TAD analysis, I find that TADs evaluated from different scales\nare not consistent and vary a lot.

Even for\nregions with high contact frequencies, TAD regions show no obvious consistence.\nHowever, when the scale value increases further, although TADs are still quite\ndifferent, TAD boundaries in these high contact frequency regions become more\nand more consistent.

We visually identify bars,\nboxy/peanut-shaped bulges, and barlenses, and examine the dependence of bar and\nbuckled bar fractions on host galaxy properties, including Hubble type, stellar\nmass, color, and gas mass fraction.

In this\npaper, I propose a new method called persistent similarity, which is based on a\nnewly-invented method in algebraic topology, known as persistent homology.\nDifferent from all previous topological methods, persistent homology is able to\nembed a geometric measurement into topological invariants, thus provides a\nbridge between geometry and topology. Further, with the proposed persistent\nBetti function (PBF), topological information derived from the persistent\nhomology analysis can be uniquely represented by a series of continuous\none-dimensional (1D) functions. In this way, any complicated biomolecular\nstructure can be reduced to several simple 1D PBFs for comparison. Persistent\nsimilarity is then defined as the quotient of sizes of intersect areas and\nunion areas between two correspondingly PBFs. If structures have no significant\ntopological properties, a pseudo-barcode is introduced to insure a better\ncomparison. Moreover, a multiscale biomolecular representation is introduced\nthrough the multiscale rigidity function. It naturally induces a multiscale\npersistent similarity. The multiscale persistent similarity enables an\nobjective-oriented comparison. State differently, it facilitates the comparison\nof structures in any particular scale of interest.

Such a risk is very challenging to compute because: 1)\nthe genotype X of the individual of interest is in general unknown; 2) the\nposterior distribution P(X|FH, T > t) changes with t (T is the age at disease\nonset for the targeted individual); 3) the competing risk of death is not\nnegligible. In this work, we present a modeling of this problem using a\nBayesian network mixed with (right-censored) survival outcomes where hazard\nrates only depend on the genotype of each individual. We explain how belief\npropagation can be used to obtain posterior distribution of genotypes given the\nFH, and how to obtain a time-dependent posterior hazard rate for any individual\nin the pedigree. Finally, we use this posterior hazard rate to compute\nindividual risk, with or without the competing risk of death. Our method is\nillustrated using the Claus-Easton model for breast cancer (BC).

Based on the well-known logistic map, chaos\nused to be regarded as intrinsic randomicity of determinate dynamics systems.\nHowever, urbanization dynamics indicates new explanation about it. Using\nmathematical derivation, numerical computation, and empirical analysis, we can\nexplore chaotic dynamics of urbanization. The key is the formula of\nurbanization level. The urbanization curve can be described with the logistic\nfunction, which can be transformed into 1-dimensional map and thus produce\nbifurcation and chaos. On the other hand, the logistic model of urbanization\ncurve can be derived from the rural-urban population interaction model, and the\nrural-urban interaction model can be discretized to a 2-dimensional map. An\ninteresting finding is that the 2-dimensional rural-urban coupling map can\ncreate the same bifurcation and chaos patterns as those from the 1-dimensional\nlogistic map. This suggests that the urban bifurcation and chaos come from\nspatial interaction between rural and urban population rather than pure\nintrinsic randomicity of determinate models. This discovery provides a new way\nof looking at origin and essence of bifurcation and chaos. By analogy with\nurbanization models, the classical predator-prey interaction model can be\ndeveloped to interpret the complex dynamics of the logistic map in physical and\nsocial sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 08:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

Various dark sector models exist, among which the\ncontribution of the dark sector neutrinos to the VMB experiment is examined.\nThe contribution comes from the mixing of photon with the dark sector Z boson\nand violates parity, thus inducing a parity-violating electromagnetic\ninteraction.

Despite their effect of redistributing the wall shear stress\nalong the duct perimeter, we find that secondary motions do not have large\ninfluence on the mean velocity field, which can be characterized with good\naccuracy as that resulting from the concurrent effect of four independent flat\nwalls, each controlling a quarter of the flow domain. As a consequence, we find\nthat parametrizations based on the hydraulic diameter concept, and\nmodifications thereof, are successful in predicting the duct friction\ncoefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 10:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This paper aims at studying the\noccurrence of CP stars in the earliest stages of evolution of a stellar\npopulation by applying this technique to Hogg 16, a very young Galactic open\ncluster (about 25 Myr). We identified several peculiar candidates: two B-type\nstars with a negative $\\Delta a$ index (CD-60 4701, CPD-60 4706) are likely\nemission-line (Be) stars, even though spectral measurements are necessary for a\nproper classification of the second one; a third object (CD-60 4703),\nidentified as a Be candidate in literature, appears to be a background B-type\nsupergiant with no significant $\\Delta a$ index, which does not rule out the\npossibility that it is indeed peculiar as the normality line of $\\Delta a$ for\nsupergiants has not been studied in detail yet. A fourth object (CD-60 4699)\nappears to be a magnetic CP star of 8 M$_\\odot$, but obtained spectral data\nseem to rule out this hypothesis. Three more magnetic CP star candidates are\nfound in the domain of early F-type stars. One is a probable nonmember and\nclose to the border of significance, but the other two are probably pre-main\nsequence cluster objects. This is very promising, as it can lead to very strong\nconstraints to the diffusion theory. Finally, we derived the fundamental\nparameters of Hogg 16 and provide for the first time an estimate of its metal\ncontent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 11:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

Due to the discontinuity resulted from the switching\ntopology, achieving consensus in the context of uncertain Lagrangian systems is\nchallenging. We propose a new adaptive controller based on dynamic feedback to\nresolve this problem and additionally propose a new analysis tool for\nrigorously demonstrating the stability and convergence of the networked\nsystems. The new introduced analysis tool is referred to as uniform\nintegral-L_p stability, which is motivated for addressing integral-input-output\nproperties of linear time-varying systems. It is then shown that the consensus\nerrors between the systems converge to zero so long as the union of the graphs\ncontains a directed spanning tree. It is also shown that the proposed\ncontroller enjoys the robustness with respect to constant communication delays.\nThe performance of the proposed adaptive controllers is shown by numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 11:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

Gamma-ray fluxes have been predicted for both the\ncentral binary and the interaction regions between jets and surrounding nebula.\nAlso, non-thermal emission at lower energies has been previously reported. We\nexplore the capability of SS 433 to emit VHE gamma rays during periods in which\nthe expected flux attenuation due to periodic eclipses and precession of the\ncircumstellar disk periodically covering the central binary system is expected\nto be at its minimum. The eastern and western SS433/W50 interaction regions are\nalso examined. We aim to constrain some theoretical models previously developed\nfor this system. We made use of dedicated observations from MAGIC and H.E.S.S.\nfrom 2006 to 2011 which were combined for the first time and accounted for a\ntotal effective observation time of 16.5 h. Gamma-ray attenuation does not\naffect the jet/medium interaction regions. The analysis of a larger data set\namounting to 40-80 h, depending on the region, was employed. No evidence of VHE\ngamma-ray emission was found. Upper limits were computed for the combined data\nset. We place constraints on the particle acceleration fraction at the inner\njet regions and on the physics of the jet/medium interactions. Our findings\nsuggest that the fraction of the jet kinetic power transferred to relativistic\nprotons must be relatively small to explain the lack of TeV and neutrino\nemission from the central system. At the SS433/W50 interface, the presence of\nmagnetic fields greater 10$\\mu$G is derived assuming a synchrotron origin for\nthe observed X-ray emission. This also implies the presence of high-energy\nelectrons with energies up to 50 TeV, preventing an efficient production of\ngamma-ray fluxes in these interaction regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 11:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

In three-dimensions, cracks generically\nundergo a micro-branching instability at about 40% of their sonic limiting\nvelocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks\nunprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without\nmicro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their\nfundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in\ncondensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture\ninstabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical\ntheory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a\nstressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict\ncrack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle\nfracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in\nthe presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by\nextensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability\ncontrolled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This\ninstability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an\nintrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture\nenergy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This\nratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the\nclassical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack\ndynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles\nin the failure of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 12:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

With ultrashort optical pulse and a\npair of chromatic dispersions, the broadband RF signal is firstly short-time\nFourier-transformed to a spectrum-spread pulse. Then a time slot, corresponding\nto the target spectrum slice, is coherently optical-sampled with\nin-phase/quadrature (I/Q) demodulation.

This process of urbanisation\ncorresponds with the process of digitalisation of urban life: while\nurbanisation acts on a physical infrastructural level, the digital develops as\na kind of metastructure above the infrastructure. This metastructural level\noffers a flexible framework through which information is continuously and\noperatively being symbolized. Today, Information technology and the\navailability of abundant urban data streams could be considered as forerunners\nof our time, having unprecedented impacts comparable to the ones brought by the\nsteam engine at the dawn of industrialisation and the electrification of\ncities. It is therefore no longer conceivable to think of the physical\nstructure of the city without including its digital counterpart. Against this\nbackground, we will explore the role of computational power and information\ntechnologies as dominant factors in the formation of computational urban models\nand normative city theories. We will show how these models and theories,\nemerging mainly during the 19th and 20th centuries, present leaping\ncorrespondences with more ancient conceptions of the city, when observed from a\nmeta-level or episteme (Foucault, 2002) approach. First, and for the sake of\nclarity, we will deal with some methodological elucidations around the concepts\nof theory, model and episteme, and how we will refer conceptually to these\nterms throughout this paper. Secondly, we will review these evolving\ntechnological and computational levels of abstraction and their influence on\nthe different conceptions of the city. Thirdly, we will develop the hypothesis\nof a conceptual gap, between our current technological capacity -- grounded on\nthe abundance and availability of urban data streams -- and the state of the\nart in urban modelling and city theory. Lastly, building upon Foucault's\nconcept of episteme (Foucault, 1970) and genealogy (Foucault, 1977b), we will\nexplore this gap by speculating around the possibility of an inversion in\ncomputational urban modelling and city theory. And above all, we will question\nthe terms in which we can think of the city, in an age where the world can be\nvirtually conceived as fully urban, and the continuity and abundance of urban\ndata streams giving account of it can be taken for granted. How are we\narticulating the phenomena we call city on top of this generic common ground?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 12:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

State-of-the-art methods to obtain them rely on\npost-selection, multi-level systems or Rydberg atomic ensembles. Recently, it\nwas shown that a strongly driven two-level system interacting with a detuned\ncavity mode can be engineered to continuously emit n-photon states. In the\npresent work, we show that spectral filtering of its emission relaxes\nconsiderably the requirements on the system parameters even to the more\naccessible bad-cavity situation, opening up the possibility of implementing\nthis protocol in a much wider landscape of different platforms. This\nimprovement is based on a key observation: in the imperfect case where only a\ncertain fraction of emission is composed of n-photon states, these have a well\ndefined energy separated from the rest of the signal, which allows to reveal\nand purify multiphoton emission just by frequency filtering. We demonstrate\nthese results by obtaining analytical expressions for relevant figures of merit\nof multiphoton emission, such as the n-photon coupling rate between cavity and\nemitter, the fraction of light emitted as n-photon states, and n-photon\nemission rates. This allows us to make a systematic study of such figures of\nmerit as a function of the system parameters and demonstrate the viability of\nthe protocol in several relevant types of cavity QED setups, where we take into\naccount the impact of their respective experimental limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

The established\nnotion of a univalent category (Ahrens, Kapulkin, Shulman) solves this by\nconsidering only truncated types, roughly corresponding to an ordinary\ncategory. This fails to capture many naturally occurring structures, stemming\nfrom the fact that the naturally occurring structures in homotopy type theory\nare not ordinary, but rather higher categories.\n  Out of the large variety of approaches to higher category theory that\nmathematicians have proposed, we believe that, for type theory, the simplicial\nstrategy is best suited. Work by Lurie and Harpaz motivates the following\ndefinition. Given the first (n+3) levels of a semisimplicial type S, we can\nequip S with three properties: first, contractibility of the types of certain\nhorn fillers; second, a completeness property; and third, a truncation\ncondition. We call this a complete semi-Segal n-type. This is very similar to\nan earlier suggestion by Schreiber.\n  The definition of a univalent (1-) category can easily be extended or\nrestricted to the definition of a univalent n-category (more precisely,\n(n,1)-category) for n in {0,1,2}, and we show that the type of complete\nsemi-Segal n-types is equivalent to the type of univalent $n$-categories in\nthese cases. Thus, we believe that the notion of a complete semi-Segal n-type\ncan be taken as the definition of a univalent n-category.\n  We provide a formalisation in the proof assistant Agda using a completely\nexplicit representation of semi-simplicial types for levels up to 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 00:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 11:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 13:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

Motivated by the\nprediction of two competing causes of progression of prostate cancer from the\nhistory of prostate-specific antigen, we conducted an in-depth simulation study\nto validate and compare the dynamic predictions derived from these two methods.\nSpecifically, we formally defined the quantity to estimate and its estimators,\nproposed techniques to assess the uncertainty around predictions and validated\nthem. We also compared the individual dynamic predictions derived from joint\nmodels and landmark models in terms of prediction error, discriminatory power,\nefficiency and robustness to model assumptions. We show that these prediction\ntools should be handled with care, in particular by properly specifying models\nand estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 10:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 12:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

By separating the closed system into a core system and\ninto reservoirs for ligands and reactants that bind to, and react with the core\nsystem, a description as an open system controlled by chemical potentials and\npossibly an external force is achieved. Entropy production and further\nthermodynamic quantities defined along a trajectory obey various fluctuation\ntheorems. For describing fluctuations in a non-equilibrium steady state in the\nlong-time limit, the concept of a rate function for large deviations from the\nmean behaviour is derived from the weight of a trajectory.

Long observations were performed in order to\nfollow the evolution of the flare on a hourly scale, covering six frequency\nranges from 1.5 GHz to 25.6 GHz. The radio emission reached a maximum of 13.2\n+/- 0.7 Jy at 7.2 GHz and 10 +/- 1 Jy at 18.6 GHz. Rapid flux variations were\nobserved at high radio frequencies at the peak of the flare, together with\nrapid evolution of the spectral index: alpha steepened from 0.3 to 0.6 within 5\nhours. This is the first time that such fast variations are observed, giving\nsupport to the evolution from optically thick to optically thin plasmons in\nexpansion moving outward from the core. Based on the Italian network (Noto,\nMedicina and SRT) and extended to the European antennas (Torun, Yebes, Onsala),\nVLBI observations were triggered at 22 GHz on five different occasions, four\ntimes prior to the giant flare, and once during its decay phase. Flux\nvariations of 2-hour duration were recorded during the first session. They\ncorrespond to a mini-flare that occurred close to the core ten days before the\nonset of the giant flare.

However, there does not exist\na convenient off-the-shelf stereo rectification approach which can be applied\ndirectly to fisheye stereo rig. One obvious drawback of existing methods is\nthat the resampling distortion (which is defined as the loss of pixels due to\nunder-sampling and the creation of new pixels due to over-sampling during\nrectification process) is severe if we want to obtain a rectification with\nepipolar line (not epipolar circle) constraint. To overcome this weakness, we\npropose a novel pixel-wise local homography technique for stereo rectification.\nFirst, we prove that there indeed exist enough degrees of freedom to apply\npixel-wise local homography for stereo rectification. Then we present a method\nto exploit these freedoms and the solution via an optimization framework.\nFinally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method have been\nverified on real fisheye lens images. The rectification results show that the\nproposed approach can effectively reduce the resampling distortion in\ncomparison with existing methods while satisfying the epipolar line constraint.\nBy employing the proposed method, dense stereo matching and 3D reconstruction\nfor fisheye lens camera become as easy as perspective lens cameras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

A well established method dealing with the structural behavior\nof periodic micro-structures is the so- called Asymptotic Expansion\nHomogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material\ndisplacement, scale bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors,\ncan be derived in order to connect the strains at the level of the\nmacro-structure with micro- structural strains. For complicated inhomogeneous\nmicro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the\nnumerical solution of a PDE problem - typically with the Finite Element Method.\nMoreover, when dealing with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material\nparameters, there is considerable uncertainty introduced in the actual stresses\nexperienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost of computing\nthe elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing\nwith the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly\ncomputationally intractable. This problem is even more pronounced when the\neffect of damage in the micro-scale is considered, where re-evaluation of the\nmicro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every occurring\ndamage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling\napproach is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale\nbehavior of the structure with the material behavior in the micro-scale,\ntherefore reducing the number of costly evaluations of corrector functions,\nallowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static\ndamage in the analysis of composite structural components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

While several works have presented\nalgorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very\nfew truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In\nthis work, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model\nproviding the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions\nand success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal\nand noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as\nthe $\\ell_0$ norm, mutual coherence, Spark and RIP to their counterparts in the\nconvolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global\nmodel. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit\nproblem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind\nbridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local\ntreatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 07:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}
