In the first part of this work we explain how the process\nof structure formation in KFT can be separated into three processes, particle\ndiffusion, the accumulation of structure due to initial momentum correlations\nand interactions relative to the inertial motion of particles. We study these\nprocesses by examining the time derivative of the non-linear density power\nspectrum in the Born approximation. We observe that diffusion and accumulation\nare delicately balanced because of the Gaussian form of the initial conditions,\nand that the net diffusion, resulting from adding these two counteracting\ncontributions, approaches the contributions from the interactions in amplitude\nover time. This hints at a kinematic relation between diffusion and\ninteractions in KFT. Indeed, in the second part, we show that the response of\nthe system to arbitrary gradient forces is directly related to the evolution of\nparticle diffusion in the form of kinematic fluctuation-dissipation relations\n(FDRs). This result is independent of the interaction potential. We show that\nthis relationship roots in a time-reversal symmetry of the underlying\ngenerating functional. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate how FDRs\noriginating from purely kinematic arguments can be used in theories far from\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 16:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 16:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

These systematics need to be isolated and\nmitigated in order for ongoing and future lensing surveys to reach their full\npotential. The IA self-calibration (SC) method was shown in previous studies to\nbe able to reduce the GI contamination by up to a factor of 10 for the 2-point\nand 3-point correlations. The SC method does not require to assume an IA model\nin its working and can extract the GI signal from the same photo-z survey\noffering the possibility to test and understand structure formation scenarios\nand their relationship to IA models. In this paper, we study the effects of the\nIA SC mitigation method on the precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter\nconstraints from future cosmic shear surveys LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We\nperform analytical and numerical calculations to estimate the loss of precision\nand the residual bias in the best fit cosmological parameters after the\nself-calibration is performed. We take into account uncertainties from\nphotometric redshifts and the galaxy bias. We find that the confidence contours\nare slightly inflated from applying the SC method itself while a significant\nincrease is due to the inclusion of the photo-z uncertainties. The bias of\ncosmological parameters is reduced from several-$\\sigma$, when IA is not\ncorrected for, to below 1-$\\sigma$ after SC is applied. These numbers are\ncomparable to those resulting from applying the method of marginalizing over IA\nmodel parameters despite the fact that the two methods operate very\ndifferently. We conclude that implementing the SC for these future cosmic-shear\nsurveys will not only allow one to efficiently mitigate the GI contaminant but\nalso help to understand their modeling and link to structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 17:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 00:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

The Koopman\noperator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics,\nand its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics\nbehave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations\nof the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work,\nwe illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is\nbeneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order\nmodels in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a\nKoopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power.\nWe show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic\ncoordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The\nresulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear\nIdentification and Control (KRONIC). It is demonstrated that these\neigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series\nexpansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the\ninfinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered\neigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be\nfaithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped\neigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to\nnearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such\nas the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant\nexamples, including 1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a\nvariety of Hamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for\nocean mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 20:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 19:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 22:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

However, with a wide\nvariety of sensitive data collected, protecting privacy of individuals,\ncommunities and organizations, is an essential factor in making data \"open\".\nThe approaches currently adopted by industry in releasing private data are\noften ad hoc and prone to a number of attacks, including re-identification\nattacks, as they do not provide adequate privacy guarantees. While differential\nprivacy has attracted significant interest from academia and industry by\nproviding rigorous and reliable privacy guarantees, the reduced utility and\ninflexibility of current differentially private algorithms for data release is\na barrier to their use in real-life. This paper aims to address these two\nchallenges. First, we propose a novel mechanism to augment the conventional\nutility of differential privacy by fusing two Laplace or geometric\ndistributions together. We derive closed form expressions for entropy, variance\nof added noise, and absolute expectation of noise for the proposed piecewise\nmixtures. Then the relevant distributions are utilised to theoretically prove\nthe privacy and accuracy guarantees of the proposed mechanisms. Second, we show\nthat our proposed mechanisms have greater flexibility, with three parameters to\nadjust, giving better utility in bounding noise, and mitigating larger\ninaccuracy, in comparison to typical one-parameter differentially private\nmechanisms. We then empirically evaluate the performance of piecewise mixture\ndistributions with extensive simulations and with a real-world dataset for both\nlinear count queries and histogram queries.

This\nwork could therefore be thought of as generalising that of Jones et al. on the\nalgebras $Q_n(\\ell)$. We also treat a fusion category $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm red}$\nintroduced by Reshitikhin, Turaev and Andersen, whose objects are the quantum\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-tilting modules with non-zero quantum dimension, and which\nhas an associative truncated tensor product (the fusion product).

These varieties have a rich combinatorial structure as can be seen\nin pioneering work of Cartwright, H\\\"abich, Sturmfels and Werner. In this\npaper, we introduce a new approach to Mustafin varieties in terms of images of\nrational maps, which were studied by Li. Applying tropical intersection theory\nand tropical convex hull computations, we use this method to give a new\ncombinatorial description of the irreducible components of the special fibers\nof Mustafin varieties. This enables connections to various topics. In\nparticular, we see that any multiview variety appears as an irreducible\ncomponent of the special fiber of some Mustafin variety. Furthermore, we use an\ninterpretation of Mustafin varieties as a moduli functor introduced by Faltings\nto relate them to certain moduli functors, called linked Grassmannians. These\nobjects are featured in limit linear series theory. The focal point of study\nregarding linked Grassmannians are so-called \\textit{simple points}. As a\ndirect consequence of the new combinatorial description of Mustafin varieties,\nwe prove that the simple points of linked Grassmannians are dense in every\nfiber. Finally, we use the connection to linked Grassmannians, to relate the\nspecial fibers of Mustafin varieties to certain local models of unitary Shimura\nvarieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 05:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 10:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

One solution to domain adaptation is\nto learn domain invariant feature representations while the learned\nrepresentations should also be discriminative in prediction. To learn such\nrepresentations, domain adaptation frameworks usually include a domain\ninvariant representation learning approach to measure and reduce the domain\ndiscrepancy, as well as a discriminator for classification. Inspired by\nWasserstein GAN, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learn domain\ninvariant feature representations, namely Wasserstein Distance Guided\nRepresentation Learning (WDGRL). WDGRL utilizes a neural network, denoted by\nthe domain critic, to estimate empirical Wasserstein distance between the\nsource and target samples and optimizes the feature extractor network to\nminimize the estimated Wasserstein distance in an adversarial manner. The\ntheoretical advantages of Wasserstein distance for domain adaptation lie in its\ngradient property and promising generalization bound.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel knowledge transfer method by treating it as a distribution\nmatching problem.

Here we show that the\ninner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets'\nformation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met\nfor a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases,\nthe orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally\nscattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a\nfraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior\nto Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with\nC-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the\ndisk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach\nsufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and\ndeliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on\nthe giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant\nplanet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 07:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 12:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

In the nasty noise model, an\nomniscient adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of both the\nunlabeled data points and their labels. This model generalizes well-studied\nnoise models, including the malicious noise model and the agnostic (adversarial\nlabel noise) model. Prior to our work, the only concept class for which\nefficient malicious learning algorithms were known was the class of\norigin-centered halfspaces.\n  Specifically, our robust learning algorithm for low-degree PTFs succeeds\nunder a number of tame distributions -- including the Gaussian distribution\nand, more generally, any log-concave distribution with (approximately) known\nlow-degree moments.

Under the hypothesis of a one-dimensional flow, this model\ntakes into account side walls friction; (ii) a multilayer discretization\nfollowing Fern\\'andez-Nieto et al. (J.

In this new numerical scheme, we propose an appropriate treatment of\nthe rheological terms through a hydrostatic reconstruction which allows this\nscheme to be well-balanced and therefore to deal with dry areas. Based on\nacademic tests, we first evaluate the influence of the width of the channel on\nthe normal profiles of the downslope velocity thanks to the multilayer approach\nthat is intrinsically able to describe changes from Bagnold to S-shaped (and\nvice versa) velocity profiles. We also check the well balance property of the\nproposed numerical scheme. We show that approximating side walls friction using\nsingle-layer models may lead to strong errors. Secondly, we compare the\nnumerical results with experimental data on granular collapses. We show that\nthe proposed scheme allows us to qualitatively reproduce the deposit in the\ncase of a rigid bed (i. e. dry area) and that the error made by replacing the\ndry area by a small layer of material may be large if this layer is not thin\nenough. The proposed model is also able to reproduce the time evolution of the\nfree surface and of the flow/no-flow interface. In addition, it reproduces the\neffect of erosion for granular flows over initially static material lying on\nthe bed. This is possible when using a variable friction coefficient $\\mu(I)$\nbut not with a constant friction coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 08:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

In this work, interactions between\ncoherent twin boundaries and $\\alpha \\to \\epsilon$ phase transition of iron are\ninvestigated using both non- equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and\nnudge elastic band method.

It transforms a system of Horn clauses,\nsuch that standard forward analysis can propagate constraints both forward, and\nbackward from a goal. Query-answer transformation is effective, but has issues\nthat we wish to address.

In SADA, the variables are partitioned into subsets, by\nfinding causal cut on the sparse causal structure over the variables. By\nrunning mainstream causation discovery algorithms as basic causal solvers on\nthe subproblems, complete causal structure can be reconstructed by combining\nthe partial results. SADA benefits from the recursive division technique, since\neach small subproblem generates more accurate result under the same number of\nsamples.

Recent experimental work has shown that inertial modes\nexist in a spherical Couette flow for $\\Omega_{i}<\\Omega_{o}$, where $\\Omega_i$\nand $\\Omega_o$ is the inner and outer sphere rotation rate. A finite number of\nparticular inertial modes has previously been found. By scanning the Rossby\nnumber from $-2.5 < Ro = (\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{o})/\\Omega_{o} < 0$ at two fixed\n$\\Omega_{o}$, we report the existence of similar inertial modes. However, the\nbehavior of the flow described here differs much from previous spherical\nCouette experiments. We show that the kinetic energy of the dominant inertial\nmode dramatically increases with decreasing Rossby number that eventually leads\nto a wave-breaking and an increase of small-scale structures at a critical\nRossby number. Such a transition in a spherical Couette flow has not been\ndescribed before. The critical Rossby number scales with the Ekman number as0\n$E^{1/5}$. Additionally, the increase of small-scale features beyond the\ntransition transfers energy to a massively enhanced mean flow around the\ntangent cylinder. In this context, we discuss an interaction between the\ndominant inertial modes with a geostrophic Rossby mode exciting secondary modes\nwhose frequencies match the triadic resonance condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 12:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

Cyanopolyynes are carbon\nchains delimited at their two extremities by an atom of hydrogen and a cyano\ngroup, so that they might be excellent reservoirs of carbon. The simplest\nmember, HC3N, is ubiquitous in the galactic interstellar medium and found also\nin external galaxies. Thus, understanding the growth of cyanopolyynes in\nregions forming stars similar to our Sun, and what affects it, is particularly\nrelevant. In the framework of the IRAM/NOEMA Large Program SOLIS (Seeds Of Life\nIn Space), we have obtained a map of two cyanopolyynes, HC3N and HC5N, in the\nprotocluster OMC2-FIR4. Because our Sun is thought to be born in a rich\ncluster, OMC2-FIR4 is one of the closest and best known representatives of the\nenvironment in which the Sun may have been born. We find a HC3N/HC5N abundance\nratio across the source in the range ~ 1 - 30, with the smallest values (< 10)\nin FIR5 and in the Eastern region of FIR4. The ratios < 10 can be reproduced by\nchemical models only if: (1) the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\\zeta$ is ~ $4\n\\times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$; (2) the gaseous elemental ratio C/O is close to\nunity; (3) O and C are largely depleted. The large $\\zeta$ is comparable to\nthat measured in FIR4 by previous works and was interpreted as due to a flux of\nenergetic (> 10 MeV) particles from embedded sources. We suggest that these\nsources could lie East of FIR4 and FIR5. A temperature gradient across FIR4,\nwith T decreasing by about 10 K, could also explain the observed change in the\nHC3N/HC5N line ratio, without the need of a cosmic ray ionisation rate\ngradient. However, even in this case, a high constant cosmic-ray ionisation\nrate (of the order of $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$) is necessary to reproduce the\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 13:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This method is used to provide evidence in the prosecution and\nsubsequent conviction of suspects. Unfortunately, there are many cases where\nlineups have led to the conviction of an innocent suspect. One of the key\nfactors affecting the incorrect identification of a suspect is the lack of\nlineup fairness, i.e. that the suspect differs significantly from all other\ncandidates. Although the process of assembling fair lineup is both highly\nimportant and time-consuming, only a handful of tools are available to simplify\nthe task. In this paper, we describe our work towards using recommender systems\nfor the photo lineup assembling task. We propose and evaluate two complementary\nmethods for item-based recommendation: one based on the visual descriptors of\nthe deep neural network, the other based on the content-based attributes of\npersons. The initial evaluation made by forensic technicians shows that\nalthough results favored visual descriptors over attribute-based similarity,\nboth approaches are functional and highly diverse in terms of recommended\nobjects. Thus, future work should involve incorporating both approaches in a\nsingle prediction method, preference learning based on the feedback from\nforensic technicians and recommendation of assembled lineups instead of single\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 13:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

This excitation transfer enhancement, mediated by environmental\nphonons, is attributed to energy relaxation toward extended, low-energy\nexcitons provided by the precise LH2 geometry with anti-parallel dipoles and\nlong-range interactions. An analysis of localization and spectral statistics is\nfollowed by dynamical measures of coherence and localization, transfer\nefficiency and superradiance.

The model predicts that an HI gas with a column density larger than\n10^20/cm^2 is able to produce Lya peak shifts larger than >300km/sec. An ISM\nwith this value of NHI would favour a large amount of scattering events,\nespecially when the medium is static, so it can explain large values of\nExt(Lya-C) and small EW(Lya). On the contrary, an ISM with a lower NHI, but\nlarge velocity outflows would lead to a Lya spatial profile peaked at the\ngalaxy center (i.e. low values of Ext(Lya-C)) and to a large EW(Lya), as we see\nin our data. Our results and their interpretation via radiative-transfer models\ntell us that it is possible to use Lya to study the properties of the HI gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 15:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Recent\ncomplexity measures such as integrated information have sought to\noperationalize this problem taking a whole-versus-parts perspective, wherein\none explicitly computes the amount of information generated by a network as a\nwhole over and above that generated by the sum of its parts during state\ntransitions. While several numerical schemes for estimating network integrated\ninformation exist, it is instructive to pursue an analytic approach that\ncomputes integrated information as a function of network weights. Our\nformulation of integrated information uses a Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the multi-variate distribution on the set of network states versus the\ncorresponding factorized distribution over its parts. Implementing stochastic\nGaussian dynamics, we perform computations for several prototypical network\ntopologies. Our findings show increased informational complexity near\ncriticality, which remains consistent across network topologies. Spectral\ndecomposition of the system's dynamics reveals how informational complexity is\ngoverned by eigenmodes of both, the network's covariance and adjacency\nmatrices. We find that as the dynamics of the system approach criticality, high\nintegrated information is exclusively driven by the eigenmode corresponding to\nthe leading eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, while sub-leading modes get\nsuppressed. The implication of this result is that it might be favorable for\ncomplex dynamical networked systems such as the human brain or communication\nsystems to operate near criticality so that efficient information integration\nmight be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 15:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

In a number of\njoint research projects our group is developing a robotic perception system\nthat perceives and models an unprepared kitchen scenario with many objects.\nSince no single sensor or measurement provides sufficient information, a\ntechnique is needed to fuse a number of uncertain estimates of the pose, i.e.\nestimates with a widely stretched probability density function ($pdf$). The\nmost frequently used approaches to describe the $pdfs$ are sample based\ndescription and multivariate normal (Gaussian) distributions. Sample based\ndescriptions in 6D can describe basically any type of $pdfs$, but they require\na large number of samples and there are no analytic formulae to fuse several\n$pdfs$. For Gaussian distributions these formulae exist, but the Gaussian\ndistributions are unimodal and don't model widely spread distributions well. In\nthis paper we present a framework for probabilistic modeling of 6D poses that\ncombines the expressive power of the sample based description with the\nconciseness and algorithmic power of the Gaussian models. As parameterization\nof the 6D poses we select the dual quaternions, i.e. any pose is represented by\ntwo quaternions. The orientation part of a pose is described by a unit\nquaternion. The translation part is described by a purely imaginary quaternion.\nA basic probability density function over the poses is constructed by selecting\na tangent point on the 3D sphere representing unit quaternions and taking the\nCartesian set product of the tangent space with the 3D space of translations.\nIn this 6D Euclidean space a 6D Gaussian distribution is defined. Projecting\nthis Gaussian back to the unit sphere and renormalizing induces a distribution\nover 6D poses, called a Projected Gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 08:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

Our\nresults show that, depending on the geometry of this boundary, two types of\nartifacts can arise: object-dependent and object-independent artifacts.\nObject-dependent artifacts are generated by singularities of the object being\nscanned and these artifacts can extend along lines.

In a\nsimilar way than the Pasternak's modelling for concrete pavements, the soil is\nmodelled by one layer, named shear layer, connected to Winkler's springs in\norder to ensure the transfer of shear stresses between the pavement structure\nand the springs. The whole four-layer system is modelled using a specific model\ndeveloped for the analysis of delamination in composite materials. It reduces\nthe problem by one dimension and gives access to regular interface stresses\nbetween layers at the edge of vertical cracks allowing the initial debonding\nanalysis. In 2D plane strain conditions, a system of twelve-second order\ndifferential equations is written analytically. This system is solved\nnumerically by the finite difference method (Newmark) computed in the free\nScilab software. The calculus tool allows analysis of the impact of material\ncharacteristics changing, loads and locations of cracks in pavements on the\ndistribution of mechanical fields. The approach with fracture mechanic concepts\nis well suited for practical use and for some subsequent numerical developments\nin 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 09:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

The proposed method exploits the combination of\nRigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and global optimization techniques (two\nevolutionary algorithms namely the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a modified form\nof the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC with memetic search phase method) are\nconsidered). As a specific example, we consider the design of beam deflectors\nusing all-dielectric nanoantennae for operation in the visible wavelength\nregion; beam deflectors can serve as building blocks for other more complicated\ndevices like metalenses. Compared to previous reports using local optimization\napproaches our approach improves device efficiency; transmission efficiency is\nespecially improved for wide deflection angle beam deflectors. The ABC method\nwith memetic search phase is also an improvement over the more commonly used GA\nas it reaches similar efficiency levels with upto 35% reduction in computation\ntime. The method described here is of interest for the rapid design of a wide\nvariety of electromagnetic metasurfaces irrespective of their operational\nwavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 10:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}
