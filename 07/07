By preventing the formation of\nhighly elongated reconnection layers, it is crucial in enabling the rapid\nenergy conversion rates that are characteristic of many astrophysical\nphenomena. Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur. The scaling laws of the plasmoid instability\nare \\emph{not} simple power laws, and depend on the Lundquist number ($S$), the\nmagnetic Prandtl number ($P_m$), the noise of the system ($\\psi_0$), the\ncharacteristic rate of current sheet evolution ($1/\\tau$), as well as the\nthinning process.

Therefore, a proper description for the\nonset of the plasmoid instability must incorporate the evolving process of the\ncurrent sheet.

The\nlatter are among the most complex of the higher structures, and are crucial for\napplications. We show that this new model of \"weakly globular n-fold\ncategories\" is suitably equivalent to the well studied model of weak\nn-categories due to Tamsamani and Simpson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 17:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

Secure\nmultiparty computation (SMC) is a viable panacea for this, allowing distributed\nparties to make computations while the parties learn nothing about their data,\nbut the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed\nsettings, it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about\nindividuals to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) can be utilized to\naddress this; however, achieving SMC with DP is not a trivial task, either. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Distributed Differentially\nPrivate (SM-DDP) protocol to achieve secure and private computations in a\nmultiparty environment. Specifically, with our protocol, we simultaneously\nachieve SMC and DP in distributed settings focusing on linear regression on\nhorizontally distributed data. That is, parties do not see each others' data\nand further, can not infer information about individuals from the final\nconstructed statistical model. Any statistical model function that allows\nindependent calculation of local statistics can be computed through our\nprotocol. The protocol implements homomorphic encryption for SMC and functional\nmechanism for DP to achieve the desired security and privacy guarantees. In\nthis work, we first introduce the theoretical foundation for the SM-DDP\nprotocol and then evaluate its efficacy and performance on two different\ndatasets. Our results show that one can achieve individual-level privacy\nthrough the proposed protocol with distributed DP, which is independently\napplied by each party in a distributed fashion. Moreover, our results also show\nthat the SM-DDP protocol incurs minimal computational overhead, is scalable,\nand provides security and privacy guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 17:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

We introduce a novel dataset of six online communities consisting\nof 158 participants focusing on improving their speaking skills. They\nvideo-record speeches for 5 prompts in 10 days and exchange comments and\nperformance-ratings with their peers. We ask (i) whether the participants'\nratings are affected by their interaction patterns with peers, and (ii) whether\nthere is any gradual buildup of speaking skills in the communities towards\nhomogeneity. To analyze the data, we employ tools from the emerging field of\nGraph Signal Processing (GSP). GSP enjoys a distinction from Social Network\nAnalysis in that the latter is concerned primarily with the connection\nstructures of graphs, while the former studies signals on top of graphs. We\nstudy the performance ratings of the participants as graph signals atop\nunderlying interaction topologies. Total variation analysis of the graph\nsignals show that the participants' rating differences decrease with time\n(slope=-0.04, p<0.01), while average ratings increase (slope=0.07,\np<0.05)--thereby gradually building up the ratings towards community-wide\nhomogeneity. We provide evidence for peer-influence through a prediction\nformulation.

This equivalence in aging of glasses formed under different\npressures indicates that local packing is the dominant variable governing the\nglassy dynamics.

These problems are\nchallenging and most planning algorithms instead solve simplified\napproximations. Popular approximations include graphs and random samples, as\nrespectively used by informed graph-based searches and anytime sampling-based\nplanners. Informed graph-based searches, such as A*, traditionally use\nheuristics to search a priori graphs in order of potential solution quality.\nThis makes their search efficient but leaves their performance dependent on the\nchosen approximation. If its resolution is too low then they may not find a\n(suitable) solution but if it is too high then they may take a prohibitively\nlong time to do so. Anytime sampling-based planners, such as RRT*,\ntraditionally use random sampling to approximate the problem domain\nincrementally. This allows them to increase resolution until a suitable\nsolution is found but makes their search dependent on the order of\napproximation. Arbitrary sequences of random samples approximate the problem\ndomain in every direction simultaneously and but may be prohibitively\ninefficient at containing a solution. This paper unifies and extends these two\napproaches to develop Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed, anytime\nsampling-based planner. BIT* solves continuous path planning problems\nefficiently by using sampling and heuristics to alternately approximate and\nsearch the problem domain. Its search is ordered by potential solution quality,\nas in A*, and its approximation improves indefinitely with additional\ncomputational time, as in RRT*. It is shown analytically to be almost-surely\nasymptotically optimal and experimentally to outperform existing sampling-based\nplanners, especially on high-dimensional planning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 17:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 22:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 07:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

The\nconstraints are characterized by the mean relation, $\\left\\langle\n\\ln{\\lambda}\\right\\rangle(M)=A+B\\ln(M/M_{\\rm pivot})$, with\n$A=3.207^{+0.044}_{-0.046}$ and $B=0.993^{+0.041}_{-0.055}$ (68\\%~CL), where\nthe pivot mass scale $M_{\\rm pivot}=3\\times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_\\odot$, and the\nscatter $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{\\ln\\lambda}|M}=\\sigma_0+q\\ln(M/M_{\\rm pivot})$ with\n$\\sigma_0=0.456^{+0.047}_{-0.039}$ and $q=-0.169^{+0.035}_{-0.026}$. We find\nthat a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest richness bins\n($20\\le \\lambda \\lesssim 30$) in order to reproduce the measurements. Without\nsuch a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing profiles tends to\noverestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination\nof intrinsically low-richness clusters due to the projection effects. Such a\nlow-mass halo contribution is significantly reduced when applying our method to\nthe sample of $30\\le \\lambda \\le 100$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 03:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 03:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

We demonstrate how to perform domain adaptation when no such\ntask-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose\nzero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from\ntask-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation\nwhich is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the\ntarget-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest\nsolution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained\nwith the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and\ntarget representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN\nRGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in\nclassification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training\ndata. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene\nclassification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations\nwith task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is\nthe first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no\ntask-relevant target-domain data.

These stars have at least one stellar\ncompanion within 2\", and the planets have measured masses and radii, allowing\nan estimate of their bulk density. The transit dilution by the companion star\nrequires the planet radii to be revised upward, even if the planet orbits the\nprimary star; as a consequence, the planetary bulk density decreases. We find\nthat, if planets orbited a faint companion star, they would be more\nvolatile-rich, and in several cases their densities would become\nunrealistically low, requiring large, inflated atmospheres or unusually large\nmass fractions in a H/He envelope. In addition, for planets detected in radial\nvelocity data, the primary star has to be the host. We can exclude 14 planets\nfrom orbiting the companion star; the remaining 15 planets in seven planetary\nsystems could orbit either the primary or the secondary star, and for five of\nthese planets the decrease in density would be substantial even if they orbited\nthe primary, since the companion is of almost equal brightness as the primary.\nSubstantial follow-up work is required in order to accurately determine the\nradii of transiting planets. Of particular interest are small, rocky planets\nthat may be habitable; a lower mean density might imply a more volatile-rich\ncomposition. Reliable radii, masses, and thus bulk densities will allow us to\nidentify which small planets are truly Earth-like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 19:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In addition, they require large amount of\ntraining data to generate accurate answers. In this paper, we introduce the\nLong-Term Memory Network (LTMN), which incorporates both an external memory\nmodule and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to comprehend the input data\nand generate multi-word answers. The LTMN model can be trained end-to-end using\nback-propagation and requires minimal supervision.

The study of random hypergraph coloring\ngives us access to a case where both the size $q$ of the domain of the\nvariables and the arity $K$ of the constraints can be varied at will. Our work\nprovides explicit values and predictions for a number of phase transitions that\nwere discovered in other constraint satisfaction problems but never evaluated\nbefore in hypergraph coloring.

These algorithms are typically blocking, so they require fair\nscheduling. But GPU programming models (e.g.\\ OpenCL) do not mandate fair\nscheduling, and GPU schedulers are unfair in practice. Current approaches avoid\nthis issue by exploiting scheduling quirks of today's GPUs in a manner that\ndoes not allow the GPU to be shared with other workloads (such as graphics\nrendering tasks). We propose cooperative kernels, an extension to the\ntraditional GPU programming model geared towards writing blocking algorithms.\nWorkgroups of a cooperative kernel are fairly scheduled, and multitasking is\nsupported via a small set of language extensions through which the kernel and\nscheduler cooperate. We describe a prototype implementation of a cooperative\nkernel framework implemented in OpenCL 2.0 and evaluate our approach by porting\na set of blocking GPU applications to cooperative kernels and examining their\nperformance under multitasking. Our prototype exploits no vendor-specific\nhardware, driver or compiler support, thus our results provide a lower-bound on\nthe efficiency with which cooperative kernels can be implemented in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 22:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

Extreme optical confinement of plasmonics can localize\nstrong cross-domain interactions into nanometer-scale volumes, smaller than\nmany nanosystem's thermal and mechanical eigenmodes, opening new regimes for\nengineering reconfigurable, dynamic nanosystems. Here, we present a nanosystem\nbased on an electrically actuated, mechanically coupled gap-plasmon\nmetamolecule resonator. Integrated electrical actuation reveals distinct\ndispersive and reactive optomechanical coupling regimes of the metamolecules,\nand enables both broad spectral tuning of individual plasmonic resonances and\nselective optical transduction of nanomechanical modes. Strong thermomechanical\nbackaction from a single point-like metamolecule yields optically driven\nself-oscillation, and we show that this metamolecule phonon laser can be\ninjection-locked to enhance weak mechanical stimulii. This multi-domain\nnanosystem advances nanomechanical sensing and optical modulation, opens new\navenues for studying nanoscale nonlinear optomechanics, and may serve as a\nbuilding block for future reconfigurable \"smart\" metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 23:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

This paper exploits this\nunique feature to design an efficient repair mechanism, called broadcast\nrepair, for wireless distributed storage systems in the presence of\nmultiple-node failures. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission,\nwe advocate a new measure on repair performance called repair-transmission\nbandwidth. In contrast to repair bandwidth, which measures the average number\nof packets downloaded by a newcomer to replace a failed node,\nrepair-transmission bandwidth measures the average number of packets\ntransmitted by helper nodes per failed node. A fundamental study on the storage\ncapacity of wireless distributed storage systems with broadcast repair is\nconducted by modeling the storage system as a multicast network and analyzing\nthe minimum cut of the corresponding information flow graph. The fundamental\ntradeoff between storage efficiency and repair-transmission bandwidth is also\nobtained for functional repair. The performance of broadcast repair is compared\nboth analytically and numerically with that of cooperative repair, the basic\nrepair method for wired distributed storage systems with multiple-node\nfailures. While cooperative repair is based on the idea of allowing newcomers\nto exchange packets, broadcast repair is based on the idea of allowing a helper\nto broadcast packets to all newcomers simultaneously. We show that broadcast\nrepair outperforms cooperative repair, offering a better tradeoff between\nstorage efficiency and repair-transmission bandwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 23:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

This definition, mainly owing to the dependence\nassumption involved, is not justified in many practical problems and thus\nlimits the application of those robust approaches. It also results in a\nlimitation of the theory of robust analysis. In this paper, we propose a new\nrobust process regression model enabling independent random errors.

Several\nbiases have been identified in the Galaxy Zoo data. Here we report on a newly\ndiscovered selection effect: astronomers interested in studying spiral galaxies\nmay select a set of spiral galaxies based upon a threshold in spirality (the\nfraction of Galaxy Zoo humans who report seeing spiral structure). SpArcFiRe is\nan automated tool that decomposes a spiral galaxy into its constituent spiral\narms, providing objective, quantitative data on their structure. SpArcFiRe\nmeasures the pitch angle of spiral arms. We have observed that when selecting a\nset of spiral galaxies based on a threshold on spirality, the pitch angle of\nspiral arms appear increase with redshift. We hypothesize that this is a\nselection effect: tightly-wound spiral arms become less visible as images\ndegrade with increasing redshift, leading to fewer such galaxies being included\nin the sample at higher redshifts. We corroborate this hypothesis by\nartificially degrading images of nearby galaxies, then using a machine learning\nalgorithm trained on Galaxy Zoo data to provide a spirality for each\nartificially degraded image. It correctly predicts that spirality decreases as\nimage quality degrades. Thus, the mean pitch angle of those galaxies remaining\nabove the spirality threshold is higher than those eliminated by the selection\neffect. This demonstrates that users who select samples of galaxies using a\nthreshold of Galaxy Zoo votes must carefully consider the possibility of\nselection effects on morphological measures, even if the measure itself is\nbelieved to be objective and unbiased. Finally, we also perform an empirical\nsensitivity analysis to demonstrate that SpArcFiRe's output changes in a smooth\nand predictable fashion to changes in its internal algorithmic parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 02:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The most important\nmotivation for QBism, enthusiastically stated on the book's cover, is that\nQBism provides \"a way past quantum theory's paradoxes and puzzles\" such that\nmuch of the weirdness associated with quantum theory \"dissolves under the lens\nof QBism\".\n  Could a non-technical book that almost fits in your pocket really succeed in\nresolving the notorious paradoxes of quantum theory? I believe the answer is:\nnot in this case. There are three primary reasons. Firstly, the argument that\nQBism solves quantum paradoxes is not convincing. Secondly, it proves difficult\nto pin down exactly what QBism says. Thirdly, as a scientific theory QBism\nseems explanatorily inert, which is maybe why the topic of scientific\nexplanation is not broached. Sections 2-4 below discuss each of these problems\nin turn.

Based on the random matrix theory (RMT), we propose uncertainty\ncharacterization schemes in which the uncertainty is modeled at the macro\n(system) level. This is different from the traditional approaches that model\nthe uncertainty in the parametric space of micro (state) level. We show that\nperturbing the system matrices rather than the state of the system provides\nunique advantages especially for robotic manipulators. First, it requires only\nlimited statistical information that becomes effective when dealing with\ncomplex systems where detailed information on their variability is not\navailable. Second, the RMT-based models are aware of the system state and\nconfiguration that are significant factors affecting the level of uncertainty\nin system behavior. In this study, in addition to the motion uncertainty\nanalysis that was first proposed in our earlier work, we also develop an\nRMT-based model for the quantification of the static wrench uncertainty in\nmulti-agent cooperative systems. This model is aimed to be an alternative to\nthe elaborate parametric formulation when only rough bounds are available on\nthe system parameters. We discuss that how RMT-based model becomes advantageous\nwhen the complexity of the system increases. We perform experimental studies on\na KUKA youBot arm to demonstrate the superiority of the RMT-based motion\nuncertainty models. We show that how these models outperform the traditional\nmodels built upon Gaussianity assumption in capturing real-system uncertainty\nand providing accurate bounds on the state estimation errors. In addition, to\nexperimentally support our wrench uncertainty quantification model, we study\nthe behavior of a cooperative system of mobile robots. It is shown that one can\nrely on less demanding RMT-based formulation and yet meets the acceptable\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 04:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

The framework is largely inspired by the control of a\nbiological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the controller may only\nchange the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem\nfor such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of\nthe controller , the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a\ntarget state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic\nfinite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is\nencoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and\nthe second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game\nwith m agents is called the m-population game. This gives rise to a\nparameterized control problem (where control refers to 2 player games), namely\nthe population control problem: can Controller control the m-population game\nfor all $m $\\in$ N$ whatever Agents does? In this paper, we prove that the\npopulation control problem is decidable, and it is a EXPTIME-complete problem.\nAs far as we know, this is one of the first results on parameterized control.\nOur algorithm, not based on cutoff techniques, produces winning strategies\nwhich are symbolic, that is, they do not need to count precisely how the\npopulation is spread between states.

HD166734 is an eccentric eclipsing binary system composed of two\nsupergiant O-type stars, orbiting with a 34.5-day period.

This system provides a chance to study\nthe individual parameters of two supergiant massive stars and to derive their\nreal masses. Methods. An intensive monitoring was dedicated to HD166734.We\nanalyzed mid- and high-resolution optical spectra to constrain the orbital\nparameters of this system. We also studied its light curve for the first time,\nobtained in the VRI filters. Finally, we disentangled the spectra of the two\nstars and modeled them with the CMFGEN atmosphere code in order to determine\nthe individual physical parameters. Results. HD166734 is a O7.5If+O9I(f)\nbinary. We confirm its orbital period but we revise the other orbital\nparameters. In comparison to what we found in the literature, the system is\nmore eccentric and, now, the hottest and the most luminous component is also\nthe most massive one.

Under\ncertain rational assumption, i.e. in the bi-component fluid mixture, the mass\nof the Brownian particle $M$ is far greater than that of the bath molecule $m$,\nwe can adopt the weakly couple limit. Only considering the first-order\napproximation of the mass ratio $m/M$, we obtain a linear motion equation in\nthe reference frame of the observer as a Brownian particle. Based on this\nequivalent equation, we get the Hamiltonian at equilibrium. Finally, using\ncanonical ensemble method, we define a new entropy that is similar to the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy.

In this paper we extend previous studies and use a formalism\nthat combines particle reacceleration by turbulence and the generation of\nsecondary particles in the intracluster medium to constrain relativistic\nprotons and their role for the origin of the radio halo. We conclude that a\npure hadronic origin of the radio halo is clearly disfavoured as it would\nrequire magnetic fields that are too strong. For instance $B_0 > 21 \\mu$G is\nfound in the cluster center assuming that the magnetic energy density scales\nwith thermal density, to be compared with $B_0 \\sim 4-5 \\mu$G as inferred from\nRotation Measures (RM) under the same assumption. However secondary particles\ncan still generate the observed radio emission if they are reaccelerated. For\nthe first time the deep gamma-ray limits allow us to derive meaningful\nconstraints if the halo is generated during phases of reacceleration of\nrelativistic protons and their secondaries by cluster-scale turbulence. In this\npaper we explore a relevant range of parameter-space of reacceleration models.\nWithin this parameter space a fraction of model configurations is already ruled\nout by current gamma-ray limits, including the cases that assume weak magnetic\nfields in the cluster core, $B \\leq 2-3 \\mu$G. Interestingly, we also find that\nthe flux predicted by a large fraction of model configurations that assume a\nmagnetic field consistent with RM is not far from the limits. This suggests\nthat a detection of gamma rays from the cluster might be possible in the near\nfuture, provided that the electrons generating the radio halo are secondaries\nreaccelerated and the magnetic field in the cluster is consistent with that\ninferred from RM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 09:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In NPLs with lateral size $L \\gtrsim 20$ nm the exciton behavior\nis essentially that in a quantum well, with superradiance leading to exciton\nlifetimes of 1 ps or less, only limited by the NPL area.

In the latter, charge separation is\nalso inefficient if band alignment is quasi-type-II (e.g. in CdSe/CdS), because\nelectron-hole interaction drives both carriers into the core.

Many approaches exist today to detect\ncommunities in static graphs. However, many networks are intrinsically\ndynamical, and need a dynamic mesoscale description, as interpreting them as\nstatic networks would cause loss of important information. For example, dynamic\nprocesses such as the emergence of new scientific disciplines, their fusion,\nsplit or death need a mesoscopic description of the evolving network of\nscientific articles. There are two straightforward approaches to describe an\nevolving network using methods developed for static networks.\n  The first finds the community structure of the aggregated network; however,\nthis approach discards most temporal information, and may lead to inappropriate\ndescriptions, as very different dynamic data can give rise to the identical\nstatic graphs.\n  The opposite approach closely follows the evolutions and builds networks for\nsuccessive time slices by selecting the relevant nodes and edges, the\nmesoscopic structure of each of these slices is found independently and the\nstructures are connected to obtain a temporal description. By using an optimal\nstructural description at each time slice, this method avoids the inertia of\nthe aggregated approach. The inherent fuzziness of the communities leads to\nnoise and artifacts.\n  Here, we present an approach that distinguishes real trends and noise in the\nmesoscopic description of data using the continuity of social evolutions. To be\nfollow the dynamics, we compute partitions for each time slice, but to avoid\ntransients generated by noise, we modify the community description at time t\nusing the structures found at times t-1 and t+1.

This makes the analysis very\ndifficult in practice and represents the major bottleneck for the applicability\nof minimization techniques based, for instance, on lumpability. In this paper\nwe present syntactic Markovian bisimulation (SMB), a notion of bisimulation\ndeveloped in the Larsen-Skou style of probabilistic bisimulation, defined over\nthe structure of a CRN rather than over its underlying CTMC. SMB identifies a\nlumpable partition of the CTMC state space a priori, in the sense that it is an\nequivalence relation over species implying that two CTMC states are lumpable\nwhen they are invariant with respect to the total population of species within\nthe same equivalence class. We develop an efficient partition-refinement\nalgorithm which computes the largest SMB of a CRN in polynomial time in the\nnumber of species and reactions. We also provide an algorithm for obtaining a\nquotient network from an SMB that induces the lumped CTMC directly, thus\navoiding the generation of the state space of the original CRN altogether. In\npractice, we show that SMB allows significant reductions in a number of models\nfrom the literature. Finally, we study SMB with respect to the deterministic\nsemantics of CRNs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where each\nequation gives the time-course evolution of the concentration of a species. SMB\nimplies forward CRN bisimulation, a recently developed behavioral notion of\nequivalence for the ODE semantics, in an analogous sense: it yields a smaller\nODE system that keeps track of the sums of the solutions for equivalent\nspecies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 11:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

With increasing array size, it is increasingly important to control\nstray radiation inside the detector chips themselves, the surface wave. We\ndemonstrate this effect with focal plane arrays of 880 lens-antenna coupled\nMicrowave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). Presented here are near field\nmeasurements of the MKID optical response versus the position on the array of a\nreimaged optical source. We demonstrate that the optical response of a detector\nin these arrays saturates off-pixel at the $\\sim-30$ dB level compared to the\npeak pixel response. The result is that the power detected from a point source\nat the pixel position is almost identical to the stray response integrated over\nthe chip area. With such a contribution, it would be impossible to measure\nextended sources, while the point source sensitivity is degraded due to an\nincrease of the stray loading. However, we show that by incorporating an\non-chip stray light absorber, the surface wave contribution is reduced by a\nfactor $>$10. With the on-chip stray light absorber the point source response\nis close to simulations down to the $\\sim-35$ dB level, the simulation based on\nan ideal Gaussian illumination of the optics. In addition, as a crosscheck we\nshow that the extended source response of a single pixel in the array with the\nabsorbing grid is in agreement with the integral of the point source\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 12:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

Specifically, the\ndatabase comprises $K$ files, which are replicatively stored among $N$ servers.\nA user wants to retrieve one file from the database by communicating with the\n$N$ servers, without revealing the identity of the desired file to any server.\nFurthermore, the user shall learn nothing about the other $K-1$ files. Any $T$\nout of $N$ servers may collude, that is, they may communicate their\ninteractions with the user to guess the identity of the requested file. An\nadversary in the system can tap in on or even try to corrupt the communication.\nThree types of adversaries are considered: a Byzantine adversary who can\noverwrite the transmission of any $B$ servers to the user; a passive\neavesdropper who can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any\n$E$ servers; and a combination of both -- an adversary who can tap in on a set\nof any $E$ nodes, and overwrite the transmission of a set of any $B$ nodes. The\nproblems of SPIR with colluding servers and the three types of adversaries are\nnamed T-BSPIR, T-ESPIR and T-BESPIR respectively.

In sponsored search, the click-through rate\nestimates the probability that a displayed advertisement is clicked by a user\nafter she submits a query to the search engine. Commercial search engines\ntypically rely on machine learning models trained with a large number of\nfeatures to make such predictions. This is inevitably requires a lot of\nengineering efforts to define, compute, and select the appropriate features. In\nthis paper, we propose two novel approaches (one working at character level and\nthe other working at word level) that use deep convolutional neural networks to\npredict the click-through rate of a query-advertisement pair.

Often this process becomes a bottleneck in\nalgorithms requiring iterative evaluation of ME. Here we propose a method for\napproximating ME of a single operator with a bounded coefficient into a product\nof certain discrete operators. This approach, which we refer to as Rapid\nExponentiation using Discrete Operators (REDO), is particularly efficient for\niterating ME over large numbers. We describe REDO in the context of a quantum\nsystem with a constant as well as a time-dependent Hamiltonian, although in\nprinciple, it can be adapted in a more general setting. As concrete examples,\nwe choose two applications. First, we incorporate REDO in optimal quantum\ncontrol algorithms and report a speed-up of several folds over a wide range of\nsystem size.

To explore the possible chemical signature of planet formation in the\nbinary system HAT-P-4, by studying abundance vs condensation temperature Tc\ntrends. The star HAT-P-4 hosts a planet detected by transits while its stellar\ncompanion does not have any detected planet. We also study the Lithium content,\nwhich could shed light on the problem of Li depletion in exoplanet host stars.\nConclusions. The exoplanet host star HAT-P-4 is found to be ~0.1 dex more metal\nrich than its companion, which is one of the highest differences in metallicity\nobserved in similar systems. This could have important implications for\nchemical tagging studies, disentangling groups of stars with a common origin.\nWe rule out a possible peculiar composition for each star as lambda Boo, delta\nScuti or a Blue Straggler. The star HAT-P-4 is enhanced in refractory elements\nrelative to volatile when compared to its stellar companion. Notably, the\nLithium abundance in HAT-P-4 is greater than in its companion by ~0.3 dex,\nwhich is contrary to the model that explains the Lithium depletion by the\npresence of planets. We propose a scenario where, at the time of planet\nformation, the star HAT-P-4 locked the inner refractory material in\nplanetesimals and rocky planets, and formed the outer gas giant planet at a\ngreater distance. The refractories were then accreted onto the star, possibly\ndue to the migration of the giant planet. This explains the higher metallicity,\nthe higher Lithium content, and the negative Tc trend detected. A similar\nscenario was recently proposed for the solar twin star HIP 68468, which is in\nsome aspects similar to HAT-P-4. We estimate a mass of at least Mrock ~ 10\nMearth locked in refractory material in order to reproduce the observed Tc\ntrends and metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 13:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

When the\nprobability of non-response, conditional on the available covariates and the\nobserved responses, still depends on unobserved outcomes, the dropout mechanism\nis said to be non ignorable. A common objective is to build a reliable\nassociation structure to account for dependence between the longitudinal and\nthe dropout processes. Starting from the existing literature, we introduce a\nrandom coefficient based dropout model where the association between outcomes\nis modeled through discrete latent effects. These effects are outcome-specific\nand account for heterogeneity in the univariate profiles. Dependence between\nprofiles is introduced by using a bi-dimensional representation for the\ncorresponding distribution. In this way, we define a flexible latent class\nstructure which allows to efficiently describe both dependence within the two\nmargins of interest and dependence between them. By using this representation\nwe show that, unlike standard (unidimensional) finite mixture models, the non\nignorable dropout model properly nests its ignorable counterpart. We detail the\nproposed modeling approach by analyzing data from a longitudinal study on the\ndynamics of cognitive functioning in the elderly. Further, the effects of\nassumptions about non ignorability of the dropout process on model parameter\nestimates are (locally) investigated using the index of (local) sensitivity to\nnon-ignorability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 13:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

We found that a signal in the portion of IBEX data\nidentified as due to the Warm Breeze does not arise when a homogeneous plasma\nflow in front of the heliopause is assumed, but it appears immediately when any\nreasonable disturbance in its flow due to the presence of the heliosphere is\nassumed.

We conclude that direct-sampling observations of neutral\nHe atoms at 1~AU from the Sun are a sensitive tool for investigating the flow\nof interstellar matter in the outer heliosheath, that the Warm Breeze is indeed\nthe secondary population of interstellar helium, as it was hypothesized\nearlier, and that the WB signal is consistent with the heliosphere distorted\nfrom axial symmetry by the interstellar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 14:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The tuning\nis made by varying the intensity of the light that, because of the\nnonlinearity, affects the dynamics of the phase fluctuations.

The bond structure of pristine PDMS\nfilms and plasma treated PDMS films differ in a particular region of silicate\nbonds. We have studied the surface physical properties of pristine PDMS films\nand plasma treated PDMS films through optical technique. It is already known\nthat plasma treated PDMS films forms very thin SiO2 layer on its surface. Due\nto difference in coefficient of thermal expansion of the surface SiO2 and the\nremaining bulk layer, the SiO2 layer develops cracks. These formations are\nexplored to characterize PDMS surface by observing intensity of scattered light\nwhile the films are stretched. Pristine PDMS films do not show such optical\nscattering. Further the intensity measurements were repeated over period of\ntime to monitor surface properties with time. It was observed that plasma\ntreated PDMS film; the scattered light intensity is linearly dependent on the\napplied force for stretching. After a substantial time, scattering intensity is\nreduced to the value which is almost equal to that of pristine PDMS surface. It\nis proposed that basic light scattering through plasma treated PDMS occurs due\nto the decrease in the width of the cracks when the PDMS film is stretched. The\nchange in the scattering property of plasma treated PDMS surface over time\ncould be attributed to healing of cracks by the migration of polymer chain\nmolecules from the bulk to the surface. It is also reported that with reference\nto various bonds present on surface plasma treated PDMS surface regains its\noriginal properties as that of pristine PDMS with time. Therefore the optical\ntechnique could be employed to study surface characteristics of PDMS surface as\nan alternative approach to conventional spectroscopic techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 15:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

We are motivated by the\nobservation that in a cellular network, a relay node placed at the cell edge\nobserves a combination of intended signal and inter-cell interference that is\ncorrelated with the received signal at a nearby destination, so a relaying link\ncan effectively allow the antennas at the relay and at the destination to be\npooled together for both signal enhancement and interference mitigation. We\nmodel this scenario by a MIMO Gaussian relay channel with a digital\nrelay-to-destination link of finite capacity, and with correlated noise across\nthe relay and destination antennas. Assuming a compress-and-forward strategy\nwith Gaussian input distribution and quantization noise, we propose a\ncoordinate ascent algorithm for obtaining a stationary point of the non-convex\njoint optimization of the transmit and quantization covariance matrices. For\nfixed input distribution, the globally optimum quantization noise covariance\nmatrix can be found in closed-form using a transformation of the relay's\nobservation that simultaneously diagonalizes two conditional covariance\nmatrices by congruence. For fixed quantization, the globally optimum transmit\ncovariance matrix can be found via convex optimization. This paper further\nshows that such an optimized achievable rate is within a constant additive gap\nof the MIMO relay channel capacity. The optimal structure of the quantization\nnoise covariance enables a characterization of the slope of the achievable rate\nas a function of the relay-to-destination link capacity. Moreover, this paper\nshows that the improvement in spatial degrees of freedom by MIMO relaying in\nthe presence of noise correlation is related to the aforementioned slope via a\nconnection to the deterministic relay channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 15:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 02:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

When the sensors are\ndensely deployed, observations at adjacent sensors are highly correlated while\nthose corresponding to distant sensors are less correlated. Thus, the\ncovariance matrix of the concatenated observation vector of all the sensors at\nany given time can be sparse where the sparse structure depends on the network\ntopology and the correlation model. Exploiting the sparsity structure of the\ncovariance matrix, we develop a robust nonparametric detector to detect the\npresence of the random event using a compressed version of the data collected\nat the distributed nodes. We employ the multiple access channel (MAC) model\nwith distributed random projections for sensors to transmit observations so\nthat a compressed version of the observations is available at the fusion\ncenter. Detection is performed by constructing a decision statistic based on\nthe covariance information of uncompressed data which is estimated using\ncompressed data. The proposed approach does not require any knowledge of the\nnoise parameter to set the threshold, and is also robust when the distributed\nrandom projection matrices become sparse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 02:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The inherent degree of large scale coordination emerges as\na global property, from the intricate sea of microscopic interactions. The\nbrain, with its structural and functional architecture, represents an\nemblematic example of hierarchic self-organization: elementary units, the\nneurons, act much like instruments of an orchestra, which combine diverse\ntimbres to create harmonious symphonies. Neurons come indeed in different\ntypes, varying in shapes, connections and electrical properties. They all team\nup to process external stimuli from a number of sources and integrate the\ninformation to yield, from neurons to mind, different cognitive faculties.\nIdentifying the coarse grained modules that exert, from bottom to up, pivotal\nneuronal functions constitutes a goal of paramount importance. On the other\nhand, the brain and its unraveled secrets could inspire novel biomimetics\ntechnologies to adaptively handle complex problems. Here, we investigate the\nintertwined stochastic dynamics of two populations of excitatory and inhibitory\nunits, arranged in a directed lattice. The endogenous noise seeds a coherent\namplification across the chain generating giant oscillations with tunable\nfrequencies, a process that the brain could exploit to enhance, and eventually\nencode, different signals. The system works as an out-equilibrium thermal\ndevice under stationary operating conditions, the associated entropy production\nrate being analytically quantified. The same scheme could be invoked to design\na novel family of manmade detectors capable of reacting to spatially\ndistributed low intensity alerts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 08:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Bilayer shaped actuators, consisting on a\nhumidity-sensitive active nanostructured silica film deposited on a polymeric\nsubstrate (Kapton) were demonstrated as an original mean to convert water\nmolecule adsorption and capillary condensation in useable mechanical work.\nReversible silica surface energy modifications by water adsorption and the\nenergy produced by the rigid silica film contraction, induced by water\ncapillary condensation in mesopores, were finely controlled and used as the\nenergy sources. The influence of the film nanostructure (microporosity,\nmesoporosity) and thickness, and of the polymeric support thickness, on the\nactuation force, on the movement speed, and on the amplitude of displacement\nare clearly evidenced and discussed.
