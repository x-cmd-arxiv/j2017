In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core, DDX3X contains\nN- and C-terminal domains. Here, we investigate the substrate and protein\nrequirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80\nresidues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that\nfor an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a\nsingle-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA\nstructural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting\nonly of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded\nRNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a\nsingle-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X\nto RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the\nsingle-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer\nformation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity. Interestingly,\nthe dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the protein concentration suggests that the\nDDX3X trimer hydrolyzes only two molecules of ATP. Lastly, a DNA substrate that\ncontains single-stranded-double-stranded regions does not support the ATPase\nactivity of DDX3X.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The best known rapid mixing results for general graphs are in\nterms of the maximum degree $\\Delta$ of the input graph $G$ and hold when\n$k>11\\Delta/6$ for all $G$. Improved results hold when $k>\\alpha\\Delta$ for\ngraphs with girth $\\geq 5$ and $\\Delta$ sufficiently large where $\\alpha\\approx\n1.7632\\ldots$ is the root of $\\alpha=\\exp(1/\\alpha)$; further improvements on\nthe constant $\\alpha$ hold with stronger girth and maximum degree assumptions.\nFor sparse random graphs the maximum degree is a function of $n$ and the goal\nis to obtain results in terms of the expected degree $d$. The following rapid\nmixing results for $G(n,d/n)$ hold with high probability over the choice of the\nrandom graph for sufficiently large constant~$d$. Mossel and Sly (2009) proved\nrapid mixing for constant $k$, and Efthymiou (2014) improved this to $k$ linear\nin~$d$. The condition was improved to $k>3d$ by Yin and Zhang (2016) using\nnon-MCMC methods. Here we prove rapid mixing when $k>\\alpha d$ where\n$\\alpha\\approx 1.7632\\ldots$ is the same constant as above. Moreover we obtain\n$O(n^{3})$ mixing time of the Glauber dynamics, while in previous rapid mixing\nresults the exponent was an increasing function in $d$. As in previous results\nfor random graphs our proof analyzes an appropriately defined block dynamics to\n\"hide\" high-degree vertices. One new aspect in our improved approach is\nutilizing so-called local uniformity properties for the analysis of block\ndynamics. To analyze the \"burn-in\" phase we prove a concentration inequality\nfor the number of disagreements propagating in large blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-13"}

The forcing acts at a wavenumber $k_f$ such that $k_fL=4$,\nwhere $2\\pi L$ is the size of the domain. Different flow behaviours were\nobtained as the parameters are varied. Above a critical rotation rate the flow\nbecomes quasi two dimensional and transfers energy to the largest scales of the\nsystem forming large coherent structures known as condensates. We examine the\nbehaviour of these condensates and their scaling properties close and away from\nthis critical rotation rate. Close to the the critical rotation rate the system\ntransitions super-critically to the condensate state displaying a bimodal\nbehaviour oscillating randomly between an incoherent-turbulent state and a\ncondensate state. Away from the critical rotation rate, it is shown that two\ndistinct mechanisms can saturate the growth of the large scale energy. The\nfirst mechanism is due to viscous forces and is similar to the saturation\nmechanism observed for the inverse cascade in two-dimensional flows.

Deep neural networks trained on object recognition datasets consist\nof multiple convolutional layers. These layers encode target appearance with\ndifferent levels of abstraction. For example, the outputs of the last\nconvolutional layers encode the semantic information of targets and such\nrepresentations are invariant to significant appearance variations. However,\ntheir spatial resolutions are too coarse to precisely localize the target. In\ncontrast, features from earlier convolutional layers provide more precise\nlocalization but are less invariant to appearance changes. We interpret the\nhierarchical features of convolutional layers as a nonlinear counterpart of an\nimage pyramid representation and explicitly exploit these multiple levels of\nabstraction to represent target objects. Specifically, we learn adaptive\ncorrelation filters on the outputs from each convolutional layer to encode the\ntarget appearance. We infer the maximum response of each layer to locate\ntargets in a coarse-to-fine manner. To further handle the issues with scale\nestimation and re-detecting target objects from tracking failures caused by\nheavy occlusion or out-of-the-view movement, we conservatively learn another\ncorrelation filter, that maintains a long-term memory of target appearance, as\na discriminative classifier.

A consistent picture emerges: the inner halo is well\nreproduced by a smooth distribution of stars settled on triaxial ellipsoids.\nThe minor axis is perpendicular to the Milky Ways disc, while the major axis is\nmisaligned by $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ from the Galactic Y axis. The elongation along\nthe major axis is mild ($\\text{p}=1.27$), and the vertical flattening is shown\nto evolve from a squashed state with $\\text{q}\\approx0.57$ in the centre to a\nmore spherical $\\text{q}\\approx0.75$ at the outer edge of our dataset. The\ndensity slope is well approximated by a single power-law with exponent\n$\\alpha=-2.96$. Within the range probed, we see no significant evidence for a\nchange of the radial density slope, out of the plane tilt or an offset of the\nhalo with respect to the Galaxy's centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 17:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

We rely\non smooth particle approximations, and consider four methods for estimating the\nfractional diffusion term. The first method is based on direct differentiation\nof the particle representation, it follows the Riesz definition of the\nfractional derivative and results in a non-conservative scheme. The other three\nmethods follow the particle strength exchange (PSE) methodology and are by\nconstruction conservative, in the sense that the total particle strength is\ntime invariant. The first PSE algorithm is based on using direct\ndifferentiation to estimate the fractional diffusion flux, and exploiting the\nresulting estimates in an integral representation of the divergence operator.\nMeanwhile, the second one relies on the regularized Riesz representation of the\nfractional diffusion term to derive a suitable interaction formula acting\ndirectly on the particle representation of the diffusing field. A third PSE\nconstruction is considered that exploits the Green's function of the fractional\ndiffusion equation. The performance of all four approaches is assessed for the\ncase of a one-dimensional diffusion equation with constant diffusivity. This\nenables us to take advantage of known analytical solutions, and consequently\nconduct a detailed analysis of the performance of the methods. This includes a\nquantitative study of the various sources of error, namely filtering,\nquadrature, domain truncation, and time integration, as well as a space and\ntime self-convergence analysis. These analyses are conducted for different\nvalues of the order of the fractional derivatives, and computational\nexperiences are used to gain insight that can be used for generalization of the\npresent constructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 19:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

If a target does not have line-of-sight to a\nminimum number of anchors, then its position cannot be estimated unambiguously\nand is, therefore, said to be in a blind-spot.

Using the all-sky WISE survey, we identified a population of\nover 100 morphologically identified interacting galaxies or mergers that\ndisplay red mid-infrared colors often associated in extragalactic sources with\npowerful AGNs. The vast majority of these advanced mergers are optically\nclassified as star-forming galaxies suggesting that they may represent an\nobscured population of AGNs that cannot be found through optical studies. In\nthis work, we present Chandra/ACIS observations and near-infrared spectra with\nthe Large Binocular Telescope of six advanced mergers with projected pair\nseparations less than ~ 10 kpc. The combined X-ray, near-infrared, and\nmid-infrared properties of these mergers provide confirmation that four out of\nthe six mergers host at least one AGN, with four of the mergers possibly\nhosting dual AGNs with projected separations less than ~10 kpc, despite showing\nno firm evidence for AGNs based on optical spectroscopic studies. Our results\ndemonstrate that 1) optical studies miss a significant fraction of single and\ndual AGNs in advanced mergers, and 2) mid-infrared pre-selection is extremely\neffective in identifying dual AGN candidates in late-stage mergers. Our\nmulti-wavelength observations suggest that the buried AGNs in these mergers are\nhighly absorbed, with intrinsic column densities in excess of N_H >10^24cm^-2,\nconsistent with hydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 22:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

In order to develop these strategies, an accurate diagnostic\ncapability that allows good estimates of the RE distribution function in these\nplasmas is needed. Synchrotron radiation (SR) of RE in MCF, besides of being\none of the main damping mechanisms for RE in the high energy relativistic\nregime, is routinely used in current MCF experiments to infer the parameters of\nRE energy and pitch angle distribution functions. In the present paper we\naddress the long standing question about what are the relationships between\ndifferent RE distribution functions and their corresponding synchrotron\nemission simultaneously including: full-orbit effects, information of the\nspectral and angular distribution of SR of each electron, and basic geometric\noptics of a camera. We study the spatial distribution of the SR on the poloidal\nplane, and the statistical properties of the expected value of the synchrotron\nspectra of runaway electrons. We observe a strong dependence of the synchrotron\nemission measured by the camera on the pitch angle distribution of RE, namely\nwe find that crescent shapes of the spatial distribution of the SR as measured\nby the camera relate to RE distributions with small pitch angles, while ellipse\nshapes relate to distributions of runaways with larger the pitch angles. A weak\ndependence of the synchrotron emission measured by the camera with the RE\nenergy, value of the q-profile at the edge, and the chosen range of wavelengths\nis observed. Furthermore, we find that oversimplifying the angular dependence\nof the SR changes the shape of the synchrotron spectra, and overestimates its\namplitude by approximately 20 times for avalanching RE and by approximately 60\ntimes for mono-energetic distributions of runaways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 00:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The design framework is based on stochastic geometry that jointly\naccounts for the spatial interference correlation at the NOMA receivers as well\nas the temporal interference correlation across HARQ transmissions. It is found\nthat ignoring the effect of the aggregate interference, or overlooking the\nspatial and temporal correlation in interference, highly overestimates the NOMA\nperformance and produces misleading design insights. An interference oblivious\nselection for the power and/or transmission rates leads to violating the\nnetwork outage constraints.

However, determining whether or not a particular\nsensor is evolved or designed to be accurate and efficient is difficult. This\narises partly from the functional constraints being at cross purposes and\npartly since quantifying the predictive performance of even in silico sensors\ncan require prohibitively long simulations. To circumvent these difficulties,\nwe develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of\nthe broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden\nsemi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs. Predictive metrics include the\ninstantaneous memory and the mutual information between present sensor state\nand input future, while dissipative metrics include power consumption and the\nnonpredictive information rate. Success in deriving these formulae relies\nheavily on identifying the environment's causal states, the input's minimal\nsufficient statistics for prediction. Using these formulae, we study the\nsimplest nontrivial biological sensor model---that of a Hill molecule,\ncharacterized by the number of ligands that bind simultaneously, the sensor's\ncooperativity. When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable\ninformation, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget\ngenerally depends on the environment's past hysteretically. In this way, the\nsensor gains robustness to environmental fluctuations. Given the simplicity of\nthe Hill molecule, such hysteresis will likely be found in more complex\npredictive sensors as well. That is, adaptations that only locally optimize\nbiochemical parameters for prediction and dissipation can lead to sensors that\n\"remember\" the past environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 02:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

However, it still remains unsolved due to two important\nchallenges. One is high bandwidth consumption of query transmission, and the\nother is the huge visual variations of query images sent from mobile devices.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, named as canonical view based\ndiscrete multi-modal hashing (CV-DMH), to handle these problems via a novel\nthree-stage learning procedure. First, a submodular function is designed to\nmeasure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it,\ncanonical views, which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited\nredundancy, are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy.\nSecond, multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from\nmultiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and\nadaptively characterize visual contents of varied landmark images with certain\ncanonical views. Finally, compact binary codes are learned on intermediate\nrepresentation within a tailored discrete binary embedding model which\npreserves visual relations of images measured with canonical views and removes\nthe involved noises. In this part, we develop a new augmented Lagrangian\nmultiplier (ALM) based optimization method to directly solve the discrete\nbinary codes. We can not only explicitly deal with the discrete constraint, but\nalso consider the bit-uncorrelated constraint and balance constraint together.\nExperiments on real world landmark datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of CV-DMH over several state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

This model is based on a time-dependent\nfour-component diffusion equation obtained from the Boltzmann transport\nequation assuming linear response and elastic scattering in the channel. We\nclassify all electronic states in the channel into four groups ($U^+$, $D^+$,\n$U^-$, and $D^-$) depending on the spin index (up ($U$), down ($D$)) and the\nsign of the $x$-component of the group velocity ($+,-$) and assign an average\nelectrochemical potential to each of the four groups to obtain the\nfour-component diffusion equation. For normal metal channels, the model\ndecouples into the well-known transmission line model for charge and a\ntime-dependent version of Valet-Fert equation for spin. We first show that in\nthe steady-state limit our model leads to simple expressions for charge-spin\ninterconversion in SML channels in good agreement with existing experimental\ndata on diverse materials. We then use the full time-dependent model to study\nspin-charge separation in the presence of SML, a subject that has been\ncontroversial in the past. Our model shows that the charge and spin signals\ntravel with two distinct velocities resulting in well-known spin-charge\nseparation which is expected to persist even in the presence of SML. However,\nour model predicts that the lower velocity signal is purely spin while the\nhigher velocity signal is largely charge with an additional spin component\nwhich has not been noted before. Finally, we note that our model can be used\nwithin standard circuit simulators like SPICE to obtain numerical results for\ncomplex geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 10:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 20:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 19:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

With respect to well-studied octahedrally-coordinated\niridates, we pay our attention to a rather unexplored iridate, Na4IrO4, showing\nan unusual square-planar coordination. The latter is key to rationalize the\nelectronic structure and magnetic property of Na4IrO4, which is here explored\nby first-principles density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Due\nto the uncommon square-planar crystal field, Ir 5d states adopt\nintermediate-spin state with double occupation of dz2 orbital, leading to a\nsizable local spin moment, at variance with many other iridates. The\nsquare-planar crystal field splitting is also crucial in opening a robust\ninsulating gap in Na4IrO4, irrespective of the specific magnetic ordering or\ntreatment of electronic correlations. Spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role in\nshaping the electronic structure, but leads to a strong magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy. The easy axis perpendicular to the IrO4 plaquette, well explained\nusing perturbation theory, is again closely related to the square-planar\ncoordination. Finally, the large single-ion anisotropy suppresses the spin\nfrustration and stabilizes a collinear antiferromagnetic long-range magnetic\nordering, as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations predicting a quite low N\\'eel\ntemperature, expected from almost isolated IrO4 square-planar units as\ncrystalline building blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 10:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

As an added benefit, it greatly increases the\nachievable precision at nose points. The method is exemplified for the case of\nMvar limits in generators regulating voltage on both local and remote buses.\nBased on the framework of the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM), it\nprovides a rigorous solution to this fundamental problem by framing it in terms\nof \\emph{optimization}. A novel Lagrangian formulation of power-flow, which is\nexact for lossless networks, leads to a natural physics-based minimization\ncriterion that yields the correct solution. For networks with small losses, as\nis the case in transmission, the AC power flow problem cannot be framed exactly\nin terms of optimization, but the criterion still retains its ability to select\nthe correct solution. This foundation then provides a way to design a HELM\nscheme to solve for the minimizing solution. Although the use of barrier\nfunctions evokes interior point optimization, this method, like HELM, is based\non the analytic continuation of a germ (of a particular branch) of the\nalgebraic curve representing the solutions of the system. In this case, since\nthe constraint equations given by limits result in an unavoidable singularity\nat $s=1$, direct analytic continuation by means of standard Pad\\'e\napproximation is fraught with numerical instabilities.

Authors have conducted a survey over different people involved in\ndifferent IoTA based application development tasks. The survey reveals that\nfeature selection is the most time consuming and niche skill demanding part of\nthe entire workflow. This paper shows how feature selection is successfully\nautomated without sacrificing the decision making accuracy and thereby reducing\nthe project completion time and cost of hiring expensive resources. Several\npattern recognition principles and state of art (SoA) ML techniques are\nfollowed to design the overall approach for the proposed automation. Three data\nsets are considered to establish the proof-of-concept. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed automation is able to reduce the time for feature\nselection to $2$ days instead of $4-6$ months which would have been required in\nabsence of the automation. This reduction in time is achieved without any\nsacrifice in the accuracy of the decision making process. Proposed method is\nalso compared against Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as most of the state\nof the art works on IoTA uses MLP based Deep Learning. Moreover the feature\nselection method is compared against SoA feature reduction technique namely\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. The results obtained show\nthat the proposed method is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 11:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

How such interplay evolves\nat low temperature---in particular at what doping level the zero-temperature\nquantum critical point (QCP) is located---is still elusive because it is masked\nby the superconducting state. The QCP had long been believed to follow a smooth\nextrapolation of the characteristic temperature $T^*$ for the strange normal\nstate well above the superconducting transition temperature. However, recently\nthe $T^*$ within the superconducting dome was reported to unexpectedly exhibit\nback-bending likely in the cuprate Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$.\nHere we show that the original and revised phase diagrams can be understood in\nterms of weak and moderate competitions, respectively, between\nsuperconductivity and a pseudogap state such as $d$-density-wave or\nspin-density-wave, based on both Ginzburg-Landau theory and the realistic\n$t$-$t^{\\prime}$-$t^{\\prime\\prime}$-$J$-$V$ model for the cuprates. We further\nfound that the calculated temperature and doping-level dependence of the\nquasiparticle spectral gap and Raman response qualitatively agrees with the\nexperiments.

The noisy voter model is a\nmodification of the voter model that includes a second mechanism for\ntransitions between states: apart from the original herding processes, voters\nmay change their states because of an intrinsic, noisy in origin source. By\nincreasing the importance of the noise with respect to the herding, the system\nexhibits a finite-size phase transition from a quasi-consensus state, where\nmost of the voters share the same opinion, to a one with coexistence. Upon\nintroducing some zealots, or voters with fixed opinion, the latter scenario may\nchange significantly. We unveil the new situations by carrying out a systematic\nnumerical and analytical study of a fully connected network for voters, but\nallowing different voters to be directly influenced by different zealots. We\nshow that this general system is equivalent to a system of voters without\nzealots, but with heterogeneous values of their parameters characterizing\nherding and noisy dynamics. We find excellent agreement between our analytical\nand numerical results. Noise and herding/zealotry acting together in the voter\nmodel yields not a trivial mixture of the scenarios with the two mechanisms\nacting alone: it represents a situation where the global-local (noise-herding)\ncompetitions is coupled to a symmetry breaking (zealots). In general, the\nzealotry enhances the effective noise of the system, which may destroy the\noriginal quasi--consensus state, and can introduce a bias towards the opinion\nof the majority of zealots, hence breaking the symmetry of the system and\ngiving rise to new phases ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 12:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 20:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The\nproposed architecture consists of a 3D convolutional feature encoder for blocks\nof 16 frames, which is trained for reconstruction tasks over the first and last\nframes of the sequence. A preliminary supervised experiment was conducted to\nverify the feasibility of proposed method by training the model with a fraction\nof videos from the UCF-101 dataset taking as ground truth the bounding boxes\naround the activity regions. Qualitative results indicate that the network can\nsuccessfully segment foreground and background in videos as well as update the\nforeground appearance based on disentangled motion features. The benefits of\nthese learned features are shown in a discriminative classification task, where\ninitializing the network with the proposed pretraining method outperforms both\nrandom initialization and autoencoder pretraining.

The critical nucleation length $L_c$ is conventionally obtained from a\nspring-block linear stability analysis extended to interfaces separating\nelastically-deformable bodies using model-dependent fracture mechanics\nestimates.

The minicolumn, defined here as a physically\nlocalized pool of ~20 L2/3 pyramidals, does this by acting as a winner-take-all\n(WTA) competitive module, implying that macrocolumnar codes consist of ~70\nactive L2/3 cells, assuming ~70 minicolumns per macrocolumn.

In the EM domain, it has been suggested that joint\nobservations of the time delay ($\\Delta\\tau$) between lensed quasar images and\nthe velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) of the lensing galaxy (i.e., the combination\n$\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$) are able to constrain the cosmological parameters more\nstrongly than $\\Delta\\tau$ or $\\sigma^{2}$ separately. Here, for the first\ntime, we propose that this $\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$ method can be applied to the\nstrongly lensed systems observed in both GW and EM windows. Combining the\nredshifts, images and $\\sigma$ observed in the EM domain with the very precise\n$\\Delta\\tau$ derived from lensed GW signals, we expect that accurate\nmultimessenger cosmology can be achieved in the era of third-generation GW\ndetectors.

However, the\nimpossibility to construct a density variable in the ocean that is exactly\nneutral because of the coupling between thermobaricity and density-compensated\ntemperature/salinity anomalies implies that the effective diapycnal diffusivity\nexperienced by any possible density variable is partly controlled by isoneutral\ndiffusion when using neutral rotated diffusion. Here, this effect is quantified\nby evaluating the effective diapycnal diffusion coefficient for five widely\nused density variables: Jackett and McDougall (1997) $\\gamma^n$, Lorenz\nreference state density $\\rho_{ref}$ of Winters et al. (1996), Saenz et al.\n(2015), and three potential density variables $\\sigma_0$, $\\sigma_2$ and\n$\\sigma_4$.Computations use the World Ocean Circulation Experiment climatology,\nassuming either a uniform value for isoneutral mixing or spatially varying\nvalues inferred from an inverse calculation. Isopycnal mixing contributions to\nthe effective diapycnal mixing yields values systematically larger than\n$10^{-3}$ $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$ in the deep ocean for all density variables,\nwith $\\gamma^n$ suffering the least from the isoneutral control of effective\ndiapycnal mixing, and $\\sigma_0$ the most. These high values are due to\nspatially localised large values of non-neutrality, mostly in the deep Southern\nOcean. Removing only 5\\% of these high values on each density surface reduces\nthe effective diapycnal diffusivities to less than $10^{-4}$\n$\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$. This work highlights the potential pitfalls of\nestimating diapycnal diffusivities by means of Walin-like water masses analysis\nor in using Lorenz reference state for diagnosing spurious numerical diapycnal\nmixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 14:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

One\ndirection for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared\nneural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer\nacross related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed,\nbecause gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making\nlearning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the\ndifferent reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task\ndominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint\ntraining of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (Distill & transfer\nlearning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we\npropose to share a \"distilled\" policy that captures common behaviour across\ntasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay\nclose to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation\nto be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process\nare derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach\nsupports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several\nrelated methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust and\nmore stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

In this model, first, by\nusing concepts from string theory and M-theory, we calculate the energy of a\nDNA in terms of interactions between free electrons and bound electrons. We\nshow that when a DNA is damaged, its energy changes and an extra current is\nproduced. This extra current causes the electromagnetic signals of a damaged\nDNA molecule to be different when compared to the electromagnetic signals of a\nnormal DNA molecule. The electromagnetic signals of a damaged DNA molecule\ninduces an extra current in a normal DNA molecule and leads to its destruction.\nBy sending crafted electromagnetic signals to normal DNA molecules and inducing\nan opposite current with respect to this extra current, we can prevent the\ndestruction of normal DNA. Finally, we argue that the type of packing of DNA in\nchromosomes of men and women are different. This causes radiated waves from\nDNAs of men and women to have opposite signs and cancel the effect of each\nother in a pair. Using this property, we suggest another mechanism to cancel\nthe effect of extra waves, which are produced by DNAs in cancer cells of a male\nor a female, by extra waves which are produced by DNAs in similar cells of a\nfemale or a male and prevent the progression of the disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 16:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 11:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 06:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 10:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 14:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 11:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 08:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 11:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 11:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 06:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 09:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 06:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 09:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 05:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 17:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 06:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 06:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 12:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

In order to reach an agreement,\nexisting consensus algorithms require each agent to exchange explicit state\ninformation with its neighbors. This leads to the disclosure of private state\ninformation, which is undesirable in cases where privacy is of concern. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach that enables secure and privacy-preserving\naverage consensus in a decentralized architecture in the absence of an\naggregator or third-party. By leveraging partial homomorphic cryptography to\nembed secrecy in pairwise interaction dynamics, our approach can guarantee\nconsensus to the exact value in a deterministic manner without disclosing a\nnode's state to its neighbors. In addition to enabling resilience to passive\nattackers aiming to steal state information, the approach also allows easy\nincorporation of defending mechanisms against active attackers which try to\nalter the content of exchanged messages. Furthermore, in contrast to existing\nnoise-injection based privacy-preserving mechanisms which have to reconfigure\nthe entire network when the topology or number of nodes varies, our approach is\napplicable to dynamic environments with time-varying coupling topologies. This\nsecure and privacy-preservation approach is also applicable to weighted average\nconsensus as well as maximum/minimum consensus under a new update rule.

Our work builds on the recently proposed\nDeep CORAL method, which proposed to train a convolutional neural network and\nsimultaneously minimize the Euclidean distance of convariance matrices between\nthe source and target domains. We propose to use the Riemannian distance,\napproximated by Log-Euclidean distance, to replace the naive Euclidean distance\nin Deep CORAL. We also consider first-order information, and minimize the\ndistance of mean vectors between two domains. We build an end-to-end model, in\nwhich we minimize both the classification loss, and the domain difference based\non the first and second order information between two domains. Our experiments\non the benchmark Office dataset demonstrate the improvements of our newly\nproposed Deep LogCORAL approach over the Deep CORAL method, as well as further\nimprovement when optimizing both orders of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 11:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

More specifically, we performed\ndetailed photoluminescence experiments as a function of excitation energy,\nincident power, irradiation fluence and temperature in order to study the\nimpact of radiative and non-radiative recombination channels on the spectrum,\nyield and lifetime of G-centers. The sharp line emitting at 969 meV ($\\sim$1280\nnm) and the broad asymmetric sideband developing at lower energy share the same\nrecombination dynamics as shown by time-resolved experiments performed\nselectively on each spectral component. This feature accounts for the common\norigin of the two emission bands which are unambiguously attributed to the\nzero-phonon line and to the corresponding phonon sideband.

It is known that many industrial instances,\neven with a great number of variables, can be solved by a clever solver in a\nreasonable amount of time. This is not possible, in general, with classical\nrandomly generated instances. We provide a different generation model of SAT\ninstances, called \\emph{scale-free random SAT instances}. It is based on the\nuse of a non-uniform probability distribution $P(i)\\sim i^{-\\beta}$ to select\nvariable $i$, where $\\beta$ is a parameter of the model. This results into\nformulas where the number of occurrences $k$ of variables follows a power-law\ndistribution $P(k)\\sim k^{-\\delta}$ where $\\delta = 1 + 1/\\beta$. This property\nhas been observed in most real-world SAT instances. For $\\beta=0$, our model\nextends classical random SAT instances.\n  We prove the existence of a SAT-UNSAT phase transition phenomenon for\nscale-free random 2-SAT instances with $\\beta<1/2$ when the clause/variable\nratio is $m/n=\\frac{1-2\\beta}{(1-\\beta)^2}$. We also prove that scale-free\nrandom k-SAT instances are unsatisfiable with high probability when the number\nof clauses exceeds $\\omega(n^{(1-\\beta)k})$. %This implies that the SAT/UNSAT\nphase transition phenomena vanishes when $\\beta>1-1/k$, and formulas are\nunsatisfiable due to a small core of clauses. The proof of this result suggests\nthat, when $\\beta>1-1/k$, the unsatisfiability of most formulas may be due to\nsmall cores of clauses.

This allows a superior\nperformance of using CGP than standard Gaussian Process (GP) in the modelling\nof Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems when observations are missing\nfor some of outputs. Similar to standard GP, a key issue of CGP is the learning\nof hyperparameters from a set of input-output observations. It typically\nperformed by maximizing the Log-Likelihood (LL) function which leads to an\nunconstrained nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. Algorithms such as\nConjugate Gradient (CG) or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) are commonly\nused but they often get stuck in local optima, especially for CGP where there\nare more hyperparameters.

In\nthis paper, we propose to use enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nalgorithms to solve this problem by minimizing the model output error instead.\nThis optimization criterion enables the quality of intermediate solutions to be\ndirectly observable during the optimization process. Two enhancements to the\nstandard PSO algorithm which make use of gradient information and the multi-\nstart technique are proposed.
