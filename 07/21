In view of\nthese two methods of term relatedness, in this work, we report our study on\nincorporating the local information of the query in the word embeddings. One\nmain challenge in this direction is that the dense vectors of word embeddings\nand their estimation of term-to-term relatedness remain difficult to interpret\nand hard to analyze. As an alternative, explicit word representations propose\nvectors whose dimensions are easily interpretable, and recent methods show\ncompetitive performance to the dense vectors. We introduce a neural-based\nexplicit representation, rooted in the conceptual ideas of the word2vec\nSkip-Gram model. The method provides interpretable explicit vectors while\nkeeping the effectiveness of the Skip-Gram model. The evaluation of various\nexplicit representations on word association collections shows that the newly\nproposed method out- performs the state-of-the-art explicit representations\nwhen tasked with ranking highly similar terms.

Abstract models of common-pool resource appropriation based\non non-cooperative game theory predict that self-interested agents will\ngenerally fail to find socially positive equilibria---a phenomenon called the\ntragedy of the commons. However, in reality, human societies are sometimes able\nto discover and implement stable cooperative solutions.

Here, we address this issue by studying the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model with two distinct numerical methods. We find that\nthe pseudogap only exists when the Fermi surface is hole-like and that, for a\nbroad range of parameters, its opening is concomitant with a Fermi surface\ntopology change from electron- to hole-like.

We first study a similar duality in a ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theory, where it can be checked exactly\nusing localization. At large $N$, the free energies of supersymmetric and\nnon-supersymmetric theories are related in a simple way, and we use this fact\nto obtain an explicit solution for the scalar and fermion free energies which\nobey the duality map and have the expected weak and strong coupling behaviors.\nWe also suggest that a worldline representation of the free energy allows to\nrelate its calculation to a sum of Wilson loops in pure Chern-Simons theory.

The first main result is that this noncrossing\nhypertree complex is homeomorphic to a piecewise spherical complex associated\nwith the noncrossing partition lattice and thus it has a natural metric. The\nfact that the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice with its\nbounding elements removed is homeomorphic to a generalized cluster complex was\nnot previously known or conjectured.\n  The metric noncrossing hypertree complex is a union of unit spheres with a\nnumber of remarkable properties: 1) the metric subspheres and simplices in each\ndimension are both bijectively labeled by the set of noncrossing hypertrees\nwith a fixed number of hyperedges, 2) the number of spheres containing the\nsimplex labeled by the noncrossing tree $\\tau$ is the same as the number\nsimplices in the sphere labeled by the noncrossing tree $\\tau$, and 3) among\nthe maximal spherical subcomplexes one finds every normal fan of a metric\nrealization of the simple associahedron associated to the cluster algebra of\ntype $A$. In particular, the poset of noncrossing hypertrees and its metric\nsimplicial complex provide a new perspective on familiar combinatorial objects\nand a common context in which to view the known bijections between noncrossing\npartitions and the vertices/facets of simple/simplicial associahedra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 17:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

Some of the\nfluxtubes are closed, while others can contain open field. The relative\nproportion of nonthermal electrons among those distinct loops is highly\nimportant for understanding the energy release, particle acceleration, and\ntransport. The access of nonthermal electrons to the open field is further\nimportant as the open field facilitates the solar energetic particle (SEP)\nescape from the flaring site, and thus controls the SEP fluxes in the solar\nsystem, both directly and as seed particles for further acceleration. The\nlarge-scale fluxtubes are often filled with a tenuous plasma, which is\ndifficult to detect in either EUV or X-ray wavelengths; however, they can\ndominate at low radio frequencies, where a modest component of nonthermal\nelectrons can render the source optically thick and, thus, bright enough to be\nobserved. Here we report detection of a large-scale `plume' at the impulsive\nphase of an X-class solar flare, SOL2001-08-25T16:23, using multi-frequency\nradio data from Owens Valley Solar Array. To quantify the flare spatial\nstructure, we employ 3D modeling utilizing force-free-field extrapolations from\nthe line-of-sight SOHO/MDI magnetograms with our modeling tool GX Simulator. We\nfound that a significant fraction of the nonthermal electrons accelerated at\nthe flare site low in the corona escapes to the plume, which contains both\nclosed and open field. We propose that the proportion between the closed and\nopen field at the plume is what determines the SEP population escaping into\ninterplanetary space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 17:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Topology monitoring becomes a critical task for optimal\ngrid scheduling. While synchrophasor installations are limited in low-voltage\ngrids, utilities have an abundance of smart meter data at their disposal. In\nthis context, a statistical learning framework is put forth for verifying\nsingle-phase grid structures using non-synchronized voltage data. The related\nmaximum likelihood task boils down to minimizing a non-convex function over a\nnon-convex set. The function involves the sample voltage covariance matrix and\nthe feasible set is relaxed to its convex hull. Asymptotically in the number of\ndata, the actual topology yields the global minimizer of the original and the\nrelaxed problems. Under a simplified data model, the function turns out to be\nconvex, thus offering optimality guarantees. Prior information on line statuses\nis also incorporated via a maximum a-posteriori approach. The formulated tasks\nare tackled using solvers having complementary strengths. Numerical tests using\nreal data on benchmark feeders demonstrate that reliable topology estimates can\nbe acquired even with a few smart meter data, while the non-convex schemes\nexhibit superior line verification performance at the expense of additional\ncomputational time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 18:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

CMEs whose front moves faster in the\nsolar wind frame than the fast magnetosonic speed, drive shocks. Such shocks\nare important contributors to space weather, by triggering substorms,\ncompressing the magnetosphere and accelerating particles. In general, near 1\nAU, CMEs with speed greater than about 500 km s$^{-1}$ drive shocks, whereas\nslower CMEs do not. However, CMEs as slow as 350 km s$^{-1}$ may sometimes,\nalthough rarely, drive shocks.

Our focus is on CMEs with average\nspeeds under 375 km s$^{-1}$. From Wind measurements from 1996 to 2016, we find\n22 cases of such shock-driving slow CMEs, and, for about half of them (11 out\nof the 22), the existence of the shock appears to be strongly related to CME\nexpansion.

[2016]. The reference\ndistributions are constructed from a particular conditional distribution formed\nfrom what we call a DAG-DAG -- a Data Analysis Generative DAG. As sampling\nconditional distributions in DAGs is generally complex, the selective sampler\nis crucial to any practical implementation of inferactive data analysis. Our\nprincipal goal is in reviewing the recent developments in selective inference\nas well as describing the general philosophy of selective inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 19:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

Traditionally, this magnetization\nis analyzed through measurements of the net magnetic moment of bulk millimeter\nto centimeter sized samples. However, geological samples are often\nmineralogically and texturally heterogeneous at submillimeter scales, with only\na fraction of the ferromagnetic grains carrying the remanent magnetization of\ninterest. Therefore, characterizing this magnetization in such cases requires a\ntechnique capable of imaging magnetic fields at fine spatial scales and with\nhigh sensitivity. To address this challenge, we developed a new instrument,\nbased on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which enables direct imaging of\nmagnetic fields due to both remanent and induced magnetization, as well as\noptical imaging, of room-temperature geological samples with spatial resolution\napproaching the optical diffraction limit. We describe the operating principles\nof this device, which we call the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), and report\nits optimized image-area-normalized magnetic field sensitivity (20\nuT.um/Hz^1/2), spatial resolution (5 um), and field of view (4 mm), as well as\ntrade-offs between these parameters.

In this paper, we show that the\nX-ray flux variations in some AGNs, and correspondingly the power spectral\ndensities (PSDs) of the variations, may be interpreted as being caused by\nabsorptions of eclipsing clouds or clumps in the broad line region (BLR) and\nthe dusty torus. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations for a number of\nplausible cloud models, we systematically investigate the statistics of the\nX-ray variations resulting from the cloud eclipsing and the PSDs of the\nvariations. For these models, we show that the number of eclipsing events can\nbe significant and the absorption column densities due to those eclipsing\nclouds can be in the range from 10^{21} to 10^{24} cm^{-2}, leading to\nsignificant X-ray variations. We find that the PSDs obtained from the mock\nobservations for the X-ray flux and the absorption column density resulting\nfrom these models can be described by a broken double power law, similar to\nthose directly measured from observations of some AGNs. The shape of the PSDs\ndepend strongly on the kinematic structures and the intrinsic properties of the\nclouds in AGNs. We demonstrate that the X-ray eclipsing model can naturally\nlead to a strong correlation between the break frequencies (and correspondingly\nthe break timescales) of the PSDs and the masses of the massive black holes\n(MBHs) in the model AGNs, which can be well consistent with the one obtained\nfrom observations.

To break this fundamental limit, in this paper we\npropose a new spectrum and energy efficient mmWave transmission scheme that\nintegrates the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with beamspace\nMIMO, i.e., beamspace MIMO-NOMA. By using NOMA in beamspace MIMO systems, the\nnumber of supported users can be larger than the number of RF chains at the\nsame time-frequency resources.

Top-tagging at such\nhigh energies forces us to confront several new issues in terms of detector\ncapabilities and jet physics. Here, we explore these issues in the context of\nsome simple JHU/CMS-type declustering algorithms and the N-subjettiness\njet-shape variable tau_32. We first highlight the complementarity between the\ntwo tagging approaches at particle-level with respect to discriminating\ntop-jets against gluons and quarks, using multivariate optimization scans. We\nthen introduce a basic fast detector simulation, including electromagnetic\ncalorimeter showering patterns determined from GEANT. We consider a number of\ntricks for processing the fast detector output back to an approximate\nparticle-level picture. Re-optimizing the tagger parameters, we demonstrate\nthat the inevitable losses in discrimination power at very high energies can\ntypically be ameliorated. For example, percent-scale mistag rates might be\nmaintained even in extreme cases where an entire top decay would sit inside of\none hadronic calorimeter cell and tracking information is completely absent. We\nthen study three novel physics effects that will come up in the multi-TeV\nenergy regime: gluon radiation off of boosted top quarks, mistags originating\nfrom g -> tt, and mistags originating from q -> (W/Z)q collinear electroweak\nsplittings with subsequent hadronic decays. The first effect, while nominally a\nnuisance, can actually be harnessed to slightly improve discrimination against\ngluons. The second effect can lead to effective O(1) enhancements of gluon\nmistag rates for tight working points. And the third effect, while conceptually\ninteresting, we show to be of highly subleading importance at all energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 02:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Mean-field Babcock-Leighton dynamos that\nconsider non-instantaneous rising flux tubes have been shown to exhibit\nlong-term variability in their magnetic cycle. However a relation that\nparameterizes the rise-time of non-axisymmetric magnetic flux tubes in terms of\nstellar parameters is still missing. Aims: We aim to find a general\nparameterization of the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes for solar-like stars.\nMethods: By considering the influence of magnetic tension on the rise of\nnon-axisymmetric flux tubes, we predict the existence of a control parameter\nreferred as $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$. This parameter is a measure of the\nbalance between rotational effects and magnetic effects (buoyancy and tension)\nacting on the magnetic flux tube. We carry out two series of numerical\nexperiments (one for axisymmetric rise and one for non-axisymmetric rise) and\ndemonstrate that $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$ indeed controls the rise-time\nof magnetic flux tubes. Results: We find that the rise-time follows a power law\nof $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$ with an exponent that depends on the\nazimuthal wavenumber of the magnetic flux loop. Conclusions: Compressibility\ndoes not impact the rise of magnetic flux tubes, while non-axisymmetry does. In\nthe case of non-axisymmetric rise, the tension force modifies the force balance\nacting on the magnetic flux tube. We identified the three independent\nparameters required to predict the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes, that is,\nthe stellar rotation rate, the magnetic flux density of the flux tube, and its\nazimuthal wavenumber.

In\nthis paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional\nneural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds.\nIn our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize\nand segment the points of the object class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual\nRNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye\nwindow, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point\nclouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the\nclassification results. It also integrates object localization, segmentation\nand classification into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud classification\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 07:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

The closure is obtained from a controlled expansion and\nrelies on extended symmetries of the Navier-Stokes field theory.

Northern\nterritories are widely covered by granular material that indicates back fall\noriginating from the active south. Decimetre sized chunks contain water ice and\ntheir trajectories are influenced by an anti-solar force instigated by\nsublimation. OSIRIS observations suggest that up to 20 % of the particles\ndirectly return to the nucleus surface taking several hours of travel time. The\nback fall covered northern areas are active if illuminated but produce mainly\nwater vapour. The decimetre chunks from the nucleus surface are too small to\ncontain more volatile compounds such as CO 2 or CO. This causes a north-south\ndichotomy of the composition measurements in the coma.

In this paper, a more general large-scale bike sharing system is\ndiscussed by means of heavy traffic approximation of multiclass closed queueing\nnetworks with non-exponential factors.

The proposed network achieves\nstate-of-the-art prediction accuracy indicating that visual cues alone contain\nhighly predictive information about the popularity of a talk.

Date is a useful piece\nof information which has various applications including date-wise videos/scene\nsearching, indexing or retrieval. This paper presents a date spotting based\ninformation retrieval system for natural scene image and video frames where\ntext appears with complex backgrounds. We propose a line based date spotting\napproach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is used to detect the date\ninformation in a given text. Different date models are searched from a line\nwithout segmenting characters or words. Given a text line image in RGB, we\napply an efficient gray image conversion to enhance the text information.\nWavelet decomposition and gradient sub-bands are used to enhance text\ninformation in gray scale. Next, Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG)\nfeature has been extracted from gray image and binary images for date-spotting\nframework. Binary and gray image features are combined by MLP based Tandem\napproach. Finally, to boost the performance further, a shape coding based\nscheme is used to combine the similar shape characters in same class during\nword spotting. For our experiment, three different date models have been\nconstructed to search similar date information having numeric dates that\ncontains numeral values and punctuations and semi-numeric that contains dates\nwith numerals along with months in scene/video text. We have tested our system\non 1648 text lines and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed date\nspotting approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 10:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

The model should be able to disentangle the semantic\ninformation from the two modalities (image and text), and generate new images\nfrom the combined semantics. To achieve this, we proposed an end-to-end neural\narchitecture that leverages adversarial learning to automatically learn\nimplicit loss functions, which are optimized to fulfill the aforementioned two\nrequirements. We have evaluated our model by conducting experiments on\nCaltech-200 bird dataset and Oxford-102 flower dataset, and have demonstrated\nthat our model is capable of synthesizing realistic images that match the given\ndescriptions, while still maintain other features of original images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 12:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

The X-ray\njet is expanding in time along the axis of the jet's propagation: we observe\nthe formation of a tail (~2.25\"), which appears to extend backwards with an\napparent velocity ~-0.10c. The origin of this feature is discussed in the\nframework of scenarios of energy dissipation.

Recently, deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have\nquickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the added\nbenefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a\nmajor downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry,\nthus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to\nobtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed\nthat they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up\nthe intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data,\nand instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced\nmaps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this\npaper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a\nsubstantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient\nperformance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors,\nbut in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger\nparts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semantic\nsegmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare its\nperformance when using different training data sets, ranging from manually\nlabeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic training\ndata derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations.

When visited by the walk, each node of the\ngraph observes a signal of elevated mean, which we assume can be different\nacross different nodes. Outside of the path of the walk, and also in its\nabsence, nodes measure only noise. Assuming the Neyman-Pearson setting, our\ngoal then is to characterize detection performance by computing the error\nexponent for the probability of a miss, under a constraint on the probability\nof false alarm. Since exact computation of the error exponent is known to be\ndifficult, equivalent to computation of the Lyapunov exponent, we approximate\nits value by finding a tractable lower bound. The bound reveals an interesting\ndetectability condition: the walk is detectable whenever the entropy of the\nwalk is smaller than one half of the expected signal-to-noise ratio. We derive\nthe bound by extending the notion of Markov types to Gauss-Markov types. These\nare sequences of state-observation pairs with a given number of node-to-node\ntransition counts and the same average signal values across nodes, computed\nfrom the measurements made during the times the random walk was visiting each\nnode's respective location.

As a consequence, we show that the\ncurrent observational isocurvature constraints on the curvaton parameters are\nnot as severe as usually thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 15:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Such matched behavior\nmakes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This\npaper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two\nimportant views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related\nto geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival\nprocesses (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of\nbike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates\nthat the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in\npractice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a\nmulticlass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example,\nbikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as\nvirtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station\nnodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road\nnodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we\nprovide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike\nsharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a\nnonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the\nproduct-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths\nat the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state\nprobability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting\nperformance measures of the bike sharing system.

Though a revolutionary proposal for its time, Dirac's Large Number\nHypothesis (1937) adopted a standard assumption of the day, namely, the\nnon-existence of the cosmological constant term ($\\Lambda = 0$). As a result,\nits implementation necessitated extreme violence to the theory of general\nrelativity -- something few physicists were prepared to sacrifice in favour of\n`numerology' -- requiring a time-dependent gravitational coupling of the form\n$G(t) \\sim 1/t$. Zel'dovich's insight (1968) was to realise that a small but\nnonzero cosmological term ($\\Lambda > 0$) allowed the present day radius of the\nUniverse to be identified with the de Sitter radius, $r_{\\rm U} \\simeq l_{\\rm\ndS} \\simeq 1/{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}$, which removed the need for time-dependence in\nthe fundamental couplings. Thus, he obtained the formula $\\Lambda \\simeq\nm^6G^2/\\hbar^4$, where $m$ is a mass scale characterising the relative\nstrengths of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which he\nidentified with the proton mass $m_{\\rm p}$. In this paper, we review a number\nof recent arguments which, instead, suggest the identification $m = m_{\\rm\ne}/\\alpha_{\\rm e}$, where $m_{\\rm e}$ is the electron mass and $\\alpha_{\\rm e}\n= e^2/\\hbar c \\simeq 1/137$ is the usual fine structure constant. We note that\nthese are of a {\\it physical} nature and, therefore, represent an attempt to\nlift previous arguments \\emph{{\\` a} la} Dirac from the realm of numerology\ninto the realm of empirical science. If valid, such arguments suggest an\nintimate connection, not only between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds,\nbut, perhaps even more surprisingly, between the very essence of \"dark\" and\n\"light\" physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 01:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 04:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 04:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

Over a period of about two years, the source exhibits hard X-ray\nvariability of the order of 20 per cent, peaking around 20 keV. When the two\nAGN are resolved with Chandra, column densities in the range $N_\\textrm{H} \\sim\n1-2 \\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ are estimated for both of them. The exact values\nare hard to determine, as they appear to depend on aspects that are sometimes\noverlooked in Compton-thick objects, such as the covering factor of the\nabsorber, iron abundance, and the contamination in the Fe-K band from\nforeground hot-gas emission. Nearly spherical covering and slightly subsolar\niron abundance are preferred in this case. While the southern nucleus is\nsuggested to be intrinsically more powerful, as also implied by the mid-IR and\n2-10 keV brightness ratios, solutions involving a similar X-ray luminosity of\nthe two AGN cannot be ruled out. The observed variability is rather limited\ncompared to the one revealed by the Swift/BAT light curve, and it can be fully\nexplained by changes in the continuum flux from the two AGN, without requiring\nsignificant column density variations. NGC 6240 is hereby confirmed to\nrepresent a unique opportunity to investigate the X-ray (and broad-band)\nproperties of massive galaxy mergers, which were much more frequent in the\nearly Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 18:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

To accelerate DSI and HARDI, recent methods from\ncompressed sensing (CS) exploit a sparse underlying representation of the data\nin the spatial and angular domains to undersample in the respective k- and\nq-spaces. State-of-the-art frameworks, however, impose sparsity in the spatial\nand angular domains separately and involve the sum of the corresponding sparse\nregularizers. In contrast, we propose a unified (k,q)-CS formulation which\nimposes sparsity jointly in the spatial-angular domain to further increase\nsparsity of dMRI signals and reduce the required subsampling rate. To\nefficiently solve this large-scale global reconstruction problem, we introduce\na novel adaptation of the FISTA algorithm that exploits dictionary\nseparability.
