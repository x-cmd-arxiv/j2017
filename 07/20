The\ninfluence of various parameters on capacitance such beam width, anchoring\ncondition, externally applied voltage, beam power and launching position is\npresented. For instance, the maximum tuning range is achieved for wide beams\nand the molecules initially aligned close to the propagation axis. It is also\nproved that launching position, especially for narrow beams, has limited\ninfluence on capacitance. The proposed component can be used, for instance, in\noptical power meters, as a feedback in laser or diode systems or just as a\nvariable capacitor in optoelectronic circuits. One of the advantages of this\ndevice is that the beam passes through the element, so steering of the\ncapacitance or measuring the parameters of the beam can be realized without\nsplitting the beam.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

The data were reduced using the dedicated SPHERE pipeline, and\nalgorithms such as PCA and TLOCI were applied to reduce the speckle pattern.\nThe IFS images revealed a previously unknown low-mass (~0.16$M_{\\odot}$)\nstellar companion (HD 294149 B) at ~0.1$^{\\prime\\prime}$, compatible with\npreviously observed radial velocity differences, as well as proper motion\ndifferences between Gaia and Tycho-2 measurements. The known brown dwarf\ncompanion (HD 284149 b) is clearly visible in the IRDIS images. This allowed us\nto refine both its photometry and astrometry. The analysis of the medium\nresolution IRDIS long slit spectra also allowed a refinement of temperature and\nspectral type estimates. A full reassessment of the age and distance of the\nsystem was also performed, leading to more precise values of both mass and\nsemi-major axis. As a result of this study, HD 284149 ABb therefore becomes the\nlatest addition to the (short) list of brown dwarfs on wide circumbinary\norbits, providing new evidence to support recent claims that object in such\nconfiguration occur with a similar frequency to wide companions to single\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Previous research\nintroduced the idea of using a finite number of sampled states with the bounds\nof the stability inequalities near the samples.

However, an\nexample of Molli Jones shows there are directed graphs which do not have\n$G$-grading sets for any cyclic group $G$ of even order greater than 2.\nFinally, we count the number of nonequivalent elementary gradings by a finite\ngroup of a full matrix ring over an arbitrary field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 19:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 21:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Recent works have shown\nthat they can accrete within an impact-generated disk. However, the detailed\nstructure and initial thermodynamic properties of the disk are poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we perform high-resolution SPH simulations of the\nMartian moon-forming giant impact that can also form the Borealis basin. This\ngiant impact heats up the disk material (around $\\sim 2000$ K in temperature)\nwith an entropy increase of $\\sim 1500$ J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$. Thus, the disk\nmaterial should be mostly molten, though a tiny fraction of disk material ($<\n5\\%$) would even experience vaporization. Typically, a piece of molten disk\nmaterial is estimated to be meter sized due to the fragmentation regulated by\ntheir shear velocity and surface tension during the impact process. The disk\nmaterials initially have highly eccentric orbits ($e \\sim 0.6-0.9$) and\nsuccessive collisions between meter-sized fragments at high impact velocity\n($\\sim 3-5$ km s$^{-1}$) can grind them down to $\\sim100 \\mu$m-sized particles.\nOn the other hand, a tiny amount of vaporized disk material condenses into\n$\\sim 0.1 \\mu$m-sized grains.

For this reason, they are widely utilized in computer\nvision applications where reliable pose estimation is required. Factors such as\nimaging noise and subtle changes in illumination induce jitter on the estimated\npose. Jitter impairs robustness in vision and robotics applications, and\ndeteriorates the sense of presence and immersion in AR/VR applications. In this\npaper, we propose STag, a fiducial marker system that provides stable pose\nestimation. STag is designed to be robust against jitter factors, thus sustains\npose stability better than the existing solutions. This is achieved by\nutilizing geometric features that can be localized more repeatably. The outer\nsquare border of the marker is used for detection and homography estimation.\nThis is followed by a novel homography refinement step using the inner circular\nborder. After refinement, the pose can be estimated stably and robustly across\nviewing conditions. These features are demonstrated with a comprehensive set of\nexperiments, including comparisons with the state of the art fiducial marker\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 20:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 10:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Walker and Penarrubia have used this approach to argue that\ndata for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their\ninner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high\nstatistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor.

In excellent agreement with experiments, the simulated electronic\nspectrum shows a broad absorption band covering the spectra of the other\nvitamin D photoisomers. The broad band stems from the spectral overlap of four\ndifferent ground state rotamers. After photoexcitation, the first excited\nsinglet state (S1) decays within 882 fs. The S1 dynamics is characterized by a\nstrong twisting of the central double bond. 96% of all trajectories relax\nwithout chemical transformation to the ground state. In 2.3 % of the\ntrajectories we observed [1,5]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift forming the partly\ndeconjugated toxisterol D1. 1.4 % previtamin D formation is observed via\nhula-twist double bond isomerization. We find a strong dependence between\nphotoreactivity and dihedral angle conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in\ncEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization occurs mainly in cEc\nrotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone to\nprevitamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a\ncyclobutene-toxisterol in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong\nabsorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol acts mainly as a sun shield\nsuppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol\nformation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc\nrotamer can lead to previtamin D formation. Our study reinforces a recent\nhypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D source when only low\nenergy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the\nmorning and evening hours of the day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 21:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

This is because\nthe large charge transfer from the FM to TI layer would prevent the Dirac cone\nat the interface from being anywhere near the Fermi level to contribute to the\nobserved spin-transfer torque. Moreover, there is yet little understanding of\nthe impact on the Dirac cone at the interface from the metallic bands\noverlapping in energy and momentum, where strong hybridization could take\nplace. Here, we build a simple microscopic model and perform\nfirst-principles-based simulations for such a TI-FM heterostructure,\nconsidering the strong hybridization and charge transfer effects.

Such a `descendent state' carries a sizable weight of the original\nDirac interface state, and thus inherits the localization at the interface and\nthe same Rashba-type spin-momentum locking.

In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-branch fully convolutional network (MB-FCN) for face detection, which\nconsiders both efficiency and effectiveness in the design process. Our MB-FCN\ndetector can deal with faces at all scale ranges with only a single pass\nthrough the backbone network. As such, our MB-FCN model saves computation and\nthus is more efficient, compared to previous methods that make multiple passes.\nFor each branch, the specific skip connections of the convolutional feature\nmaps at different layers are exploited to represent faces in specific scale\nranges. Specifically, small faces can be represented with both shallow\nfine-grained and deep powerful coarse features. With this representation,\nsuperior improvement in performance is registered for the task of detecting\nsmall faces. We test our MB-FCN detector on two public face detection\nbenchmarks, including FDDB and WIDER FACE. Extensive experiments show that our\ndetector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all these datasets in general\nand by a substantial margin on the most challenging among them (e.g. WIDER FACE\nHard subset).

Previous applications of the theory of mean action time to\nestimate the response time use the first two central moments of the probability\ndensity function associated with the transition from the initial condition, at\n$t=0$, to the steady state condition that arises in the long time limit, as $t\n\\to \\infty$. This previous approach leads to a computationally convenient\nestimation of the response time, but the accuracy can be poor.

Results are validated using an existing\nlaboratory-scale data set describing flow in a homogeneous porous medium. In\naddition, we demonstrate how the results also apply to flow in heterogeneous\nporous media. Overall, the new method is: (i) extremely accurate; and (ii)\ncomputationally inexpensive. In fact, the computational cost of the new method\nis orders of magnitude less than the computational effort required to study the\nresponse time by solving the transient flow equation. Furthermore, the approach\nprovides a rigorous mathematical connection with the heuristic argument that\nthe response time for flow in a homogeneous porous medium is proportional to\n$L^2/D$, where $L$ is a relevant length scale, and $D$ is the aquifer\ndiffusivity.

We also inspect the influence of the edge\nstructure on persistent currents. In zigzag-edged configurations they are found\nto be sensitive to a length-dependent term which behaves as an effective flux.\nArmchair rings show a quite distinctive property: alternation of constant and\nflux-dependent currents according to the width of the ring, for a fixed\ntransverse quantum number. In the flux-free case the effects of topology are\nfound to be entirely suppressed, and conventional odd and even currents become\nundistinguishable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 03:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 15:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

However, the necessity of migration has been\nrecently called into question with the emergence of in-situ formation models of\nclose-in giant planets. Observational characterization of the transiting\nsub-sample of close-in giants has revealed that \"warm\" Jupiters, possessing\norbital periods longer than roughly 10 days more often possess close-in,\nco-transiting planetary companions than shorter period \"hot\" Jupiters, that are\nusually lonely.

In this work, we demonstrate that both classes of\nplanet may arise via early migration or in-situ conglomeration, but that the\nenhanced loneliness of hot Jupiters arises due to a secular resonant\ninteraction with the stellar quadrupole moment. Such an interaction tilts the\norbits of exterior, lower mass planets, removing them from transit surveys\nwhere the hot Jupiter is detected. Warm Jupiter-hosting systems, in contrast,\nretain their coplanarity due to the weaker influence of the host star's\nquadrupolar potential relative to planet-disk interactions.

It is shown that the learning accuracy is\ncomparable to that obtained when using a software-based BP algorithm when the\nelectronic synapse device has a linear conductance response with a high dynamic\nrange. Furthermore, the proposed unidirectional weight-updating method is\nsuitable for electronic synapse devices which have nonlinear and finite\nconductance responses. Because this weight-updating method can compensate the\ndemerit of asymmetric weight updates, we can obtain better accuracy compared to\nother methods.

The problem of dispersion of $n$ robots on an $n$ node graph, introduced\nby Augustine and Moses Jr. [1], requires robots to coordinate with each other\nand reach a configuration where exactly one robot is present on each node. This\nproblem has real world applications and applies whenever we want to minimize\nthe total cost of $n$ agents sharing $n$ resources, located at various places,\nsubject to the constraint that the cost of an agent moving to a different\nresource is comparatively much smaller than the cost of multiple agents sharing\na resource (e.g. smart electric cars sharing recharge stations). The study of\nthis problem also provides indirect benefits to the study of scattering on\ngraphs, the study of exploration by mobile robots, and the study of load\nbalancing on graphs.\n  We solve the problem of dispersion in the presence of two types of dynamism\nin the underlying graph: (i) vertex permutation and (ii) 1-interval\nconnectivity. We introduce the notion of vertex permutation dynamism and have\nit mean that for a given set of nodes, in every round, the adversary ensures a\nring structure is maintained, but the connections between the nodes may change.\nWe use the idea of 1-interval connectivity from Di Luna et al. [10], where for\na given ring, in each round, the adversary chooses at most one edge to remove.\n  We assume robots have full visibility and present asymptotically time optimal\nalgorithms to achieve dispersion in the presence of both types of dynamism when\nrobots have chirality. When robots do not have chirality, we present\nasymptotically time optimal algorithms to achieve dispersion subject to certain\nconstraints. Finally, we provide impossibility results for dispersion when\nrobots have no visibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 06:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 03:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 13:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

However,\nfast models are usually less accurate, while accurate models cannot satisfy our\nneed for speed. A fast model can be 10 times faster but 50\\% less accurate than\nan accurate model. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Feeding (AF) to combine a\nfast (but less accurate) detector and an accurate (but slow) detector, by\nadaptively determining whether an image is easy or hard and choosing an\nappropriate detector for it. In practice, we build a cascade of detectors,\nincluding the AF classifier which make the easy vs. hard decision and the two\ndetectors. The AF classifier can be tuned to obtain different tradeoff between\nspeed and accuracy, which has negligible training time and requires no\nadditional training data. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and\nCaltech Pedestrian datasets confirm that AF has the ability to achieve\ncomparable speed as the fast detector and comparable accuracy as the accurate\none at the same time. As an example, by combining the fast SSD300 with the\naccurate SSD500 detector, AF leads to 50\\% speedup over SSD500 with the same\nprecision on the VOC2007 test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

It is based on\nthe EOS for uniform nuclear matter that two of the authors derived recently,\napplying a variational method to realistic two- and there-body nuclear forces.\nWe utilize an extended liquid drop model of heavy nuclei and a\nquantum-theoretical mass evaluation for light nuclei. In addition to realistic\nnuclear forces, the inclusion of in-medium effects on the full ensemble of\nnuclei makes the new EOS one of the most realistic EOS's for supernova\nsimulations. We make comparisons with the FYSS EOS, which is based on the same\nformulation for the nuclear ensemble but adopts the relativistic mean field\n(RMF) theory with the TM1 parameter set for uniform nuclear matter. The new EOS\nis softer than the FYSS EOS around and above nuclear saturation densities. We\nfind that neutron-rich nuclei with small mass numbers are more abundant in the\nnew EOS than in the FYSS EOS because of the larger saturation densities and\nsmaller symmetry energy of nuclei in the former. We apply the two EOS's to 1D\nsupernova simulations and find that the new EOS gives lower electron fractions\nand higher temperatures in the collapse phase owing to the smaller symmetry\nenergy. As a result, the inner core has smaller masses for the new EOS. It is\nmore compact, on the other hand, due to the softness of the new EOS and bounces\nat higher densities. The ensuing outward propagations of the shock wave in the\nouter core are very similar in the two simulations, which may be an artifact,\nthough, caused by the use of the same tabulated electron capture rates for\nheavy nuclei ignoring differences in the nuclear composition between the two\nEOS's in these computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 08:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

The warmness of such 7 keV DM produced from the thermal\nbath, in general, appears in tension with Ly-$\\alpha$ forest data, although a\ndirect comparison is not straightforward. This is because the Ly-$\\alpha$\nforest constraints are usually reported on the mass of the conventional warm\ndark matter (WDM), where large entropy production is implicitly assumed to\noccur in the thermal bath after WDM particles decouple. The phase space\ndistribution of freeze-in axino DM varies depending on production processes and\naxino DM may alleviate the tension with the tight Ly-$\\alpha$ forest\nconstraints. By solving the Boltzmann equation, we first obtain the resultant\nphase space distribution of axinos produced by 2-body decay, 3-body decay, and\n2-to-2 scattering, respectively. The reduced collision term and resultant phase\nspace distribution are useful for studying other freeze-in scenarios as well.\nWe then calculate the resultant linear matter power spectra for such axino DM\nand directly compare them with the linear matter power spectra for the\nconventional WDM. In order to demonstrate realistic axino DM production, we\nconsider benchmark points with the Higgsino next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (NLSP) and wino NLSP. In the case of the Higgsino NLSP, the phase\nspace distribution of axinos is colder than that in the conventional WDM case,\nso the most stringent Ly-$\\alpha$ forest constraint can be evaded with mild\nentropy production from saxion decay inherent in the supersymmetric DFSZ axion\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 09:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 14:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Under\nconditions of Landau-level crossing, caused by enhanced spin susceptibility in\ncombination with the tilting of the magnetic field, the transition between two\nrivaling phases- paramagnetic and ferromagnetic- is traced in terms of optical\nspectra reconstruction. Synchronous sharp transformations are observed both in\nthe photoluminescence structure and parameters of collective excitations upon\ntransition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. Based on these\nmeasurements, a phase diagram is constructed in terms of the 2D electron\ndensity and tilt angle of the magnetic field. Apart from stable paramagnetic\nand ferromagnetic phases, an instability region is found at intermediate\nparameters with the Stoner transition occurring at $\\nu\\approx 2$. The spin\nconfiguration in all cases is unambiguously determined by means of inelastic\nlight scattering by spin-sensitive collective excitations. One indicator of the\nspin ordering is the intra-Landau-level spin exciton, which acquires a large\nspectral weight in the ferromagnetic phases. The other - is an abrupt energy\nshift of the intersubband charge density excitation due to change in the\nmany-particle energy contribution upon spin rearrangement.

The data set of the long-term XMM-Newton monitoring program of HD 81809\nis analyzed to study its X-ray cycle, to investigate if the latter is related\nto the chromospheric one, to infer the structure of the corona of HD 81809, and\nto explore if the coronal activity of HD 81809 can be ascribed to phenomena\nsimilar to the solar ones and, therefore, considered an extension of the solar\ncase. Methods. We analyze the observations of HD 81809 performed with\nXMM-Newton with a regular cadence of 6 months from 2001 to 2016 and\nrepresenting one of the longest available observational baseline ($\\sim 15$~yr)\nfor a solar-like star with a well-studied chromospheric cycle (with a period of\n$\\sim 8$~yr). We investigate the modulation of coronal luminosity and\ntemperature and its relation with the chromospheric cycle. We interpret the\ndata in terms of a mixture of solar-like coronal regions, adopting a\nmethodology originally proposed to study the Sun as an X-ray star. Results. The\nobservations show a well-defined regular cyclic modulation of the X-ray\nluminosity that reflects the activity level of HD 81809. The data covers\napproximately two cycles of coronal activity; the modulation has an amplitude\nof a factor of $\\sim 5$ (excluding evident flares, as in the June 2002\nobservation) and a period of $7.3\\pm 1.5$~yr, consistent with that of the\nchromospheric cycle. We demonstrate that the corona of HD 81809 can be\ninterpreted as an extension of the solar case and it can be modeled with a\nmixture of solar-like coronal regions along the whole cycle. The activity level\nis mainly determined by a varying coverage of very bright active regions,\nsimilar to cores of active regions observed in the Sun. Evidence of unresolved\nsignificant flaring activity is present especially in proximity of cycle\nmaxima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 10:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Agent i\ninfluences agent j if they are connected (according to the network topology),\nand if agent j uses the data from agent i to update its online statistic. The\nsolution of this inference task is challenging for two main reasons. First,\nonly the output of the diffusion learning algorithm is available to the\nexternal observer that must perform the inference based on these indirect\nmeasurements. Second, only output measurements from a fraction of the network\nagents is available, with the total number of agents itself being also unknown.\nThe main focus of this article is ascertaining under these demanding conditions\nwhether consistent tomography is possible, namely, whether it is possible to\nreconstruct the interaction profile of the observable portion of the network,\nwith negligible error as the network size increases. We establish a critical\nachievability result, namely, that for symmetric combination policies and for\nany given fraction of observable agents, the interacting and non-interacting\nagent pairs split into two separate clusters as the network size increases.\nThis remarkable property then enables the application of clustering algorithms\nto identify the interacting agents influencing the observations. We provide a\nset of numerical experiments that verify the results for finite network sizes\nand time horizons.

The extended analyticity conjecture (due to Fonseca and\nZamolodchikov) posits that, for $T < T_{\\rm c}$, the Lee-Yang edge\nsingularities are the closest singularities to the real $H$ axis. This has\ninteresting implications, in particular, that the spinodal singularities must\nlie off the real $H$ axis for $d < 4$, in contrast to the commonly known result\nof the mean-field approximation. We find that the parametric representation of\nthe Ising equation of state obtained in the $\\varepsilon = 4-d$ expansion, as\nwell as the equation of state of the ${\\rm O}(N)$-symmetric $\\phi^4$ theory at\nlarge $N$, are both nontrivially consistent with the conjecture.

In the present study, we proposed a state-space\nmodel that explicitly incorporates the biphasic nature of the menstrual cycle,\nin which the probability density distributions for the advancement of the\nmenstrual phase and that for BBT switch depend on a latent state variable. Our\nmodel derives the predictive distribution of the day of the next menstruation\nonset that is adaptively adjusted by accommodating new observations of BBT\nsequentially.

Coarse sampling increases the random noise\nerrors in wavelength by typically 10 - 20% at 2 pixels/FWHM, but with wide\nvariation depending on the functional form of the instrumental Line Spread\nFunction (LSF) and on the pixel phase. Line widths are even more strongly\naffected at low sampling frequencies. However, the noise in fitted peak\namplitudes is minimally affected. Pixellation has a substantial but complex\neffect on the ability to see a relative minimum between two closely-spaced\npeaks (or relative maximum between two absorption lines). The consistent scale\nof resolving power presented by Robertson (2013) is extended to cover\npixellated spectra. The systematic bias errors in wavelength introduced by\npixellation are examined. While they may be negligible for smooth well-sampled\nsymmetric LSFs, they are very sensitive to asymmetry and high spatial frequency\nsubstructure. The Modulation Transfer Function for sampled data is shown to\ngive a useful indication of the extent of improperly sampled signal in an LSF.\nThe common maxim that 2 pixels/FWHM is the Nyquist limit is incorrect and most\nLSFs will exhibit some aliasing at this sample frequency. While 2 pixels/FWHM\nis often an acceptable minimum for moderate signal/noise work, it is preferable\nto carry out simulations for any actual or proposed LSF to find the effects of\nsampling frequency.

Algorithms predicated on merely necessary constraints for\ncausal compatibility typically suffer from false negatives, i.e. they admit\nincompatible distributions as apparently compatible with the given graph. In\n[arXiv:1609.00672], one of us introduced the inflation technique for\nformulating useful relaxations of the causal compatibility problem in terms of\nlinear programming. In this work, we develop a formal hierarchy of such causal\ncompatibility relaxations. We prove that inflation is asymptotically tight,\ni.e., that the hierarchy converges to a zero-error test for causal\ncompatibility. In this sense, the inflation technique fulfills a longstanding\ndesideratum in the field of causal inference. We quantify the rate of\nconvergence by showing that any distribution which passes the $n^{th}$-order\ninflation test must be $O\\left(n^{-1/2}\\right)$-close in Euclidean norm to some\ndistribution genuinely compatible with the given causal structure. Furthermore,\nwe show that for many causal structures, the (unrelaxed) causal compatibility\nproblem is faithfully formulated already by either the first or second order\ninflation test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 12:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 17:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 19:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

There is a significant scatter in gradients at a given\nmass, which originates from the last path, and therefore from galaxy type.

We measure equivalent widths similar to values found during more\nactive phases in the past, indicating that the low-luminosity state is not\nsimply triggered by a smaller Be disk. The NuSTAR data, taken at a 3-78 keV\nluminosity of ~6.8e35 erg/s (for a distance of 7.1 kpc), are well described by\nstandard accreting pulsar models, such as an absorbed power-law with a\nhigh-energy cutoff. We find that pulsations are still clearly visible at these\nluminosities, indicating that accretion is continuing despite the very low mass\ntransfer rate. In phase-resolved spectroscopy we find a peculiar variation of\nthe photon index from ~1.5 to ~2.5 over only about 3% of the rotational period.\nThis variation is similar to that observed with XMM-Newton at much higher\nluminosities. It may be connected to the accretion column passing through our\nline of sight. With Swift/XRT we observe luminosities as low as 1e34 erg/s\nduring which the data quality did not allow us to search for pulsations, but\nthe spectrum is much softer and well described by either a blackbody or soft\npower-law continuum. This softer spectrum might be due to the fact that\naccretion has been stopped by the propeller effect and we only observe the\nneutron star surface cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 07:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The aim is to compute the cheapest network $N\\subseteq G$ for\nwhich there is an $s\\to t$ path for each $(s,t)\\in\\mathcal{D}$. It is known\nthat this problem is notoriously hard as there is no\n$k^{1/4-o(1)}$-approximation algorithm under Gap-ETH, even when parametrizing\nthe runtime by $k$ [Dinur & Manurangsi, ITCS 2018]. In light of this, we\nsystematically study several special cases of DSN and determine their\nparameterized approximability for the parameter $k$.\n  For the bi-DSN$_\\text{Planar}$ problem, the aim is to compute a solution\n$N\\subseteq G$ whose cost is at most that of an optimum planar solution in a\nbidirected graph $G$, i.e., for every edge $uv$ of $G$ the reverse edge $vu$\nexists and has the same weight. This problem is a generalization of several\nwell-studied special cases. Our main result is that this problem admits a\nparameterized approximation scheme (PAS) for $k$. We also prove that our result\nis tight in the sense that (a) the runtime of our PAS cannot be significantly\nimproved, and (b) it is unlikely that a PAS exists for any generalization of\nbi-DSN$_\\text{Planar}$, unless FPT=W[1].\n  One important special case of DSN is the Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph\n(SCSS) problem, for which the solution network $N\\subseteq G$ needs to strongly\nconnect a given set of $k$ terminals. It has been observed before that for SCSS\na parameterized $2$-approximation exists when parameterized by $k$ [Chitnis et\nal., IPEC 2013]. We give a tight inapproximability result by showing that for\n$k$ no parameterized $(2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm exists under\nGap-ETH.

When the chirp intensity\nvanishes a perfect periodic system, with bands and gaps, is obtained. The\nmechanical rainbow trapping effect occurs for small values of the chirp\nintensity. The wave packet traveling along the beam is progressively slowing\ndown and is reflected back at a certain depth, which depends on its central\nfrequency.

In this paper, we propose\na novel guidance system for intra-arterial procedures using a distributed\nstrain sensing device based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to\ntrack the shape of a catheter. Tracking enhancement is provided by exposing a\nfiber triplet to a focused ultraviolet beam, producing high scattering\nproperties. Contrary to typical quasi-distributed strain sensors, we propose a\ntruly distributed strain sensing approach, which allows to reconstruct a fiber\ntriplet in real-time. A 3D roadmap of the hepatic anatomy integrated with a 4D\nMR imaging sequence allows to navigate the catheter within the\npre-interventional anatomy, and map the blood flow velocities in the arterial\ntree. We employed Riemannian anisotropic heat kernels to map the sensed data to\nthe pre-interventional model. Experiments in synthetic phantoms and an in vivo\nmodel are presented. Results show that the tracking accuracy is suitable for\ninterventional tracking applications, with a mean 3D shape reconstruction\nerrors of 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm.

Typical Length avoids the inherent dependence of the Large\nFish Indicator on a parameter that requires case-by-case adjustments.

Any practical implementation of\nsuch a memory cell calls for a strong miniaturization, at which point\nfluctuations start playing a role that cannot be neglected. A detailed\nunderstanding of switching mechanisms and reliability is essential. For this\nreason, we formulate a particle model based on the stochastic motion of oxygen\nvacancies. It allows us to investigate fluctuations in the resistance states of\na switch with two active zones. The vacancies' dynamics is governed by a master\nequation. Upon the application of a voltage pulse, the vacancies travel\ncollectively through the switch. By deriving a generalized Burgers equation we\ncan interpret this collective motion as nonlinear traveling waves, and\nnumerically verify this result. Further, we define binary logical states by\nmeans of the underlying vacancy distributions, and establish a framework of\nwriting and reading such memory element with voltage pulses. Considerations\nabout the dis- criminability of these operations under fluctuations together\nwith the markedness of the resistive switching effect itself lead to the\nconclusion, that an intermediate vacancy number is optimal for performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Preamble added","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"q-fin.GN","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"  In this theoretical paper, I propose creation of a venture bank, able to\nmultiply the capital of a venture capital firm by at least 47 times, without\nrequiring access to the Federal Reserve or other central bank apart from\nsettlement. This concept rests on obtaining default swap instruments on loans\nin order to create the capital required, and expand Tier 1 and 2 base capital.\nProfitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of equity\ndefault swaps, cost of default swap, and the multiple of original capital (MOC)\nadopted by the venture bank. A new derivative financial instrument, the equity\ndefault swap (EDS), to cover loans made as venture investments. An EDS is\nsimilar to a credit default swap (CDS) but with some unique features. The\nfeatures and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along\nwith audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry\nexchanges with special features to ensure orderly operation of the market. It\nis the creation of public markets for EDSs that makes possible the use of\npublic market pricing to indirectly provide a potential market capitalization\nfor the underlying venture-bank investment. Full coverage insulates the\nventure-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite\ndramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 20X are attainable.\nFurther, a new feature for EDS derivatives, a clawback lien, closes out the\nequity default swap. Here it is optimized at 77%, and is to be paid back to the\nunderwriter at a future date to prevent perverse incentive to deliberately\nfail. This new feature creates an Equity Default Clawback Swap (EDCS) which can\nbe used safely. This proposal also solves an old problem in banking, because it\nmatches the term of the loan with the term of the investment. I show that the\nventure-bank investment and the EDCS underwriting business are profitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 22:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 20:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 23:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 07:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 02:35:49 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 21:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}
