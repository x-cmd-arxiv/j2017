We\nintroduce a two-stage neural-network grounding pipeline that maps natural\nlanguage referring expressions directly to objects in the images. The first\nstage uses visual descriptions in the referring expressions to generate a\ncandidate set of relevant objects. The second stage examines all pairwise\nrelationships between the candidates and predicts the most likely referred\nobject according to the spatial descriptions in the referring expressions. A\nkey feature of our system is that by leveraging a large dataset of images\nlabeled with text descriptions, it allows unrestricted object types and natural\nlanguage referring expressions.

However complex evolutionary events, such as genetic\nreassortments or hybrid speciations which occur commonly in viruses, bacteria\nand plants, do not fit into this elementary framework. Alternatively, various\nnetwork representations have been developed. Circular networks are a natural\ngeneralization of leaf-labeled trees interpreted as split systems, that is,\ncollections of bipartitions over leaf labels corresponding to current species.\nAlthough such networks do not explicitly model specific evolutionary events of\ninterest, their straightforward visualization and fast reconstruction have made\nthem a popular exploratory tool to detect network-like evolution in genetic\ndatasets.\n  Standard reconstruction methods for circular networks, such as Neighbor-Net,\nrely on an associated metric on the species set. Such a metric is first\nestimated from DNA sequences, which leads to a key difficulty: distantly\nrelated sequences produce statistically unreliable estimates. This is\nproblematic for Neighbor-Net as it is based on the popular tree reconstruction\nmethod Neighbor-Joining, whose sensitivity to distance estimation errors is\nwell established theoretically. In the tree case, more robust reconstruction\nmethods have been developed using the notion of a distorted metric, which\ncaptures the dependence of the error in the distance through a radius of\naccuracy. Here we design the first circular network reconstruction method based\non distorted metrics. Our method is computationally efficient. Moreover, the\nanalysis of its radius of accuracy highlights the important role played by the\nmaximum incompatibility, a measure of the extent to which the network differs\nfrom a tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

Furthermore, the 1538 nm emission in\nSiC:Ox NW PC was found to be modulated linearly with the PC lattice periodicity\nof the structure. The observed characteristics reveal the efficient\nEr3+-emission extraction from the technologically-friendly SiC:Ox NW PC\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:50:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 20:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have shown\npromising performance in this task due to their strengths in modeling the\ndependencies and dynamics in sequential data. As not all skeletal joints are\ninformative for action recognition, and the irrelevant joints often bring noise\nwhich can degrade the performance, we need to pay more attention to the\ninformative ones. However, the original LSTM network does not have explicit\nattention ability. In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network,\nGlobal Context-Aware Attention LSTM (GCA-LSTM), for skeleton based action\nrecognition. This network is capable of selectively focusing on the informative\njoints in each frame of each skeleton sequence by using a global context memory\ncell. To further improve the attention capability of our network, we also\nintroduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention performance\nof the network can be enhanced progressively. Moreover, we propose a stepwise\ntraining scheme in order to train our network effectively.

Extragalactic\njets are well collimated and relativistic, both in terms of thermodynamics and\nkinematics. They generate strong shocks in the ambient medium, associated with\nobserved hotspots, and carve cavities that are filled with the shocked jet\nflow. In this Letter, we compare the pressure evolution in the hotspot and the\ncavity generated by relativistic and classical jets. Our results show that the\nclassical approach underestimates the cavity pressure by a factor larger or\nequal to 2 for a given shocked volume during the whole active phase. The\ntension between both approaches can only be alleviated by unrealistic jet flow\ndensities or gigantic jet areas in the classical case. As a consequence, the\nefficiency of a relativistic jet heating the ambient is typically around 20%\nlarger compared with a classical jet, and the heated volume is 2 to 10 times\nlarger during the time evolution. This conflict translates into two\nsubstantially disparate manners, both spatially and temporal, of heating the\nambient medium.

However, the mechanism\nthrough which proteins without any sources or sinks form such single-cell\ngradients is not yet fully understood. One of the models for such gradient\nformation, based on differential diffusion, is limited to proteins with large\nratios of their diffusion constants or to specific protein-large molecule\ninteractions. We introduce a novel mechanism for gradient formation via the\ncoupling of the proteins within a single cell with a molecule, that we call a\n\"pronogen\", whose action is similar to that of morphogens in multi-cell\nassemblies, the pronogen is produced with a fixed flux at one side of the cell.\nThis coupling results in an effectively non-linear diffusion degradation model\nfor the pronogen dynamics within the cell, which leads to a steady-state\ngradient of the protein concentration. We use a stability analysis to show that\nthese gradients are linearly stable with respect to perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 18:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 17:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

On\nthese long timescales, the quiescent light curve is dominated by high\namplitude, short term (seconds-days) variability spanning ~ 2 magnitudes, with\nan increasing trend of the mean flux from 2012 to 2017 that is steeper than in\nany other X-ray binary found to date (0.17 mag/yr).

Previous studies have shown\nthat the quiescent spectral, polarimetric and rapid variability properties of\nSwift J1357.2-0933 are consistent with synchrotron emission from a weak compact\njet. We find that a variable optical/infrared spectrum is responsible for the\nbrightening: a steep, red spectrum before and soon after the 2011 outburst\nevolves to a brighter, flatter spectrum since 2013. The evolving spectrum\nappears to be due to the jet spectral break shifting from the infrared in 2012\nto the optical in 2013, then back to the infrared by 2016-2017 while the\noptical remains relatively bright.

Each\nindividual in the network is charged with minimizing the global objective\nfunction, which is an average of sum of the statistical average loss function\nof each agent in the network. Since agents are not assumed to observe data from\nidentical distributions, the hypothesis that all agents seek a common action is\nviolated, and thus the hypothesis upon which consensus constraints are\nformulated is violated. Thus, we consider nonlinear network proximity\nconstraints which incentivize nearby nodes to make decisions which are close to\none another but not necessarily coincide. Moreover, agents are not assumed to\nreceive their sequentially arriving observations on a common time index, and\nthus seek to learn in an asynchronous manner. An asynchronous stochastic\nvariant of the Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point method is proposed to solve this\nproblem which operates by alternating primal stochastic descent steps and\nLagrange multiplier updates which penalize the discrepancies between agents.\nThis tool leads to an implementation that allows for each agent to operate\nasynchronously with local information only and message passing with neighbors.\nOur main result establishes that the proposed method yields convergence in\nexpectation both in terms of the primal sub-optimality and constraint violation\nto radii of sizes $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$,\nrespectively.

When the majority of tests are\nnull, procedures controlling the False discovery rate (Fdr) can be improved by\nreplacing the theoretical global null with its empirical estimate. However,\nthese other adjustment procedures remain sensitive to the working model\nassumption. Here we propose two key ideas to improve inference in this space.\nFirst, we propose $p$-values that are standardized to the empirical null\ndistribution (instead of the theoretical null). Second, we propose model\naveraging $p$-values by bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) to account for model\nuncertainty and selection procedures. The combination of these two key ideas\nyields bagged empirical null $p$-values (BEN $p$-values) that often\ndramatically alter the rank ordering of significant findings.

The underlying assumption is that the overall two-agent scheme can\nreach desired performance level even if only one of the agents performs\nsatisfactorily, hence there exist two independent opportunities to estimate.\nThe notion of altruism motivates a new definition of cooperative estimation\noptimality that generalizes the common definition of minimum mean squared error\noptimality. Fundamental equations are derived for two types of altruistic\ncooperative estimation problems, corresponding to heterarchical and\nhierarchical setups. Although these equations are, generally, hard to solve,\ntheir solution in the Gaussian case is straightforward and only entails the\ncomputation of the largest eigenvalue of the conditional covariance matrix and\nits corresponding eigenvector. Moreover, in the Gaussian case the performance\nimprovement of the two altruistic cooperative estimation techniques over the\nconventional (egoistic) estimation approach is shown to depend on the problem's\ndimensionality and statistical distribution.

Tasks arrive at the various servers as independent Poisson\nprocesses of rate $\\lambda$. Each incoming task is irrevocably assigned to\nwhichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where it\nappears and its neighbors in $G_N$. Tasks have unit-mean exponential service\ntimes and leave the system upon service completion.\n  The above model has been extensively investigated in the case $G_N$ is a\nclique. Since the servers are exchangeable in that case, the queue length\nprocess is quite tractable, and it has been proved that for any $\\lambda < 1$,\nthe fraction of servers with two or more tasks vanishes in the limit as $N \\to\n\\infty$. For an arbitrary graph $G_N$, the lack of exchangeability severely\ncomplicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than\nfor a clique. Accordingly, a graph $G_N$ is said to be $N$-optimal or\n$\\sqrt{N}$-optimal when the occupancy process on $G_N$ is equivalent to that on\na clique on an $N$-scale or $\\sqrt{N}$-scale, respectively.\n  We prove that if $G_N$ is an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph with average\ndegree $d(N)$, then it is with high probability $N$-optimal and\n$\\sqrt{N}$-optimal if $d(N) \\to \\infty$ and $d(N) / (\\sqrt{N} \\log(N)) \\to\n\\infty$ as $N \\to \\infty$, respectively.

The proposed\nmodel can be extended to any gas mixture for which molecular relaxation\ntimescales and attenuation measurements are available. The performance of the\nmodel is assessed for air by varying the base temperature, pressure, relative\nhumidity $h_r$, and acoustic frequency.

The transport of polarized light is\nmodeled by the Vector Radiative Transfer Equation (VRTE), an\nintegro-differential equation. Computing solution to that equation is\nexpensive. The Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM) is a common approach to solving\nthe VRTE. Such solvers are very time consuming for complex uses such as BRDF\ncomputation, where one must solve VRTE for surface radiance distribution due to\nlight incident from every direction of the hemisphere above the surface.

The\nstochastic model admits several kinds of noise-driven mixed-mode oscillations\nwhich capture the intermediate dynamics between two cycles of population\noutbreaks. Depending on the strength of noise, the prey population exhibits\nintermediate to high-amplitude fluctuations (related to moderate or severe\noutbreaks respectively). We classify these fluctuations as isolated or\nintermittent or as clusters depending on their recurrences. We study the\ndistribution of the random variable $N$, representing the number of small\noscillations between successive spikes, as a function of the noise intensity\nand the distance to the Hopf bifurcation. The distribution of $N$ is\n\"asymptotically geometric\" with the corresponding parameter related to the\nprincipal eigenvalue of a substochastic Markov chain. Finally, the stochastic\nmodel is transformed into its \"normal form\" which is used to obtain an estimate\nof the probability of repeated outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 22:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

Epidemiologists have warned that risk ratios may be\nmisleading when outcomes are contagious, but the nature and severity of this\nerror is not well understood. In this study, we assess the epidemiologic\nmeaning of the risk ratio when outcomes are contagious. We first give a\nstructural definition of infectious disease transmission within clusters, based\non the canonical susceptible-infective epidemic model. From this standard\ncharacterization, we define the individual-level ratio of instantaneous risks\n(hazard ratio) as the inferential target, and evaluate the properties of the\nrisk ratio as an estimate of this quantity. We exhibit analytically and by\nsimulation the circumstances under which the risk ratio implies an effect whose\ndirection is opposite that of the true individual-level hazard ratio. In\nparticular, the risk ratio can be greater than one even when the covariate of\ninterest reduces both individual-level susceptibility to infection, and\ntransmissibility once infected. We explain these findings in the epidemiologic\nlanguage of confounding and relate the direction bias to Simpson's paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 22:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

The key advantage of such states compared to simple Gaussian states is\npresence of non-factorizable correlations and the possibility of describing\nstates with strong entanglement between particles. In contrast to the commonly\nused canonical transformations, such as the polaron or Lang-Firsov\ntransformations, we allow parameters of the transformations to be time\ndependent, which extends their regions of applicability. We derive equations of\nmotion for the parameters characterizing the states both in real and imaginary\ntime using the differential structure of the variational manifold. The ground\nstate can be found by following the imaginary time evolution until it converges\nto a steady state. Collective excitations in the system can be obtained by\nlinearizing the real-time equations of motion in the vicinity of the imaginary\ntime steady-state solution. Our formalism allows us not only to determine the\nenergy spectrum of quasiparticles and their lifetime, but to obtain the\ncomplete spectral functions and to explore far out of equilibrium dynamics such\nas coherent evolution following a quantum quench. We illustrate and benchmark\nthis framework with several examples: a single polaron in the Holstein and\nSu-Schrieer-Heeger models, non-equilibrium dynamics in the spin-boson and Kondo\nmodels, the superconducting to charge density wave phase transitions in the\nHolstein model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 00:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The effective dissipation that emerges from this simple,\nclassical model with no ad hoc terms shows, surprisingly, a range of rich,\nnon-trivial, behavior.

Therefore, deep neural\nnetwork models are often trained separately for different verticals. However,\nusing specialized models for different verticals is not scalable and expensive\nto deploy. This paper addresses the problem of learning one unified embedding\nmodel for multiple object verticals (e.g. all apparel classes) without\nsacrificing accuracy. The problem is tackled from two aspects: training data\nand training difficulty. On the training data aspect, we figure out that for a\nsingle model trained with triplet loss, there is an accuracy sweet spot in\nterms of how many verticals are trained together. To ease the training\ndifficulty, a novel learning scheme is proposed by using the output from\nspecialized models as learning targets so that L2 loss can be used instead of\ntriplet loss. This new loss makes the training easier and make it possible for\nmore efficient use of the feature space. The end result is a unified model\nwhich can achieve the same retrieval accuracy as a number of separate\nspecialized models, while having the model complexity as one.

In this\npaper, we adopt multi-antenna techniques to overcome the bottleneck and\ninvestigate the performance of single-user beamforming, an effective method to\nenhance desired signal power, in small cell networks from the perspective of\nuser coverage probability (CP) and network spatial throughput (ST).\nPessimistically, it is proved that, even when multi-antenna techniques are\napplied, both CP and ST would be degraded and even asymptotically diminish to\nzero with the increasing base station (BS) density. Moreover, the results also\nreveal that the increase of ST is at the expense of the degradation of CP.\nTherefore, to balance the tradeoff between user and system performance, we\nfurther study the critical density, under which ST could be maximized under the\nCP constraint. Accordingly, the impact of key system parameters on critical\ndensity is quantified via the derived closed-form expression. Especially, the\ncritical density is shown to be inversely proportional to the square of antenna\nheight difference between BSs and users. Meanwhile, single-user beamforming,\nalbeit incapable of improving CP and ST scaling laws, is shown to significantly\nincrease the critical density, compared to the single-antenna regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 07:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

To evaluate the contribution of different regions to the SMMF, we\nseparated all the pixels of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into three subsets: weak\n(B_W), intermediate (B_I), and strong (B_S) fields.

In summary, we found\nthat regardless of the threshold level, only a small part of the solar disk\narea contributes to the SMMF. This means that the photospheric magnetic\nstructure is an intermittent, inherently porous medium, resembling a\npercolation cluster. These findings suggest that the long-standing concept that\ncontinuous vast unipolar areas on the solar surface are the source of the SMMF\nmay need to be reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 08:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Unfortunately, results based on them are\nnon-constructive, as their proofs inherently use an induction on overlapping\nsubgraphs and these overlaps hinder to bound the running time to a polynomial.\nFor special cases however, computational results of Tutte paths are known: For\n4-connected planar graphs, Tutte paths are in fact Hamiltonian paths and Chiba\nand Nishizeki showed how to compute such paths in linear time. For 3-connected\nplanar graphs, Tutte paths have a more complicated structure, and it has only\nrecently been shown that they can be computed in polynomial time. However,\nTutte paths are defined for general 2-connected planar graphs and this is what\nmost applications need. Unfortunately, no computational results are known. We\ngive the first efficient algorithm that computes a Tutte path (for the general\ncase of 2-connected planar graphs). One of the strongest existence results\nabout such Tutte paths is due to Sanders, which allows to prescribe the end\nvertices and an intermediate edge of the desired path. Encompassing and\nstrengthening all previous computational results on Tutte paths, we show how to\ncompute this special Tutte path efficiently.

The goal is to make the\nlabels as short as possible. Alstrup, Gavoille, Kaplan, and Rauhe [Theor.\nComput. Syst. 37(3):441-456 2004] showed that $O(\\log n)$-bit labels are\nenough. More recently, Alstrup, Halvorsen, and Larsen [SODA 2014] refined this\nto only $2.772\\log n$, and provided a lower bound of $1.008\\log n$.\n  We connect designing a labeling scheme for nearest common ancestors to the\nexistence of a tree, called a minor-universal tree, that contains every tree on\n$n$ nodes as a topological minor. Even though it is not clear if a labeling\nscheme must be based on such a notion, we argue that the existing schemes can\nbe reformulated as such, and it allows us to obtain clean and good bounds on\nthe length of the labels. As the main upper bound, we show that $2.318\\log\nn$-bit labels are enough. Surprisingly, the notion of a minor-universal tree\nfor binary trees on $n$ nodes has been already used in a different context by\nHrubes et al. [CCC 2010], and Young, Chu, and Wong [J. ACM 46(3):416-435, 1999]\nintroduced a closely related notion of a universal tree. On the lower bound\nside, we show that the size of any minor-universal tree for trees on $n$ nodes\nis $\\Omega(n^{2.174})$. This highlights a natural limitation for all approaches\nbased on such trees. Our lower bound technique also implies that the size of\nany universal tree in the sense of Young et al. is $\\Omega(n^{2.185})$, thus\ndramatically improves their lower bound of $\\Omega(n\\log n)$. We complement the\nexistential results with a generic transformation that decreases the query time\nto constant in any scheme based on a minor-universal tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 10:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

The\nNambu-Goldstone coset containing the Higgs field, or Higgs coset, is either\n$SU(4)/Sp(4)$ or $SU(5)/SO(5)$, whereas the top partners live in two-index\nrepresentations of the relevant flavor group ($SU(4)$ or $SU(5)$).

Their\npredictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the\ngravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the\nelectromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational\ncoupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine\nstructure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the\ndetection of gravitons -- the hypothetical quanta of energy of the\ngravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals -- is deemed\nto be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different,\nquantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that\nquantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness\nquantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses\neach in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any\nsystem (e.g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum\nsystems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on\nany specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the\nentanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our\nargument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an indirect witness\nof the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this\nexperiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself.

Contrary to other models, here noise is\nintrinsic to the neurons through a membrane-potential dependent spiking rate\nprobability, that we assume to be given by a power law. This allows one to\ncollapse several sources of neural noise into a single function, which aids for\na more treatable mathematical and comptuational analysis. In particular, we\ngive pseudo-analytical expressions for the invariant distributions of membrane\npotentials across the population and study their stability computationally. The\nneurons are assumed to be connected both by chemical and possibly electrical\n(gap junction) synapses and can also undergo a leakage of ions with the\nextracellular medium. The distributions are of compact support whenever leakage\nor gap junction rates are non-zero and an infinite discontinuity appears at the\nmaximum potential in the population. This happens invariably for the leakage\n(with no gap junctions) and gap junction (without leakage) cases. However,\nthese discontinuous distributions might only be stable for linear spiking rate\nfunctions. It was recently shown how the network can present highly synchronous\nstates of global oscillations in its activity when leakage is not present and\ngap junctions are strong enough. Here we confirm how oscillations persist also\nwhen weak leakage is considered. Thus, these dendritic (rather than axonal) gap\njunctions could play a role in the high levels of neural synchrony necessary\nfor the development of neural systems at young ages. The model, thus, presents\na rich phenomenology and capability to reproduce several biological features of\nneural networks despite of its mathematical simplicity, hence presenting a\npowerful tool for high performance computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

And size\neffects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs to\naccount for contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient\nbased higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well\nestablished to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids\ndirectly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher\norder elastic instabilities is established and justified by developing an\nequivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical\ninstability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is\ndetermined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain\ngradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the\nhigher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be\ndirectly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of\nthe stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals,\ni.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression\ntechnique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed\nto study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted\ncritical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with the results from the\nNEMD simulations for all the metals.

The stagnant lid may rather be the\nmost common tectonic expression on such bodies. To understand whether a\nstagnant-lid planet can be habitable, i.e. host liquid water at its surface, we\nmodel the thermal evolution of the mantle, volcanic outgassing of H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, and resulting climate of an Earth-like planet lacking plate tectonics.\nWe used a 1D model of parameterized convection to simulate the evolution of\nmelt generation and the build-up of an atmosphere of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ over 4.5\nGyr. We then employed a 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model to calculate\nthe global mean atmospheric temperature and the boundaries of the habitable\nzone (HZ). The evolution of the interior is characterized by the initial\nproduction of a large amount of partial melt accompanied by a rapid outgassing\nof H$_2$O and CO$_2$. At 1 au, the obtained temperatures generally allow for\nliquid water on the surface nearly over the entire evolution. While the outer\nedge of the HZ is mostly influenced by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, the\ninner edge presents a more complex behaviour that is dependent on the partial\npressures of both gases. At 1 au, the stagnant-lid planet considered would be\nregarded as habitable. The width of the HZ at the end of the evolution, albeit\ninfluenced by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, can vary in a non-monotonic way\ndepending on the extent of the outgassed H$_2$O reservoir. Our results suggest\nthat stagnant-lid planets can be habitable over geological timescales and that\njoint modelling of interior evolution, volcanic outgassing, and accompanying\nclimate is necessary to robustly characterize planetary habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The basic idea is to employ a relationship\nbetween unified formalism for a Griffiths variational problem and its classical\nLepage-equivalent variational problem. As a way to understand from an intuitive\nviewpoint the Griffiths variational problem approach considered here, we may\nsay the variations of the Palatini Lagrangian are performed in such a way that\nthe so called metricity condition, i.e. (part of) the condition ensuring that\nthe connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric specified by the\nvielbein, is preserved. From the same perspective, the classical\nLepage-equivalent problem is a geometrical implementation of the Lagrange\nmultipliers trick, so that the metricity condition is incorporated directly\ninto the Palatini Lagrangian. The main geometrical tools involved in these\nconstructions are canonical forms living on the first jet of the frame bundle\nfor the spacetime manifold $M$. These forms play an essential r\\^ole in\nproviding a global version of the Palatini Lagrangian and expressing the\nmetricity condition in an invariant form; with their help, it was possible to\nformulate an unified formalism for Palatini gravity in a geometrical fashion.\nMoreover, we were also able to find the associated equations of motion in\ninvariant terms and, by using previous results from the literature, to prove\ntheir involutivity. As a bonus, we showed how this construction can be used to\nprovide a unified formalism for the so called unimodular gravity by employing a\nreduction of the structure group of the principal bundle $LM$ to the special\nlinear group $SL\\left(m\\right),m=\\mathop{\\text{dim}}{M}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We study coarsening - the growth of extended domains\nwherein the binary mixture phase separates into its component parts. The\ncoarsening is characterized by two competing effects: flow, and the\nCahn-Hilliard diffusion term, which drives the phase separation. Based on\nextensive two-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we construct a\nflow-pattern map outlining the relative strength of these effects in different\nparts of the parameter space. The map reveals large regions of parameter space\nwhere a standard theory applies, and where the domains grow algebraically in\ntime. However, there are significant parts of the parameter space where the\nstandard theory does not apply. In one region, corresponding to low values of\nviscosity and diffusion, the coarsening is accelerated compared to the standard\ntheory. Previous studies involving Stokes flow report on this phenomenon; we\ncomplete the picture by demonstrating that this anomalous regime occurs not\nonly for Stokes flow, but also, for flows dominated by inertia. In a second\nregion, corresponding to arbitrary viscosities and high Cahn-Hilliard\ndiffusion, the diffusion overwhelms the hydrodynamics altogether, and the\nlatter can effectively be ignored, in contrast to the prediction of the\nstandard scaling theory. Based on further high-resolution simulations in three\ndimensions, we find that broadly speaking, the above description holds there\nalso, although the formation of the anomalous domains in the\nlow-viscosity-low-diffusion part of the parameter space is delayed in three\ndimensions compared to two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Whereas many previous SZ studies\nhave parameterized the pressure profiles of galaxy clusters, non-parametric\nreconstructions will provide insights into the thermodynamic state of the\nintracluster medium (ICM). Aims: We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure\nprofiles of the high redshift ($z=0.89$) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as\ninferred from SZ data from the MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and Planck instruments,\nwhich all probe different angular scales. Methods: Our non-parametric algorithm\nmakes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of\nellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam\nwe derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good\nagreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric\nprofiles are consistent with a fitted gNFW profile. Given the ability of Planck\nto constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton Y\nparameter as determined by Planck. Results: For a given instrument, constraints\non the pressure profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap\nin spatial scales probed by these four datasets is therefore critical in\nchecking for consistency between instruments. By using multiple instruments,\nour analysis of CLJ 1226.9+3332 covers a large radial range, from the central\nregions to the cluster outskirts: $0.05 R_{500} < r < 1.1 R_{500}$. This is a\nwider range of spatial scales than is typical recovered by SZ instruments.\nSimilar analyses will be possible with the new generation of SZ instruments\nsuch as NIKA2 and MUSTANG2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Simultaneously, a striking\nadvantage of metal nanocrystals over semiconductors lies in their very large\nabsorption cross sections. Therefore, metal nanostructures with strong and\ntailored plasmonic resonances are very attractive for photocatalytic\napplications. However, the central questions regarding plasmonic hot electrons\nare how to quantify and extract the optically-excited energetic electrons in a\nnanocrystal. We develop a theory describing the generation rates and the\nenergy-distributions of hot electrons in nanocrystals with various geometries.\nIn our theory, hot electrons are generated owing to surfaces and hot spots. The\nformalism predicts that large optically-excited nanocrystals show the\nexcitation of mostly low-energy Drude electrons, whereas plasmons in small\nnanocrystals involve mostly hot electrons. The energy distributions of\nelectrons in an optically-excited nanocrystal show how the quantum many-body\nstate in small particles evolves towards the classical state described by the\nDrude model when increasing nanocrystal size. We show that the rate of surface\ndecay of plasmons in nanocrystals is directly related to the rate of generation\nof hot electrons. Based on a detailed many-body theory involving kinetic\ncoefficients, we formulate a simple scheme describing the plasmon's dephasing.\nIn most nanocrystals, the main decay mechanism of a plasmon is the Drude\nfriction-like process and the secondary path comes from generation of hot\nelectrons due to surfaces and electromagnetic hot spots. This latter path\nstrongly depends on the size, shape and material of the nanocrystal,\ncorrespondingly affecting its efficiency of hot-electron production.

While the kernel\nmatrix involves inner products in the feature space, the sample covariance\nmatrix of the data requires outer products. Therefore, their spectral\nproperties are tightly connected. This allows us to examine the kernel matrix\nthrough the sample covariance matrix in the feature space and vice versa. The\nuse of kernels often involves a large number of features, compared to the\nnumber of observations. In this scenario, the sample covariance matrix is not\nwell-conditioned nor is it necessarily invertible, mandating a solution to the\nproblem of estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices under small sample\nsize conditions. We tackle this problem through the use of a shrinkage\nestimator that offers a compromise between the sample covariance matrix and a\nwell-conditioned matrix (also known as the \"target\") with the aim of minimizing\nthe mean-squared error (MSE). We propose a distribution-free kernel matrix\nregularization approach that is tuned directly from the kernel matrix, avoiding\nthe need to address the feature space explicitly.

To address the first issue, we investigate\nseveral types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that can model both the\nconversation context and the sarcastic response. We show that the conditional\nLSTM network (Rocktaschel et al., 2015) and LSTM networks with sentence level\nattention on context and response outperform the LSTM model that reads only the\nresponse. To address the second issue, we present a qualitative analysis of\nattention weights produced by the LSTM models with attention and discuss the\nresults compared with human performance on the task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 01:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

A duality will be\na suitable isomorphism between models: and the four relevant contrasts are as\nfollows:\n  (a) Bare theory: a triple of states, quantities, and dynamics endowed with\nappropriate structures and symmetries; vs. interpreted theory: which is endowed\nwith, in addition, a suitable pair of interpretative maps.\n  (b) Extendable vs. unextendable theories: which can, respectively cannot, be\nextended as regards their domains of application.\n  (c) External vs. internal intepretations: which are constructed,\nrespectively, by coupling the theory to another interpreted theory vs. from\nwithin the theory itself.\n  (d) Theoretical vs. physical equivalence: which contrasts formal equivalence\nwith the equivalence of fully interpreted theories.\n  I apply this scheme to answering questions (iii)-(iv) for gauge/gravity\ndualities.

Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured\nby different clocks depends on their relative motion and on the strength of the\ngravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the time\nparameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks (i.e., clocks at rest with\nrespect to the expanding space). This proper time is assumed to flow at a\nconstant rate throughout the whole history of the universe. We make the\nalternative hypothesis that the rate at which the cosmological time flows\ndepends on the dynamical state of the universe. In thermodynamics, the arrow of\ntime is strongly related to the second law, which states that the entropy of an\nisolated system will always increase with time or, at best, stay constant.\nHence, we assume that the time measured by fundamental clocks is proportional\nto the entropy of the region of the universe that is causally connected to\nthem. Under that simple assumption, we find it possible to build toy\ncosmological models that present an acceleration of their expansion without any\nneed for dark energy while being spatially closed and finite, avoiding the need\nto deal with infinite values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

The methodology is\nillustrated with the homogenization of thermo-mechanical properties of three\ntwo-dimensional microstructure models: a microstructure with mono-disperse\nelliptic inclusions, foam, and sandstone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 12:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

Two main factors called beta amyloid plaques and tangles are\nprime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells. However, oxidative stress,\nthe process which produces free radicals in cells, is believed to promote its\nprogression to the extent that it may responsible for the cognitive and\nfunctional decline observed in AD. As of today there are few FDA approved drugs\nin the market for treatment, but their cholinergic adverse effect, potentially\ndistressing toxicity and limited targets in AD pathology limits their use.\nTherefore, it is crucial to find an effective compounds to combat AD. We choose\n45 plant derived natural compounds that have antioxidant properties to slow\ndown disease progression by quenching free redicals or promoting endogenous\nantioxidant capacity. However, we performed molecular docking studies to\ninvestigate the binding interactions between natural compounds and 13 various\nanti Alzheimer drug targets. Three known Cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil,\nGalantamine and Rivastigmine) were taken as reference drugs over natural\ncompounds for comparison and drug likeness studies. Few of these compounds\nshowed good inhibitory activity besides anti oxidant activity. Most of these\ncompounds followed pharmacokinetics properties that make them potentially\npromising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 05:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}
