In this work we predict a third class of topological\nsuperconductivity and Majorana modes, in which they appear exclusively in the\npresence of impurity disorder. Observation and control of Majorana fermions and\nother non-Abelions often requires a symmetry leading to a gap in a\nsingle-particle spectra. Disorder introduces states into the gap and enables\nconductance and proximity-induced superconductivity via the in-gap states. We\nshow that disorder-enabled topological superconductivity can be realized in a\nquantum Hall ferromagnet, when helical domain walls are coupled to an s-wave\nsuperconductor. Solving a general quantum mechanical problem of impurity bound\nstates in a system of spin-orbit coupled Landau levels, we show that\ndisorder-induced Majorana modes emerge in a setting of the quantum Hall\nferromagnetic transition in a CdMnTe quantum wells at a filling factor $\\nu=2$.\nRecent experiments on transport through electrostatically controlled single\ndomain wall in this system indicated the vital role of disorder in conductance,\nbut left an unresolved question whether this could intrinsically preclude\ngeneration of Majorana fermions.

A key tool is to employ the smooth Cheeger-Gromov compactness\ntheorem to obtain general and essentially sharp a priori estimates for Gauss\ncurvatures $K$ contained in naturally defined stable regions. We prove that in\nsuch stable regions, the map $u \\rightarrow K_{g}$, $g = e^{2u}g_{+1}$ is a\nproper Fredholm map with well-defined degree on each component. This leads to a\nnumber of new existence and non-existence results. We also present a new proof\nand generalization of the Moser theorem on Gauss curvatures of even conformal\nmetrics on $S^{2}$.\n  In contrast to previous work, the work here does not use any of the\nSobolev-type inequalities of Trudinger-Moser-Aubin-Onofri.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 16:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 14:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 16:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

An attacker that manages to\naccess a local network could remotely affect control performance by tampering\nwith sensor measurements delivered to the controller.

Consequently, we\nstudy effects of intermittent data integrity guarantees on system performance\nunder stealthy attacks.

We perform a two-dimensional power spectrum fit of the\namplitude of the primordial B-modes (tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$) and the\namplitude of the lensing B-modes (parameter $A_{lens}$), jointly with the\nestimation of the astrophysical foregrounds including both synchrotron and\nthermal dust emissions. Using this Bayesian framework, we forecast the ability\nof the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain $r$ in the presence of\nrealistic lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior\ndistribution of $r$ and $A_{lens}$, which we improve by adopting a prior on\n$A_{lens}$ taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement. As it applies\nto the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on $r$\nthat is due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B-modes by lensing, unlike\nstandard delensing techniques that are performed on maps. However, the method\nallows to correct for the bias on $r$ induced by lensing, at the expense of a\nlarger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We\nquantify, for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off\nbetween bias correction and increase of uncertainty on $r$. For LiteBIRD\nsimulations, which include foregrounds and lensing contamination, we find that\ncorrecting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the lensing\nbias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a $3\\sigma$ detection\nof $r=5\\times 10^{-3}$. The significance of the detection is increased to\n$6\\sigma$ when the current SPT prior on $A_{lens}$ is adopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 16:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

We estimate the relative likelihood of a\nplanet's propensity towards habitability by considering key physical\ncharacteristics such as the role of temperature on ecological and evolutionary\nprocesses, and atmospheric losses via hydrodynamic escape and stellar wind\nerosion. From our analysis, we demonstrate that Earth-sized exoplanets in the\nhabitable zone around M-dwarfs seemingly display much lower prospects of being\nhabitable relative to Earth, owing to the higher incident ultraviolet fluxes\nand closer distances to the host star. We illustrate our results by\nspecifically computing the likelihood (of supporting life) for the recently\ndiscovered exoplanets, Proxima b and TRAPPIST-1e, which we find to be several\norders of magnitude smaller than that of Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

These can\ndrive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even at arbitrarily small\ndust-to-gas mass ratios. Here, we identify and study both resonant and new\nnon-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral\nhydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\\,k^{2}$). The\ngas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external\naccelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift\nvelocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\\em all}\ndust-to-gas ratios $\\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\\mu$\naround resonance, as $\\sim\\mu^{1/3}$ or $\\sim \\mu^{1/2}$ (depending on\nwavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is\nlarger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic regime a\n'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with\nwavenumber, even for vanishingly small $\\mu$ and values of the coupling\nstrength ('stopping time'). In the subsonic regime non-resonant instabilities\nalways exist, but their growth rates no longer increase indefinitely towards\nsmall wavelengths. The dimensional scalings and qualitative behavior of the\ninstability do not depend sensitively on the drag law or equation-of-state of\nthe gas. The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing\ndust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are\notherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds,\nAGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the\ncharacter of these outflows and could drive clumping and/or turbulence in the\ndust and gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 21:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 05:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

It has always been known that if during the discrete\nintegration of the KPZ equation the nearest-neighbor height-difference exceeds\na critical value, an instability appears and the integration diverges. One way\nto avoid these instabilities is to replace the KPZ nonlinear-term by a function\nof the same term that depends on a single adjustable parameter which is able to\ncontrol pillars or grooves growing on the interface. Here, we propose a\ndifferent integration method which consists of directly limiting the value\ntaken by the KPZ nonlinearity, thereby imposing a restriction rule that is\napplied in each integration time-step, as if it were the growth rule of a\nrestricted discrete model, e.g. restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS). Taking the\ndiscrete KPZ equation with restrictions to its dimensionless version, the\nintegration depends on three parameters: the coupling constant $g$, the inverse\nof the time-step $k$, and the restriction constant $\\varepsilon$ which is\nchosen to eliminate divergences while keeping all the properties of the\ncontinuous KPZ equation. We study in detail the conditions in the parameters'\nspace that avoids divergences in the 1-dimensional integration and reproduce\nthe scaling properties of the continuous KPZ with a particular parameter set.\nWe apply the tested methodology to the $d$-dimensional case ($d = 3,4$) with\nthe purpose of obtaining the growth exponent $\\beta$, by establishing the\nconditions of the coupling constant $g$ under which we recover known values\nreached by other authors, in particular for the RSOS model.

This work provides\nstrong evidence against the most commonly reported experimental hypotheses, and\nindicates that rutile (110) is unlikely to be the relevant surface for nitrogen\nreduction. However, the limiting potential for nitrogen oxidation on rutile\n(110) is significantly lower, indicating that oxidative pathways may be\nrelevant on rutile (110). These findings suggest that photocatalytic dinitrogen\nfixation may occur via a complex balance of oxidative and reductive processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 19:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 19:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 14:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

Heuristics play a crucial role in such\nsituations by guiding the search towards potentially good directions and\nconsequently minimizing search effort. Moreover, it must infer such directions\nin an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up\nuntil that time. However, state of the art methods do not address the problem\nof computing a heuristic that explicitly minimizes search effort.

In this\nmethod, the electron operator is factorized into a fermioninc spinon describing\nthe physical spin and a slave-spin describing the charge fluctuations.\nFollowing the $U(1)$ formalism derived by Yu and Si [Phys. Rev. B 86, 085104\n(2012)], it is shown that the self-consistent equations to explore various\nsymmetry-broken density wave states can be constructed in general with a\ncluster of multiple slave-spin sites. We employ this method to study the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) state in the single band Hubbard model with the two and\nfour-site clusters of slave spins. While the Hubbard gap, the charge gap due to\nthe doubly-occupied states, scales with the Hubbard interaction $U$ as\nexpected, the AFM gap $\\Delta$, the gap in the spinon dispersion in the AFM\nstate, exhibits a crossover from the weak to strong-coupling behaviors as $U$\nincreases. Our cluster slave-spin method reproduces not only the traditional\nmean-field behavior of $\\Delta \\sim U$ in the weak-coupling limit, but also the\nbehavior of $\\Delta \\sim t^2/U$ predicted by the superexchange mechanism in the\nstrong coupling limit. In addition, the holon-doublon correlator as functions\nof $U$ and doping $x$ is also computed, which exhibits a strong tendency toward\nthe holon-doublon binding in the strong coupling regime. We further show that\nthe quasiparticle weight obtained by the cluster slave-spin method is in a good\nagreement with the generalized Gutzwiller approximation in both AFM and\nparamagnetic states, and the results can be improved beyond the generalized\nGutzwiller approximation as the cluster is enlarged from a single site to 4\nsites.

It uses activity evoked by position-varying high luminance\ncontrast visual patterns presented throughout the visual field for determining\nthe spatial organization of cortical visual areas. While the advantage of using\nhigh luminance contrast is that it tends to drive a wide range of neural\npopulations - thus resulting in high signal-to-noise BOLD responses - this may\nalso be a limitation, especially for approaches that attempt to squeeze more\ninformation out of the BOLD response, such as population receptive field (pRF)\nmapping.

According to Hund's rules[2], the lowest energy exciton in organic\nmaterials should be a poorly emitting triplet state. Analogously, the lowest\nexciton level in all known inorganic semiconductors is believed to be optically\ninactive. These 'dark' excitons (into which the system can relax) hinder\nlight-emitting devices based on semiconductor nanostructures. While strategies\nto diminish their influence have been developed[3-5], no materials have been\nidentified in which the lowest exciton is bright. Here we show that the lowest\nexciton in quasi-cubic lead halide perovskites is optically active. We first\nuse the effective-mass model and group theory to explore this possibility,\nwhich can occur when the strong spin-orbit coupling in the perovskite\nconduction band is combined with the Rashba effect [6-10]. We then apply our\nmodel to CsPbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) nanocrystals[11], for which we measure size- and\ncomposition-dependent fluorescence at the single-nanocrystal level. The bright\ncharacter of the lowest exciton immediately explains the anomalous\nphoton-emission rates of these materials, which emit 20 and 1,000 times\nfaster[12] than any other semiconductor nanocrystal at room[13-16] and\ncryogenic[17] temperatures, respectively.

For semiconductor nanocrystals[18], which are already\nused in lighting[19,20], lasers[21,22], and displays[23], these optically\nactive excitons can lead to materials with brighter emission and enhanced\nabsorption.

Because this optimization problem is non-deterministic\npolynomial-time hard due to signomial constraints, we then propose an algorithm\nto obtain a local optimum with polynomial complexity. Our framework serves as a\nbenchmark for pilot design in scenarios with either ideal or non-ideal\nhardware. Numerical results manifest that the proposed optimization algorithms\nare close to the optimal solution obtained by exhaustive search for different\npilot assignments and the new pilot structure and optimization bring large\ngains over the state-of-the-art suboptimal pilot design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 22:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 05:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

We here consider a particularly challenging version\nof OPP, namely, the Stochastic On-line Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP). In\nSO-EPP, the target partitioning is unknown and has to be inferred purely from\nobserving an on-line sequence of object pairs. The paired objects belong to the\nsame partition with probability $p$ and to different partitions with\nprobability $1-p$, with $p$ also being unknown. As an additional complication,\nthe partitions are required to be of equal cardinality. Previously, only\nsub-optimal solution strategies have been proposed for SO- EPP. In this paper,\nwe propose the first optimal solution strategy. In brief, the scheme that we\npropose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian network representation of SO-EPP\nproblems.

This leaves not only the\nhierarchy problem of the SM unsolved, but introduces a copy of it because of\nthe new fundamental scalars responsible for breaking the new gauge group. A\npossible solution is to embed these models into a supersymmetric framework.\nHowever, this gives rise to an additional source of fine-tuning compared to the\nMSSM and poses the question how natural such a setup is.

It has been shown that\nthe addition of a thin oxide overlayer in many cases cathodically shifts the\npotential of photocurrent onset and/or increases the maximum photocurrent,\nleading to greater collection efficiencies beneficial for OER. However, the\norigin of this enhancement is not well understood. Here, we present a model\nrelying on analytical expressions rather than differential equations to\ninvestigate the role of surface states in electrocatalyst-modified\nsemiconductor photoelectrodes. Without catalyst overlayer, we find that if\nsurface states are screened, meaning charged surface states are electronically\nneutralized via nearby solution ions, no Helmholtz potential is generated and\nphotoelectrodes exhibit good performance. In contrast, if the surface states\nare unscreened, an additional Helmholtz potential forms decreasing the amount\nof band bending and resulting in poor performance. In the presence of a\ncatalyst overlayer, there is a strong dependence on how the surface states\ninteract with the catalyst. Catalysts in series with surface states can\nincrease the effective rate of transfer from surface states to solution,\nleading to an increase in total current while catalysts that act in parallel\nwith surface states can increase the open circuit voltage or photovoltage. Both\nseries and parallel catalyst effects operate in tandem in real devices, leading\nto an increase in current and/or photovoltage, depending on the relevant\nexchange currents. This model does not only help to understand the role of\nsurface states in charge transfer and ultimately efficiencies in\nphotoelectrochemical systems but also allows facile application for other\nresearchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 02:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

On the other hand, for sufficiently\nstrong nonlinearities, connected with contact breaking, the granular chain\nreaches energy equipartition and an equilibrium chaotic state, independent of\nthe initial position excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Most of the existing methods assume\nforeground and background show visually distinct characteristics and thus the\nforeground can be detected once a good background model is obtained. However,\nthere are many situations where this is not the case. Of particular interest in\nvideo surveillance is the camouflage case. For example, an active attacker\ncamouflages by intentionally wearing clothes that are visually similar to the\nbackground. In such cases, even given a decent background model, it is not\ntrivial to detect foreground objects. This paper proposes a texture guided\nweighted voting (TGWV) method which can efficiently detect foreground objects\nin camouflaged scenes. The proposed method employs the stationary wavelet\ntransform to decompose the image into frequency bands. We show that the small\nand hardly noticeable differences between foreground and background in the\nimage domain can be effectively captured in certain wavelet frequency bands. To\nmake the final foreground decision, a weighted voting scheme is developed based\non intensity and texture of all the wavelet bands with weights carefully\ndesigned.

We study whether rotational excitation makes a difference to the\nabundances of the $\\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs, including spin states, in physical\nconditions corresponding to starless cores and protostellar envelopes.\n  Methods. We developed a new rate coefficient set for the $\\rm H_3^+$\nisotopologs, allowing for rotational excitation, using the state-to-state rate\ncoefficients from Hugo et al. These new so-called species-to-species rate\ncoefficients are compared with previously-used ground state-to-species rate\ncoefficients.\n  Results.

The\nspecies-to-species model predicts a lower $\\rm H_3^+$ deuteration degree at\nhigh density owing to an increase of the rate coefficients of endothermic\nreactions that decrease deuteration.

To enhance the throughput performance of some far-away WDs, we\nallow one of the WDs to act as the cluster head (CH) that helps forward the\nmessages of the other cluster members (CMs). However, the performance of the\nproposed cluster-based cooperation is fundamentally limited by the high energy\nconsumption of the CH, who needs to transmit all the WDs' messages including\nits own. To tackle this issue, we exploit the capability of multi-antenna\nenergy beamforming (EB) at the HAP, which can focus more transferred power to\nthe CH to balance its energy consumption in assisting the other WDs.\nSpecifically, we first derive the throughput performance of each individual WD\nunder the proposed scheme. Then, we jointly optimize the EB design, the\ntransmit time allocation among the HAP and the WDs, and the transmit power\nallocation of the CH to maximize the minimum data rate achievable among all the\nWDs (the max-min throughput) for improved throughput fairness among the WDs. An\nefficient optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization\nproblem. Moreover, we simulate under practical network setups and show that the\nproposed multi-antenna enabled cluster-based cooperation can effectively\nimprove the throughput fairness of WPCN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 09:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

When the segmentation\nprocess targets rare observations, a severe class imbalance is likely to occur\nbetween candidate labels, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In order\nto mitigate this issue, strategies such as the weighted cross-entropy function,\nthe sensitivity function or the Dice loss function, have been proposed.

In the inflation paradigm this would be an unprecedented\nprobe of the energy scale of inflation as it is directly proportional to the\npower spectrum of the GWB. However, similar tensor perturbations can be\nproduced by the matter fields present during inflation, breaking this simple\nrelationship. It is therefore important to be able to distinguish between\ndifferent generation mechanisms of the GWB. In this paper, we analyse the\ndetectability of a new axion-SU(2) gauge field model using its chiral,\nscale-dependent tensor spectrum. We forecast the detectability of the resulting\nCMB TB and EB cross-correlations by the LiteBIRD satellite, considering the\neffects of residual foregrounds, gravitational lensing, and for the first time\nassess the ability of such an experiment to jointly detect primordial TB and EB\nspectra and self-calibrate its polarimeter. We find that LiteBIRD will be able\nto detect the chiral signal for $r_*>0.03$ with $r_*$ denoting the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio at the peak scale, and that the maximum signal-to-noise\nfor $r_*<0.07$ is $\\sim 2$. We go on to consider an advanced stage of a\nLISA-like mission, and find that such experiments would complement CMB\nobservations by providing sensitivity to GWB chirality on scales inaccessible\nto the CMB. We conclude that in order to use the CMB to distinguish this model\nfrom a conventional vacuum fluctuation model two-point statistics provide some\npower, but to achieve high statistical significance we would require higher\norder statistics which take advantage of the model's non-Gaussianity. On the\nother hand, in the case of a spectrum peaked at very small scales, inaccessible\nto the CMB, a highly significant detection could be made using space-based\nlaser interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 12:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 14:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

A common approach is\ntime-series forecasting of cyber attacks based on data from network telescopes,\nhoneypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems. This research\nhas uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyber attacks. Here, we\npropose an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of\nattacks that are analyst-detected and -verified occurrences of malware. We call\nthese instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically, our dataset was\nanalyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service\nProvider (CSSP) for the U.S. Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on\nautomated systems. Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over\napproximately seven years. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts,\nour dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in\nother sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a\nnumber for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the\ndevelopment of effective risk-management strategies. We used a Bayesian State\nSpace Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead could be\npredicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model. Our findings of\nsystematicity in analyst-detected cyber attacks are consistent with previous\nwork using other sources. The advanced information provided by a forecast may\nhelp with threat awareness by providing a probable value and range for future\ncyber events one week ahead. Other potential applications for cyber event\nforecasting include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for\ncyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing and sensor configuration) in CSSPs.\nEnhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 12:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 16:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 18:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Typically, obtaining an\nalgorithm for separation yields a deep understanding of the investigated class\nC. This explains why a lot of effort has been devoted to finding algorithms for\nthe most prominent classes.\n  Here, we are interested in classes within concatenation hierarchies. Such\nhierarchies are built using a generic construction process: one starts from an\ninitial class called the basis and builds new levels by applying generic\noperations. The most famous one, the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and\nCohen, classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. Moreover, it\nwas shown by Thomas that it corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy\nof first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages\nthat can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. Finding\nseparation algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy is among the most famous\nopen problems in automata theory.\n  Our main theorem is generic: we show that separation is decidable for the\nlevel 3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite. Furthermore, in\nthe special case of the dot-depth, we push this result to the level 5/2. In\nlogical terms, this solves separation for $\\Sigma_3$: first-order sentences\nhaving at most three quantifier blocks starting with an existential one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 23:29:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 16:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2018 15:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 10:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

A firm,\nrepresentative of the productive sector of a country, aims at maximizing its\nprofits by expanding its production. Assuming that the output of production is\nproportional to the level of pollutants' emissions, the firm increases the\nlevel of pollution. The government of the country aims at minimizing the social\ncosts due to the pollution, and introduces regulatory constraints on the\nemissions' level, which then effectively cap the output of production.\nSupposing that the firm and the government face both proportional and fixed\ncosts in order to adopt their policies, we model the previous problem as a\nstochastic impulse two-person nonzero-sum game. The state variable of the game\nis the level of the output of production which evolves as a general linearly\ncontrolled one-dimensional Ito-diffusion. Following an educated guess, we first\nconstruct a pair of candidate equilibrium policies and of corresponding\nequilibrium values, and we then provide a set of sufficient conditions under\nwhich they indeed realize an equilibrium. Our results are complemented by a\nnumerical study when the (uncontrolled) output of production evolves as a\ngeometric Brownian motion, and the firm's operating profit and the government's\nrunning cost functions are of power type. An analysis of the dependency of the\nequilibrium policies and values on the model parameters yields interesting new\nbehaviors that we explain as a consequence of the strategic interaction between\nthe firm and the government.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 15:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 07:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

In our experiments on a complex\nvideogame character, CHARDA successfully discovers a reasonable\nover-approximation of the character's true behaviors. Our results also compare\nfavorably against recent work in automatically learning probabilistic timed\nautomata in an aircraft domain: CHARDA exactly learns the modes of these\nsimpler automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 15:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

We found that a broad-band modulation of THz radiation may be\ninduced by a low-power optical excitation in the spectral range of the impurity\nabsorption band in GaAs. The measured modulation achieves 80\\%. The amplitude\nand frequency characteristics of the resulting THz modulator are critically\ndependent on the carrier density and relaxation dynamics in the conduction band\nof GaAs. In semi-insulating GaAs crystals, the carrier density created by the\nimpurity excitation is controlled by the rate of their relaxation to the\nimpurity centers. The relaxation rate and, consequently, the frequency\ncharacteristics of the modulator can be optimized by an appropriate choice of\nthe impurities and their concentrations. The modulation parameters can be also\ncontrolled by the crystal temperature and by the power and photon energy of the\noptical excitation. These experiments pave the way to the low-power fast\noptically-controlled THz modulation, imaging, and beam steering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 11:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

The optical power dependent impedance of the LED is well fitted by a\nmodified dispersive carrier transport model for inorganic semiconductors. The\nbandwidth of the LED-LED visible light communication link is further shown to\ndecrease with the optical power received by the LED. This leads to a trade-off\nbetween link bandwidth and SNR, and consequently affects the choice of the\nproper dada modulation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 01:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}
