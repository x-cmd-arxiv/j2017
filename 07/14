Provided that\ndisks form early on, even under conservative assumptions for accretion, these\nconstraints exclude a monochromatic distribution of PBH with masses above $\\sim\n2\\, M_\\odot$ as the dominant form of DM. The bound on the median PBH mass gets\nmore stringent if a broad, log-normal mass function is considered. A deepened\nunderstanding of non-linear clustering properties and BH accretion disk physics\nwould permit an improved treatment and possibly lead to more stringent\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 13:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

In this work, using first\nprinciples computations, we investigate the influence of nearly 40 dopants on\nthe phase stability in bulk hafnia to identify dopants that can favor formation\nof the polar Pca21 phase. Although no dopant was found to stabilize this polar\nphase as the ground state, suggesting that dopants alone cannot induce\nferroelectricity in hafnia, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Y and Gd were found to\nsignificantly lower the energy of the polar phase with respect to the\nequilibrium monoclinic phase. These results are consistent with the empirical\nmeasurements of large remnant polarization in hafnia films doped with these\nelements. Additionally, clear chemical trends of dopants with larger ionic\nradii and lower electronegativity favoring the polar Pca21 phase in hafnia were\nidentified. For this polar phase, an additional bond between the dopant cation\nand the 2nd nearest oxygen neighbor was identified as the root-cause of these\ntrends. Further, trivalent dopants (Y, La, and Gd) were revealed to stabilize\nthe polar Pca21 phase at lower strains when compared to divalent dopants (Sr\nand Ba). Based on these insights, we predict that the lanthanide series metals,\nthe lower half of alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba) and Y as the most\nsuitable dopants to promote ferroelectricity in hafnia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

The use\nof an approximate model introduces a discrepancy, or modeling error, that may\nhave a detrimental effect on the solution of the ill-posed inverse problem, or\nit may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. In the\nBayesian paradigm, the modeling error can be considered as a random variable,\nand by using an estimate of the probability distribution of the unknown, one\nmay estimate the probability distribution of the modeling error and incorporate\nit into the inversion.

The problem is challenging because nodes are indistinguishable\n(they lack identifiers and execute the same program) and the topology may\nchange arbitrarily from round to round of communication, as long as the network\nis connected in each round. The problem is central in distributed computing as\nthe number of participants is frequently needed to make important decisions,\nsuch as termination, agreement, synchronization, and many others. A variety of\nalgorithms built on top of mass-distribution techniques have been presented,\nanalyzed, and also experimentally evaluated; some of them assumed additional\nknowledge of network characteristics, such as bounded degree or given upper\nbound on the network size. However, the question of whether Counting can be\nsolved deterministically in sub-exponential time remained open. In this work,\nwe answer this question positively by presenting Methodical Counting, which\nruns in polynomial time and requires no knowledge of network characteristics.\nMoreover, we also show how to extend Methodical Counting to compute the sum of\ninput values and more complex functions without extra cost. Our analysis\nleverages previous work on random walks in evolving graphs, combined with\ncarefully chosen alarms in the algorithm that control the process and its\nparameters. To the best of our knowledge, our Counting algorithm and its\nextensions to other algebraic and Boolean functions are the first that can be\nimplemented in practice with worst-case guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 18:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

The\nmultispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to\nincomplete lineage sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect.\n  In previous work, an information-theoretic trade-off was derived in this\ncontext between the number of loci, $m$, needed for an accurate reconstruction\nand the length of the locus sequences, $k$. It was shown that to reconstruct an\ninternal branch of length $f$, one needs $m$ to be of the order of $1/[f^{2}\n\\sqrt{k}]$. That previous result was obtained under the molecular clock\nassumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as\npopulation sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny.\n  Here we generalize this result beyond the restrictive molecular clock\nassumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has the same data\nrequirement (up to log factors). Our main contribution is a novel reduction to\nthe molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent. As a corollary, we\nalso obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any\nspecies tree with $n \\geq 3$ species, the rooted species tree can be identified\nfrom the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence\nof a molecular clock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 20:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

Yet, it\nperforms poorly when the density of a positive variable is to be estimated\n(boundary issues, spurious bumps in the tail). So various extensions of the\nbasic kernel estimator allegedly suitable for $\\mathbb{R}^+$-supported\ndensities, such as those using Gamma or other asymmetric kernels, abound in the\nliterature. Those, however, are not based on any valid smoothing operation\nanalogous to the convolution, which typically leads to inconsistencies. By\ncontrast, in this paper a kernel estimator for $\\mathbb{R}^+$-supported\ndensities is defined by making use of the Mellin convolution, the natural\nanalogue of the usual convolution on $\\mathbb{R}^+$. From there, a very\ntransparent theory flows and leads to new type of asymmetric kernels strongly\nrelated to Meijer's $G$-functions. The numerous pleasant properties of this\n`Mellin-Meijer-kernel density estimator' are demonstrated in the paper. Its\npointwise and $L_2$-consistency (with optimal rate of convergence) is\nestablished for a large class of densities, including densities unbounded at 0\nand showing power-law decay in their right tail. Its practical behaviour is\ninvestigated further through simulations and some real data analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 20:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

The codebook can be optimally learned jointly with the net, or fixed,\nas for binarization or ternarization approaches. Previous work has quantized\nthe weights of the reference net, or incorporated rounding operations in the\nbackpropagation algorithm, but this has no guarantee of converging to a\nloss-optimal, quantized net. We describe a new approach based on the recently\nproposed framework of model compression as constrained optimization\n\\citep{Carreir17a}. This results in a simple iterative \"learning-compression\"\nalgorithm, which alternates a step that learns a net of continuous weights with\na step that quantizes (or binarizes/ternarizes) the weights, and is guaranteed\nto converge to local optimum of the loss for quantized nets. We develop\nalgorithms for an adaptive codebook or a (partially) fixed codebook. The latter\nincludes binarization, ternarization, powers-of-two and other important\nparticular cases. We show experimentally that we can achieve much higher\ncompression rates than previous quantization work (even using just 1 bit per\nweight) with negligible loss degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 20:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

To complete co-flow $j$,\nwe must satisfy all of its demands. Due to capacity constraints, a port can\nonly transmit (or receive) one unit of data in unit time.

Many algorithms have been suggested for the\nmaximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from\nsubmodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending\nthis issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing\nsubmodular functions, has been the focus of recent works.\n  One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of\nattention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the\napproximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization\nsubject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from\nsubmodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject\nto constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the\ngreedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such\nconstraints.\n  In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm\n(previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves\nan approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/\\gamma)^{-2}$ for the maximization of a\nweakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where\n$\\gamma$ is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from\nsubmodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this\nversion of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural\nbenchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in\npractice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a\nnon-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function\nsubject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In\nparticular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important\nand broad class of matroid constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 22:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

The squared Laplacian energy is a popular choice of energy\nand has a corresponding standard implementation: squaring the discrete\nLaplacian matrix. For compact domains, when values along the boundary are not\nknown in advance, this construction bakes in low-order boundary conditions.\nThis causes the geometric shape of the boundary to strongly bias the solution.\nFor many applications, this is undesirable. Instead, we propose using the\nsquared Frobenious norm of the Hessian as a smoothness energy. Unlike the\nsquared Laplacian energy, this energy's natural boundary conditions (those that\nbest minimize the energy) correspond to meaningful high-order boundary\nconditions. These boundary conditions model free boundaries where the shape of\nthe boundary should not bias the solution locally.

How does that provide hints on the generator's design and compare\nto the flourishing but almost exclusively experimental literature on the\nsubject?\n  In this paper, we unveil a broad class of distributions for which such\nconvergence happens --- namely, deformed exponential families, a wide superset\nof exponential families --- and show tight connections with the three other key\nGAN parameters: loss, game and architecture.

It is\nknown that two scale-invariant theories may be defined. By regularizing the\nnear-origin behavior of the potential by a finite square well with variable\nwidth $b$ and depth $g$, it is shown how these two scale-invariant theories\noccupy fixed points in the resulting $(b,g)$-space of Hamiltonians. A\nrenormalization group flow exists in this space and scaling variables are shown\nto exist in a neighborhood of the fixed points. Consequently, the propagator of\nthe regulated theory enjoys homogeneous scaling laws close to the fixed points.\nUsing renormalization group arguments it is possible to discern the functional\nform of the propagator for long distances and long imaginary times, thus\ndemonstrating the extent to which fixed points control the behavior of the\ncut-off theory.\n  By keeping the width fixed and varying only the well depth, we show how the\nmean position of a bound state diverges as $g$ approaches a critical value.

By efficient usage of void space\nbetween constellation points for $q$-ary modulations and using soft information\nat the input of the decoder, the S-SCA is capable of outperforming conventional\nSymbolic-Chase algorithm (S-CA) with less computational cost. Since the S-SCA\nstarts with the randomized generation of likely test-vectors, it reduces the\ncomplexity to polynomial order and also it does not need to find the least\nreliable symbols to generate test-vectors. Our simulation results show that by\nincreasing the number of test-vectors, the performance of the algorithm can\napproach the ML bound. The S-SCA($1K$) provides near $2$ dB gain in comparison\nwith S-CA($1K$) for $(31, 25)$ RS code using $32$-QAM. Furthermore, the\nalgorithm provides near $3$ dB further gain with $1K$ iteration compared with\nS-CA($65K$) when $(255, 239)$ RS code is used in an AWGN channel. For the\nRayleigh fading channel and the same code, the algorithm provides more that $5$\ndB gain.

It is important for fundamental issues (quantum phase\ntransitions, transport, . . . ) and for the development of innovative\nmaterials. Analytic approaches to many-body systems are limited and the huge\nsize of their Hilbert space makes numerical simulations on classical computers\nintractable. A quantum simulator avoids these limitations by transcribing the\nsystem of interest into another, with the same dynamics but with interaction\nparameters under control and with experimental access to all relevant\nobservables. Quantum simulation of spin systems is being explored with trapped\nions, neutral atoms and superconducting devices. We propose here a new paradigm\nfor quantum simulation of spin-1/2 arrays providing unprecedented flexibility\nand allowing one to explore domains beyond the reach of other platforms. It is\nbased on laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms. Their long intrinsic lifetimes\ncombined with the inhibition of their microwave spontaneous emission and their\nlow sensitivity to collisions and photoionization make trapping lifetimes in\nthe minute range realistic with state-of-the-art techniques. Ultra-cold\ndefect-free circular atom chains can be prepared by a variant of the\nevaporative cooling method. This method also leads to the individual detection\nof arbitrary spin observables. The proposed simulator realizes an XXZ spin-1/2\nHamiltonian with nearest-neighbor couplings ranging from a few to tens of kHz.\nAll the model parameters can be tuned at will, making a large range of\nsimulations accessible. The system evolution can be followed over times in the\nrange of seconds, long enough to be relevant for ground-state adiabatic\npreparation and for the study of thermalization, disorder or Floquet time\ncrystals. This platform presents unrivaled features for quantum simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 06:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 12:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

In this work, we explore a different kind of contextual\ninformation: inner-scene similarity. We present the CISS (Context by Inner\nScene Similarity) algorithm, which is based on the observation that two\nvisually similar sub-image patches are likely to share semantic identities,\nespecially when both appear in the same image. CISS uses base-scores provided\nby a base detector and performs as a post-detection stage. For each candidate\nsub-image (denoted anchor), the CISS algorithm finds a few similar sub-images\n(denoted supporters), and, using them, calculates a new enhanced score for the\nanchor. This is done by utilizing the base-scores of the supporters and a\npre-trained dependency model. The new scores are modeled as a linear function\nof the base scores of the anchor and the supporters and is estimated using a\nminimum mean square error optimization. This approach results in: (a) improved\ndetection of partly occluded objects (when there are similar non-occluded\nobjects in the scene), and (b) fewer false alarms (when the base detector\nmistakenly classifies a background patch as an object).

High temporal\nand high spatial resolution observations reveal that the two adjacent ends of\nthe two filamentary threads are rooted in opposite magnetic polarities within\nthe source region.

For high\ndensities, these solutions become strongly entangled and the motion of a needle\nis essentially restricted to a one-dimensional sliding in a confining tube\ncomposed of neighboring needles. From the density-dependent behavior of the\norientational and translational diffusion, we extract the long-time transport\ncoefficients and the geometry of the confining tube. The sliding motion within\nthe tube becomes visible in the non-Gaussian parameter of the translational\nmotion as an extended plateau at intermediate times and in the intermediate\nscattering function as an algebraic decay. This transient dynamic arrest is\nalso corroborated by the local exponent of the mean-square displacements\nperpendicular to the needle axis. Moreover, the probability distribution of the\ndisplacements perpendicular to the needle becomes strongly non-Gaussian, rather\nit displays an exponential distribution for large displacements. On the other\nhand, based on the analysis of higher-order correlations of the orientation we\nfind that the rotational motion becomes diffusive again for strong confinement.\nAt coarse-grained time and length scales, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the\nneedle for the high entanglement is captured by a single freely diffusing\nphantom needle with long-time transport coefficients obtained from the needle\nin solution.

Here we measure the fractions of\n[CII] emission originating in the ionized and neutral gas phases of a sample of\nnearby galaxies. We use the [NII] 205um fine-structure line to trace the\nionized medium, thereby eliminating the strong density dependence that exists\nin the ratio of [CII]/[NII] 122um.

Among these sources, XTE J0929-314 has been detected in\noutburst just once in about 15 years of continuous monitoring of the X-ray sky.\nAims. We aim to demonstrate that a conservative mass transfer in this system\nwill result in an X-ray luminosity that is higher than the observed, long-term\naveraged X-ray luminosity. Methods. Under the hypothesis of a conservative mass\ntransfer driven by gravitational radiation, as expected for this system given\nthe short orbital period of about 43.6 min and the low mass of the companion\nimplied by the mass function derived from timing techniques, we calculate the\nexpected mass transfer rate in this system and predict the long-term averaged\nX-ray luminosity. This is compared with the averaged, over 15 years, X-ray flux\nobserved from the system, and a lower limit of the distance to the source is\ninferred. Results. This distance is shown to be > 7.4 kpc in the direction of\nthe Galactic anticentre, implying a large height, > 1.8 kpc, of the source with\nrespect to the Galactic plane, placing the source in an empty region of the\nGalaxy. We suggest that the inferred value of the distance is unlikely.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 10:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 08:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

The data from two planar\nprototypes have been reconstructed and analyzed offline with two clusterization\nmethods: the enter of gravity of the charge distribution and the micro Time\nProjection Chamber (\\muTPC). Concerning the spatial resolution, the charge\ncentroid cluster reconstruction performs extremely well with no magnetic field:\nthe resolution is well below 100 \\mum . Increasing the magnetic field\nintensity, the resolution degrades almost linearly as effect of the Lorentz\nforce that displaces, broadens and asymmetrizes the electron avalanche. Tuning\nthe electric fields of the GEM prototype we could achieve the unprecedented\nspatial resolution of 190 \\mum at 1 Tesla. In order to boost the spatial\nresolution with strong magnetic field and inclined tracks a \\muTPC cluster\nreconstruction has been investigated. Such a readout mode exploits the good\ntime resolution of the GEM detector and electronics to reconstruct the\ntrajectory of the particle inside the conversion gap. Beside the improvement of\nthe spatial resolution, information on the track angle can be also extracted.\nThe new clustering algorithm has been tested with diagonal tracks with no\nmagnetic field showing a resolution between 100 um and 150 um for the incident\nangle ranging from 10{\\deg} to 45{\\deg} . Studies show similar performance with\n1 Tesla magnetic field. This is the first use of a \\muTPC readout with a triple\nGEM detector in magnetic field.

We\nobtained its high-resolution X-ray spectrum using Chandra observatory. PoWR\nmodel atmospheres were calculated to provide realistic wind opacities and to\nestablish the wind density structure. We find that collisional de-excitation is\nthe dominant mechanism de-populating the metastable upper levels of the\nforbidden lines of the He-like ions SiXIV and MgXII. Comparison between the\nmodel and observations reveals that X-ray emission is produced in a dense\nplasma, which could reside only at the photosphere or in a colliding wind zone\nbetween binary components. The observed X-ray spectra are well fitted by\nthermal plasma models, with average temperatures in excess of 10 MK. The wind\nspeed in Cyg OB2-12 is not high enough to power such high temperatures, but the\ncollision of two winds in a binary system can be sufficient. We used archival\ndata to investigate the X-ray properties of other blue hypergiants. In general,\nstars of this class are not detected as X-rays sources. We suggest that our new\nChandra observations of Cyg OB2-12 can be best explained if Cyg OB2-12 is a\ncolliding wind binary possessing a late O-type companion. This makes Cyg OB2-12\nonly the second binary system among the 16 known Galactic hypergiants. This low\nbinary fraction indicates that the blue hypergiants are likely products of\nmassive binary evolution during which they either accreted a significant amount\nof mass or already merged with their companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Understanding the behavior and the\ncharacteristics of the members of an inactive community help to sustain the\ngrowth dynamics of these communities and, possibly, prevents them from being\nout of service.

The excellent performance is often attributed to some\nunderlying discrete version of the Lagrange--d'Alembert principle. Instead, in\nthis paper, we give evidence that reversibility is behind the observed\nbehaviour. Indeed, we show that many standard nonholonomic test problems have\nthe structure of being foliated over reversible integrable systems. As most\nnonholonomic integrators preserve the foliation and the reversible structure,\nnear conservation of the first integrals is a consequence of reversible KAM\ntheory. Therefore, to fully evaluate nonholonomic integrators one has to\nconsider also non-reversible nonholonomic systems. To this end we construct\nperturbed test problems that are integrable but no longer reversible (with\nrespect to the standard reversibility map). Applying various nonholonomic\nintegrators from the literature to these problems we observe that no method\nperforms well on all problems.

From this investigation we posit two logically and operationally\ndistinct statements of the equivalence principle for quantum systems: Version\nA: The probability distribution of position for a free-falling particle is the\nsame as the probability distribution of a free particle, modulo a\nmass-independent shift of its mean.

For a class of initial states, we find a dephasing\nfor the translational dof, namely, the suppression of the off-diagonal terms of\nthe density matrix, in the position basis. We also find a gravitational phase\nshift in the reduced density matrix of the internal dof that does not depend on\nthe particle's mass.

The dynamics of parametric\nresonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter\n$q$. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial\namplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to\nother species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed\nvalue(s) of $q$. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude\ndependence on $q$, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical\nresults. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a\nwide range of $q$ values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating\nscenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final\namplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our\nparametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW\nbackground today, for an arbitrary $q$. The GW signal can be rather large, as\n$h^2\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f_p) \\lesssim 10^{-11}$, but it is always peaked at high\nfrequencies $f_p \\gtrsim 10^{7}$ Hz.

So, it\nis essential to identify additional therapeutic strategies to block the growth\nof HCC tumors. As a cancer disease, it is associated with aberrant genomic and\ntranscriptional landscapes. We sought to use a systematic drug repositioning\nbioinformatics approach to identify novel candidate drugs to treat HCC, which\nconsiders not only aberrant genomic information, but also the changes of\ntranscriptional landscapes. First, we screen the collection of HCC feature\ngenes that frequently mutated in most samples of HCC based on human mutation\ndata. Then, the gene expression data of HCC in TCGA are combined to classify\nthe kernel genes of HCC. Finally, the therapeutic score (TS) of each drug is\ncalculated based on the kolmogorov-smirnov statistical method. Using this\nstrategy, we identified five drugs that associated with HCC, including three\ndrugs that could treat HCC and two drugs that might have side-effect on HCC.
