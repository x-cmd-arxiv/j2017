For the surface electrons in three-dimensional topological insulators\n(TIs), their spin is locked to the transport direction. For photons in optical\nfibers and photonic waveguides, they carry transverse spin angular momentum\n(SAM) which is also locked to the propagation direction. A direct connection\nbetween the electronic and the optical spins occurs in TIs with lifted spin\ndegeneracy, which leads to spin-dependent selection rules of optical\ntransitions and results in phenomena such as circular photogalvanic effect\n(CPGE). Here, we demonstrate an optoelectronic device that integrates a TI with\na photonic waveguide.

Network properties such as the degree distribution and\nshortest path length have been computed in numerous real-world networks, and\nmost of them have been shown to be both scale-free and small-world networks.\nGraphlets and network motifs are subgraph patterns that capture richer\nstructural information than aforementioned global network properties, and these\nlocal features are often used for network comparison. However, past work on\ngraphlets and network motifs is almost exclusively applicable only for static\nnetworks. Many systems are better represented as temporal networks which depict\nnot only how a system was at a given stage but also how they evolved.\nTime-dependent information is crucial in temporal networks and, by disregarding\nthat data, static methods can not achieve the best possible results. This paper\nintroduces an extension of graphlets for temporal networks. Our proposed method\nenumerates all 4-node graphlet-orbits in each network-snapshot, building the\ncorresponding orbit-transition matrix in the process. Our hypothesis is that\nnetworks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions\nwhich better identify them than simple static patterns, and this is assessed on\na set of real temporal networks split into categories. In order to perform\ntemporal network comparison we put forward an orbit-transition-agreement metric\n(OTA). OTA correctly groups a set of temporal networks that both static network\nmotifs and graphlets fail to do so adequately. Furthermore, our method produces\ninterpretable results which we use to uncover characteristic orbit transitions,\nand that can be regarded as a network-fingerprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 17:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

Path\nplanning, whether offline or online, entails setting up the path as a sequence\nof locations in the 3D Euclidean space, whose coordinates happen to be\nlatitude, longitude and altitude. For the specific application of remote\nsurveillance of long linear infrastructures in non-urban terrain, the\ncontinuous 3D-ESP problem practically entails two important scalar costs. The\nfirst scalar cost is the distance traveled along the planned path. Since drones\nare battery operated, hence it is needed that the path length between fixed\nstart and goal locations of a mission should be minimal at all costs. The other\nscalar cost is the cost of transmitting the acquired video during the mission\nof remote surveillance, via a camera mounted in the drone's belly. Because of\nthe length of surveillance target which is long linear infrastructure, the\namount of video generated is very high and cannot be generally stored in its\nentirety, on board. If the connectivity is poor along certain segments of a\nnaive path, to boost video transmission rate, the transmission power of the\nsignal is kept high, which in turn dissipates more battery energy. Hence a path\nis desired that simultaneously also betters what is known as communication\ncost. These two costs trade-off, and hence Pareto optimization is needed for\nthis 3D bi-objective Euclidean shortest path problem. In this report, we study\nthe mono-objective offline path planning problem, based on the distance cost,\nwhile posing the communication cost as an upper-bounded constraint.

Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass\nsubhalos within lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their\ncontribution to the lensing convergence field is approximately Gaussian and\ncould thus be described by their power spectrum. We develop here a general\nformalism to compute from first principles the substructure convergence power\nspectrum for different populations of dark matter subhalos. As an example, we\napply our framework to two distinct subhalo populations: a truncated\nNavarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard CDM, and a\ntruncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM). We study in detail how the subhalo abundance, mass function, internal\ndensity profile, and concentration affect the amplitude and shape of the\nsubstructure power spectrum. We determine that the power spectrum is mostly\nsensitive to a specific combination of the subhalo abundance and moments of the\nmass function, as well as to the average tidal truncation scale of the largest\nsubhalos included in the analysis. Interestingly, we show that the asymptotic\nslope of the substructure power spectrum at large wave number reflects the\ninternal density profile of the subhalos. In particular, the SIDM power\nspectrum exhibits a characteristic steepening at large wave number absent in\nthe CDM power spectrum, opening the possibility of using this observable, if at\nall measurable, to discern between these two scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 22:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

In general, an order parameter capable of\nidentifying two different phases of matter separated by a correspond- ing phase\ntransition is constructed based on symmetry arguments. This parameter measures\nthe degree of order as the phase transition proceeds. However, when the two\ndistinct phases are highly disordered it is not trivial to identify broken\nsymmetries with which to find an order parameter. This poses an excellent\nproblem to be addressed using machine learning procedures. Room tem- perature\nliquid water is hypothesized to be a supercritical liquid, with fluctuations of\ntwo different molecular orders associated to two parent liquid phases, one with\nhigh density and another one with low density. The validity of this hypothesis\nis linked to the existence of an order parameter capable of identifying the two\ndistinct liquid phases and their fluctuations. In this work we show how two\ndifferent machine learning procedures are capable of recognizing local order in\nliquid water. We argue that when in order to learn relevant features from this\ncomplexity, an initial, physically motivated preparation of the available data\nis as important as the quality of the data set, and that machine learning can\nbecome a successful analysis tool only when coupled to high level physical\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

In this approach,\nsparse signals can be effectively inverted, as the coarse fluctuations are\nreconstructed before the finer ones. Furthermore, the number of nonzero entries\nin the system matrix can be compressed and thus the inversion procedure can be\nspeeded up. As a test scenario we investigate satellite-based asteroid interior\nreconstruction. We use both full-wave and projected wave data and estimate the\naccuracy of the inversion under different error sources: noise and positioning\ninaccuracies. The results suggest that the present full-wave inversion approach\nallows recovering the interior with a single satellite recording backscattering\ndata. It seems that robust results can be achieved, when the peak-to-peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio is above 10 dB. Furthermore, it seems that reconstructing\nthe deep interior can be enhanced if two satellites can be utilized in the\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 18:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 09:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

A\ncomparison with type Ic supernova spectra shows that LSQ14efd is quite similar\nto the type Ic SN 2004aw.

The analysis\nof such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we\ncan often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates\nto features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear\nMarkovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change\ncollectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional\nanalysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach\nfor Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and\noptimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key\ninsight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular\ncomponents of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of\nscore functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be\nemployed to optimize a Markovian model.

Analytically tractable models with Gaussian driving\nnoise have led to important, general insights, but they fail to capture rare,\ncatastrophic events, which are increasingly observed at scales ranging from\nglobal fisheries to intestinal microbiota. Due to mathematical challenges,\ngrowth processes with random catastrophes are less well characterized and it\nremains unclear how their consequences differ from those of Gaussian processes.\nIn the face of a changing climate and predicted increases in ecological\ncatastrophes, as well as increased interest in harnessing microbes for\ntherapeutics, these processes have never been more relevant. To better\nunderstand them, I revisit here a differential equation model of logistic\ngrowth coupled to density-independent catastrophes that arrive as a Poisson\nprocess, and derive new analytic results that reveal its statistical structure.\nFirst, I derive exact expressions for the model's stationary moments, revealing\na single effective catastrophe parameter that largely controls low order\nstatistics. Then, I use weak convergence theorems to construct its Gaussian\nanalog in a limit of frequent, small catastrophes, keeping the stationary\npopulation mean constant for normalization. Numerically computing statistics\nalong this limit shows how they transform as the dynamics shifts from\ncatastrophes to diffusions, enabling quantitative comparisons. For example, the\nmean time to extinction increases monotonically by orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating significantly higher extinction risk under catastrophes than\nunder diffusions. Together, these results provide insight into a wide range of\nstochastic dynamical systems important for ecology and conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 00:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 03:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

However, training such a network usually requires large\namounts of annotated samples for covering the semantic space (e.g., diverse\naction decomposition and ordering). To alleviate this issue, we introduce a\ntemporal And-Or graph (AOG) for task description, which hierarchically\nrepresents a task into atomic actions. With this AOG representation, we can\nproduce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences according with common sense)\nby training another auxiliary LSTM network with a small set of annotated\nsamples. And these generated samples (i.e., task-oriented action sequences)\neffectively facilitate training the model for task-oriented action prediction.\nIn the experiments, we create a new dataset containing diverse daily tasks and\nextensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 01:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

We test the\nmodel over a 117-genre dataset and a reduced 20-genre dataset. Experimental\nresults show that the HAN outperforms both non-neural models and simpler neural\nmodels, whilst also classifying over a higher number of genres than previous\nresearch.

These approaches, however, are\nproblematic from two perspectives. First, they are minimizing the error between\n3D shapes and pose labels - with little thought about the nature of this label\nerror when reprojecting the shape back onto the image. Second, they rely on the\nonerous and ill-posed task of hand labeling natural images with respect to 3D\nshape and pose. In this paper we define the new task of pose-aware shape\nreconstruction from a single image, and we advocate that cheaper 2D annotations\nof objects silhouettes in natural images can be utilized.

In this theory, charge and spin\n(or orbital) degrees are treated as independent degrees of freedom, coupled by\na constraint. Using this formalism in single as well as cluster extension, we\ncapture the effective many body scales beyond conventional mean-field theory.\nWhile the formation of exciton is favored by the interband hybridization $V$,\nit is strongly influenced by the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. Beyond a\ncritical hybridization, there is a condensation of exciton, effectively giving\nrise to a crossover from metal to an excitonic insulator phase. The system goes\nfrom a metal to an excitonic insulating state, with a first order jump in the\nexcitonic order parameter. Moreover, the behavior of excitonic averages differs\nfrom earlier results from Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. Low-$U$ results show\nthat excitonic order parameter ($\\Delta$) is continuous across the transition\nboth for single as well as two-site approximation. The transition changes to\nweakly first order in the intermediate $U$ for cluster case. On the other hand,\nlarge $U$ limit shows a continuous transition for cluster but remains first\norder in the single-site approximation. The slave rotor also indicates an\nexcitonic metallic region in both single and cluster cases, while there is an\norbital liquid in the insulating regime in the cluster theory.

All the definitions of simple, joint, conditional, and mutual\nentropy of Shannon information theory are derived by a uniform transformation\nfrom the corresponding definitions at the logical level. The purpose of this\npaper is to give the direct generalization to quantum logical information\ntheory that similarly focuses on the pairs of eigenstates distinguished by an\nobservable, i.e., qudits of an observable. The fundamental theorem for quantum\nlogical entropy and measurement establishes a direct quantitative connection\nbetween the increase in quantum logical entropy due to a projective measurement\nand the eigenstates (cohered together in the pure superposition state being\nmeasured) that are distinguished by the measurement (decohered in the\npost-measurement mixed state).

Updated version","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.GT","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among a set of\nagents in a fair and efficient manner. An allocation is said to be fair if it\nis envy-free up to one good (EF1), which means that each agent prefers its own\nbundle over the bundle of any other agent up to the removal of one good. In\naddition, an allocation is deemed efficient if it satisfies Pareto optimality\n(PO). While each of these well-studied properties is easy to achieve\nseparately, achieving them together is far from obvious. Recently, Caragiannis\net al. (2016) established the surprising result that when agents have additive\nvaluations for the goods, there always exists an allocation that simultaneously\nsatisfies these two seemingly incompatible properties. Specifically, they\nshowed that an allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare (NSW)\nobjective is both EF1 and PO. However, the problem of maximizing NSW is\nNP-hard. As a result, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm for\nfinding a fair and efficient allocation.\n  In this paper, we bypass this barrier, and develop a pseudopolynomial time\nalgorithm for finding allocations that are EF1 and PO; in particular, when the\nvaluations are bounded, our algorithm finds such an allocation in polynomial\ntime. Furthermore, we establish a stronger existence result compared to\nCaragiannis et al. (2016): For additive valuations, there always exists an\nallocation that is EF1 and fractionally PO.\n  Another contribution of our work is to show that our algorithm provides a\npolynomial-time 1.45-approximation to the NSW objective. This improves upon the\nbest known approximation ratio for this problem (namely, the 2-approximation\nalgorithm of Cole et al. (2017)). Unlike many of the existing approaches, our\nalgorithm is completely combinatorial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 12:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 08:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Despite a large amount of experimental\nactivities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual\nparticle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To\ngo one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic\nmicrogel particles \"in silico\". We exploit the self-assembly of a binary\nmixture composed of tetravalent (crosslinkers) and bivalent (monomer beads)\npatchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully-bonded\nnetworks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel\nconfiguration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model\ncomplemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our\nassembly protocol we focus on a small microgel test-case and show that we can\nreproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining\nsphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated\nassembly methodologies, e.g. in the case of networks generated from an\nunderlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in\nreciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function\nof temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely-used\nfuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modelling of\nmicrogel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their\nelastic properties and effective interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 14:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 13:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

The classical sharp interface\ntreatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed\nto separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when\nanalyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple\nmetastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale\ndimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can\nextend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems\nexhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable\nsystems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable\n(macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium.\nSufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape\nfrom metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting\nand interfacial processes via kinetic equations.

Modern variations of the\nclassical (purely bottom-up) approach, involve, e.g., some form of user\nassistance (interactive segmentation) or ask for the simultaneous segmentation\nof two or more images (co-segmentation). At an abstract level, all these\nvariants can be thought of as \"constrained\" versions of the original\nformulation, whereby the segmentation process is guided by some external source\nof information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle this kind of\nproblems in a unified way. Our work is based on some properties of a family of\nquadratic optimization problems related to dominant sets, a well-known\ngraph-theoretic notion of a cluster which generalizes the concept of a maximal\nclique to edge-weighted graphs. In particular, we show that by properly\ncontrolling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the\nscale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of\ndominant-set clusters that are constrained to contain predefined elements. In\nparticular, we shall focus on interactive segmentation and co-segmentation (in\nboth the unsupervised and the interactive versions).
