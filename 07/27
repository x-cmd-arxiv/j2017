While many researchers are tackling write\namplification in key-value stores, IO amplification in file systems has been\nlargely unexplored. We analyze data and metadata operations on five widely-used\nLinux file systems: ext2, ext4, XFS, btrfs, and F2FS. We find that data\noperations result in significant write amplification (2-32X) and that metadata\noperations have a large IO cost. For example, a single rename requires 648 KB\nwrite IO in btrfs. We also find that small random reads result in read\namplification of 2-13X. Based on these observations, we present the CReWS\nconjecture about the relationship between IO amplification, consistency, and\nstorage space utilization. We hope this paper spurs people to design future\nfile systems with less IO amplification, especially for non-volatile memory\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The separation of social grooming methods is caused by a difference in\nthe trade-off between the number and strength of social relationships.

The success of\nsuch a memory critically depends on the ability to stabilize and manipulate\nskyrmions at low magnetic fields. The driving force for skyrmion formation is\nthe non-collinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction (DMI) originating\nfrom spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It competes with both the nearest neighbour\nHeisenberg exchange interaction and the magnetic anisotropy, which favour\ncollinear states. While skyrmion lattices might evolve at vanishing magnetic\nfields, the formation of isolated skyrmions in ultra-thin films so far required\nthe application of an external field which can be as high as several T. Here,\nwe show that isolated skyrmions in a monolayer (ML) of Co epitaxially grown on\na Ru(0001) substrate can be stabilized at magnetic fields as low as 100 mT.\nEven though SOC is weak in the 4d element Ru, a homochiral spin spiral ground\nstate and isolated skyrmions could be detected and laterally resolved using a\ncombination of tunneling and anisotropic tunneling magnetoresistance effect in\nspin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations confirm these chiral magnetic textures, even though the\nstabilizing DMI interaction is weak.

On the other hand,\nbackscatter-sensors with limited signal-processing capabilities are unable to\nsupport conventional algorithms for multiple-access and channel-training. Thus,\nthe key challenge in designing backscatter-sensor networks is to enable readers\nto accurately detect sensing-values given simple ALOHA random access, primitive\ntransmission schemes, and no knowledge of channel-states. We tackle this\nchallenge by proposing the novel framework of backscatter sensing featuring\nrandom-encoding at sensors and statistical-inference at readers. Specifically,\nassuming the on/off keying for backscatter transmissions, the practical\nrandom-encoding scheme causes the on/off transmission of a sensor to follow a\ndistribution parameterized by the sensing values. Facilitated by the scheme,\nstatistical-inference algorithms are designed to enable a reader to infer\nsensing-values from randomized transmissions by multiple sensors. The specific\ndesign procedure involves the construction of Bayesian networks, namely\nderiving conditional distributions for relating unknown parameters and\nvariables to signals observed by the reader. Then based on the Bayesian\nnetworks and the well-known expectation-maximization principle, inference\nalgorithms are derived to recover sensing-values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 16:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

The actual path to explosion,\nhowever, remains elusive, with numerous plausible parent systems and explosion\nmechanisms suggested. Observationally, type Ia supernovae have multiple\nsubclasses, distinguished by their lightcurves and spectra. This raises the\nquestion whether these reflect that multiple mechanisms occur in nature, or\ninstead that explosions have a large but continuous range of physical\nproperties. We revisit the idea that normal and 91bg-like supernovae can be\nunderstood as part of a spectral sequence, in which changes in temperature\ndominate. Specifically, we find that a single ejecta structure is sufficient to\nprovide reasonable fits of both the normal type Ia supernova SN~2011fe and the\n91bg-like SN~2005bl, provided that the luminosity and thus temperature of the\nejecta are adjusted appropriately. This suggests that the outer layers of the\nejecta are similar, thus providing some support of a common explosion\nmechanism. Our spectral sequence also helps to shed light on the conditions\nunder which carbon can be detected in pre-maximum SN~Ia spectra -- we find that\nemission from iron can \"fill in\" the carbon trough in cool SN~Ia.

Consider the\ncurve in the family that encloses the greatest number of the shifted lattice\npoints: we seek to identify the limiting shape of this maximizing curve as the\narea is scaled up towards infinity.\n  The limiting shape is shown to depend explicitly on the lattice shift. The\nresult holds for all positive shifts, and for negative shifts satisfying a\ncertain condition. When the shift becomes too negative, the optimal curve no\nlonger converges to a limiting shape, and instead we show it degenerates.\n  Our results handle the $p$-circle $x^p+y^p=1$ when $p>1$ (concave) and also\nwhen $0<p<1$ (convex). Rescaling the $p$-circle generates the family of\n$p$-ellipses, and so in particular we identify the asymptotically optimal\n$p$-ellipses associated with shifted integer lattices.\n  The circular case $p=2$ with shift $-1/2$ corresponds to minimizing high\neigenvalues in a symmetry class for the Laplacian on rectangles, while the\nstraight line case ($p=1$) generates an open problem about minimizing high\neigenvalues of quantum harmonic oscillators with normalized parabolic\npotentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 18:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

In particular, we have applied the\nmethod to 2MASS point sources observed in the Orion A and B complexes, and the\nresults obtained compare very well with those obtained from deep Spitzer and\nChandra observations where presence of infrared excess or X-ray emission\ndirectly determines membership status for every star.

We analyse the sunspot area/number and the total magnetic flux\ndata for northern and southern hemispheres during solar cycles 19-23 which had\nremarkable north-south asymmetry. Using wavelet analysis of sunspot area and\nnumber during the north-dominated cycles (19-20) we obtained the periodicity of\n160-165 days in the stronger northern hemisphere and 180-190 days in the weaker\nsouthern hemisphere. On the other hand, south-dominated cycles (21-23) display\nthe periodicity of 155-160 days in the stronger southern hemisphere and 175-188\ndays in the weaker northern hemisphere. Therefore, the Rieger-type periodicity\nhas the north-south asymmetry in sunspot area/number data during solar cycles\nwith strong hemispheric asymmetry. We suggest that the periodicity is caused by\nmagnetic Rossby waves in the internal dynamo layer.

Failure to resolve\nthis has arguably delayed explaining the origins of superconductivity in these\nhighly complex materials. Here we effectively settle the question by\ncalculating a variety of thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties, exploring\nthe effect of a temperature-dependent pair-breaking term in the self-energy in\nthe presence of pairing interactions that persist well above $T_c$.

The boundary case\n$[\\phi]^+_{Ag}$ corresponds to the public announcement of $\\phi$, as known from\nthe literature. Unlike standard public announcements, which are {\\em model\ntransformers}, the global and local announcements are {\\em pointed model\ntransformers}. In particular, the update induced by the announcement may be\ndifferent in different states of the model. Therefore, the resulting\ncomputations are trees of models, rather than the typical sequences. A\nconsequence of our semantics is that modally bisimilar states may be\ndistinguished in our logic. Then, we provide a stronger notion of bisimilarity\nand we show that it preserves modal equivalence in GLAL. Additionally, we show\nthat GLAL is strictly more expressive than public announcement logic with\ncommon knowledge. We prove a wide range of validities for GLAL involving the\ninteraction between dynamics and knowledge, and show that the satisfiability\nproblem for GLAL is decidable.

First,\nwe analyze mobile applications associated with smart devices and then extract\nsome device control APIs. Second, we use SM@RT framework to build the device\nruntime model. Third, we define the scenario model, that is an abstraction of\ndevices and objects which the system consists of. Fourth, we specify mapping\nrules from the scenario model to the runtime model and employ a synchronizer,\nwhich can interpret the mapping rules, to keep the synchronization between the\nscenario model and the device runtime model. The mapping handler reads the\nmapping rules that are defined by developers and does the mapping in terms of\nthem. At last, developers can program smart home systems upon the MOF-compliant\nscenario model using the state-of-the-art model driven technologies.\nhttps://youtu.be/SP12OtmHj50\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

We show that, for $q > 2$, all q-ary linear codes are $\\sigma$-LCD\nand that, for every binary linear code $\\mathcal C$, the code $\\{0\\}\\times\n\\mathcal C$ is $\\sigma$-LCD. Further, we study deeply $\\sigma$-LCD generalized\nquasi-cyclic (GQC) codes. In particular, we provide characterizations of\n$\\sigma$-LCD GQC codes, self-orthogonal GQC codes and self-dual GQC codes,\nrespectively. Moreover, we provide constructions of asymptotically good\n$\\sigma$-LCD GQC codes. Finally, we focus on $\\sigma$-LCD Abelian codes and\nprove that all Abelian codes in a semi-simple group algebra are $\\sigma$-LCD.\n  The results derived in this paper extend those on the classical LCD codes and\nshow that $\\sigma$-LCD codes allow the construction of LCP of codes more easily\nand with more flexibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

the\nKashima NICT radio observatory in the 1.4 -- 1.7 GHz band with a net exposure\nof about 2 ks on 25 March 2016, just before the loss of the Hitomi mission.The\ntiming performance of the Hitomi instruments was confirmed to meet the timing\nrequirement and about 1,000 and 100 GRPs were simultaneously observed at the\nmain and inter-pulse phases, respectively, and we found no apparent

In the literature\non strong approximation of SDEs, polynomial error rate results are typically\nachieved under the assumption that the first order derivatives of the\ncoefficients of the equation satisfy a polynomial growth condition. This\nassumption is violated for the pathological SDEs from the above mentioned\nnegative result.

To the best\nof our knowledge, this is only the second example in the literature of an SDE\nfor which there exist adaptive methods that perform superior to non-adaptive\nones with respect to the convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 11:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

First, the conditions required to have a nowhere negative\nand monothonically decreasing dark matter halo density profile, are derived.

The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact\nsubspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary\nphases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the\nbackground gravitational field is small and the leading term in the\ncorresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field\nin the locally Minkowski bulk. Unlike the Minkowskian case, in the system\nconsisting an equal number of fermionic and scalar degrees of freedom, with\nsame masses, charges and phases in the periodicity conditions, the total\ncurrent density does not vanish. In these systems, the leading divergences in\nthe scalar and fermionic contributions on the horizon are canceled and, as a\nconsequence of that, the charge flux, integrated over the coordinate\nperpendicular to the AdS boundary, becomes finite. We show that in odd\nspacetime dimensions the fermionic fields realizing two inequivalent\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra and having equal phases in the\nperiodicity conditions give the same contribution to the VEV of the current\ndensity. Combining the contributions from these fields, the current density in\nodd-dimensional C-,P- and T -symmetric models are obtained.

In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the\nmost thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide\nspectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to\ncollect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that\na tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit\npresence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never\nbeen implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year\nuntouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag\nhash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which\nmoves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design\nthree types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and\ntash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective\nreading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2\nprotocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply\nour hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality\nestimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of\nTash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,\n000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication\noverhead in the air.

Our fastest implementation is\nbandwidth-bound and integrates $343$ million grid points per second on a Tesla\nK40t GPU, achieving a $3.6 \\times$ speedup over a comparable hydrodynamics\nsolver benchmarked on two Intel Xeon E5-2690v3 processors. Our alternative GPU\nimplementation is latency-bound and achieves the rate of $168$ million updates\nper second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

During this very deep X-ray\ncampaign, the source was caught in a high flux state similar to the earlier\n2003 XMM-Newton observation, and about twice as bright as the lower-flux\nobservation in 2013. The spectral analysis confirms the \"softer when brighter\"\nbehaviour of Ark 120. The four XMM-Newton/pn spectra are characterized by the\npresence of a prominent soft X-ray excess and a significant FeK$\\alpha$\ncomplex. The continuum is very similar above about 3 keV, while significant\nvariability is present for the soft X-ray excess. We find that relativistic\nreflection from a constant-density, flat accretion disk cannot simultaneously\nproduce the soft excess, broad FeK$\\alpha$ complex, and hard X-ray excess.\nInstead, Comptonization reproduces the broadband (0.3-79 keV) continuum well,\ntogether with a contribution from a mildly relativistic disk reflection\nspectrum. During this 2014 observational campaign, the soft X-ray spectrum of\nArk 120 below $\\sim$0.5 keV was found to be dominated by Comptonization of seed\nphotons from the disk by a warm ($kT_{\\rm e}$$\\sim$0.5 keV), optically-thick\ncorona ($\\tau$$\\sim$9). Above this energy, the X-ray spectrum becomes dominated\nby Comptonization from electrons in a hot optically thin corona, while the\nbroad FeK$\\alpha$ line and the mild Compton hump result from reflection off the\ndisk at several tens of gravitational radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

It is generally accepted\nthat magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in these conversion processes.\nTo achieve the rapid energy release required in solar flares, an anomalous\nresistivity, orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity, is often\nused in MHD simulations of reconnection. Spitzer resistivity is based on\nCoulomb scattering, which becomes negligible at the high energies achieved by\naccelerated particles. As a result, simulations of particle acceleration in\nreconnection events are often performed in the absence of any interaction\nbetween accelerated particles and any background plasma. This need not be the\ncase for scattering associated with anomalous resistivity caused by turbulence\nwithin solar flares, as the higher resistivity implies an elevated scattering\nrate. We present results of test particle calculations, with and without pitch\nangle scattering, subject to fields derived from MHD simulations of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) X-point reconnection. Scattering rates proportional to the\nratio of the anomalous resistivity to the local Spitzer resistivity, as well as\nat fixed values, are considered. Pitch angle scattering, which is independent\nof the anomalous resistivity, causes higher maximum energies in comparison to\nthose obtained without scattering. Scattering rates which are dependent on the\nlocal anomalous resistivity tend to produce fewer highly energised particles\ndue to weaker scattering in the separatrices, even though scattering in the\ncurrent sheet may be stronger when compared to resistivity-independent\nscattering. Strong scattering also causes an increase in the number of\nparticles exiting the computational box in the reconnection outflow region, as\nopposed to along the separatrices as is the case in the absence of scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 19:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

The objective of this\nwork is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation of a RS field in\nthe studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing\nFCPR. This led to the development of a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES,\nin which RS are introduced by weld bead deposition far from the region in which\nfatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a consequence, the effect of factors\ninfluencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes or plastic\ndeformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding\nRS introduced in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and\nthe weight functions method was used to calculate the stress intensity factor\n(SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack propagates into the\nspecimen. The evolution of cyclic stress ratio at the crack tip, Rlocal, was\nthen computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the cyclic stress\nratio. The results show that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR\nof the welded geometry with fixed externally low R ratio (R = 0.1), but\nconstantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry\nwithout RS, solicited at high cyclic stress ratio (R = 0.7). These observations\npartially validate the BS7910 standard philosophy in which the remaining life\nof a flawed structure in presence of tensile RS is calculated from a high\ncyclic stress ratio (R > 0.5) crack propagation curve to eliminate crack\nclosure effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 20:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

At its\ncore is a surrogate model employing a machine-learning technique called\nkriging, which is combined with data-driven basis functions to extract and\nmodel the underlying coherent structures. This emulation framework encompasses\nkey design parameter sensitivity analysis, physics-guided classification of\ndesign parameter sets, and flow evolution modeling for efficient design survey.\nTo better inform the model of quantifiable physical knowledge, a sensitivity\nanalysis using Sobol' indices and a decision tree are incorporated into the\nframework. This information improves the surrogate model training process,\nwhich employs basis functions as regression functions over the design space for\nthe kriging model. The novelty of the proposed approach is the construction of\nthe model through Common Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which allows for\ndata-reduction and extraction of common coherent structures. The accuracy of\nprediction of mean flow features for new swirl injector designs is assessed and\nthe dynamic flowfield is captured in the form of power spectrum densities. This\ndata-driven framework also demonstrates the uncertainty quantification of\npredictions, providing a metric for model fit. The significantly reduced\ncomputation time required for evaluating new design points enables efficient\nsurvey of the design space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 21:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

Two different computation methods for these AIRs are also discussed:\nMonte-Carlo integration and Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Closed-form ready-to-use\napproximations for such computations are provided for arbitrary constellations\nand the multidimensional AWGN channel.
