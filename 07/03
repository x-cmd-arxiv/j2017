However, these multipath schemes have not been widely\ndeployed in DCNs. We argue that two key factors among others impeded their\nadoption: TCP incast and minimum window syndrome. First, these mechanisms are\nill-suited for workloads with a many-to-one communication pattern, commonly\nfound in DCNs, causing frequent TCP incast collapses. Second, the syndrome we\ndiscover for the first time, results in 2-5 times lower throughput for\nsingle-path flows than multipath flows, thus severely violating network\nfairness.\n  To effectively tackle these problems, we propose AMP: an adaptive multipath\ncongestion control mechanism that quickly detects the onset of these problems\nand transforms its multipath flow into a single-path flow. Once these problems\ndisappear, AMP safely reverses this transformation and continues its data\ntransmission via multiple paths. Our evaluation results under a diverse set of\nscenarios in a fat-tree topology with realistic workloads demonstrate that AMP\nis robust to the TCP incast problem and improves network fairness between\nmultipath and single-path flows significantly with little performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 16:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 14:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 12:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

In this paper, we propose a reciprocal recommender\nsystem which matches learners who are mutually interested in, and likely to\ncommunicate with each other based on their profile attributes like age,\nlocation, gender, qualification, interests, etc. We test our algorithm on data\nsampled using the publicly available MITx-Harvardx dataset and demonstrate that\nboth attribute importance and reciprocity play an important role in forming the\nfinal recommendation list of learners. Our approach provides promising results\nfor such a system to be implemented within an actual MOOC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 18:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

H2 emission is found in most of them (14 out of 15), mostly\nassociated with rings at their equatorial regions and with their bipolar lobes.\nThese detections add to the high occurrence of H2 emission among bipolar PNe\nreported in previous works, resulting from the large reservoir of molecular\nmaterial in these sources and the suitable excitation conditions for H2\nemission. The correlation between detailed bipolar morphology and H2 luminosity\nis also confirmed: bipolar PNe with broad equatorial rings (R-BPNe) have almost\nno continuum emission, are H2 brighter and have larger H2/Brgamma line ratio\nthan bipolar PNe with pinched equatorial waists (W-BPNe). The origin of this\ndichotomy is unclear. The larger size and age of R-BPNe are consistent with\nshock excitation of H2, whereas ultraviolet pumping is most likely the\nexcitation mechanism in the smaller and younger W-BPNe, which would explain\ntheir lower H2 luminosity. Although both types of bipolar PNe seem to proceed\nfrom the same progenitor population, this does not imply that R-BPNe descend\nfrom W-BPNe. Otherwise, we note that some of the H2-weak bipolar PNe harbor\npost-common envelope binary systems and symbiotic stars. Finally, we suggest\nthat the long-living H2 emission from R-BPNe arises from a discrete\ndistribution of compact knots embedded within the ionized gas at the equatorial\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 23:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

However, it is still\nunclear why these deep learning architectures work for specific inverse\nproblems. To address these issues, here we show that the long-searched-for\nmissing link is the convolution framelets for representing a signal by\nconvolving local and non-local bases. The convolution framelets was originally\ndeveloped to generalize the theory of low-rank Hankel matrix approaches for\ninverse problems, and this paper further extends the idea so that we can obtain\na deep neural network using multilayer convolution framelets with perfect\nreconstruction (PR) under rectilinear linear unit nonlinearity (ReLU). Our\nanalysis also shows that the popular deep network components such as residual\nblock, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) do indeed help\nto achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented\nwith high-pass branches to meet the PR condition. Moreover, by changing the\nnumber of filter channels and bias, we can control the shrinkage behaviors of\nthe neural network. This discovery leads us to propose a novel theory for deep\nconvolutional framelets neural network. Using numerical experiments with\nvarious inverse problems, we demonstrated that our deep convolution framelets\nnetwork shows consistent improvement over existing deep architectures.This\ndiscovery suggests that the success of deep learning is not from a magical\npower of a black-box, but rather comes from the power of a novel signal\nrepresentation using non-local basis combined with data-driven local basis,\nwhich is indeed a natural extension of classical signal processing theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 00:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 08:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 13:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 07:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 09:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

There has been growing\ninterest in developing efficient algorithms for CDL, mostly relying on the\naugmented Lagrangian (AL) method or the variant alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). When their parameters are properly tuned, AL methods have\nshown fast convergence in CDL. However, the parameter tuning process is not\ntrivial due to its data dependence and, in practice, the convergence of AL\nmethods depends on the AL parameters for nonconvex CDL problems. To moderate\nthese problems, this paper proposes a new practically feasible and convergent\nBlock Proximal Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPG-M) for CDL. The\nBPG-M-based CDL is investigated with different block updating schemes and\nmajorization matrix designs, and further accelerated by incorporating some\nmomentum coefficient formulas and restarting techniques. All of the methods\ninvestigated incorporate a boundary artifacts removal (or, more generally,\nsampling) operator in the learning model. Numerical experiments show that,\nwithout needing any parameter tuning process, the proposed BPG-M approach\nconverges more stably to desirable solutions of lower objective values than the\nexisting state-of-the-art ADMM algorithm and its memory-efficient variant do.\nCompared to the ADMM approaches, the BPG-M method using a multi-block updating\nscheme is particularly useful in single-threaded CDL algorithm handling large\ndatasets, due to its lower memory requirement and no polynomial computational\ncomplexity. Image denoising experiments show that, for relatively strong\nadditive white Gaussian noise, the filters learned by BPG-M-based CDL\noutperform those trained by the ADMM approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 03:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We find that the hemisphere of the\nmaximum acceleration scale is in the direction $(l,b) =\n({175.5^\\circ}^{+6^\\circ}_{-10^\\circ}, {-6.5^\\circ}^{+8^\\circ}_{-3^\\circ})$\nwith $g_{\\dag,max}=1.10\\times10^{-10} \\rm m~s^{-2}$, while the hemisphere of\nthe minimum acceleration scale is in the opposite direction $(l,b) =\n({355.5^\\circ}^{+6^\\circ}_{-10^\\circ}, {6.5^\\circ}^{+3^\\circ}_{-8^\\circ})$ with\n$g_{\\dag,min}=0.76\\times10^{-10} \\rm m~s^{-2}$. The maximum anisotropy level\nreaches up to $0.37\\pm0.04$. Robust tests present that such a level of\nanisotropy can't be reproduced by a statistically isotropic data. In addition,\nwe show that the spatial anisotropy on the acceleration scale has little\ncorrelation with the non-uniform distribution of the SPARC data points in sky.\nWe also find that the maximum anisotropy direction is close with other\ncosmological preferred directions, especially the direction of the \"Australia\ndipole\" for the fine structure constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 06:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Four of them are new, while the other six had been\ndiscovered previously, but never investigated homogeneously and in detail.\nProjected physical separations and magnitude differences of the ten probably\nbound pairs range from 180 to 1220 au, and from 0.0 to 3.4 mag in K,\nrespectively. Besides, we identify two cluster stars with elongated point\nspread functions. We determine the minimum frequency of wide multiplicity in\nthe interval of projected physical separations s = 160-1600 au in sigma Orionis\nat 3.0^{+1.2}_{-1.1} %. We discover a new Lindroos system, find that massive\nand X-ray stars tend to be in pairs or trios, conclude that multiplicity\ntruncates circumstellar discs and enhances X-ray emission, and ascribe a\nreported lithium depletion in a young star to unresolved binarity in spectra of\nmoderate resolution. When accounting for all know multiples, including\nspectroscopic binaries, the minimum frequency of multiplicity increases to\nabout 10 %, which implies that of the order of 80-100 unknown multiple systems\nstill await discovery in sigma Orionis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 08:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Data encryption offers robust security,\nbut at the cost of hampering the efficiency of the service and limiting the\nfunctionalities that can be applied over the (encrypted) data stored on cloud\npremises. Because both efficiency and functionality are crucial advantages of\ncloud computing, in this paper we aim at retaining them by proposing a\nprivacy-protection mechanism that relies on splitting (clear) data, and on the\ndistributed storage offered by the increasingly popular notion of multi-clouds.\nWe propose a semantically-grounded data splitting mechanism that is able to\nautomatically detect pieces of data that may cause privacy risks and split them\non local premises, so that each chunk does not incur in those risks; then,\nchunks of clear data are independently stored into the separate locations of a\nmulti-cloud, so that external entities cannot have access to the whole\nconfidential data. Because partial data are stored in clear on cloud premises,\noutsourced functionalities are seamlessly and efficiently supported by just\nbroadcasting queries to the different cloud locations. To enforce a robust\nprivacy notion, our proposal relies on a privacy model that offers a priori\nprivacy guarantees; to ensure its feasibility, we have designed heuristic\nalgorithms that minimize the number of cloud storage locations we need; to show\nits potential and generality, we have applied it to the least structured and\nmost challenging data type: plain textual documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 08:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The single unicast index coding problem\nwith symmetric neighboring interference (SUICP-SNI) is motivated by topological\ninterference management problems in wireless communication networks. Maleki,\nCadambe and Jafar obtained the capacity of this SUICP-SNI with $K$ tending to\ninfinity and Blasiak, Kleinberg and Lubetzky for the special case of $(D=U=1)$\nwith $K$ being finite. Finding the capacity of the SUICP-SNI for arbitrary\n$K,D$ and $U$ is a challenging open problem. In our previous work, for an\nSUICP-SNI with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we defined a set $\\mathcal{\\mathbf{S}}$\nof $2$-tuples such that for every $(a,b)$ in that set $\\mathcal{\\mathbf{S}}$,\nthe rate $D+1+\\frac{a}{b}$ is achieved by using vector linear index codes over\nevery finite field.

A random vector is regularly varying if and\nonly if its radial part $R$ is regularly varying and is asymptotically\nindependent of the angular part $\\Theta$ as $R$ goes to infinity. The\nconditional limiting distribution of $\\Theta$ given $R$ is large characterizes\nthe tail dependence of the random vector and hence its estimation is the\nprimary goal of applications. A typical strategy is to look at the angular\ncomponents of the data for which the radial parts exceed some threshold. While\na large class of methods has been proposed to model the angular distribution\nfrom these exceedances, the choice of threshold has been scarcely discussed in\nthe literature. In this paper, we describe a procedure for choosing the\nthreshold by formally testing the independence of $R$ and $\\Theta$ using a\nmeasure of dependence called distance covariance. We generalize the limit\ntheorem for distance covariance to our unique setting and propose an algorithm\nwhich selects the threshold for $R$. This algorithm incorporates a subsampling\nscheme that is also applicable to weakly dependent data. Moreover, it avoids\nthe heavy computation in the calculation of the distance covariance, a typical\nlimitation for this measure.

If these hops are\nuncorrelated, quantitative relationships can be derived that connect\nmicroscopic hopping rates to macroscopic transport coefficients. At non-dilute\nconcentrations the relationships between hopping frequency, diffusion\ncoefficient, and ionic conductivity deviate from the random walk case, with\nthis deviation quantified by single-particle and collective correlation\nfactors, $f$ and $f_\\mathrm{I}$. These factors vary between materials, and\ndepend on the concentration of mobile particles, the nature of the\ninteractions, and the host lattice geometry. Here we study these correlation\neffects for the garnet lattice using lattice-gas Monte Carlo simulations. We\nfind that for non-interacting particles (volume exclusion only) single-particle\ncorrelation effects are more significant than for any previously studied\nthree-dimensional lattice. This is attributed to the presence of two-coordinate\nlattice sites, which causes correlation effects intermediate between typical\nthree-dimensional and one-dimensional lattices.

Single ion orbits show that ion radial mass separation in a uniform\nmagnetized plasma column can be achieved by applying a tailored electric\npotential profile across the column, or by driving a rotating magnetic field\nwithin the column. Furthermore, magnetic pressure and centrifugal effects can\nbe combined in a non-uniform geometry to separate ions based on mass along the\nfield lines. Practical application of these separation schemes hinges on the\nability to produce the desirable electric and magnetic field configuration\nwithin the plasma column.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 12:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The basic idea is that primary\nparticles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant\nshocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally\ninteracting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce\nsecondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The\nsame shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the\nfirst place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided\nbeing above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by\nspallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get\naccelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of\ndebate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium\ntaking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the\nrecent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron\nand lithium flux.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the most common scenario: the user-item (U-I) matrix of implicit\nfeedback. Even though many recommendation approaches are designed based on\nimplicit feedback, they attempt to project the U-I matrix into a low-rank\nlatent space, which is a strict restriction that rarely holds in practice. In\naddition, although misclassification costs from imbalanced classes are\nsignificantly different, few methods take the cost of classification error into\naccount. To address aforementioned issues, we propose a robust framework by\ndecomposing the U-I matrix into two components: (1) a low-rank matrix that\ncaptures the common preference, and (2) a sparse matrix that detects the\nuser-specific preference of individuals. A cost-sensitive learning model is\nembedded into the framework. Specifically, this model exploits different costs\nin the loss function for the observed and unobserved instances. We show that\nthe resulting non-smooth convex objective can be optimized efficiently by an\naccelerated projected gradient method with closed-form solutions. Morever, the\nproposed algorithm can be scaled up to large-sized datasets after a relaxation.\nThe theoretical result shows that even with a small fraction of 1's in the U-I\nmatrix $M\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$, the cost-sensitive error of the proposed\nmodel is upper bounded by $O(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{mn}})$, where $\\alpha$ is a\nbias over imbalanced classes. Finally, empirical experiments are extensively\ncarried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.\nEncouraging experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark recommendation datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 13:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

This requires explanation since\nin a low-state, the mass-transfer rate is in principle too low for the disc to\nbe fully ionized and the disc should be subject to the standard thermal and\nviscous instability observed in dwarf novae. We investigate the conditions\nunder which an accretion disc in an intermediate polar could exhibit a\nluminosity drop of 2 magnitudes in the optical band without showing outbursts.\nWe use our numerical code for the time evolution of accretion discs, including\nother light sources from the system (primary, secondary, hot spot). We show\nthat although it is marginally possible for the accretion disc in the low-state\nto stay on the hot stable branch, the required mass-transfer rate in the normal\nstate would then have to be extremely high, of the order of 10$^{19}$ gs$^{-1}$\nor even larger. This would make the system so intrinsically bright that its\ndistance should be much larger than allowed by all estimates. We show that\nobservations of FO Aqr are well accounted for by the same mechanism that we\nhave suggested as explaining the absence of outbursts during low states of VY\nScl stars: during the decay, the magnetospheric radius exceeds the\ncircularization radius, so that the disc disappears before it enters the\ninstability strip for dwarf nova outbursts.

Only about 30% of the total HI gas is anchored on\nthe stellar disk, while most of HI gas forms the filament in the west.

We have shown that for $s$ states the dependence on QED\neffects may also be removed to high accuracy. The ability to probe the\nelectronic wave functions, through hyperfine comparisons, with significantly\nincreased accuracy is important for the analysis of atomic parity violation\nmeasurements and may enable the accuracy of atomic parity violation\ncalculations to be improved.

Diffusion coefficients were computed\nfor representative structures taking into account the framework flexibility\nthat is essential in assessing the dynamical properties of the adsorbed gases.\nGood performance for the gas separation in CH$_{4}$/H$_{2}$, CO$_{2}$/H$_{2}$\nand CO$_{2}$/N$_{2}$ mixtures was found with values comparable to those of\nmetal-organic frameworks and zeolites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 14:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

A\ncrucial step in this algorithm uses the existence of vertex subsets of a simple\ngraph $G$ whose contractions leave a graph with $\\tilde{O}(n/\\delta)$ vertices\nand $\\tilde{O}(n)$ edges ($n := |V(G)|$) such that all non-trivial min-cuts of\n$G$ are preserved. We improve this result by eliminating the poly-logarithmic\nfactors, that is, we show a contraction-based sparsification that leaves\n$O(n/\\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges and preserves all non-trivial min-cuts.\nWe complement this result by giving a sparsification that leaves $O(n/\\delta)$\nvertices and $O(n)$ edges such that all (possibly not minimum) cuts of size\nless than $\\delta$ are preserved, by using contractions in a second tree\nstructure. As consequence, we have that every simple graph has $O(n/\\delta)$\n$\\delta$-edge-connected components, and, if it is connected, it has\n$O((n/\\delta)^2)$ non-trivial min-cuts. All these results are proven to be\nasymptotically optimal.\n  By using a third tree structure, we give a new lower bound on the number of\n\\emph{pendant pairs}.

SN\n2009ip-like events are characterized by a long-lasting phase of erratic\nvariability which ends with two luminous outbursts a few weeks apart. The\nsecond outburst is significantly more luminous (about 3 mag) than the first. In\nthe case of SN 2016bdu, the first outburst (Event A) reached an absolute\nmagnitude M(r) ~ -15.3 mag, while the second one (Event B) occurred over one\nmonth later and reached M(r) ~ -18 mag. By inspecting archival data, a faint\nsource at the position of SN 2016bdu is detectable several times in the past\nfew years. We interpret these detections as signatures of a phase of erratic\nvariability, similar to that experienced by SN 2009ip between 2008 and\nmid-2012, and resembling the currently observed variability of the luminous\nblue variable SN 2000ch in NGC 3432. Spectroscopic monitoring of SN 2016bdu\nduring the second peak initially shows features typical of a SN IIn. One month\nafter the Event B maximum, the spectra develop broad Balmer lines with P Cygni\nprofiles and broad metal features. At these late phases, the spectra resemble\nthose of a typical Type II SN. All members of this SN 2009ip-like group are\nremarkably similar to the Type IIn SN 2005gl. For this object, the claim of a\nterminal SN explosion is supported by the disappearance of the progenitor star.\nThe similarity with SN 2005gl suggests that all members of this family may\nfinally explode as genuine SNe, although the unequivocal detection of\nnucleosynthesised elements in their nebular spectra is still missing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 15:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

The conductivity\nmeasured between two plane electrodes in a longitudinal configuration is linear\nwithin 2% provided the electric field is kept below 100 kV/m. Furthermore,\nsimulations show that the signal behaves like the amount of generated free\nelectrons. The slow ionic current measured with plane electrodes in a parallel\nconfiguration is representative of the ionic charge available in the filament,\nafter several $\\mu$s, when the free electrons have recombined. It is linear\nwithin 2% with the amount of ions and is insensitive to misalignment. Finally,\nthe fast polarization signal in the same configuration deviates from linearity\nby up to 80% and can only be considered as a semi-qualitative indication of the\npresence of charges, e.g., to characterize the filament length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 15:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Recent computational\nstudies have adopted a distinct different view, where plausible mechanisms are\nproposed to describe a wide range of social phenomena, including the onset and\nevolution of organizational culture. In this spirit, this work introduces an\nempirically-grounded, agent-based model which relaxes a set of assumptions that\ndescribes past work - (a) omittance of an individual's strive for achieving\ncognitive coherence, (b) limited integration of important contextual factors -\nby utilizing networks of beliefs and incorporating social rank into the\ndynamics. As a result, we illustrate that: (i) an organization may appear to be\nincreasingly coherent in terms of organizational culture, yet be composed of\nindividuals with reduced levels of coherence, (ii) the components of social\nconformity - peer-pressure and social rank - are influential at different\naggregation levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 09:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
