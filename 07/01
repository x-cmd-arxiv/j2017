This paper proposes an SPH method for\nevaporating multiphase flows. The present SPH method can simulate the heat and\nmass transfers across the liquid-gas interfaces. The conservation equations of\nmass, momentum and energy were reformulated based on SPH, then were used to\ngovern the fluid flow and heat transfer in both the liquid and gas phases. The\ncontinuity equation of the vapor species was employed to simulate the vapor\nmass fraction in the gas phase. The vapor mass fraction at the interface was\npredicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron correlation. A new evaporation rate was\nderived to predict the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase at\nthe interface. Because of the mass transfer across the liquid-gas interface,\nthe mass of an SPH particle was allowed to change. New particle splitting and\nmerging techniques were developed to avoid large mass difference between SPH\nparticles of the same phase. The proposed method was tested by simulating three\nproblems, including the Stefan problem, evaporation of a static drop, and\nevaporation of a drop impacting on a hot surface. For the Stefan problem, the\nSPH results of the evaporation rate at the interface agreed well with the\nanalytical solution. For drop evaporation, the SPH result was compared with the\nresult predicted by a level-set method from literature. In the case of drop\nimpact on a hot surface, the evolution of the shape of the drop, temperature,\nand vapor mass fraction were predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 16:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 04:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

The\ntheoretical result guarantees that, under the degree corrected stochastic block\nmodel, even for networks with outliers, the maximizer of the tightness\ncriterion can extract communities with small misclassification rates even when\nthe number of communities grows to infinity as the network size grows.\nSimulation study shows that the proposed method can recover true communities\nmore accurately than other methods. Applications to a college football data and\na yeast protein-protein interaction data also reveal that the proposed method\nperforms significantly better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 17:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

In this framework, the problem of signal reconstruction in\ninterferometry amounts to one of basis analysis. Its applicability is shown to\nextend beyond conventional temporal interferometry, which leverages the\nrelative delay between the two arms of an interferometer, to arbitrary degrees\nof freedom of the input signal. This allows for reconstruction of signals\nsupported in other domains (e.g., spatial) with no modification to the\nunderlying structure except for replacing the standard temporal delay with a\ngeneralized delay, that is, a practically realizable unitary transformation for\nwhich the basis elements are eigenfunctions. Under the proposed model, the\ninterferometric measurements are shown to be linear in the basis coefficients,\nthereby enabling efficient and fast recovery of the desired information. While\nthe corresponding linear transformation has only a limited number of degrees of\nfreedom set by the structure of the interferometer giving rise to a highly\nconstrained sensing structure, we show that the problem of signal recovery from\nsuch measurements can still be carried out compressively. This signifies\nsignificant reduction in sample complexity without introducing any additional\nrandomization as is typically done in prior work leveraging compressive sensing\ntechniques. We provide performance guarantees under constrained sensing by\nproving that the transformation satisfies sufficient conditions for successful\nreconstruction of sparse signals using concentration arguments. We showcase the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using simulation results, as well as\nactual experimental results in the context of optical modal analysis of spatial\nbeams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 17:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

A major driver of steady-state plate tectonics on Earth is the\nsinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking\nis the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the\nlithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust\nand lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk\ncomposition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building\nelements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy.\nWe present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary\ndifferentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and\nshow that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances\ncontrol a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived,\nmelt-extracted crusts that sink.

Motivated by recent claims that the evaporation of just one PBH\nwould destabilise the Higgs vacuum and collapse the universe, we calculate the\nconstraints which follow from assuming there are zero PBHs within the\nobservable universe. This extends the constraints right down to the horizon\nscale at the end of inflation, but does not significantly tighten the existing\npower spectrum constraints, even though the constraint on PBH abundance can\ndecrease by up to 46 orders of magnitude. This shows that no future improvement\nin observational constraints can ever lead to a significant tightening in\nconstraints on inflation (via the power spectrum amplitude). The power spectrum\nconstraints are weak because an order unity perturbation is required in order\nto overcome pressure forces. We therefore consider an early matter dominated\nera, during which exponentially more PBHs form for the same initial conditions.\nWe show this leads to far tighter constraints, which approach ${\\cal\nP}_\\mathcal{R}\\lesssim10^{-9}$, albeit over a smaller range of scales and are\nvery sensitive to when the early matter dominated era ends. Finally, we show\nthat an extended early matter era is incompatible with the argument that an\nevaporating PBH would destroy the universe, unless the power spectrum amplitude\ndecreases by up to ten orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 17:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 17:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

While telemetry healthcare services\nusing mobile networks may enable remote real-time monitoring of transported\npatients, physiologic measures and tracking are at least as important and\nrequires the existence of high-fidelity communication coverage. However, the\nwireless networks along the roads especially in rural areas can range from 4G\nto low-speed 2G, some parts with communication breakage. From a patient care\nperspective, transport during critical illness can make route selection patient\nstate dependent. Prompt decisions with the relative advantage of a longer more\nsecure bandwidth route versus a shorter, more rapid transport route but with\nless secure bandwidth must be made. The trade-off between route selection and\nthe quality of wireless communication is an important optimization problem\nwhich unfortunately has remained unaddressed by prior work.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel physiology-aware route scheduling approach\nfor emergency ambulance transport of rural patients with acute, high risk\ndiseases in need of continuous remote monitoring. We mathematically model the\nproblem into an NP-hard graph theory problem, and approximate a solution based\non a trade-off between communication coverage and shortest path. We profile\ncommunication along two major routes in a large rural hospital settings in\nIllinois, and use the traces to manifest the concept. Further, we design our\nalgorithms and run preliminary experiments for scalability analysis.

These preliminary studies\nnevertheless assume background-free scenarios after certain selection criteria\nwhich are overly optimistic and untenable in realistic situations. These lead\nto incorrect projections. The unique signal topology and challenging hadronic\nenvironment also make this mass-scale regime ripe for a careful investigation.\nWith the above motivations, we attempt to perform the first systematic study of\nlow, electroweak-scale, right-handed neutrinos at hadron colliders, in this\nunique signal topology. There are currently no active searches at hadron\ncolliders for sterile neutrino states in this mass range, and we frame the\nstudy in the context of the $13\\,\\rm{TeV}$ high-luminosity Large Hadron\nCollider and the proposed FCC-hh/SppC $100\\,\\rm{TeV}$ $pp$-collider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 18:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

In this manuscript, we discuss\nthe models and capabilities that have recently been implemented within the APBS\nsoftware package including: a Poisson-Boltzmann analytical and a\nsemi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a geometry-based\ngeometric flow solvation model, a graph theory based algorithm for determining\np$K_a$ values, and an improved web-based visualization tool for viewing\nelectrostatics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 19:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 21:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

Recently, it has\nbeen shown that codes can provide significant gains in overcoming these\nbottlenecks. In particular, optimal coding schemes for minimizing latency in\ndistributed computation of linear functions and mitigating the effect of\nstragglers was proposed for a wired network, where the workers can\nsimultaneously transmit messages to a master node without interference. In this\npaper, we focus on the problem of coded computation over a wireless\nmaster-worker setup with straggling workers, where only one worker can transmit\nthe result of its local computation back to the master at a time. We consider 3\nasymptotic regimes (determined by how the communication and computation times\nare scaled with the number of workers) and precisely characterize the total\nrun-time of the distributed algorithm and optimum coding strategy in each\nregime. In particular, for the regime of practical interest where the\ncomputation and communication times of the distributed computing algorithm are\ncomparable, we show that the total run-time approaches a simple lower bound\nthat decouples computation and communication, and demonstrate that coded\nschemes are $\\Theta(\\log(n))$ times faster than uncoded schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

However, the\nintrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is a major limitation for\nrealizing large-scale quantum networks. Active feedforward switching of photons\nfrom multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach that can be used to\nbuild a deterministic source. However, previous implementations of this\napproach that utilize spatial and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly\nincreasing switching losses when scaled to a large number of modes. Here, we\nbreak this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses\nremain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order\nnonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient\nultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three\nfrequency modes. We achieve a record generation rate of $4.6\\times10^4$\nmultiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low $g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07, indicating\nhigh single-photon purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a\ntotal loss of just 1.3 dB independent of the number of multiplexed modes, such\nthat the 4.8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly\novercomes switching loss.

A geometrical\ndescription in the frequency-wavenumber plane is developed to provide insight\ninto the possible interactions and their nature. It is shown that the secular\nequation has a singularity, which results in a weak/passive second harmonic\ngeneration process. Additionally bandgaps arising from the strong/active\nparametric interaction between an incident wave and its space-time harmonic,\nresult in an inelastic Brillouin like scattering process. Hence when the\nincident frequency is inside a forward (backward) bandgap, a Stokes'\n(Anti-Stokes') scattered wave bounces back to the source. Although the forward\nand backward bandgaps do not generally occur at the same frequency bands, the\ninsertion loss and gap width are equal. Requiring that both gaps do not\noverlap, enforces a lower bound on the modulation speed. It is shown that\nalthough an increase in the modulation index is desirable, as it enhances the\nnon-reciprocal behaviour, it also limits the range of possible modulation\nspeeds. The effective complex refractive index is calculated over a wide\nfrequency range. It is shown that peaks appear in the extinction coefficient,\nindicating scattering to Stokes' and Anti-Stokes' waves. Finally, a\ncomprehensive numerical analysis based on the Finite Difference Time Domain\nmethod is developed to verify and demonstrate the intriguing properties of\nspace-time modulated media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 21:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 17:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Deep\nlearning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using\ncamera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical\napplication, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state\nof the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the\ncharacterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing\non prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without\nadditional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to\nidentify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show\nthat inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar\nimages can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections)\nand using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary\nclassifier can be used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two\ndistinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data that are\nreadily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any\ncamera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of\nreal world data. We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our\nclassifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI\ntracking dataset with an average precision of 0.94. We also release a new\ntracking dataset with 104 sequences totaling 80,655 labeled pairs of stereo\nimages along with ground truth disparity from a game engine to facilitate\nfurther research.

When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has an\nanomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapse\nSN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves this\ndiscrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054\nis an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an order\nof magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches were\nperformed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set a\nstringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extreme\nbrightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employed\nspectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomi\nsatellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limit\nfor emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the\n2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.\nBy assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-ray\nplasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, and\nplasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To compare\nwith the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the Crab\nSNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniform\nISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can be\ncompatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~\n0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or a\nprogenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of\n10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 22:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 08:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The\nnature of such a QCP has been a subject of recent studies by density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG). In this paper, we reexamine the ground state of\nthe one doped hole, and show that a two-component structure is present in the\ndensity wave regime in contrast to the single component in the Bloch wave\nregime. In the former, the density wave itself is still contributed by a\nstanding-wave-like component characterized by a quasiparticle spectral weight\n$Z$ in a finite-size system. But there is an additional charge incoherent\ncomponent emerging, which intrinsically breaks the translational symmetry\nassociated with the density wave. The partial momentum is carried away by\nneutral spin excitations.

The energy is given by\na Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian that includes Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,\nanisotropy and external magnetic field. Local minima on this surface correspond\nto the ferromagnetic and skyrmion states. Minimum energy paths (MEP) between\nthe minima are calculated using the geodesic nudged elastic band method. The\nmaximum energy along an MEP corresponds to a first order saddle point on the\nenergy surface and gives an estimate of the activation energy for the magnetic\ntransition, such as creation and annihilation of a skyrmion.

In neutral talking\nenvironments, speakers can be easily verified, however, in emotional talking\nenvironments, speakers cannot be easily verified as in neutral talking ones.\nConsequently, speaker verification systems do not perform well in emotional\ntalking environments as they do in neutral talking environments. In this work,\na two-stage approach has been employed and evaluated to improve speaker\nverification performance in emotional talking environments. This approach\nemploys speaker emotion cues (text-independent and emotion-dependent speaker\nverification problem) based on both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and\nSuprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) as classifiers. The approach is\ncomprised of two cascaded stages that combines and integrates emotion\nrecognizer and speaker recognizer into one recognizer. The architecture has\nbeen tested on two different and separate emotional speech databases: our\ncollected database and Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts database.

The very precise measurements of the mirrors motion can be\ndetermined, also in the presence of a disturbing noise, by means of the sudden\nreflectivity changes in special points of the mirrors positions. When the\nmirrors cross such positions, the effective opto-mechanical potential that\narises in the device is (roughly) at a maximum. We show that the motion cross\nsuch potential maxima is not only confused by the presence of noise, but also\nfavoured by noise itself that induces hoppings. Thus, the measurements of the\ntimes at which the crossings occur can be exploited to identify the properties\nof the applied signal.

A scalable ANNS algorithm should be both\nmemory-efficient and fast. Some early graph-based approaches have shown\nattractive theoretical guarantees on search time complexity, but they all\nsuffer from the problem of high indexing time complexity. Recently, some\ngraph-based methods have been proposed to reduce indexing complexity by\napproximating the traditional graphs; these methods have achieved revolutionary\nperformance on million-scale datasets. Yet, they still can not scale to\nbillion-node databases. In this paper, to further improve the search-efficiency\nand scalability of graph-based methods, we start by introducing four aspects:\n(1) ensuring the connectivity of the graph; (2) lowering the average out-degree\nof the graph for fast traversal; (3) shortening the search path; and (4)\nreducing the index size. Then, we propose a novel graph structure called\nMonotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (MRNG) which guarantees very low search\ncomplexity (close to logarithmic time). To further lower the indexing\ncomplexity and make it practical for billion-node ANNS problems, we propose a\nnovel graph structure named Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) by\napproximating the MRNG. The NSG takes the four aspects into account\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments show that NSG outperforms all the\nexisting algorithms significantly. In addition, NSG shows superior performance\nin the E-commercial search scenario of Taobao (Alibaba Group) and has been\nintegrated into their search engine at billion-node scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2017 11:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 06:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 08:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 02:57:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 03:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 15:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 06:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 07:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

The free-energy density is minimized with\nrespect to the individual equilibrium densities of all heavy nuclei and the\nnuclear composition. We find that their optimized equilibrium densities become\nsmaller and smaller at high temperatures because of the increase of thermal\ncontributions to bulk free energies and the reduction of surface energies. The\nneutron-rich nuclei become unstable and disappear one after another at some\ntemperatures. The calculations are performed for two sets of model parameters\nleading to different values of the slope parameter in the nuclear symmetry\nenergy.

Specifically, we separate the even components of the tensors,\ninvariant under reflexion with respect to all axes, from the odd ones, which\nidentically vanish in the absence of shear. Our results indicate that the\nlargest deviation from isotropy comes from the odd component of the third\nvelocity gradient correlation function, especially from the third moment of the\nderivative along the normal direction of the streamwise velocity component. At\nthe Reynolds numbers considered (R_lambda ~ 140), we observe that these second\nand third order correlation functions are significantly larger in turbulent\nchannel flows than in homogeneous shear flow.

A simple analysis reveals that a\nprerequisite for the existence of a significant spectral broadening of the\nwaves is that the linear part of the energy (Hamiltonian) has different\ncontributions of opposite signs. It turns out that, at variance with the\nexpected soliton turbulence scenario, an increase of the amount of disorder\n(incoherence) in the system does not require the generation of a coherent\nsoliton structure. We illustrate the idea by considering the propagation of two\nwave components in an optical fiber with opposite dispersion coefficients. A\nwave turbulence approach of the problem reveals that the increase of kinetic\nenergy in one component is offset by the negative reduction in the other\ncomponent, so that the waves exhibit, as a general rule, a virtually unlimited\nspectral broadening. More precisely, a self-similar solution of the kinetic\nequations reveals that the spectra of the incoherent waves tend to relax toward\na homogeneous distribution in the wake of a front that propagates in frequency\nspace with a decelerating velocity.

In any case the\ninflationary sector of the model is of the form $V(\\phi)=V_0 \\left(1+a\n\\cos(\\phi/f)\\right)$ where $0\\leq a<1$ and the end of inflation is triggered by\nan independent waterfall field.
