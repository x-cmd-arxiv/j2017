Direct reconstruction\nmethods such as filtered backprojection, time reversal and least squares suffer\nfrom curved line artefacts and blurring, especially in case of limited angles\nor strong noise. In recent years, there has been great interest in regularised\niterative methods. These methods employ prior knowledge on the image to provide\nhigher quality reconstructions. However, easy comparisons between regularisers\nand their properties are limited, since many tomography implementations heavily\nrely on the specific regulariser chosen. To overcome this bottleneck, we\npresent a modular reconstruction framework for photoacoustic tomography. It\nenables easy comparisons between regularisers with different properties, e.g.\nnonlinear, higher-order or directional. We solve the underlying minimisation\nproblem with an efficient first-order primal-dual algorithm. Convergence rates\nare optimised by choosing an operator dependent preconditioning strategy. Our\nreconstruction methods are tested on challenging 2D synthetic and experimental\ndata sets. They outperform direct reconstruction approaches for strong noise\nlevels and limited angle measurements, offering immediate benefits in terms of\nacquisition time and quality. This work provides a basic platform for the\ninvestigation of future advanced regularisation methods in photoacoustic\ntomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 16:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 13:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

By exploiting the non-Gaussian imprints of\nlensing in the polarization of the CMB, the CORE mission can produce a clean\nmap of the lensing deflections over nearly the full-sky. The number of high-S/N\nmodes in this map will exceed current CMB lensing maps by a factor of 40, and\nthe measurement will be sample-variance limited on all scales where linear\ntheory is valid. Here, we summarise this mission product and discuss the\nscience that it will enable. For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will be\ndetermined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point\ninformation with contemporaneous BAO measurements, three times smaller than the\nminimum total mass allowed by neutrino oscillations. In the search for B-mode\npolarization from primordial gravitational waves with CORE, lens-induced\nB-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the\ngravitational wave power spectrum amplitude. With lensing reconstructed by\nCORE, one can \"delens\" the observed polarization internally, reducing the\nlensing B-mode power by 60%. This improves to 70% by combining lensing and CIB\nmeasurements from CORE, reducing the error on the gravitational wave amplitude\nby 2.5 compared to no delensing (in the null hypothesis).

We wish to clarify the origin of the multiple jet features emanating\nfrom the binary protostar SVS 13A (= VLA4A/VLA4B). Methods. We used the Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer to map at 0.3-0.8\" (~70-190 au) dust emission at 1.4 mm,\nCO(2-1), SiO(5-4), SO(65-54). Revised proper motions for VLA4A/4B and jet\nwiggling models are computed to clarify their respective contribution. Results.\nVLA4A shows compact dust emission suggestive of a disk < 50 au, and is the hot\ncorino source, while CO/SiO/SO counterparts to the small-scale H2 jet originate\nfrom VLA4B and reveal the jet variable velocity structure. This jet exhibits ~\n3\" wiggling consistent with orbital motion around a yet undetected ~ 20-30 au\ncompanion to VLA4B, or jet precession. Jet wiggling combined with velocity\nvariability can explain the large apparent angular momentum in CO bullets. We\nalso uncover a synchronicity between CO jet bullets and knots in the HH7-11\nchain demonstrating that they trace two distinct jets. Their ~ 300 yr twin\noutburst period may be triggered by close perihelion approach of VLA4A in an\neccentric orbit around VLA4B. A third jet is tentatively seen at PA ~ 0\ndegrees. Conclusions. SVS13 A harbors at least 2 and possibly 3 distinct jet\nsources. The CO and HH7-11 jets are launched from quasi-coplanar disks,\nseparated by 20-70 au. Their synchronous major events every 300 yr favor\nexternal triggering by close binary interactions, a scenario also invoked for\nFU Or outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 16:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The sign of $C_\\ell^{\\rm T g}$ is set by the\ntime evolution of the lensing potential in the redshift range of the galaxy\nsample: it is positive if the potential decays (like in $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$),\nnegative if it deepens.

The cubic\nGalileon model predicts a negative $C_\\ell^{\\rm T g}$ and exhibits a\n$7.8\\sigma$ tension with the data, which effectively rules it out.

In this\npaper, we show how two simple techniques can lead to end-to-end (image to\nvelocity) execution of a multi-stage task, which is analogous to a simple\ntidying routine, without having seen a single real image. This involves\nlocating, reaching for, and grasping a cube, then locating a basket and\ndropping the cube inside. To achieve this, robot trajectories are computed in a\nsimulator, to collect a series of control velocities which accomplish the task.\nThen, a CNN is trained to map observed images to velocities, using domain\nrandomisation to enable generalisation to real world images. Results show that\nwe are able to successfully accomplish the task in the real world with the\nability to generalise to novel environments, including those with dynamic\nlighting conditions, distractor objects, and moving objects, including the\nbasket itself.

The large core, high mass deficit and oversized M_def/M_ BH ratio of IC\n1101 suggest that the depleted core was scoured by overmassive SMBH binaries\nwith a final coalesced mass M_BH ~ (4 -10) X 10^10 M_sun, i.e., ~ (1.7- 3.2) X\nsigma_s larger than the black hole masses estimated using the spheroid's\n$\\sigma$, L and M_*. The large core might be partly due to oscillatory core\npassages by a gravitational radiation-recoiled black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 17:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The peak of the resolved radio source coincides with the dynamical\ncenter of NGC404, the center of a rotating disk of molecular gas, and the\nposition of a compact, hard X-ray source. We also present evidence for shocks\nin the NGC404 nucleus from archival narrowband HST imaging, Chandra X-ray data,\nand Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, and discuss possible origins for the\nshock excitation. Given the morphology, location, and steep spectral index of\nthe resolved radio source, as well as constraints on nuclear star formation\nfrom the ALMA CO(2-1) data, we find the most likely scenario for the origin of\nthe radio source in the center of NGC404 to be a radio outflow associated with\na confined jet driven by the active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Recently, adaptive correlation filters have been\nsuccessfully applied to object tracking. However, tracking algorithms relying\non highly adaptive correlation filters are prone to drift due to noisy updates.\nMoreover, as these algorithms do not maintain long-term memory of target\nappearance, they cannot recover from tracking failures caused by heavy\nocclusion or target disappearance in the camera view. In this paper, we propose\nto learn multiple adaptive correlation filters with both long-term and\nshort-term memory of target appearance for robust object tracking. First, we\nlearn a kernelized correlation filter with an aggressive learning rate for\nlocating target objects precisely. We take into account the appropriate size of\nsurrounding context and the feature representations. Second, we learn a\ncorrelation filter over a feature pyramid centered at the estimated target\nposition for predicting scale changes. Third, we learn a complementary\ncorrelation filter with a conservative learning rate to maintain long-term\nmemory of target appearance. We use the output responses of this long-term\nfilter to determine if tracking failure occurs. In the case of tracking\nfailures, we apply an incrementally learned detector to recover the target\nposition in a sliding window fashion.

However, there\nexists the diversity between underlying distribution of color names' RGB values\nand that of image pixels' RGB values, which may lead to inaccuracy when\ndirectly comparing them in Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod named soft Gaussian mapping (SGM) to address this problem. We model the\ndiscrepancies between color names and pixels using a Gaussian and utilize the\ninverse of covariance matrix to bridge the gap between them. Based on SGM, an\nimage could be converted to several soft Gaussian maps. In each soft Gaussian\nmap, we further seek to establish stable and robust descriptors within a local\nregion through a max pooling operation. Then, a robust image representation\nbased on color names is obtained by concatenating the statistical descriptors\nin each stripe. When labeled data are available, one discriminative subspace\nprojection matrix is learned to build efficient representations of an image via\ncross-view coupling learning. Experiments on the public datasets - VIPeR,\nPRID450S and CUHK03, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 18:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Modeling or\nparameterizing these effects is essential in order to extract valuable\nconstraints on cosmological parameters. In a recent paper, Eifler et al. (2015)\nsuggested a reduction technique for baryonic effects by conducting a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and removing the largest baryonic eigenmodes from the\ndata. In this article, we conducted the investigation further and addressed two\ncritical aspects. Firstly, we performed the analysis by separating the\nsimulations into training and test sets, computing a minimal set of principle\ncomponents from the training set and examining the fits on the test set. We\nfound that using only four parameters, corresponding to the four largest\neigenmodes of the training set, the test sets can be fitted thoroughly with an\nRMS $\\sim 0.0011$. Secondly, we explored the significance of outliers, the most\nexotic/extreme baryonic scenarios, in this method. We found that excluding the\noutliers from the training set results in a relatively bad fit and degraded the\nRMS by nearly a factor of 3. Therefore, for a direct employment of this method\nto the tomographic analysis of the weak lensing data, the principle components\nshould be derived from a training set that comprises adequately exotic but\nreasonable models such that the reality is included inside the parameter domain\nsampled by the training set.

At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line of sight, lensing\nmust occur and will be accompanied by periodicity due to the relativistic\nDoppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux of the\nDoppler modulation would be a smoking gun signature of self-lensing and can be\nused to constrain binary parameters.

Because the force acts tangential to the filament, no matter what\nits shape, this \"follower-force\" problem is intrinsically non-variational, and\nthereby differs fundamentally from Euler buckling, where the force has a fixed\ndirection, and which, in the low Reynolds number regime, ultimately leads to a\nstationary, energy-minimizing shape.

At reentry,\nthese fluctuations source gravitational waves (GW) via second order anisotropic\nstresses. These GW, together with those (possibly) sourced during inflation by\nthe same mechanism responsible for the large curvature fluctuations, constitute\na primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB) that unavoidably accompanies the\nPBH formation. We study how the amplitude and the range of frequencies of this\nsignal depend on the statistics (Gaussian versus $\\chi^2$) of the primordial\ncurvature fluctuations, and on the evolution of the PBH mass function due to\naccretion and merging. We then compare this signal with the sensitivity of\npresent and future detectors, at PTA and LISA scales. We find that this SGWB\nwill help to probe, or strongly constrain, the early universe mechanism of PBH\nproduction. The comparison between the peak mass of the PBH distribution and\nthe peak frequency of this SGWB will provide important information on the\nmerging and accretion evolution of the PBH mass distribution from their\nformation to the present era. Different assumptions on the statistics and on\nthe PBH evolution also result in different amounts of CMB $\\mu$-distortions.\nTherefore the above results can be complemented by the detection (or the\nabsence) of $\\mu$-distortions with an experiment such as PIXIE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2017 13:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

We consider recent inspiring proposals:\ninducing ferroelectricity in paraelectric material such as KTaO$_3$ and\ninducing structural deformations in cuprates like La$_2$CuO$_4$ [A. Subedi\net.al, Phys. Rev. B 89,220301 (2014), A.Subedi, Phys. Rev. B 95, 134113\n(2017)]. High-frequency phonon modes are driven by mid-infrared pulses, and\ncoupled to lower-frequency modes those indirect excitation causes structural\ndeformations. Such proposals are in line with a series of recent experiments on\nlight-induced phase transitions. We study in a more detail the case of KTaO$_3$\nwithout strain, where (at first glance) it was not possible to excite the\nneeded low frequency phonon mode by resonant driving of the higher frequency\none. Behaviour of the phonon system is explained using a reduced model of\ncoupled driven nonlinear oscillators. We find a dynamical mechanism which\nprevents effective excitation at resonance driving, and show that for certain\ndetunings of driving frequency from the exact resonance the system response is,\ncounterintuitively, greatly amplified.

In situations where a\nsystem is time varying, one would like to update the system's description\nonline as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing\nDMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data\nbecomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and\ncomputes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that\nplaces less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward\nmanner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A\nvariant of the method may also be applied to online computation of \"windowed\nDMD\", in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method\nis compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the\nstate dimension is less than about~200, the proposed algorithm is the most\nefficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more\nefficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on\nseveral examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex\nexample using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that\nthe method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure\nmeasurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 17:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Methodology\ntakes as an input projected economic development, expressed through a paced\ngrowth of the system loads, as well as uncertainties, expressed through\nmultiple scenarios of the growth. We price new devices according to their\ncapacities. Installation cost contributes to the optimization objective in\ncombination with the cost of operations integrated over time and averaged over\nthe scenarios. The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a\ngradual distribution of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the\ninvestment budget, or equivalently constraint on building capacity, is\nintroduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not only\nnewly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees\nof freedom. This complex optimization problem is stated using the most general\nAC Power Flows. Non-linear, non-convex, multiple-scenario and multi-time-frame\noptimization is resolved via efficient heuristics, consisting of a sequence of\nalternating Linear Programmings or Quadratic Programmings (depending on the\ngeneration cost) and AC-PF solution steps designed to maintain operational\nfeasibility for all scenarios. Computational scalability and application of the\nnewly developed approach is illustrated on the example of the 2736-nodes large\nPolish system.
