Here, we resonantly\nexcite diffusive reorientational motions in water with intense terahertz pulses\nand measure the resulting transient optical birefringence. The observed\nresponse is shown to arise from a particular configuration, namely the\nrestricted trans-lational motion of water molecules whose motions are\npredominantly orthogonal to the dipole moment of the excited neighboring water\nmolecules. Accordingly, we estimate the strength of the anharmonic coupling\nbetween the rotational and the restricted translational degrees of freedom of\nwater.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 16:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

However, new models of\nproto-planetary disk evolution suggest that magnetic fields play an important\nrole in solar system formation. In particular, the magneto-hydrodynamic\nbehavior of proto-planetary disks is believed to be responsible for the net\noutward flow of angular momentum in the solar system. It is important to\nre-evaluate the plausibility of magnetic induction based on the intense\nmagnetic field environments described by the most recent models of\nproto-planetary disk evolution.\n  In order to re-evaluate electromagnetic induction theory the electrical\nconductivity of meteorites must be determined.

The thermal response of each sample,\nwhich depends on electrical conductivity, was monitored until a thermal steady\nstate was achieved. The relationship between conductivity and thermal response\ncan be exploited to estimate the electrical conductivity of unknown samples.\nAfter applying the technique to various metals it was recognized that this\nmethod is not capable of making precise electrical conductivity measurements.\nHowever, this method can constrain the product of the electrical conductivity\nand the square of the magnetic permeability, or ${\\sigma}{{\\mu}^2}$, for\nmeteoritic and metallic samples alike.

Using\nVLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact\ncomponent not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the\nfirst time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr\nold) supernova.

By the time the ejecta have expanded so that\na 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN\nejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion\nmeasures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to\npropagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at\ndistances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc.

In\nparticular, the possibility of forming cooperative groups to coordinate the\nMTDs' requests for the random access channel (RACH) is analyzed. The problem is\nformulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the\nplayers that seek to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function\nthat captures each MTD's energy consumption and time-varying queue length.\nWithin each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends the access\nrequests of the coalition members over the RACH. One key feature of this game\nis its ability to cope with stochastic environments in which the arrival\nrequests of MTDs and the packet success rate over RACH are dynamically\ntime-varying. The proposed stochastic coalitional is composed of multiple\nstages, each of which corresponds to a coalitional game in stochastic\ncharacteristic form that is played by the MTDs at each time step. To solve this\ngame, a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed and shown\nto converge to a stable MTD partition. Simulation results show that, on the\naverage, the proposed stochastic coalition formation algorithm can reduce the\naverage fail ratio and energy consumption of up to 36% and 31% for a\ncluster-based distribution of MTDs, respectively, compared with a\nnoncooperative case. Moreover, when the MTDs are more sensitive to the energy\nconsumption (queue length), the coalitions' size will increase (decrease).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 21:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the\nnumber of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances and traits.\nAlthough their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling\nexponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that\necological scaling laws are linked had been entertained before, but the full\nextent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints\nimposed by finite resource supply and a comprehensive empirical verification\nare still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that\npredicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species'\nabundances and body sizes.

Adopting crystalline materials for thin, reflecting\nmirror coatings, rather than the amorphous coatings used in current-generation\ndetectors, could potentially reduce thermal noise. Understanding and reducing\nthermal noise requires accurate theoretical models, but modeling thermal noise\nanalytically is especially challenging with crystalline materials. Thermal\nnoise models typically rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which\nrelates the power spectral density of the thermal noise to an auxiliary elastic\nproblem. In this paper, we present results from a new, open-source tool that\nnumerically solves the auxiliary elastic problem to compute the Brownian\nthermal noise for both amorphous and crystalline coatings. We employ\nopen-source frameworks to solve the auxiliary elastic problem using a\nfinite-element method, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing that\nenables us to use high resolutions capable of resolving the thin reflective\ncoating. We compare with approximate analytic solutions for amorphous\nmaterials, and we verify that our solutions scale as expected. Finally, we\nmodel the crystalline coating thermal noise in an experiment reported by Cole\nand collaborators (2013), comparing our results to a simpler numerical\ncalculation that treats the coating as an \"effectively amorphous\" material. We\nfind that treating the coating as a cubic crystal instead of as an effectively\namorphous material increases the thermal noise by about 3%. Our results are a\nstep toward better understanding and reducing thermal noise to increase the\nreach of future gravitational-wave detectors.

A lot of work has been done in the area of long\ndistance Wi-Fi networks. However, these networks require tall towers and high\ngain (directional) antennas. Also, they work in the unlicensed band which has\nEffective Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) limit (e.g. 1 W in India) which\nrestricts the network design. In this work, we propose a Long Term\nEvolution-Advanced (LTE-A) network operating in TV UHF to connect the remote\nareas to the optical PoP. In India, around 100 MHz of TV UHF band IV (470-585\nMHz) is unused at any location and can be put to an effective use in these\nareas. We explore the idea of multi-hop topology for the proposed network. We\nalso compare the performance of the multi-hop network with the Point to\nMultipoint (PMP) topology. The results show that multi-hop network performs\nmuch better than the PMP network. We then formulate a Linear Programming (LP)\nproblem of generating optimal topology and compare its performance with the\nmulti-hop network.

The promise is that\nMA-QKD would require less demanding quantum memories than the ones needed for\nprobabilistic quantum repeaters. Nevertheless, early investigations suggest\nthat, in order to beat the conventional no-memory QKD schemes, the quantum\nmemories used in the MA-QKD protocols must have high bandwidth-storage products\nand short interaction times. Among different types of quantum memories,\nensemble-based memories offer some of the required specifications, but they\ntypically suffer from multiple excitation effects. To avoid the latter issue,\nin this paper, we propose two new variants of MA-QKD both relying on\nsingle-photon sources (SPSs) for entangling purposes.

At first glance, the\nexperiment suggests that measurements on one part of an entangled photon pair\n(the idler) can be employed to control whether the measurement outcome of the\nother part of the photon pair (the signal) produces interference fringes at a\nscreen after being sent through a double slit. Significantly, the choice\nwhether there is interference or not can be made long after the signal photon\nencounters the screen. The results of the experiment have been alleged to\ninvoke some sort of 'backwards in time influence'. I argue that this issue can\nbe eliminated by taking into proper account the role of the signal photon.\nLikewise, in the de Broglie-Bohm picture the particle's trajectories can be\ngiven a well-defined description at any instant of time during the experiment.\nThus, it is again clear that there is no need to resort to any kind of\n'backwards in time influence'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 09:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 13:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 08:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 12:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Two procedures for the determination of the heliographic\npositions were applied: an interactive procedure on the KSO sunspot drawings\n(1964 - 2008, solar cycles nos. 20 - 23) and an automatic procedure on the KSO\nwhite light images (2009 - 2016, solar cycle no. 24). For the determination of\nthe synodic angular rotation velocities two different methods have been used: a\ndaily shift (DS) method and a robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) method.\nAfterwards, the rotation velocities had to be converted from synodic to\nsidereal, which were then used in the least-squares fitting for the solar\ndifferential rotation law. For the test data from 2014, we found the rLSQ\nmethod for calculating rotational velocities to be more reliable than the DS\nmethod.

The RWC Japan has\nbeen issuing four-categorical deterministic solar flare forecasts for a long\ntime. In this forecast verification study, we used solar flare forecast data\naccumulated over 16 years (from 2000 to 2015). We compiled the forecast data\ntogether with solar flare data obtained with the Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES). Using the compiled data sets, we estimated\nsome conventional scalar verification measures with 95% confidence intervals.\nWe also estimated a multi-categorical scalar verification measure. These scalar\nverification measures were compared with those obtained by the persistence\nmethod and recurrence method. As solar activity varied during the 16 years, we\nalso applied verification analyses to four subsets of forecast-observation pair\ndata with different solar activity levels. We cannot conclude definitely that\nthere are significant performance difference between the forecasts of RWC Japan\nand the persistence method, although a slightly significant difference is found\nfor some event definitions. We propose to use a scalar verification measure to\nassess the judgment skill of the operational solar flare forecast. Finally, we\npropose a verification strategy for deterministic operational solar flare\nforecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 10:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

This\nis done by considering the Theil index, which is an established statistical\nmeasure used to determine levels of inequality across a system of `agents',\ne.g., income levels across a population. Here, we establish a Theil index for\ngraphs, which provides us with a macroscopic measure of graph centralization.\nConcretely, we show that the von Neumann index can be used to bound the graph's\nTheil index, and thus we provide a direct characterization of graph\ncentralization via the von Neumann index. Because of the algebraic similarities\nbetween the bound and the Theil index, we call the bound the von Neumann Theil\nindex. %From an information theoretic perspective, the von Neumann Theil index\ndescribes the mutual information between the quantum state corresponding to a\ngraph and the maximally mixed state (which corresponds to the complete graph).\nWe elucidate our ideas by providing examples and a discussion of different\n$n=7$ vertex graphs. We also discuss how the von Neumann Theil index provides a\nmore comprehensive measure of centralization when compared to traditional\ncentralization measures, and when compared to the graph's classical Theil\nindex. This is because it more accurately accounts for macro-structural changes\nthat occur from micro-structural changes in the graph (e.g., the removal of a\nvertex). Finally, we provide future direction, showing that the von Neumann\nTheil index can be generalized by considering the R\\'enyi entropy. We then show\nthat this generalization can be used to bound the negative logarithm of the\ngraph's Jain fairness index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 10:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 10:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2018 10:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Specifically, piecewise\nsmooth (PWS) regression considers target functions switching deterministically\nvia a partition of the input space, while switching regression considers\narbitrary switching laws. The paper derives generalization error bounds in\nthese two settings by following the approach based on Rademacher complexities.\nFor PWS regression, our derivation involves a chaining argument and a\ndecomposition of the covering numbers of PWS classes in terms of the ones of\ntheir component functions and the capacity of the classifier partitioning the\ninput space. This yields error bounds with a radical dependency on the number\nof modes. For switching regression, the decomposition can be performed directly\nat the level of the Rademacher complexities, which yields bounds with a linear\ndependency on the number of modes.

This\nhypothesis extends the standard model through the addition of two scalar bosons\nand a hidden sector that can provide a dark matter candidate. This hidden\nsector interacts with the standard model only through the mediation of one of\nthese scalars S. The couplings of S are not amenable to investigation in\ncurrent collider data and so are assumed to be Higgs-like to reduce the\nparameter space of the model. Our previous work (Beck & Colafrancesco 2016) has\nshown that these couplings can be limited via indirect dark matter detection\nexperiments in gamma-rays (for resonant annihilations into S). Here we will\ntreat the dark matter and S masses independently, and we generalise our\nprevious work and examine what fraction of the cosmological dark matter\nabundance can be accounted for by particles in the hidden sector of the Madala\nhypothesis dark matter when these annihilate to standard model products via a\nHiggs-like S.

This\ncoupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,\nespecially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally\nhelical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon\nnumber, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during\ninflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an\nimprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this\npaper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the\napproximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of\nbaryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2)\nexamine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that\nsuccessful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~\n3 x 10^17 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion. The\ngauge field production at the end of inflation is then typically accompanied by\na peak in the GW spectrum at frequencies in the MHz range or above. The\ndetection of such a peak is out of reach of present-day technology; but in the\nfuture, it may serve as a smoking-gun signal for baryogenesis from pseudoscalar\ninflation.

Thereby, its sub-mmag photometric precision and ability to\nidentify false positives are crucial. Particularly, variable background objects\nblended in the photometric aperture frequently mimic Neptune-sized transits and\nare costly in follow-up time. These objects can best be identified with the\ncentroiding technique: if the photometric flux is lost off-centre during an\neclipse, the flux centroid shifts towards the centre of the target star.\nAlthough this method has successfully been employed by the Kepler mission, it\nhas previously not been implemented from the ground. We present a\nfully-automated centroid vetting algorithm developed for NGTS, enabled by our\nhigh-precision auto-guiding. Our method allows detecting centroid shifts with\nan average precision of 0.75 milli-pixel, and down to 0.25 milli-pixel for\nspecific targets, for a pixel size of 4.97 arcsec. The algorithm is now part of\nthe NGTS candidate vetting pipeline and automatically employed for all detected\nsignals. Further, we develop a joint Bayesian fitting model for all photometric\nand centroid data, allowing to disentangle which object (target or background)\nis causing the signal, and what its astrophysical parameters are. We\ndemonstrate our method on two NGTS objects of interest. These achievements make\nNGTS the first ground-based wide-field transit survey ever to successfully\napply the centroiding technique for automated candidate vetting, enabling the\nproduction of a robust candidate list before follow-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 21:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Numerical experiments are conducted in a domain sufficiently\nlarge so as to allow the predicted critical modes to develop in a physically\nrealistic manner. The ratio between gravity, which drives the instability in\nthis case (as well as in several of the corresponding observations), and\nmagnetic field strength is taken up to a ratio which accurately reflects that\nof observed astrophysical plasma, in order to allow comparison between the\nresults of the simulations and the observational data which served as\ninspiration for this work. This study finds reduced non-linear growth of the\nrising bubbles of the RTI for stronger magnetic fields, and that this is\ndirectly due to the change in magnetic field strength, rather than the indirect\neffect of altering characteristic length scales with respect to domain size. By\nexamining the growth of the falling spikes, the growth rate appears to be\nenhanced for the strongest magnetic field strengths, suggesting that rather\nthan affecting the development of the system as a whole, increased magnetic\nfield strengths in fact introduce an asymmetry to the system. Further\ninvestigation of this effect also revealed that the greater this asymmetry, the\nless efficiently the gravitational energy is released. By better understanding\nthe under-studied regime of such a major phenomenon in astrophysics, deeper\nexplanations for observations may be sought, and this work illustrates that the\nstrength of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas influences observed RTI in\nsubtle and complex ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

However, the evolution\nof these interactions as a function of the binding energy, ultimately when\nnuclei become unbound, is poorly known. The $^{26}$F nucleus, composed of a\ndeeply bound $\\pi0d\\_{5/2}$ proton and an unbound $\\nu0d\\_{3/2}$ neutron on top\nof an $^{24}$O core, is particularly adapted for this purpose. The coupling of\nthis proton and neutron results in a $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 - 4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet,\nwhose energies must be determined to study the influence of the proximity of\nthe continuum on the corresponding proton-neutron interaction. The $J^{\\pi} =\n1^{+}\\_1, 2^{+}\\_1,4^{+}\\_1$ bound states have been determined, and only a\nclear identification of the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to\ncomplete the study of the $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 - 4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet in\n$^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ unbound\nstate. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in\n$^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous\nexperiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at\nabout $440A$\\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to\npopulate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout\nreactions on a CH$\\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the\nR$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added\nto the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the\ndetermination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in\n$^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound\nstate in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a\n$p\\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV\nis proposed to be the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ member of the $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 -\n4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been\ncompared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a\nphenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium\nsimilarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective\nproton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\\% in comparison to the\nmodels, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in\ntheoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of\n$^{26}$F.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Although the two methods have successfully revealed a\nnumber of unsettled phase diagrams, their results sometimes contradicted when\nit is difficult to construct an appropriate Hamiltonian that captures the\ncharacteristics of materials, e.g., for a system consisting of multiple-scale\nobjects whose interactions are essential to the system's characteristics.\nMeanwhile, the advantage of our approach over existing methods is that it can\ndirectly and uniquely determine the effective Hamiltonian without any\nthermodynamic information. The validity of our approach is demonstrated through\nan Mg--Zn--Y long-period stacking-ordered structure, which is a challenging\nsystem for existing methods, leading to contradictory results.

In recent years, many evidence combination rules have\nbeen proposed in this framework, such as the conjunctive rule, the cautious\nrule, the PCR (Proportional Conflict Redistribution) rules and so on. These\nrules can be adopted for different types of sources. However, most of these\nrules are not applicable when the number of sources is large. This is due to\neither the complexity or the existence of an absorbing element (such as the\ntotal conflict mass function for the conjunctive-based rules when applied on\nunreliable evidence). In this paper, based on the assumption that the majority\nof sources are reliable, a combination rule for a large number of sources,\nnamed LNS (stands for Large Number of Sources), is proposed on the basis of a\nsimple idea: the more common ideas one source shares with others, the\nmorereliable the source is. This rule is adaptable for aggregating a large\nnumber of sources among which some are unreliable. It will keep the spirit of\nthe conjunctive rule to reinforce the belief on the focal elements with which\nthe sources are in agreement. The mass on the empty set will be kept as an\nindicator of the conflict. Moreover, it can be used to elicit the major opinion\namong the experts.

For small-amplitude internal\nwaves, the projection of energy onto higher wave numbers by geometric focusing\ncan be balanced by viscous dissipation at high wave numbers. Contrary to what\nwas previously suggested, viscous dissipation in interior shear layers may not\nbe sufficient to explain the experiments on wave attractors in the classical\nquasi-2D trapezoidal laboratory set-ups. Applying standard boundary layer\ntheory, we provide an elaborate description of the viscous dissipation in the\ninterior shear layer, as well as at the rigid boundaries. Our analysis shows\nthat even if the thin lateral Stokes boundary layers consist of no more than 1%\nof the wall-to-wall distance, dissipation by lateral walls dominates at\nintermediate wave numbers.

Suszko\nproved that every Tarskian consequence relation can be characterized using only\ntwo truth values. Malinowski showed that this number can equal three if some of\nTarski's structural constraints are relaxed. By so doing, Malinowski introduced\na case of so-called mixed consequence, allowing the notion of a designated\nvalue to vary between the premises and the conclusions of an argument. In this\npaper we give a more systematic perspective on Suszko's problem and on mixed\nconsequence. First, we prove general representation theorems relating\nstructural properties of a consequence relation to their semantic\ninterpretation, uncovering the semantic counterpart of substitution-invariance,\nand establishing that (intersective) mixed consequence is fundamentally the\nsemantic counterpart of the structural property of monotonicity. We use those\nto derive maximum-rank results proved recently in a different setting by French\nand Ripley, as well as by Blasio, Marcos and Wansing, for logics with various\nstructural properties (reflexivity, transitivity, none, or both).

However, although exact in principle, in\npractise approximations must be made for the exchange-correlation functional in\nthis theory, and the standard functional approximations perform poorly for\nexcitations which have a long-range charge-transfer component. Intense progress\nhas been made in developing more sophisticated functionals for this problem,\nwhich we review. We point out an essential difference between the properties of\nthe exchange-correlation kernel needed for an accurate description of\ncharge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between closed-shell\nfragments. We then turn to charge-transfer dynamics, which, in contrast to the\nexcitation problem, is a highly non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, process\ninvolving a transfer of one full electron in space. This turns out to be a much\nmore challenging problem for TDDFT functionals. We describe dynamical step and\npeak features in the exact functional evolving over time, that are missing in\nthe functionals currently used. The latter underestimate the amount of charge\ntransferred and manifest a spurious shift in the charge transfer resonance\nposition.

In the Philippines, commercial loads have unused backup generation\nof up to 3000 MW, at the same time there are shortages of as much as 700 MW\nduring peak demand. This gives utilities the incentive to implement Demand\nResponse programs to minimize this shortage. But when considering Demand\nResponse from a modeling perspective, social welfare through profit is always\nthe major objective for program implementation. That isn't always the case\nduring an emergency situation as there can be a trade-off between grid\nresilience and cost of electricity.\n  The question is how the Distribution Utility (DU) shall optimally allocate\nthe unused generation to meet the shortage when this trade-off exists. We\nformulate a combined multi-objective optimal dispatch model where we can make a\ndirect comparison between the least-cost and resilience objectives.\n  We find that this trade-off is due to the monotonically increasing nature of\nenergy cost functions. If the supply is larger than the demand, the DU can\nperform a least-cost approach in the optimal dispatch since maximizing the\nenergy generated in this case can lead to multiple solutions.

Based on this interpretation of quantum theory the\nexistence of free objects in space, their symmetry properties and their\ninteractions shall be inferred. The alternatives are represented by binary\nalternatives, which are called Ur-alternatives because of their logically\nfundamental character. Through Ur-alternatives as elementary quantum\ntheoretical units of information the Copernican revolution with respect to the\nquestion of space is realized in a consequent way. This means that not the\nobjects of nature are in a given space, but the existence of space arises as a\nkind of indirect representation of relations between abstract quantum\ntheoretical objects. The Ur-alternatives do not exist in a given physical\nreality, but the existence of space is constituted by Ur-alternatives at all.\nSuch a concept of reality is implicitly contained within the uncertainty\nrelation and can be seen especially in the EPR-paradoxon. It is shown in this\nthesis in a mathematical consistent way that a state in the tensor space of\nmany Ur-alternatives can directly be mapped into a real three dimensional space\nwhich means that together with the dynamics a representation in a\n(3+1)-dimensional space-time becomes possible.

This causes\nnot only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to\npower line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.\nSince existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to\nradiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate\nnetwork simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted\nand radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to\ncommon mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this\nwork allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission\nmatrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of\ntransmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The\nresults of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of\ncomprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 08:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}
