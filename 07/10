Three complementary descriptions are considered, their\ndomain of applicability discussed and their predictions on average properties\nof an electron population compared. The first description relies on the\nradiation reaction force in the Landau and Lifschitz (LL) form. The second\nrelies on the linear Boltzmann equation for the electron and photon\ndistribution functions.

Trained on almost one million tweets, several models were\ntested in both same domain and cross-domain corpora.

The narrow iron\nK$\\alpha$ line at 6.4 keV is thought to be produced by the X-ray reflection\nfrom the torus. Thus, the velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of it is able\nto constrain the kinematics of the torus. Such effort is limited by the\nspectral resolution of current CCD detectors and should be possible with the\nmicrocalorimeter on the next generation X-ray satellite. In this paper, we\nfirst construct the response functions of the torus under a uniform inflow, a\nKeplerian rotation, and a uniform outflow.

Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and\nslightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. This search uses\nthe data from Advanced LIGO's first observational run, O1. No periodic\ngravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were placed on their\nstrengths. The lowest upper limits on worst-case (linearly polarized) strain\namplitude h0 are 4e-25 near 170 Hz. For a circularly polarized source (most\nfavorable orientation), the smallest upper limits obtained are 1.5e-25. These\nupper limits refer to all sky locations and the entire range of frequency\nderivative values. For a population-averaged ensemble of sky locations and\nstellar orientations, the lowest upper limits obtained for the strain amplitude\nare 2.5e-25.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 01:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 06:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

We\nshow that the truncated two-point function in this model decays exponentially\nwith a rate independent of $a$. As a consequence, we show exponential decay in\nthe near-critical scaling limit Euclidean magnetization field. For the lattice\nmodel with $a=1$, the mass (inverse correlation length) is of order $h^{8/15}$\nas $h\\downarrow 0$; for the Euclidean field, it equals exactly $Ch^{8/15}$ for\nsome $C$. Although there has been much progress in the study of critical\nscaling limits, results on near-critical models are far fewer due to the lack\nof conformal invariance away from the critical point. Our arguments combine\nlattice and continuum FK representations, including coupled conformal loop and\nmeasure ensembles, showing that such ensembles can be useful even in the study\nof near-critical scaling limits. Thus we provide the first substantial\napplication of measure ensembles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 01:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 04:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 11:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

The simplest method for PCA, the power iteration, requires\n$\\mathcal O(1/\\Delta)$ full-data passes to recover the principal component of a\nmatrix with eigen-gap $\\Delta$. Lanczos, a significantly more complex method,\nachieves an accelerated rate of $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ passes. Modern\napplications, however, motivate methods that only ingest a subset of available\ndata, known as the stochastic setting. In the online stochastic setting, simple\nalgorithms like Oja's iteration achieve the optimal sample complexity $\\mathcal\nO(\\sigma^2/\\Delta^2)$. Unfortunately, they are fully sequential, and also\nrequire $\\mathcal O(\\sigma^2/\\Delta^2)$ iterations, far from the $\\mathcal\nO(1/\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ rate of Lanczos. We propose a simple variant of the power\niteration with an added momentum term, that achieves both the optimal sample\nand iteration complexity. In the full-pass setting, standard analysis shows\nthat momentum achieves the accelerated rate, $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. We\ndemonstrate empirically that naively applying momentum to a stochastic method,\ndoes not result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis\nthat reveals the \"breaking-point variance\" beyond which this acceleration does\nnot occur. By combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques,\nwe construct stochastic PCA algorithms, for the online and offline setting,\nthat achieve an accelerated iteration complexity $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nDue to the embarassingly parallel nature of our methods, this acceleration\ntranslates directly to wall-clock time if deployed in a parallel environment.\nOur approach is very general, and applies to many non-convex optimization\nproblems that can now be accelerated using the same technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 01:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

At high temperature region, the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ is shown to decrease with increasing $q$ from the\nphase diagram in the $(T,~\\mu)$ plane. However, larger values of $q$ causes the\nrise of $T_c$ at low temperature but high chemical potential. Moreover, it is\nfound that $\\mu$ different from zero corresponds to a first-order phase\ntransition while $\\mu=0$ to a crossover one. The critical endpoint (CEP)\ncarries higher chemical potential but lower temperature with $q$ increasing due\nto the non-extensive effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 08:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 09:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

Pricing a leasing contract\nis complicated because the leasing rate embodies an expectation of the residual\nvalue of the car after contract expiration. To aid lessors in their pricing\ndecisions, the paper develops resale price forecasting models. A peculiarity of\nthe leasing business is that forecast errors entail different costs.\nIdentifying effective ways to address this characteristic is the main objective\nof the paper. More specifically, the paper contributes to the literature\nthrough i) consolidating and integrating previous work in forecasting with\nasymmetric cost of error functions, ii) systematically evaluating previous\napproaches and comparing them to a new approach, and iii) demonstrating that\nforecasting with asymmetric cost of error functions enhances the quality of\ndecision support in car leasing. For example, under the assumption that the\ncosts of overestimating resale prices is twice that of the opposite error,\nincorporating corresponding cost asymmetry into forecast model development\nreduces decision costs by about eight percent, compared to a standard\nforecasting model. Higher asymmetry produces even larger improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 08:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

The problem is APX-Hard and can be\n2-approximated by, e.g., the elegant primal-dual algorithm of Agrawal, Klein,\nand Ravi from 1995.\n  We give a local-search-based constant-factor approximation for the problem.\nLocal search brings in new techniques to an area that has for long not seen any\nimprovements and might be a step towards a combinatorial algorithm for the more\ngeneral survivable network design problem. Moreover, local search was an\nessential tool to tackle the dynamic MST/Steiner Tree problem, whereas dynamic\nSteiner Forest is still wide open.\n  It is easy to see that any constant factor local search algorithm requires\nsteps that add/drop many edges together. We propose natural local moves which,\nat each step, either (a) add a shortest path in the current graph and then drop\na bunch of inessential edges, or (b) add a set of edges to the current\nsolution. This second type of moves is motivated by the potential function we\nuse to measure progress, combining the cost of the solution with a penalty for\neach connected component. Our carefully-chosen local moves and potential\nfunction work in tandem to eliminate bad local minima that arise when using\nmore traditional local moves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 08:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

Compared to the isostructural neodymium compound, significant\ndifferences of magnetism and magnetoelectric effects are seen. We present the\nresults of thorough investigations of temperature and magnetic field dependent\nmagnetization as well as ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. These bulk\nmeasurements are complemented by local-probe spectroscopy utilizing\nelectron-spin resonance and muon-spin rotation/relaxation for probing the\nchromium moments. Ferroelectric order is inferred from pyro- and magnetocurrent\nmeasurements. GdCrTiO5 shows a pyrocurrent signal around 10 K, only if the\nsystem is cooled in an applied magnetic field exceeding 10 kOe. A distinct\nspin-driven ferroelectric order is revealed in this state for temperatures\nbelow 10 K, which can be switched by changing magnetic-field direction and the\npolarity of the electric field. But, the magnetic measurements reveal no clear\nsignature of long-range magnetic ordering. The presence of such\nmeta-magnetoelectric-type behaviour in the absence of any meta-magnetic\nbehavior is rare in the literature. Our microscopic spectroscopy results\nindicate significant changes of the magnetic properties around 10 K. Probably\nthere is an exchange frustration between Gd and Cr moments, which prevents\nlong-range magnetic ordering at further high temperature. Below 10 K, weak\nmagnetic ordering occurs by minimizing frustration due to lattice distortion,\nwhich helps in magnetodielectric coupling. However, the non-polar distortion\nattains appreciable values after application of magnetic fields above 10 kOe to\nbreak the spatial inversion symmetry, which creates ferroelectricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 09:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 12:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 13:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 14:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

A\nmotivating example is the data-summarization problem in machine learning where\none is given a collection of vectors that represent data such as documents or\nimages. The volume of a set of vectors is used as a measure of their diversity,\nand partition or matroid constraints over $[m]$ are imposed in order to ensure\nresource or fairness constraints. Recently, Nikolov and Singh presented a\nconvex program and showed how it can be used to estimate the value of the most\ndiverse set when ${\\cal B}$ corresponds to a partition matroid.

The question of whether these estimation algorithms can\nbe converted into the more useful approximation algorithms -- that also output\na set -- remained open.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to give the first approximation\nalgorithms for both partition and regular matroids. We present novel\nformulations for the subdeterminant maximization problem for these matroids;\nthis reduces them to the problem of finding a point that maximizes the absolute\nvalue of a nonconvex function over a Cartesian product of probability\nsimplices. The technical core of our results is a new anti-concentration\ninequality for dependent random variables that allows us to relate the optimal\nvalue of these nonconvex functions to their value at a random point.

The parametrically driven cold atoms show the\nideal mean-field symmetry-breaking transition, and the symmetry is broken with\nrespect to time translation by the modulation period. Such a phase transition\nresults from the cooperation and competition between the inter-particle\ninteraction and the fluctuations, which lead to the nonlinear switching of\natoms between the vibrational states, and the experimentally measured critical\ncharacteristics prove it as the ideal mean-field transition class. On the other\nhand, the resonantly driven cold atoms that possess the coexisting periodic\nattractors exhibit the kinetic phase transition analogous to the discontinuous\ngas-liquid phase transition in equilibrium, and interestingly the global\ninteraction between atoms causes the shift of the phase-transition boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 10:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The backreaction\nanalysis revealed that the impact of the dark vortex presence is far more\ncomplicated than causing only a deficit angle. The vortex causes an ergosphere\nshift and the event horizon velocity is also influenced by its presence. These\nphenomena are more significant than in the case of a visible vortex sector. The\narea of the event horizon of a black hole is diminished and this decline is\nlarger in comparison to the Kerr black hole with an Abelian Higgs vortex case.\nAfter analyzing the gravitational properties for the general setup, we focused\non the subset of models that are motivated by particle physics.

However,\nwe also derive asymptotics and demonstrate that the leading order asymptotics\ncan be specified.\n  It is sometimes argued that if the factors multiplying the spatial\nderivatives decay exponentially (for a system of wave equations), then the\nspatial derivatives can be ignored.

Moreover, we replace the evolution (over one period) with a matrix\nmultiplication. We cannot calculate the matrices, but we approximate them. To\nobtain the asymptotics we need to calculate a matrix product where there is no\nbound on the number of factors, and where each factor can only be approximated.\nNevertheless, we obtain detailed asymptotics.

This depression is much greater than that\nexpected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in\nparticular the dominant effect of overionisation. Here we attempt to reproduce\nthe apparent Fe discrepancy, and investigate differences in reported sodium\nabundances. We compare in detail the methods and results of the recent study\nwith those of an earlier study of NGC 6752 AGB stars. Iron and sodium\nabundances are derived using Fe I, Fe II, and Na I lines. Various uncertainties\nare explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,\nusing different observational data and computational tools. Further\ninvestigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly\ndependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise\nuncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using\nthe infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ scales used by\nboth the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated\ntemperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression. Our IRFM temperatures result\nin negligible apparent depression, consistent with theory.

[Na/H] in the AGB stars is consistent between all studies.\nSince Fe is constant, it follows that [Na/Fe] is also consistent between\nstudies, apart from any systematic offsets in Fe.

From\nobservations, some of the key properties of molecular clouds are well known but\nmany questions regarding their evolution and star formation activity remain\nopen. While numerical simulations feature a large number and complexity of\ninvolved physical processes, this plenty of effects may hide the fundamentals\nthat determine the evolution of molecular clouds and enable the formation of\nstars. Purely analytical models, on the other hand, tend to suffer from rough\napproximations or a lack of completeness, limiting their predictive power. In\nthis paper, we present a model that incorporates central concepts of\nastrophysics as well as reliable results from recent simulations of molecular\nclouds and their evolutionary paths. Based on that, we construct a\nself-consistent semi-analytical framework that describes the formation,\nevolution and star formation activity of molecular clouds, including a number\nof feedback effects to account for the complex processes inside those objects.\nThe final equation system is solved numerically but at much lower computational\nexpense than, e.g., hydrodynamical descriptions of comparable systems. The\nmodel presented in this paper agrees well with a broad range of observational\nresults, showing that molecular cloud evolution can be understood as an\ninterplay between accretion, global collapse, star formation and stellar\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 14:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

To\nbegin with the effect of magnetic field on the thermodynamics, we have first\ncalculated the pressure of a thermal QCD medium in strong magnetic field limit\n(SML), where the pressure at fixed temperature increases with the magnetic\nfield faster than the increase with the temperature at constant magnetic field.\nThis can be envisaged from the dominant scale of thermal medium in SML, which\nis the magnetic field, like the temperature in thermal medium in absence of\nstrong magnetic field. Thus although the presence of strong magnetic field\nmakes the pressure of hot QCD medium harder but the increase of pressure with\nrespect to the temperature becomes less steeper. Corroborated to the above\nobservations, the entropy density is found to decrease with the temperature in\nthe ambience of strong magnetic field which resonates with the fact that the\nstrong magnetic field restricts the dynamics of quarks in two dimensions, hence\nthe phase space gets squeezed resulting the reduction of number of microstates.\nMoreover the energy density is seen to decrease and the speed of sound of\nthermal QCD medium is increased in the presence of strong magnetic field.

We\nargue that the large extensions occur because the elastic contribution to the\nfree energy is dominated by the anchoring. We demonstrate that the elongation\ninvolves hydrodynamic flow and is reversible, the tactoids return to their\noriginal shapes upon removing the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 15:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We first look at the\nequivalence of two approaches --- action and order-by-order gravity equation\napproach --- for cosmological perturbation theory, and establish that both lead\nto equivalent results for any gravity models at any order of perturbations. We\nthen focus on Hamiltonian formalism that has not been studied extensively in\nthe literature. We provide a generalized Hamiltonian approach for cosmological\nperturbations which is equivalent to the Lagrangian approach. We show that, the\napproach can be applied to any model at any order of perturbations. Using this\napproach, we show that evaluating interaction Hamiltonian is simpler and\nefficient than earlier approach. In the next work, we concentrate on\ngeneralized non-canonical scalar field and by introducing a new variable\nprovide a technique to write Hamiltonian for generalized non-canonical scalar\nfield. We then implement our Hamiltonian approach for non-canonical scalar\nfield and evaluate interaction Hamiltonian without slow-roll approximations.\nFinally, for the first time, we construct a vector Galileon model in curved\nspace-time in which, the field equations do not contain any higher-derivative\nterms, yet, preserving U(1) gauge-invariance.

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication has the potential of preventing up to 35% of such serious road\ncollisions. In fact, under the 5G/LTE Rel.15+ standardization, V2V is a\ncritical use-case not only for the purpose of enhancing road safety, but also\nfor enabling traffic efficiency in modern smart cities. Under this anticipated\n5G definition, high reliability of 0.99999 is expected for semi-autonomous\nvehicles (i.e., driver-in-the-loop). As a consequence, there is a need to\nassess the reliability, especially for accident-prone areas, such as\nintersections. We unpack traditional average V2V reliability in order to\nquantify its related fine-grained V2V reliability. Contrary to existing work on\ninfinitely large roads, when we consider finite road segments of significance\nto practical real-world deployment, fine-grained reliability exhibits bimodal\nbehavior. Performance for a certain vehicular traffic scenario is either very\nreliable or extremely unreliable, but nowhere in relative proximity to the\naverage performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 13:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

Crime\noccurrences depend on many complex factors. Compared to many predictable\nevents, crime is sparse. At different spatio-temporal scales, crime\ndistributions display dramatically different patterns. These distributions are\nof very low regularity in both space and time. In this work, we adapt the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning spatio-temporal predictor, ST-ResNet [Zhang et\nal, AAAI, 2017], to collectively predict crime distribution over the Los\nAngeles area. Our models are two staged. First, we preprocess the raw crime\ndata. This includes regularization in both space and time to enhance\npredictable signals.
