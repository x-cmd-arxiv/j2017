As\nit turns out, definitional interpreters, especially those written in monadic\nstyle, can provide a nice basis for a wide variety of collecting semantics,\nabstract interpretations, symbolic executions, and their intermixings.\n  But the real insight of this story is a replaying of an insight from\nReynold's landmark paper, Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order\nProgramming Languages, in which he observes definitional interpreters enable\nthe defined-language to inherit properties of the defining-language. We show\nthe same holds true for definitional abstract interpreters. Remarkably, we\nobserve that abstract definitional interpreters can inherit the so-called\n\"pushdown control flow\" property, wherein function calls and returns are\nprecisely matched in the abstract semantics, simply by virtue of the function\ncall mechanism of the defining-language.\n  The first approaches to achieve this property for higher-order languages\nappeared within the last ten years, and have since been the subject of many\npapers. These approaches start from a state-machine semantics and uniformly\ninvolve significant technical engineering to recover the precision of pushdown\ncontrol flow. In contrast, starting from a definitional interpreter, the\npushdown control flow property is inherent in the meta-language and requires no\nfurther technical mechanism to achieve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 16:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

This is useful e.g. to test scale dependence of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. Unfortunately, the primordial $y$-T signal is strongly\ncontaminated by the late-time correlation between the Integrated Sachs Wolfe\nand Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects. Moreover, SZ itself generates a large\nnoise contribution in the $y$-parameter map. We consider two original ways to\naddress these issues. In order to remove the bias due to the SZ-CMB temperature\ncoupling, while also adding new signal, we include in the analysis the\ncross-correlation between $y$-distortions and CMB {\\em polarization}. In order\nto reduce the noise, we propose to clean the $y$-map by subtracting a SZ\ntemplate, reconstructed via cross-correlation with external tracers (CMB and\ngalaxy-lensing signals).

At small scales the attractant molecules move by\nBrownian motion and diffusive processes dominate. This example is the archetype\nof diffusive signaling problems where an agent moves via a random walk until it\neither strikes or eludes a target. Berg & Purcell modeled the target as a\nsphere with a set of small circular targets (pores) that can capture a\ndiffusing agent. They argued that, in the limit of small radii and wide\nspacing, each pore could be modeled independently as a circular pore on an\ninfinite plane. Using a known exact solution, they showed the capture rate to\nbe proportional to the combined perimeter of the pores. In this paper we study\nhow to improve this approximation by including inter-pore competition effects\nand verify this result numerically for a finite collection of pores on a plane\nor sphere. Asymptotically we have found the corrections to the Berg-Purcell\nformula that account for enhancement of capture due to the curvature of the\nspherical target and inhibition of capture due to spatial interactions of the\npores. Numerically we develop a spectral boundary element method for the\nexterior mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary value problem. Our formulation\nreduces the problem to a linear integral equation, specifically a Neumann to\nDirichlet map, which is supported only on the individual pores. The difficulty\nis that both the kernel and the flux are singular, a notorious obstacle in such\nproblems. A judicious choice of singular boundary elements allows us to resolve\nthe flux singularity at the edge of the pore. In biological systems there can\nbe thousands of receptors whose radii are 0.1% the cell radius. Our numerics\nresolve this realistic limit with an accuracy of roughly one part in 10^8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 19:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

In some systems, such as $n$-alkanes, this enhancement\nis dramatic, and results in the formation of a crystalline layer at the free\ninterface even at temperatures slightly above the equilibrium bulk freezing\ntemperature. There are, however, systems in which the enhancement is purely\nkinetic, and only involves faster nucleation at or near the interface. The\nfirst, thermodynamic, type of surface freezing is easier to confirm in\nexperiments, requiring only the verification of the existence of crystalline\norder at the interface. The second, kinetic, type of surface freezing is far\nmore difficult to prove experimentally. One material that is suspected of\nundergoing the second type of surface freezing is liquid water. Despite strong\nindications that the freezing of liquid water is kinetically enhanced at\nvapor-liquid interfaces, the findings are far from conclusive, and the topic\nremains controversial.

There would be many axions stars condensing\nas dark matter in an early stage galaxy so that such collisions arises\nrepeatedly. The radiations are emitted by coherent oscillations of electrons in\nthe accretion disk.

The theoretical framework employed is an effective field\ntheory anchored on a scale-invariant hidden local symmetric Lagrangian\nconstructed along the line of Weinberg's \"Folk Theorem\" on effective field\ntheory. The problems addressed are the high-precision calculations on the\nthermal $np$ capture, the solar $pp$ fusion process, the solar $hep$ process --\nJohn Bahcall's challenge to nuclear theorists -- and the quenching of $g_A$ in\ngiant Gamow-Teller resonances and the whopping enhancement of first-forbidden\nbeta transitions in astrophysical processes.

Since in the real world any network is\nprone to failures, it is natural to study the fault tolerant version of the\nabove problem. Unfortunately, it turns out that there may not always exist such\na sparse subgraph even under single edge failure [Demetrescu \\emph{et al.}\n'08]. However in real applications it is not always the case that a link (edge)\nin a network becomes completely faulty. Instead, it can happen that some links\nbecome more congested which can easily be captured by increasing weight on the\ncorresponding edges. Thus it makes sense to try to construct a sparse distance\npreserving subgraph under the above weight increment model. To the best of our\nknowledge this problem has not been studied so far. In this paper we show that\ngiven any weighted directed graph with $n$ vertices and a source vertex, one\ncan construct a subgraph that contains at most $e \\cdot (k-1)!2^kn$ many edges\nsuch that it preserves distances between the source and all other vertices as\nlong as the total weight increment is bounded by $k$ and we are allowed to have\nonly integer valued (can be negative) weight on each edge and also weight of an\nedge can only be increased by some positive integer. Next we show a lower bound\nof $c\\cdot 2^kn$, for some constant $c \\ge 5/4$, on the size of the subgraph.\nWe also argue that restriction of integer valued weight and integer valued\nweight increment are actually essential by showing that if we remove any one of\nthese two restrictions we may need to store $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges to preserve\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 11:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

With recent breakthroughs in Cellular electron\ncryo tomography (CECT) 3D imaging technology, it is now possible for\nresearchers to gain accesses to fully study and understand the macromolecular\nstructures single cells. However, systematic recovery of macromolecular\nstructures from CECT is very difficult due to high degree of structural\ncomplexity and practical imaging limitations. Specifically, we proposed a deep\nlearning based image classification approach for large-scale systematic\nmacromolecular structure separation from CECT data. However, our previous work\nwas only a very initial step towards exploration of the full potential of deep\nlearning based macromolecule separation. In this paper, we focus on improving\nclassification performance by proposing three newly designed individual CNN\nmodels: an extended version of (Deep Small Receptive Field) DSRF3D, donated as\nDSRF3D-v2, a 3D residual block based neural network, named as RB3D and a\nconvolutional 3D(C3D) based model, CB3D. We compare them with our previously\ndeveloped model (DSRF3D) on 12 datasets with different SNRs and tilt angle\nranges. The experiments show that our new models achieved significantly higher\nclassification accuracies. The accuracies are not only higher than 0.9 on\nnormal datasets, but also demonstrate potentials to operate on datasets with\nhigh levels of noises and missing wedge effects presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 14:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

We also discuss a new baryogenesis scenario, in which\nthe asymmetry is generated without introducing neither loop corrections nor\nrotation of a field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 04:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 05:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 15:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

To\navoid the bias of anecdotal tests towards a particular algorithm, the proposed\nprotocols are Monte Carlo sampling based, generating an ensemble of activity\npatches in each brain region identified in a given atlas. The sensitivity is\nmeasured by how much, on average, the reconstructed activity is concentrated in\nthe brain region of the simulated active patch. The specificity analysis is\nbased on Bayes factors, interpreting the estimated current activity as data for\ntesting the hypothesis that the active brain region is correctly identified,\nvs. the hypothesis of any erroneous attribution.

The strength of presence of each possible state\nin the superposition, i.e., its probability of being observed, is represented\nby its probability amplitude coefficient. The assumption that these\ncoefficients must be represented physically disjointly from each other, i.e.,\nlocalistically, is nearly universal in the quantum theory/computing literature.\nAlternatively, these coefficients can be represented using sparse distributed\nrepresentations (SDR), wherein each coefficient is represented by small subset\nof an overall population of units, and the subsets can overlap. Specifically, I\nconsider an SDR model in which the overall population consists of Q WTA\nclusters, each with K binary units. Each coefficient is represented by a set of\nQ units, one per cluster. Thus, K^Q coefficients can be represented with KQ\nunits. Thus, the particular world state, X, whose coefficient's representation,\nR(X), is the set of Q units active at time t has the max probability and the\nprobability of every other state, Y_i, at time t, is measured by R(Y_i)'s\nintersection with R(X). Thus, R(X) simultaneously represents both the\nparticular state, X, and the probability distribution over all states. Thus,\nset intersection may be used to classically implement quantum superposition. If\nalgorithms exist for which the time it takes to store (learn) new\nrepresentations and to find the closest-matching stored representation\n(probabilistic inference) remains constant as additional representations are\nstored, this meets the criterion of quantum computing. Such an algorithm has\nalready been described: it achieves this \"quantum speed-up\" without esoteric\nhardware, and in fact, on a single-processor, classical (Von Neumann) computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 17:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}
