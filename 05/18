We\nconsider an intrinsic principal component analysis for smooth Riemannian\nmanifold-valued functional data and study its asymptotic properties. Riemannian\nfunctional principal component analysis (RFPCA) is carried out by first mapping\nthe manifold-valued data through Riemannian logarithm maps to tangent spaces\naround the time-varying Fr\\'echet mean function, and then performing a\nclassical multivariate functional principal component analysis on the linear\ntangent spaces. Representations of the Riemannian manifold-valued functions and\nthe eigenfunctions on the original manifold are then obtained with exponential\nmaps. The tangent-space approximation through functional principal component\nanalysis is shown to be well-behaved in terms of controlling the residual\nvariation if the Riemannian manifold has nonnegative curvature. Specifically,\nwe derive a central limit theorem for the mean function, as well as root-$n$\nuniform convergence rates for other model components, including the covariance\nfunction, eigenfunctions, and functional principal component scores. Our\napplications include a novel framework for the analysis of longitudinal\ncompositional data, achieved by mapping longitudinal compositional data to\ntrajectories on the sphere, illustrated with longitudinal fruit fly behavior\npatterns. RFPCA is shown to be superior in terms of trajectory recovery in\ncomparison to an unrestricted functional principal component analysis in\napplications and simulations and is also found to produce principal component\nscores that are better predictors for classification compared to traditional\nfunctional functional principal component scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 16:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 04:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The origin\nof this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and\noptical depth effects suggested in the literature. In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values. Grain growth and settling concur in\nthermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate\nwith large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at\nintermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for\nlow turbulence values. Also, due to disk mid-plane shadowing, a second CO\nthermal desorption (rather than photodesorption) front can occur in the warmer\nouter mid-plane disk. The models are compared to ALMA observations of HD 163296\nas a test case. In order to reproduce the observed CO snowline of the system, a\nbinding energy for CO typical of ice mixtures needs to be used rather than the\nlower pure CO value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 16:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 14:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The detailed physics of the binary and disk\nformation are still poorly constrained. Methods: Using the VLA in its most\nextended configuration at ~24GHz toward the prototypical high-mass star-forming\nregion NGC7538IRS1 has allowed us to study the NH3 and thermal CH3OH emission\nand absorption as well as the cm continuum emission at an unprecedented spatial\nresolution of 0.06\"x0.05\", corresponding to a linear resolution of ~150AU at a\ndistance of 2.7kpc. Results: A comparison of these new cm continuum data with\nprevious VLA observations from 23yrs ago reveals no recognizable proper\nmotions. If the emission were caused by a protostellar jet, proper motion\nsignatures should have been easily identified. In combination with the high\nspectral indices S~nu^{alpha} (alpha between 1 and 2), this allows us to\nconclude that the continuum emission is from two hypercompact HII regions\nseparated in projection by about 430AU. The NH3 spectral line data reveal a\ncommon rotating envelope indicating a bound high-mass binary system. In\naddition to this, the thermal CH3OH data show two separate velocity gradients\nacross the two hypercompact HII regions. This indicates two disk-like\nstructures within the same rotating circumbinary envelope. Disk and envelope\nstructures are inclined by ~33deg, which can be explained by initially varying\nangular momentum distributions within the natal, turbulent cloud. Conclusions:\nStudying high-mass star formation at sub-0.1\" resolution allows us to isolate\nmultiple sources as well as to separate circumbinary from disk-like rotating\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 16:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Localization patterns with both single and multiple localization\nsites (multibreathers) are considered. The model is scalar, i.e. each particle\ncan move only parallel to the axis of the chain it belongs to. The model\ninvolves symmetric parabolic on-site potential with rigid constraints (the\ndisplacement domain of each particle is finite) and a linear nearest-neighbor\ncoupling in the chain, and also between the neighbors in adjacent chains. When\nthe particle approaches the constraint, it undergoes an elastic Newtonian\nimpact. The rigid impact constraints are the only source of nonlinearity in the\nsystem. The model allows easy computation of highly accurate approximate\nsolutions for the breathers and multibreathers with an arbitrary set of\nlocalization sites in conservative setting. The vibro-impact nonlinearity\npermits explicit derivation of a monodromy matrix for the breather and\nmulti-breather solutions. Consequently, the stability of the derived breather\nand multibreather solutions can be studied in the framework of simple methods\nof linear algebra, without additional approximations. It is shown that due to\nthe coupling of the chains, the breather solutions can undergo the symmetry\nbreaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 16:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

These results have been attributed to a slingshot mechanism\nresulting from the oscillation of the filament (Stutz & Gould 2016). In this\npaper, we show that radially contracting filaments naturally evolve toward a\nstate where gravitational, magnetic, and rotational energy are comparable.\nWhile the contraction of the filament will preferentially amplify the axial\ncomponent of the magnetic field, the presence of rotation leads to a helical\nfield structure. We show how magnetic tension can give rise to a filament\noscillation, and estimate a typical timescale of 0.7 million years for the\nmotion of the filament to the position of maximum displacement, consistent with\nthe characteristic timescale of the ejected stars. Furthermore, the presence of\nhelical magnetic fields is expected to give rise to magneto-hydrodynamical\ninstabilities.

It appears that explicit breaking is\nnot the sole possibility, and like QCD, gravity may break global symmetries\ndynamically. As an useful byproduct, matching of gravitational anomalies\nprovides a selection tool for compositeness, eliminating possibility of\nmassless composite fermions where standard gauge anomaly matching would allow\nfor their existence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 19:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

These theories are interesting because they\nhave the potential to simultaneously suppress modifications to Einstein's\ntheory on Solar System scales, while introducing large deviations in the strong\nfield of neutron stars. Scalar-tensor theories can be classified through the\nchoice of conformal factor, a scalar that regulates the coupling between matter\nand the metric in the Einstein frame. The class defined by a Gaussian conformal\nfactor with negative exponent has been studied the most because it leads to\nspontaneous scalarization (i.e. the sudden activation of the scalar field in\nneutron stars), which consequently leads to large deviations from General\nRelativity in the strong field. This class, however, has recently been shown to\nbe in conflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the\ncosmological evolution of the scalar field. We study whether this remains the\ncase when the exponent of the conformal factor is positive, as well as in\nanother class of theories defined by a hyperbolic conformal factor. We find\nthat in both of these scalar-tensor theories, Solar System tests are passed\nonly in a very small subset of parameter space, for a large set of initial\nconditions compatible with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, while we find\nthat it is possible for neutron stars to scalarize, one must carefully select\nthe coupling parameter to do so, and even then, the scalar charge is typically\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than in the negative exponent case. Our study\nsuggests that future work on scalar-tensor gravity, for example in the context\nof tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves from neutron star\nbinaries, should be carried out within the positive coupling parameter class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 21:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

In common with other membrane\nprotein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers\nand protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules.\nWe study here in detail a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold\nreaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to\ncapture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and\ncharacteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that\nour stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field\nmodels of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of\nanalytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction\ndynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the\nreaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion\nproperties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous\nexperiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic\nreaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a\nsimple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the\nmolecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed\nsingle-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates\nat which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Our work\nsheds light on the physical mechanisms and principles linking the collective\nproperties of membrane protein domains to the stochastic dynamics that rule\ntheir molecular~components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 21:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

Also called\nthe phase retrieval, this is a fundamental challenge in bio-,astronomical\nimaging and speech processing. The problem above is ill-posed; additional\nassumptions on the signal and/or the measurements are necessary. In this paper\nwe first study the case where the signal $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is $s$-sparse. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm that we call Compressive Phase Retrieval with\nAlternating Minimization, or CoPRAM. Our algorithm is simple; it combines the\nclassical alternating minimization approach for phase retrieval with the CoSaMP\nalgorithm for sparse recovery. Despite its simplicity, we prove that CoPRAM\nachieves a sample complexity of $O(s^2\\log n)$ with Gaussian measurements\n$\\mathbf{a}_i$, matching the best known existing results; moreover, it\ndemonstrates linear convergence in theory and practice. Additionally, it\nrequires no extra tuning parameters other than signal sparsity $s$ and is\nrobust to noise.

The finite cavity electromagnetic decay rate can lead to either\namplification or cooling of the mechanical oscillator, and lead in particular\nto a parametric oscillatory instability, associated with regenerative\noscillations of the mechanical oscillator, an effect limiting the circulating\npower in laser gravitational wave interferometers. These effects implicitly\nrely on an electromagnetic cavity whose dissipation rate vastly exceeds that of\nthe mechanical oscillator, a condition naturally satisfied in most\noptomechanical systems. Here we consider the opposite limit, where the\nmechanical dissipation is engineered to dominate over the electromagnetic one,\nessentially reversing role of electromagnetic and mechanical degree of freedom.\nAs a result, the electromagnetic field is now subject to dynamical backaction:\nthe mechanical oscillator provides a feedback mechanism which modifies the\ndamping rate of the electromagnetic cavity.

Building on previous experimental work,\nwe demonstrate this dynamical backaction on light in a superconducting\nmicrowave optomechanical circuit.

The MVC problem on $G$\nseeks to identify a vertex cover with minimum cardinality, i.e. minimum vertex\ncover or MVC. Likewise, CVC seeks a connected vertex cover (CVC) with minimum\ncardinality. The problems MDS and CDS seek to identify a dominating set and a\nconnected dominating set respectively of minimum cardinalities. MVC, CVC, MDS,\nand CDS on a general graph are known to be NP-complete. On certain classes of\ngraphs they can be computed in polynomial time. Such algorithms are known for\nbipartite graphs, chordal graphs, cycle graphs, comparability graphs, claw-free\ngraphs, interval graphs and circular arc graphs for some of these problems. In\nthis article we introduce a new class of graphs called a layered graph and show\nthat if the number of vertices in a layer is $O(\\log \\mid V \\mid)$ then MIS,\nMVC, CVC, MDS and CDC can be computed in polynomial time. The restrictions that\nare employed on graph classes that admit polynomial time solutions for hard\nproblems, e.g. lack of cycles, bipartiteness, planarity etc. are not applicable\nfor this class. \\\\ Key words: Independent set, vertex cover, dominating set,\ndynamic programming, complexity, polynomial time algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 06:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 15:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

A topological entanglement entropy of the Wen-Plaquette\nmodel could be obtained by relating the upper bound of the maximum violation of\nthe Bell's inequality to the concurrences of a pure state with respect to\ndifferent bipartitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 07:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

As an effective way\nto resist the channel fading, cooperative relaying is usually adopted in\nwireless networks where neighbouring nodes act as relays to help the\ntransmission between the source and the destination. Most research works simply\nregard these cooperative nodes trustworthy, which may be not practical in some\ncases especially when transmitting confidential information. In this paper, we\nconsider the issue of untrusted relays in cooperative communications and\npropose an information self-encrypted approach to protect against these relays.\nSpecifically, the original packets of the information are used to encrypt each\nother as the secret keys such that the information cannot be recovered before\nall of the encrypted packets have been received. The information is intercepted\nonly when the relays obtain all of these encrypted packets. It is proved that\nthe intercept probability is reduced to zero exponentially with the number of\nthe original packets. However, the security performance is still not\nsatisfactory for a large number of relays. Therefore, the combination of\ndestination-based jamming is further adopted to confuse the relays, which makes\nthe security performance acceptable even for a large number of relays.

Graph theory\nprovides a general and powerful framework to study these networks and their\nstructure at various scales. By way of example, community detection methods\nhave been widely applied to investigate the modular structure of many natural\nnetworks, including brain functional connectivity networks. Sparsification\nprocedures are often applied to remove the weakest edges, which are the most\naffected by experimental noise, and to reduce the density of the graph, thus\nmaking it theoretically and computationally more tractable. However, weak links\nmay also contain significant structural information, and procedures to identify\nthe optimal tradeoff are the subject of active research. Here, we explore the\nuse of percolation analysis, a method grounded in statistical physics, to\nidentify the optimal sparsification threshold for community detection in brain\nconnectivity networks. By using synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth\nmodular structure and realistic topological features typical of human brain\nfunctional connectivity networks, we show that percolation analysis can be\napplied to identify the optimal sparsification threshold that maximizes\ninformation on the networks' community structure. We validate this approach\nusing three different community detection methods widely applied to the\nanalysis of brain connectivity networks: Newman's modularity, InfoMap and\nAsymptotical Surprise. Importantly, we test the effects of noise and data\nvariability, which are critical factors to determine the optimal threshold.\nThis data-driven method should prove particularly useful in the analysis of the\ncommunity structure of brain networks in populations characterized by different\nconnectivity strengths, such as patients and controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 09:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

We investigate thermodynamic effects of\nquantum coherent driving in the context of the fluctuation theorem. We adopt a\nquantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback\ncontrol. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process\nplays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum\nmeasurement and post-selection must be considered in the backward process in\nsharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with\nquantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space\nof quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong\nirreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute\nirreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down.\nIn the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute\nirreversibility because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region\ncompatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems,\nabsolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective\nmeasurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically\nforbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of\nabsolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum\ncoherent driving. Absolute irreversibility is shown to emerge in the absence of\ncoherent driving after the measurement, especially in systems under\ntime-delayed feedback control. We show that absolute irreversibility is\nmitigated by increasing the duration of quantum coherent driving or decreasing\nthe delay time of feedback control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 10:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 11:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The robots are anonymous,\noblivious, and have neither any access to the global coordinate system nor any\nexplicit communication medium. Each robot observes the positions of other\nrobots and moves in terms of its local coordinate system. To investigate the\nself-organization power of robot systems, formation problems in the two\ndimensional space (2D-space) have been extensively studied. Yamauchi et al.\n(DISC 2015) introduced robot systems in the three dimensional space (3D-space).\nWhile existing results for 3D-space assume that the robots agree on the\nhandedness of their local coordinate systems, we remove the assumption and\nconsider the robots without chirality. One of the most fundamental agreement\nproblems in 3D-space is the plane formation problem that requires the robots to\nland on a common plane, that is not predefined. It has been shown that the\nsolvability of the plane formation problem by robots with chirality is\ndetermined by the rotation symmetry of their initial local coordinate systems\nbecause the robots cannot break it. We show that when the robots lack\nchirality, the combination of rotation symmetry and reflection symmetry\ndetermines the solvability of the plane formation problem because a set of\nsymmetric local coordinate systems without chirality is obtained by rotations\nand reflections. This richer symmetry results in the increase of unsolvable\ninstances compared with robots with chirality and a flaw of existing plane\nformation algorithm. In this paper, we give a characterization of initial\nconfigurations from which the robots without chirality can form a plane and a\nnew plane formation algorithm for solvable instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 11:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 06:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

Instead, $\\delta$ measures the possibility to impose a further\ntime-reversal symmetry constraint on the Bloch frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 11:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

Both these conditions are hard to obtain if the\nnon-thermal electrons are mixed with the hot gas in the intra cluster medium,\nbut can be possibly obtained if the non-thermal electrons are mainly confined\nin bubbles with high content of non-thermal plasma and low content of thermal\nplasma, or in giant radio lobes/relics located in the outskirts of clusters. In\norder to derive more precise results on the properties of non-thermal electrons\nin clusters, and in view of more solid detections of a discrepancy between\nX-rays and SZE derived clusters temperatures that cannot be explained in other\nways, it would be necessary to reproduce the full analysis done by Hurier\n(2016) by adding systematically the non-thermal component of the SZE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 11:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The presence of water molecules in the triangular and\nhexagonal pores in the hexagonal structure was established by detailed\nsimulation of the diffraction pattern and Rietveld refinement of the\nexperimental data.

Similar to debugging in imperative languages, where the\nbehaviour of a program is observed during a step-by-step execution, stepping\nfor ASP allows for observing the effects that rule applications have in the\ncomputation of an answer set. While the approach is inspired from debugging in\nimperative programming, it is conceptually different to stepping in other\nparadigms due to non-determinism and declarativity that are inherent to ASP. In\nparticular, unlike statements in an imperative program that are executed\nfollowing a strict control flow, there is no predetermined order in which to\nconsider rules in ASP during a computation. In our approach, the user is free\nto decide which rule to consider active in the next step following his or her\nintuition. This way, one can focus on interesting parts of the debugging search\nspace. Bugs are detected during stepping by revealing differences between the\nactual semantics of the program and the expectations of the user. As a solid\nformal basis for stepping, we develop a framework of computations for\nanswer-set programs. For fully supporting different solver languages, we build\nour framework on an abstract ASP language that is sufficiently general to\ncapture different solver languages.

When the effective energy of mesons becomes\ncomparable to the bag energy enclosing the quarks, the neutrons merge together\nand form a super-baryon (SB), whose interior is made of incompressible\ngluon-quark superfluid. It turns out that the process has a runaway-character:\nit enables the super-baryon to grow in mass and volume from inside-to-outside\nto finally metamorphose the entire object into a completely invisible dark\ngluon-quark object, practically indistinguishable from isolated stellar black\nholes. The inability of these objects to merge with other objects whilst\nagglomerating in clusters makes them excellent candidates both for black holes\nand for dark matter halos in cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 14:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

The statistical analysis of the\ncalculation results shows that: In the selected carbon nanotubes of four\ndifferent diameters, VLi will gradually rise with the increase of CNT diameter\ndue to lithium irons migration resistance decreasing; as the port of CNT is\nsuccessively modified to hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2) and\ncarboxyl (-COOH), the corresponding migration resistance of lithium ions is\nenhanced resulting in the dropping of VLi; in comparison to the effect strength\nof four types of functional groups on VLi, -COOH shows strongest, -NH2 and -OH\nperform relatively weaker, and the effect difference between -NH2 and -OH is\nvery small, -H displays weakest; When the number of a given non-hydrogen\nfunctional group on the port sequentially increases, it also shows a trend that\nlithium ion migration resistance gradually increases which makes VLi decreases\nin turn.

At a first sight, spin summations are\noperations similar to tensor transpositions; a closer look instead reveals\nadditional challenges to high-performance calculations, including temporal\nlocality as well as scattered memory accesses. This publication explores a\nsequence of algorithmic solutions for spin summations, each exploiting\nindividual properties of either the underlying hardware (e.g. caches,\nvectorization), or the problem itself (e.g. factorizability). The final\nalgorithm combines the advantages of all the solutions, while avoiding their\ndrawbacks; this algorithm, achieves high-performance through parallelization,\nvectorization, and by exploiting the temporal locality inherent to spin\nsummations. Combined, these optimizations result in speedups between 2.4x and\n5.5x over the NCC quantum chemistry software package. In addition to such a\nperformance boost, our algorithm can perform the spin summations in-place, thus\nreducing the memory footprint by 2x over an out-of-place variant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 15:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

However, with such power comes the\nresponsibility of ensuring the correctness of these operations. A solution is\nadding run-time checks to the program via assertions, but this can introduce\noverheads that are in many cases impractical. While static analysis can greatly\nreduce such overheads, the gains depend strongly on the quality of the\ninformation inferred. Reusable libraries, i.e., library modules that are\npre-compiled independently of the client, pose special challenges in this\ncontext. We propose a technique which takes advantage of module systems which\ncan hide a selected set of functor symbols to significantly enrich the shape\ninformation that can be inferred for reusable libraries, as well as an improved\nrun-time checking approach that leverages the proposed mechanisms to achieve\nlarge reductions in overhead, closer to those of static languages, even in the\nreusable-library context. While the approach is general and system-independent,\nwe present it for concreteness in the context of the Ciao assertion language\nand combined static/dynamic checking framework. Our method maintains the full\nexpressiveness of the assertion language in this context. In contrast to other\napproaches it does not introduce the need to switch the language to a (static)\ntype system, which is known to change the semantics in languages like Prolog.\nWe also study the approach experimentally and evaluate the overhead reduction\nachieved in the run-time checks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 15:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 00:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

When the number of events is large, however, NR\ncalculation is time consuming and how these pairs are organized are not yet\nexplored. In this paper, we designed a new approach to calculate clusters of NR\nevents efficiently. To begin with, R-tree is utilized to index crime events, a\nsingle event is represented by a vertex whereas edges are constructed by range\nquerying the vertex in R-tree, and a graph is formed. Cohesive subgraph\napproaches are applied to identify the event chains. k-clique, k-truss, k-core\nplus DBSCAN algorithms are implemented in sequence with respect to their varied\nrange of ability to find cohesive subgraphs. Real world crime data in Chicago,\nNew York and Washington DC are utilized to conduct experiments. The experiment\nconfirmed that near repeat is a solid effect in real big crime data by\nconducting Mapreduce empowered knox tests. The performance of 4 different\nalgorithms are validated, while the quality of the algorithms are gauged by the\ndistribution of number of cohesive subgraphs and their clustering coefficients.\nThe proposed framework is the first to process the real crime data of million\nrecord scale, and is the first to detect NR events with size of more than 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 12:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 22:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

The GKTFET consists of a sequence of angled\ngraphene p-n junctions (GPNJs). Klein tunneling creates a collimation of\nelectrons across each GPNJ, so that the lack of substantial overlap between\ntransmission lobes across successive junctions creates a gate-tunable transport\ngap without significantly compromising the on-current. Electron scattering at\nthe device edge tends to bleed parasitic states into the gap, but the resulting\npseudogap is still sufficient to create a saturated output ($I_D-V_D$)\ncharacteristic and a high output resistance. The modulated density of states\ngenerates a higher transconductance ($g_m$) and unity current gain cut-off\nfrequency ($f_T$) than GFETs. More significantly the high output resistance\nmakes the unity power gain cut-off frequency ($f_{max}$) of GKTFETs\nconsiderably larger than GFETs, making analog GKTFET potentially useful for RF\nelectronics. Our estimation shows the $f_T$/$f_{max}$ of a GKTFET with 1 $\\mu$m\nchannel reaches 33 GHz/17 GHz, and scale up to 350 GHz/53 GHz for 100 nm\nchannel (assuming a single, scalable trapezoidal gate).

This barrier prevents un-managed, self-organizing,\nautocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex,\ncooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that\ncould otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an\norganization will often not be supported within the organization, and because\nside reactions and other free-riding processes will undermine cooperation. As a\nresult, the barrier seriously limits the possibility space that can be explored\nby un-managed organizations, impeding individuation, complex functionality and\nthe transition to life. The barrier can be overcome comprehensively by\nappropriate management which implements a system of evolvable constraints. The\nconstraints support beneficial co-operators and suppress free riders. In this\nway management can manipulate the chemical processes of an autocatalytic\norganization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the\norganization as a whole and that could not arise and persist spontaneously in\nan un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is\nable to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its management of\nan autocatalytic organization promotes beneficial cooperation. Selection\ntherefore favours the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical\norganizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism\nhypothesis shows that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier\ncomprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the\nhypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a\ndigitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 04:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}
