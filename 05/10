We find that the residual flux fraction ($RFF$), which measures the\nfractional contribution to the galaxy light of the residuals left after\nsubtracting a symmetric and smooth model, is very sensitive to the degree of\nstructural disturbance but not the causes of such disturbance. On the other\nhand, the asymmetry of these residuals ($A_{\\rm res}$) is more sensitive to the\ncauses of the disturbance, with merging galaxies having the highest values of\n$A_{\\rm res}$. Using these quantitative parameters we find that, at a fixed\nmorphology, cluster and field galaxies show statistically similar degrees of\ndisturbance. However, there is a higher fraction of symmetric and passive\nspirals in the cluster than in the field. These galaxies have smoother light\ndistributions than their star-forming counterparts. We also find that while\nalmost all field and cluster S0s appear undisturbed, there is a relatively\nsmall population of star-forming S0s in clusters but not in the field. These\nfindings are consistent with relatively gentle environmental processes acting\non galaxies infalling onto clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 16:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Despite this considerable precision improvement, inferring\nregulatory networks remains challenging because stochasticity now proves to\nplay a fundamental role in gene expression. In particular, mRNA synthesis is\nnow acknowledged to occur in a highly bursty manner. We propose to view the\ninference problem as a fitting procedure for a mechanistic gene network model\nthat is inherently stochastic and takes not only protein, but also mRNA levels\ninto account. We first explain how to build and simulate this network model\nbased upon the coupling of genes that are described as piecewise-deterministic\nMarkov processes. Our model is modular and can be used to implement various\nbiochemical hypotheses including causal interactions between genes. However, a\nnaive fitting procedure would be intractable. By performing a relevant\napproximation of the stationary distribution, we derive a tractable procedure\nthat corresponds to a statistical hidden Markov model with interpretable\nparameters. This approximation turns out to be extremely close to the\ntheoretical distribution in the case of a simple toggle-switch, and we show\nthat it can indeed fit real single-cell data. As a first step toward inference,\nour approach was applied to a number of simple two-gene networks simulated in\nsilico from the mechanistic model and satisfactorily recovered the original\nnetworks. Our results demonstrate that functional interactions between genes\ncan be inferred from the distribution of a mechanistic, dynamical stochastic\nmodel that is able to describe gene expression in individual cells.

The\nsubstrates covered in this review, which have been chosen with commercial\navailability and, most importantly, experimental practicality as a criterion,\nare KTaO3, REScO3 (RE = Rare-earth elements), SrTiO3,\nLa0.18Sr0.82Al0.59Ta0.41O3 (LSAT), NdGaO3, LaAlO3, SrLaAlO4, and YAlO3.\nAnalyzing all the established procedures, we conclude that atomically flat\nsurfaces with selective A- or B-site single termination would be obtained for\nmost commercially available oxide substrates. We further note that this topmost\nsurface layer selectivity would provide an additional degree of freedom in\nsearching for unforeseen emergent phenomena and functional applications in\nepitaxial oxide thin films and heterostructures with atomically controlled\ninterfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 17:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 15:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

In this paper, we establish frequentist consistency and\nasymptotic normality of VB methods.

A remarkable signal alteration, such as a reduction in\nsignal correlation (NSR, about 3 s; AF, less than 1 s) and increased\nprobability (up to three to four times higher in AF than in NSR) of extreme\nvalue events, emerges for the peripheral brain circulation.

This sample covers a\ncontinuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At\nlow redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are\nrotationally supported ($V_{rot}>\\sigma_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of\ngalaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\\%$ at low stellar mass\n($10^{9}-10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$) and 70$\\%$ at high stellar mass\n($10^{10}-10^{11}M_{\\odot}$). For $V_{rot}\\,>\\,3\\,\\sigma_g$, the percentage\ndrops below 35$\\%$ for all masses. From $z\\,=\\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit\nremarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards\nrotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems.\nThis is mostly due to an average decline in $\\sigma_g$ by a factor of 3 since a\nredshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period,\n$V_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not\nevolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V_{rot}$ and $\\sigma_g$ with\ntime are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary\ntracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with\nabundance matching, not only does $\\sigma_g$ decline with time as before, but\n$V_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the\nevolution in $V_{rot}/\\sigma_g$. These results indicate that $z\\,=\\,2$ is a\nperiod of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in\ntoday's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

We aim to find signs of disk evolutionary processes by studying the\ndisk geometry and the dust grain properties at its surface, and to search for\ncompanion candidates. We analyze a set of VLT/SPHERE data at near-infrared and\noptical wavelengths. We performed polarimetric imaging of T Cha with IRDIS (1.6\n$\\mu$m) and ZIMPOL (0.5-0.9 $\\mu$m), and obtained intensity images from IRDIS\ndual-band imaging with simultaneous spectro-imaging with IFS (0.9-1.3 $\\mu$m).\nThe disk around T Cha is detected in all observing modes and its outer disk is\nresolved in scattered light with unprecedented angular resolution and\nsignal-to-noise. The images reveal a highly inclined disk with a noticeable\neast-west brightness asymmetry. The significant amount of non-azimuthal\npolarization signal in the $U_{\\phi}$ images, with a $U_{\\phi}$/$Q_{\\phi}$\npeak-to-peak value of 14%, is in accordance with theoretical studies on\nmultiple scattering. Our optimal axisymmetric radiative transfer model\nconsiders two coplanar inner and outer disks, separated by a gap of 0.28\"\n(~30au) in size. We derive a disk inclination of ~69 deg and PA of ~114 deg. In\norder to self-consistently reproduce the intensity and polarimetric images, the\ndust grains, responsible for the scattered light, need to be dominated by sizes\nof around ten microns. A point source is detected at an angular distance of\n3.5\" from the central star. It is, however, found not to be co-moving. We\nconfirm that the dominant source of emission is forward scattered light from\nthe near edge of the outer disk. Our point source analysis rules out the\npresence of a companion heavier than ~8.5 $M_{\\mathrm{jup}}$ between 0.1\" and\n0.3\".

The method applies equally well to Feynman integrals with a\nunitarity cut in a single kinematic channel and to maximally-cut Feynman\nintegrals. Our cut Baikov-Lee representation reproduces the expected relation\nbetween cuts and discontinuities in a given kinematic channel and furthermore\nmakes the dependence on the kinematic variables manifest from the beginning. By\ncombining the Baikov-Lee representation of maximally-cut Feynman integrals and\nthe properties of periods of algebraic curves, we are able to obtain complete\nsolution sets for the homogeneous differential equations satisfied by Feynman\nintegrals which go beyond multiple polylogarithms. We apply our formalism to\nthe direct evaluation of a number of interesting cut Feynman integrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 18:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 17:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

But QBism is not Bohr. This paper\nattempts to show that, despite a popular misconception, QBism is no minor tweak\nto Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is something quite distinct.\nAlong the way, we lay out three tenets of QBism in some detail: 1) The Born\nRule---the foundation of what quantum theory means for QBism---is a normative\nstatement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should\nstrive for; it is not a descriptive \"law of nature\" in the usual sense. 2) All\nprobabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they\nnever tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum\nstates thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes\njust are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Particularly,\nquantum measurement outcomes are not, to paraphrase Bohr, instances of\n\"irreversible amplification in devices whose design is communicable in common\nlanguage suitably refined by the terminology of classical physics.\" Finally, an\nexplicit comparison is given between QBism and Bohr with regard to three\nsubjects: a) The issue of the \"detached observer\" as it arose in a debate\nbetween Pauli and Bohr, b) Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and\nc) Bohr's mature notion of \"quantum phenomena.\" At the end, we discuss how\nBohr's notion of phenomena may have something to offer the philosophy of\nWilliam James: A physics from which to further develop his vision of the\nworld---call it an ontology if you will---in which \"new being comes in local\nspots and patches.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 18:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 17:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

In this paper, we propose transforming the\nsequential ranks into sequential normal scores which are independent, and\nasymptotically standard normal random variables. Thus original methods based on\nthe normality assumption may be used.\n  A novel approach permits the inclusion of a priori information in the form of\nquantiles. It is developed as a strategy to increase the sensitivity of the\nscoring statistic. The result is a powerful convenient method to analyze\nnon-normal data sequences. Also, four variations of sequential normal scores\nare presented using examples from the literature. Researchers and practitioners\nmight find this approach useful to develop nonparametric procedures to address\nnew problems extending the use of parametric procedures when distributional\nassumptions are not met. These methods are especially useful with large data\nstreams where efficient computational methods are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 19:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

In this paper, we propose\ncollaborative edge computing among SBSs by forming SBS coalitions to share\ncomputation resources with each other, thereby accommodating more computation\nworkload in the edge system and reducing reliance on the remote cloud. A novel\nSBS coalition formation algorithm is developed based on the coalitional game\ntheory to cope with various new challenges in small-cell-based edge systems,\nincluding the co-provisioning of radio access and computing services,\ncooperation incentives, and potential security risks. To address these\nchallenges, the proposed method (1) allows collaboration at both the user-SBS\nassociation stage and the SBS peer offloading stage by exploiting the ultra\ndense deployment of SBSs, (2) develops a payment-based incentive mechanism that\nimplements proportionally fair utility division to form stable SBS coalitions,\nand (3) builds a social trust network for managing security risks among SBSs\ndue to collaboration.

The performance of these schemes are studied under the\nhigh-dimensional asymptotic setting in which p grows linearly with n. In this\nasymptotic setting, phase transition diagrams (PT) are often used for comparing\nthe performance of different estimators. Although phase transition analysis is\nshown to provide useful information for compressed sensing, the fact that it\nignores the measurement noise not only limits its applicability in many\napplication areas, but also may lead to misunderstandings. For instance,\nconsider a linear regression problem in which n > p and the signal is not\nexactly sparse. If the measurement noise is ignored in such systems,\nregularization techniques, such as LQLS, seem to be irrelevant since even the\nordinary least squares (OLS) returns the exact solution.

In particular, we argue that since systems with smaller\n{\\it{smallest scaling dimension}} have bigger QFI, the multipartite\nentanglement content of a CFT is dependent on the value of the smallest scaling\ndimension present in the spectrum of the system. We show that our argument\nseems to be consistent with some of the existing results regarding the von\nNeumann entropy, negativity, and localizable entanglement in $1+1$ dimensions.\nFurthermore, we also argue that the QFI decays under renormalization group (RG)\nflow between two unitary CFTs. Finally, we also comment on the non-conformal\nbut scale invariant systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 21:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 17:08:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 18:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

The embedding vectors are\ntypically learned based on term proximity in a large corpus.

However, this\nobjective is not necessarily equivalent to the goal of many information\nretrieval (IR) tasks. The primary objective in various IR tasks is to capture\nrelevance instead of term proximity, syntactic, or even semantic similarity.\nThis is the motivation for developing unsupervised relevance-based word\nembedding models that learn word representations based on query-document\nrelevance information. In this paper, we propose two learning models with\ndifferent objective functions; one learns a relevance distribution over the\nvocabulary set for each query, and the other classifies each term as belonging\nto the relevant or non-relevant class for each query. To train our models, we\nused over six million unique queries and the top ranked documents retrieved in\nresponse to each query, which are assumed to be relevant to the query.

However, the existing I/O\nstack are designed and optimized based on an assumption of disk-based storage.\nTo effectively use NVM, we must re-examine the existing high performance\ncomputing (HPC) I/O sub-system to properly integrate NVM into it. Using NVM as\na fast storage, the previous assumption on the inferior performance of storage\n(e.g., hard drive) is not valid any more. The performance problem caused by\nslow storage may be mitigated; the existing mechanisms to narrow the\nperformance gap between storage and CPU may be unnecessary and result in large\noverhead. Thus fully understanding the impact of introducing NVM into the HPC\nsoftware stack demands a thorough performance study.\n  In this paper, we analyze and model the performance of I/O intensive HPC\napplications with NVM as a block device. We study the performance from three\nperspectives: (1) the impact of NVM on the performance of traditional page\ncache; (2) a performance comparison between MPI individual I/O and POSIX I/O;\nand (3) the impact of NVM on the performance of collective I/O. We reveal the\ndiminishing effects of page cache, minor performance difference between MPI\nindividual I/O and POSIX I/O, and performance disadvantage of collective I/O on\nNVM due to unnecessary data shuffling. We also model the performance of MPI\ncollective I/O and study the complex interaction between data shuffling,\nstorage performance, and I/O access patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 03:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

This paper introduces a new\nmechanism, Loose-Ordering Consistency (LOC), that satisfies the ordering\nrequirements at significantly lower performance and endurance loss. LOC\nconsists of two key techniques. First, Eager Commit eliminates the need to\nperform a persistent commit record write within a transaction. We do so by\nensuring that we can determine the status of all committed transactions during\nrecovery by storing necessary metadata information statically with blocks of\ndata written to memory. Second, Speculative Persistence relaxes the write\nordering between transactions by allowing writes to be speculatively written to\npersistent memory. A speculative write is made visible to software only after\nits associated transaction commits. To enable this, our mechanism supports the\ntracking of committed transaction ID and multi-versioning in the CPU cache. Our\nevaluations show that LOC reduces the average performance overhead of memory\npersistence from 66.9% to 34.9% and the memory write traffic overhead from\n17.1% to 3.4% on a variety of workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 06:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

An edge connecting nodes i and j may\ndiffer in its importance for spreading from i to j and from j to i. The key\nissue is whether node j, after infected by i through the edge, would reach out\nto other nodes that i itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to\ninvoke two unequal weights wij and wji characterizing the importance of an edge\naccording to the neighborhoods of nodes i and j. The total asymmetric\ndirectional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure si which\nquantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. A s-shell\ndecomposition scheme further assigns a s-shell index or weighted coreness to\nthe nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on si and the\nweighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world\nnetworks.

This discussion is motivated by an\noccurring misinterpretation of thermodynamic transport equations written in\nterms of chemical potential in the presence of temperature gradient. The\ntransport equations contain the contributions owned by a gauge transformation\nrelated to the fact that chemical potential is determined up to the summand of\nform (AT+B) with arbitrary constants A and B, where constant A is owned by the\nentropy invariance with respect to shifts by a constant value and B is owned by\nthe potential energy invariance with respect to shifts by a constant value. The\ncoefficients of the cross-effect terms in thermodynamic fluxes are contributed\nby this gauge transformation and, generally, are not the actual cross-effect\nphysical transport coefficients. Our treatment is based on consideration of the\nentropy balance and suggests a promising hint for attempts of evaluation of the\nthermal diffusion constant from the first principles. We also discuss the\nimpossibility of the \"barodiffusion\" for dilute solutions, understood in a\nsense of diffusion flux driven by the pressure gradient itself. When one speaks\nof \"barodiffusion\" terms in literature, these terms typically represent the\ndrift in external potential force field (e.g., electric or gravitational\nfields), where in the final equations the specific force on molecules is\nsubstituted with an expression with the hydrostatic pressure gradient this\nexternal force field produces. Obviously, the interpretation of the latter as\nbarodiffusion is fragile and may hinder the accounting for the diffusion fluxes\nproduced by the pressure gradient itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 10:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

An appealing finding\nis that, for typical fading channels, their instantaneous capacity and\ncumulative capacity are both light-tailed. A direct implication of this finding\nis that the cumulative capacity and subsequently the delay and backlog\nperformance can be upper-bounded by some exponential distributions, which is\noften assumed but not justified in the wireless network performance analysis\nliterature. In addition, various bounds are derived for distributions of the\ncumulative capacity and the delay-constrained capacity, considering three\nrepresentative dependence structures in the capacity process, namely\ncomonotonicity, independence, and Markovian. To help gain insights in the\nperformance of a wireless channel whose capacity process may be too complex or\ndetailed information is lacking, stochastic orders are introduced to the\ncapacity process, based on which, results to compare the delay and\ndelay-constrained capacity performance are obtained. Moreover, the impact of\nself-interference in communication, which is an open problem in stochastic\nnetwork calculus (SNC), is investigated and original results are derived.

How such a strong magnetic field can originate during the\nformation of a neutron star is still subject of active research. An important\nrole can be played by fast rotation: if magnetars are born as millisecond\nrotators dynamo mechanisms may efficiently amplify the magnetic field inherited\nfrom the progenitor star during the collapse. In this case, the combination of\nrapid rotation and strong magnetic field determine the right physical condition\nnot only for the development of a powerful jet driven explosion, manifesting as\na gamma ray burst, but also for a copious gravitational waves emission. Strong\nmagnetic fields are indeed able to induce substantial quadrupolar deformations\nin the star. In this paper we analyze the joint effect of rotation and\nmagnetization on the structure of a polytropic and axisymmetric neutron star,\nwithin the ideal magneto-hydrodynamic regime. We will consider either purely\ntoroidal or purely poloidal magnetic field geometries. Through the sampling of\na large parameter space, we generalize previous results in literature,\ninferring new quantitative relations that allow for a parametrization of the\ninduced deformation, that takes into account also the effects due to the\nstellar compactness and the current distribution. Finally, in the case of\npurely poloidal field, we also discuss how different prescriptions on the\nsurface charge distribution (a gauge freedom) modify the properties of the\nsurrounding electrosphere and its physical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 14:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on\nthe existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs,\nthus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid.\nIn this paper, a novel gametheoretic framework for smart routing of EVs within\nthe smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to balance the\nelectricity load across the grid while taking into account the traffic\ncongestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is\nformulated as a noncooperative game. For this game, it is shown that selfish\nbehavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price\nof anarchy upper bounded by the variance of the ground load induced by the\nresidential, industrial, or commercial users. Moreover, the results are\nextended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the\nsubjective behavior of the owners of EVs as captured by using notions from the\nbehavioral framework of prospect theory.

Task assignment is challenging, since a worker's performance (i)\nmay fluctuate, depending on both the worker's current personal context and the\ntask context, (ii) is not known a priori, but has to be learned over time.\nMoreover, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to\ncontext information, which may not be available at a central entity due to\ncommunication overhead or privacy concerns. Additionally, evaluating worker\nperformance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose\na context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem\nof performance maximization in MCS. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC)\nin the mobile device of a worker regularly observes the worker's context,\nher/his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing\ntasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates the worker's\ncontext-specific performance.

This\nhierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker\nperformance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers.

It further\nhighlights the need to explore the effects of density variations in modifying\nthe turbulence properties as well as in heating the solar wind plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 15:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

We present here that\nthin film franckeite (60 nm < d < 100 nm) behave as narrow band gap\nsemiconductor demonstrating a wide band photoresponse. We have observed the\nband-edge transition at ~ 1500 nm (~830 meV) and high external quantum\nefficiency (EQE~3%) at room temperature. Laser power resolved and temperature\nresolved photocurrent measurements reveal that the photo-carrier generation and\nrecombination are dominated by continuously distributed trap states within the\nband gap. To understand wavelength resolved photocurrent, we also calculated\nthe optical absorption properties via density functional theory. Finally, we\nhave shown that the device has fast photoresponse with rise time as fast as ~ 1\nms. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the optoelectronic\nbehavior in a complex naturally occurring vdWH and can open up the\npossibilities of producing new type of nanoscale optoelectronic devices with\ntailored properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 15:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

Along with its inability to reproduce Fourier's Law -\nwhich subsequent generalizations have been trying to amend - the RLL model is\nalso characterized by awkward cusps at the ends of the non-equilibrium chain,\nan effect that has endured all these years without a satisfactory answer. In\nthis paper, we first show that such trait stems from the insufficiency of\npinning interactions between the chain and the substrate. Assuming the\npossibility of pinning the chain, the analysis of the temperature profile in\nthe space of parameters reveals that for a proper combination of the border and\nbulk pinning values, the temperature profile may shift twice between the RLL\ncuspidal behavior and the expected monotonic local temperature evolution along\nthe system, as a function of the pinning. At those inversions, the temperature\nprofile along the chain is characterized by perfect plateaux: at the first\nthreshold, the cumulants of the heat flux reach their maxima and the vanishing\nof the two-point velocity correlation function for all sites of the chain so\nthat the system behaves similarly to a \"phonon box\". On the other hand, at the\nsecond change of the temperature profile, we still have the vanishing of the\ntwo-point correlation function but only for the bulk, which explains the\nemergence of the temperature plateau and thwarts the reaching of the maximal\nvalues of the cumulants of the heat flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 15:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

To the best of our knowledge,\nthere are few well-founded robust kernel methods for statistical unsupervised\nlearning. In addition, while the influence function (IF) of an estimator can\ncharacterize its robustness, asymptotic properties and standard error, the IF\nof a standard kernel canonical correlation analysis (standard kernel CCA) has\nnot been derived yet. To fill this gap, we first propose a robust kernel\ncovariance operator (robust kernel CO) and a robust kernel cross-covariance\noperator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of\nthe quadratic loss function. Second, we derive the IF for robust kernel CCO and\nstandard kernel CCA. Using the IF of the standard kernel CCA, we can detect\ninfluential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method\nbased on the robust kernel CO and the robust kernel CCO, called {\\bf robust\nkernel CCA}, which is less sensitive to noise than the standard kernel CCA. The\nintroduced principles can also be applied to many other kernel methods\ninvolving kernel CO or kernel CCO.

In the PTA analysis, ultra-low\nfrequency GWs ($\\lesssim 10^{-10}$ Hz) which evolve just linearly during the\nobservation time span are absorbed by the pulsar spin-down rates since both\nhave the same effect on the pulse arrival time. Therefore, such GWs cannot be\ndetected by the conventional method of PTAs. However, the bias on the observed\nspin-down rates depends on relative direction of a pulsar and GW source and\nshows a quadrupole pattern in the sky. Thus, if we divide the pulsars according\nto the position in the sky and see the difference in the statistics of the\nspin-down rates, ultra-low frequency GWs from a single source can be detected.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the potential of this method by Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and estimate the sensitivity, considering only the \"Earth term\"\nwhile the \"pulsar term\" acts like random noise for GW frequencies\n$10^{-13}-10^{-10}$ Hz.

However, existing models rarely consider investors in networking\nstocks and accordingly miss the exact knowledge of how panic contagion leads to\nabrupt crash. In this paper, by networking stocks of sharing common mutual\nfunds, a new methodology of investigating the market crash is presented. It is\nsurprisingly revealed that the herding, which origins in the mimic of seeking\nfor high diversity across investment strategies to lower individual risk, will\nproduce too-connected-to-fail stocks and reluctantly boosts the systemic risk\nof the entire market. Though too-connected stocks might be relatively stable\nduring the crisis, they are so influential that a small downward fluctuation\nwill cascade to trigger severe drops of massive successor stocks, implying that\ntheir falls might be unexpectedly amplified by the collective panic and result\nin the market crash. Our findings suggest that the whole picture of portfolio\nstrategy has to be carefully supervised to reshape the stock network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 10:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 06:57:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 14:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

Data were collected from a body\nsensor network consisting of six wearable inertial sensors (accelerometer and\ngyroscope) located on the right and left thighs, shins, and feet. Additionally,\ntwo electromyography sensors were used on the quadriceps (front thigh) to\nmeasure muscle activity. This database can be used not only for activity\nrecognition but also for studying how activities are performed and how the\nparts of the legs move relative to each other. Therefore, the data can be used\n(a) to perform health-care-related studies, such as in walking rehabilitation\nor Parkinson's disease recognition, (b) in virtual reality and gaming for\nsimulating humanoid motion, or (c) for humanoid robotics to model humanoid\nwalking. This dataset is the first of its kind which provides data about human\ngait in great detail.
