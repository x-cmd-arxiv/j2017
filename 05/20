The security guarantee should hold also with respect to an adversary\nthat has learned the initial position of K touched blocks out of the N blocks.\nThe classical notion of Oblivious Shuffling is obtained for K = N.\n  We present a family of algorithms for Oblivious Shuffling.

While for the most\npessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the\nejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light\ncurves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic\nheating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement. We conclude\nthat future reliable macronova observations would constrain nuclear heating\nrates, and consequently help constrain nuclear mass models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 16:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Many signal processing problems\nrequire iterative application of singular value decomposition (SVD) for\nminimizing the rank of a given data matrix with other cost functions and/or\nconstraints, which is called matrix rank minimization. In matrix rank\nminimization, singular values of a matrix are shrunk by hard-thresholding,\nsoft-thresholding, or weighted soft-thresholding. However, the computational\ncost of SVD is generally too expensive to handle high dimensional signals such\nas images; hence, in this case, matrix rank minimization requires enormous\ncomputation time. In this paper, we leverage CPA to (approximately) manipulate\nsingular values without computing singular values and vectors. The thresholding\nof singular values is expressed by a multiplication of certain matrices, which\nis derived from a characteristic of CPA. The multiplication is also efficiently\ncomputed using the sparsity of signals. As a result, the computational cost is\nsignificantly reduced.

As this is an\nadditional charge independent of the Berry $\\pi$-phase flowing along the band\ndegeneracy, such nodal loops are, in fact, doubly charged. In this manuscript,\nwe generalize the homotopy discussion to the centrosymmetric extensions of all\nAtland-Zirnbauer classes. We develop a taylored mathematical framework dubbed\nthe AZ+$\\mathcal{I}$ classification and show that in three spatial dimensions\nsuch robust and multiply charged nodes appear in four of such centrosymmetric\nextensions, namely AZ+$\\mathcal{I}$ classes $\\textrm{CI}$ and $\\textrm{AI}$\nlead to doubly charged nodal lines, while $\\textrm{D}$ and $\\textrm{BDI}$\nsupport doubly charged nodal surfaces. We remark that no further crystalline\nsymmetries apart from the spatial inversion are necessary for their stability.\nWe provide a description of the corresponding topological charges, and develop\nsimple tight-binding models of various semimetallic and superconducting phases\nthat exhibit these nodes. We also indicate how the concept of robust and\nmultiply charged nodes generalizes to other spatial dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

We find that in most collisions, only part of the\ndust particle is left on the target; velocity is the main driver of the\nappearance of these deposits. A boundary between sticking/bouncing and\nfragmentation as an outcome of the particle-target collision is found at v ~ 2\nm/s. For velocities below this value, particles either stick and leave a single\ndeposit on the target plate, or bounce, leaving a shallow footprint of\nmonomers. At velocities > 2 m/s and sizes > 80 um, particles fragment upon\ncollision, transferring up to 50 per cent of their mass in a rubble-pile-like\ndeposit on the target plate. The amount of mass transferred increases with the\nimpact velocity. The morphologies of the deposits are qualitatively similar to\nthose found by the COSIMA instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

The typical\nidea is to design a clustering algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution,\nprovided the data satisfy a natural stability notion. For example, Bilu and\nLinial (2010) and Awasthi et al. (2012) presented algorithms that output\nnear-optimal solutions, assuming the optimal solution is preserved under small\nperturbations to the input distances. A drawback to this approach is that the\nalgorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and\ngive no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output\narbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not\nsatisfy the given stability notion.\n  In this work, we address this concern in two ways. First, we provide\nalgorithms that inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation\nalgorithms, while simultaneously guaranteeing near-optimal solutions when the\ndata is stable. Our algorithms are natural modifications to existing\nstate-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Second, we initiate the study of\nlocal stability, which is a property of a single optimal cluster rather than an\nentire optimal solution. We show our algorithms output all optimal clusters\nwhich satisfy stability locally. Specifically, we achieve strong positive\nresults in our local framework under recent stability notions including metric\nperturbation resilience (Angelidakis et al. 2017) and robust perturbation\nresilience (Balcan and Liang 2012) for the $k$-median, $k$-means, and\nsymmetric/asymmetric $k$-center objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 19:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Prior work is either limited to controlled\nenvironments (\\eg gonioreflectometers, light stages, or multi-camera domes), or\nrequires the joint optimization of shape, illumination, and reflectance, which\nis often computationally too expensive (\\eg hours of running time) for\nreal-time applications. Moreover, most prior work requires HDR images as input\nwhich further complicates the capture process. In this paper, we propose a\nlightweight approach for surface reflectance estimation directly from $8$-bit\nRGB images in real-time, which can be easily plugged into any 3D\nscanning-and-fusion system with a commodity RGBD sensor. Our method is\nlearning-based, with an inference time of less than 90ms per scene and a model\nsize of less than 340K bytes. We propose two novel network architectures,\nHemiCNN and Grouplet, to deal with the unstructured input data from multiple\nviewpoints under unknown illumination. We further design a loss function to\nresolve the color-constancy and scale ambiguity. In addition, we have created a\nlarge synthetic dataset, SynBRDF, which comprises a total of $500$K RGBD images\nrendered with a physically-based ray tracer under a variety of natural\nillumination, covering $5000$ materials and $5000$ shapes. SynBRDF is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark dataset for reflectance estimation.

Electron-hole compensation has been proposed\nas a mechanism of this nonsaturating XMR in WTe$_2$, while it is yet to be\nclear in the case of MoTe$_2$ which has an identical crystal structure of\nWTe$_2$ at low temperatures.

The nodes in the secondary network are assumed to be solely powered\nby ambient RF energy harvested from the transmissions of the primary network.\nWe assume that the secondary nodes can eavesdrop on the primary transmissions\ndue to which the primary network uses secrecy guard zones. The primary\ntransmitter goes silent if any secondary receiver is detected within its guard\nzone. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of\nsuccessful connection of the primary network as well as the probability of\nsecure communication. Two conditions must be jointly satisfied in order to\nensure successful connection: (i) the SINR at the primary receiver is above a\npredefined threshold, and (ii) the primary transmitter is not silent. In order\nto ensure secure communication, the SINR value at each of the secondary nodes\nshould be less than a predefined threshold. Clearly, when more secondary nodes\nare deployed, more primary transmitters will remain silent for a given guard\nzone radius, thus impacting the amount of energy harvested by the secondary\nnetwork. Our results concretely show the existence of an optimal deployment\ndensity for the secondary network that maximizes the density of nodes that are\nable to harvest sufficient amount of energy. Furthermore, we show the\ndependence of this optimal deployment density on the guard zone radius of the\nprimary network. In addition, we show that the optimal guard zone radius\nselected by the primary network is a function of the deployment density of the\nsecondary network. This interesting coupling between the two networks is\nstudied using tools from game theory. Overall, this work is one of the few\nconcrete works that symbiotically merge tools from stochastic geometry and game\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 00:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Focusing on OH emission and observations until March 2015, we\nconsidered about 3,000 high-quality spectra from two instrumental set-ups\ncentred on 760 and 860 nm, which cover about 380 nm each. These data allowed us\nto measure line intensities for several OH bands in order to derive band\nintensities and rotational temperatures for different upper vibrational levels\nas a function of solar activity and observing date. The results were compared\nwith those derived from emission and temperature profile data of the radiometer\nSABER on the TIMED satellite taken in the Cerro Paranal area between 2002 and\n2015. In agreement with the SABER data, the long-term variations in OH\nintensity and temperature derived from the UVES data are dominated by the solar\ncycle, whereas secular trends appear to be negligible. Combining the UVES and\nSABER results, the solar cycle effects for the OH intensity and temperature are\nabout 12 to 17% and 4 to 5 K per 100 sfu and do not significantly depend on the\nselected OH band. The data also reveal that variations of the effective OH\nemission layer height and air density can cause significant changes in the OH\nrotational temperatures due to a varying ratio of OH thermalising collisions by\nair molecules and OH radiation, deactivation, and destruction processes which\nimpede the rotational relaxation. However, this effect appears to be of minor\nimportance for the explanation of the rotational temperature variations related\nto the solar activity cycle, which causes only small changes in the OH emission\nprofile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 00:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic\nforgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned\ninformation. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed\nthat catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity,\nwhich can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters\nof nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show\nthat modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able\nto produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby\nleaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested.

On the simple diagnostic\nproblem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces\ntask-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific\nlocalized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and\n3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting.

Hyperuniform systems have\nattracted recent attention because they are endowed with novel transport and\noptical properties. Recently, the hyperuniformity concept has been generalized\nto characterize scalar fields, two-phase media and random vector fields. In\nthis paper, we devise methods to explicitly construct hyperuniform scalar\nfields. We investigate explicitly spatial patterns generated from Gaussian\nrandom fields, which have been used to model the microwave background radiation\nand heterogeneous materials, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for spinodal\ndecomposition, and Swift-Hohenberg equations that have been used to model\nemergent pattern formation, including Rayleigh-B{\\' e}nard convection. We show\nthat the Gaussian random scalar fields can be constructed to be hyperuniform.\nWe also numerically study the time evolution of spinodal decomposition patterns\nand demonstrate that these patterns are hyperuniform in the scaling regime.\nMoreover, we find that labyrinth-like patterns generated by the Swift-Hohenberg\nequation are effectively hyperuniform. We show that thresholding a hyperuniform\nGaussian random field to produce a two-phase random medium tends to destroy the\nhyperuniformity of the progenitor scalar field. We then propose guidelines to\nachieve effectively hyperuniform two-phase media derived from thresholded\nnon-Gaussian fields.

By\nmodel-independent, we mean that each agent can execute its algorithm with no\nknowledge of the agent self-dynamics. A variable-gain algorithm is employed\nwhen the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a\nfully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous\nwork concerning event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is\ndirected, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be\ncentrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities which require\nlimited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics,\nbounds on network topology information and bounds on the initial conditions.\nWhen the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics which include the vector of\ngravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed which\nrequires more information about the agent dynamics but can estimate uncertain\nagent parameters.\n  For each algorithm, a trigger function is proposed to govern the event update\ntimes. At each event, the controller is updated, which ensures that the control\ninput is piecewise constant and saves energy resources.

These relations provide a direct link between\nobservables, i.e. effective temperature and characteristics of the oscillation\nspectra, and stellar properties, i.e. mean density and surface gravity (thus\nmass and radius). These scaling relations are commonly used to characterize\nlarge samples of stars. Usually, the Sun is used as a reference from which the\nstructure is scaled. However, for stars that do not have a similar structure as\nthe Sun, using the Sun as a reference introduces systematic errors as large as\n10\\% in mass and 5\\% in radius.

Thus, CeAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ provides a starting point for\ninvestigating geometric magnetic frustration in a cerium lattice without strong\nKondo hybridization, where calculations provide useful guidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 18:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}
