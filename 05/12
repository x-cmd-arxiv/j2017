One renowned theorem of signed networks, known as\nHarary's theorem, states that structurally balanced signed networks are\nclusterable. By viewing each cycle in a signed network as a parity-check\nconstraint, we show that the community detection problem in a signed network\nwith two communities is equivalent to the decoding problem for a parity-check\ncode. We also show how one can use two renowned decoding algorithms in error-\ncorrecting codes for community detection in signed networks: the bit-flipping\nalgorithm, and the belief propagation algorithm. In addition to these two\nalgorithms, we also propose a new community detection algorithm, called the\nHamming distance algorithm, that performs community detection by finding a\ncodeword that minimizes the Hamming distance. We compare the performance of\nthese three algorithms by conducting various experiments with known ground\ntruth. Our experimental results show that our Hamming distance algorithm\noutperforms the other two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 16:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of\nlong-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated\nsimulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion.\nHowever, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the\noutcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar\nplanetary systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of\ninitial parameters of planet formation via pebble accretion, and present the\nfirst results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate the pebble accretion\nmodel by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along\nwith the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and\nplanet migration in the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads\nto a variety of planetary systems, but have difficulty in reproducing observed\nproperties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary mass, semimajor axis, and\neccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient type\nI migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our\nsimulations also lead to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that\nformation efficiencies of planets depend on the stellar metallicities, not only\nfor giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths (SEs). The\ndependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead\nto faster formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost\nlater via dynamical instability. Second, our results indicate that a wide range\nof bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural consequence of dynamical\nevolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations\nsuggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 16:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 13:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

For the case with BPSK signals and restricted\nnumber of active antennas, the results show that RS fails to predict the\nperformance while the RSB ansatz is consistent with theoretical bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 17:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

This encapsulates a common way\nof building categories in practice, by starting with an existing category and\nadding extra data/properties to the objects and morphisms.\n  The interest of this seemingly trivial reformulation is that various\nproperties of functors are more naturally defined as properties of the\ncorresponding displayed categories. Grothendieck fibrations, for example, when\ndefined as certain functors, use equality on objects in their definition. When\ndefined instead as certain displayed categories, no reference to equality on\nobjects is required. Moreover, almost all examples of fibrations in nature are,\nin fact, categories whose standard construction can be seen as going via\ndisplayed categories.\n  We therefore propose displayed categories as a basis for the development of\nfibrations in the type-theoretic setting, and similarly for various other\nnotions whose classical definitions involve equality on objects.\n  Besides giving a conceptual clarification of such issues, displayed\ncategories also provide a powerful tool in computer formalisation, unifying and\nabstracting common constructions and proof techniques of category theory, and\nenabling modular reasoning about categories of multi-component structures.

The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that can be\nemployed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great popularity as a tool\nfor testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a\nstatistical technique that is used to make sense of the cross-correlation of\ntwo sets of measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain\nimaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients), and sparse CCA\nextends the classical method to high-dimensional settings.

Concentration-dependent clustering\ndepends strongly on mass at all $\\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions\n($\\Delta \\sim 200\\mathrm{m}-600\\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering\nat low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through\ninteractions with neighbouring haloes.

Hardware vision acceleration,\nhowever, does not address the cost of capturing and processing the image data\nthat feeds these algorithms. We examine the role of the image signal processing\n(ISP) pipeline in computer vision to identify opportunities to reduce\ncomputation and save energy. The key insight is that imaging pipelines should\nbe designed to be configurable: to switch between a traditional photography\nmode and a low-power vision mode that produces lower-quality image data\nsuitable only for computer vision. We use eight computer vision algorithms and\na reversible pipeline simulation tool to study the imaging system's impact on\nvision performance. For both CNN-based and classical vision algorithms, we\nobserve that only two ISP stages, demosaicing and gamma compression, are\ncritical for task performance. We propose a new image sensor design that can\ncompensate for skipping these stages. The sensor design features an adjustable\nresolution and tunable analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our proposed\nimaging system's vision mode disables the ISP entirely and configures the\nsensor to produce subsampled, lower-precision image data. This vision mode can\nsave ~75% of the average energy of a baseline photography mode while having\nonly a small impact on vision task accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 18:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 19:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 18:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

Extremal records summarize the limits of the space explored by a\nprocess, and the historical progression of a record sheds light on the\nunderlying dynamics of the process. Existing analyses of prediction,\nstatistical properties, and ultimate limits of record progressions have focused\non particular domains. However, a broad perspective on how record progressions\nvary across different spheres of activity needs further development. Here we\nemploy cross-cutting metrics to compare records across a variety of domains,\nincluding sports, games, biological evolution, and technological development.\nWe find that these domains exhibit characteristic statistical signatures in\nterms of rates of improvement, \"burstiness\" of record-breaking time series, and\nthe acceleration of the record breaking process. Specifically, sports and games\nexhibit the slowest rate of improvement and a wide range of rates of\n\"burstiness.\" Technology improves at a much faster rate and, unlike other\ndomains, tends to show acceleration in records. Many biological and\ntechnological processes are characterized by constant rates of improvement,\nshowing less burstiness than sports and games. It is important to understand\nhow these statistical properties of record progression emerge from the\nunderlying dynamics. Towards this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of a\nparticular record-setting event: elite marathon running. In this domain, we\nfind that studying record-setting data alone can obscure many of the structural\nproperties of the underlying process. The marathon study also illustrates how\nsome of the standard statistical assumptions underlying record progression\nmodels may be inappropriate or commonly violated in real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 18:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 18:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

Galaxy formation is suppressed below a Jeans\nscale, of $\\simeq 10^8 M_\\odot$ by setting the axion mass to, $m_B \\sim\n10^{-22}$eV, and the large dark cores of dwarf galaxies are explained as\nsolitons on the de-Broglie scale. This is persuasive, but detection of the\ninherent scalar field oscillation at the Compton frequency, $\\omega_B= (2.5{\\rm\n\\, months})^{-1}(m_B/10^{-22}eV)$, would be definitive.

The oscillating field\npressure induces General Relativistic time dilation in proportion to the local\ndark matter density and pulsars within this dense core have detectably large\ntiming residuals, of $\\simeq 400nsec/(m_B/10^{-22}eV)$. This is encouraging as\nmany new pulsars should be discovered near the Galactic center with planned\nradio surveys.

In order to identify truthful values from (crowd) workers'\nnoisy or even conflicting sensory data, truth discovery algorithms, which\njointly estimate workers' data quality and the underlying truths through\nquality-aware data aggregation, have drawn significant attention. However, the\npower of these algorithms could not be fully unleashed in MCS systems, unless\nworkers' strategic reduction of their sensing effort is properly tackled. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a payment mechanism, named\nTheseus, that deals with workers' such strategic behavior, and incentivizes\nhigh-effort sensing from workers. We ensure that, at the Bayesian Nash\nEquilibrium of the non-cooperative game induced by Theseus, all participating\nworkers will spend their maximum possible effort on sensing, which improves\ntheir data quality. As a result, the aggregated results calculated subsequently\nby truth discovery algorithms based on workers' data will be highly accurate.\nAdditionally, Theseus bears other desirable properties, including individual\nrationality and budget feasibility. We validate the desirable properties of\nTheseus through theoretical analysis, as well as extensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 22:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

From\nthe perspective of geometric structure-preserving, such approaches are\nundesirable as they are either computationally less efficient, or interfere\nwith the preservation of other geometric properties of the dynamics.\n  In this paper, we adopt the approach used in constructing Lie group\nvariational integrators for rigid body dynamics on the rotation group to the\nrepresentation in terms of unit quaternions. In particular, the rigid body\ndynamics is lifted to unit quaternions, and the Lie group structure of unit\nquaternions is used to represent tangent vector intrinsically, thereby avoiding\nthe use of a Lagrange multiplier. A Lie group variational integrator in the\nunit quaternion representation is derived, and numerical results are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 23:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

This is a new\ntype of equilibrium: the thermoelastic equilibrium between the MEs and parent\nphase in which the total volume of MEs and their size are equilibrium internal\nthermodynamic parameters. This thermoelastic equilibrium exists only in\npresence of the stress-generating defects. Cooling the pre-transitional state\ntowards Ms or applying the external stimuli, stress or magnetic field, results\nin a shift of the thermoelastic equilibrium provided by a reversible\nanhysteretic growth of MEs that results in a giant ME-generated macroscopic\nstrain.

A family of\nguessing sequences is said to be joint if all of its members can guess any\ngiven family of targets independently and simultaneously. I primarily\ninvestigate jointness in the case of various kinds of Laver diamonds. In the\ncase of measurable cardinals I show that, while the assertions that there are\njoint families of Laver diamonds of a given length get strictly stronger with\nincreasing length, they are all equiconsistent. This is contrasted with the\ncase of partially strong cardinals, where we can derive additional consistency\nstrength, and ordinary diamond sequences, where large joint families exist\nwhenever even one diamond sequence does. Grounded forcing axioms modify the\nusual forcing axioms by restricting the posets considered to a suitable ground\nmodel. I focus on the grounded Martin's axiom which states that Martin's axioms\nholds for posets coming from some ccc ground model. I examine the new axiom's\neffects on the cardinal characteristics of the continuum and show that it is\nquite a bit more robust under mild forcing than Martin's axiom itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 01:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

The estimation of parameters of ODE based models is essential for\nunderstanding its dynamics, but the lack of an analytical solution of the ODE\nmakes the parameter estimation challenging. The aim of this paper is to propose\na general and fast framework of statistical inference for ODE based models by\nrelaxation of the underlying ODE system. Relaxation is achieved by a properly\nchosen numerical procedure, such as the Runge-Kutta, and by introducing\nadditive Gaussian noises with small variances.

A beam focuses on a small\nrange of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase\nshifts across frequency due to practical hardware constraints. In switched\nbeamforming, a discrete codebook consisting of multiple beams is used to cover\na larger angle range. However, for sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain\nprovided by the phased array is frequency dependent even if the radiation\npattern of the antenna elements is frequency independent, an effect called beam\nsquint. This paper shows that the beam squint reduces channel capacity of a\nuniform linear array (ULA). The beamforming codebook is designed to compensate\nfor the beam squint by imposing a channel capacity constraint.

The latter theory can be viewed as a background\nindependent version of the 6-dimensional Hitchin theory, for its critical\npoints are complex or para-complex 6-manifolds, but unlike in Hitchin's\nconstruction, one does not need to choose of a background cohomology class to\ndefine the theory.

This problem relates to\noscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this\nstudy, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag\nreduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented,\nand five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and\nsolid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter,\nwhich we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a\nno-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs\nwhen the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a\nfree-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which\ncorresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes\nare identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to\nthe solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three\nmodes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These\nfindings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid\ndynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical\nsolution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction\nsolvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple\nviscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 09:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

This has motivated\ninvestigations of interference-limited multi-user channels, for example, the\nGaussian interfering multiple access channel (G-IMAC). Networks with\ninterference usually require the use of interference alignment (IA) as a\ntechnique to achieve the upper bounds of a network. A promising approach in\nview of constant-gap capacity results is a special form of IA called\nsignal-scale alignment, which works for time-invariant, frequency-flat,\nsingle-antenna networks. However, until now, results were limited to the\nmany-to-one interference channel and the Gaussian X-channel. To make progress\non this front, we investigate signal-scale IA schemes for the G-IMAC and aim to\nshow a constant-gap capacity result for the G-IMAC. We derive a constant-gap\nsum capacity approximation for the lower triangular deterministic (LTD)-IMAC\nand see that the LTD model can overcome difficulties of the linear\ndeterministic model. We show that the schemes can be translated to the Gaussian\nIMAC and that they achieve capacity within a constant gap. We show that\nmulti-user gain is possible in the whole regime and provide a new look at\ncellular interference channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 11:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

As external appearances of\nhuman emotions, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and video face signals are\nwidely used to track and analyze human's affective information. According to\ntheir common characteristics of spatial-temporal volumes, in this paper we\npropose a novel deep learning framework named spatial-temporal recurrent neural\nnetwork (STRNN) to unify the learning of two different signal sources into a\nspatial-temporal dependency model. In STRNN, to capture those spatially\ncooccurrent variations of human emotions, a multi-directional recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) layer is employed to capture longrange contextual cues by\ntraversing the spatial region of each time slice from multiple angles. Then a\nbi-directional temporal RNN layer is further used to learn discriminative\ntemporal dependencies from the sequences concatenating spatial features of each\ntime slice produced from the spatial RNN layer. To further select those salient\nregions of emotion representation, we impose sparse projection onto those\nhidden states of spatial and temporal domains, which actually also increases\nthe model discriminant ability because of this global consideration.\nConsequently, such a two-layer RNN model builds spatial dependencies as well as\ntemporal dependencies of the input signals. Experimental results on the public\nemotion datasets of EEG and facial expression demonstrate the proposed STRNN\nmethod is more competitive over those state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 11:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

The single freeform surface design for\ninput wavefronts, which are neither planar nor spherical, is therefore of\ninterest. In this work, the design of single freeform surfaces for a given\nzero-\\'etendue source and complex target irradiances is investigated. Hence,\nnot only collimated input beams or point sources are assumed. Instead, a\npredefined input ray direction vector field and irradiance distribution on a\nsource plane, which has to be redistributed by a single freeform surface to\ngive the predefined target irradiance, is considered. To solve this design\nproblem, a partial differential equation (PDE) or PDE system, respectively, for\nthe unknown surface and its corresponding ray mapping is derived from energy\nconservation and the ray-tracing equations. In contrast to former PDE\nformulations of the single freeform design problem, the derived PDE of\nMonge-Amp\\`ere type is formulated for general zero-\\'etendue sources in\ncartesian coordinates. The PDE system is discretized with finite differences\nand the resulting nonlinear equation system solved by a root-finding algorithm.\nThe basis of the efficient solution of the PDE system builds the introduction\nof an initial iterate constuction approach for a given input direction vector\nfield, which uses optimal mass transport with a quadratic cost function. After\na detailed description of the numerical algorithm, the efficiency of the design\nmethod is demonstrated by applying it to several design examples.

Earlier studies of the\npertinent multiorbital Hubbard models identified an orbital-selective Mott\nphase, which anchors the orbital-selective behavior seen in the overall phase\ndiagram. An important characteristics of the models is that the orbitals are\nkinetically coupled -- i.e. hybridized -- to each other, which makes the\norbital-selective Mott phase especially nontrivial. A U(1) slave-spin method\nwas used to analyze the model with nonzero orbital-level splittings. Here we\ndevelop a Landau free-energy functional to shed further light on this issue.

Here we introduce another concept that takes\nadvantage of preventing unwanted transitions in fermionic systems by using\nPauli blocking: excitations from a protected ground state to higher-lying\nstates are avoided by adding a layer of buffer fermions, such that the\nprotected fermions cannot make a transition to higher lying excited states\nbecause these are already occupied. This allows to speed-up adiabatic\nevolutions of the system. We do a thorough investigation of the technique, and\ndemonstrate its power by applying it to high fidelity transport, trap expansion\nand splitting in ultracold atoms systems in anharmonic traps.

While its predecessors rely on a black-box approach to hybrid solving by\nintegrating the CP solver gecode, the new clingcon system pursues a lazy\napproach using dedicated constraint propagators to extend propagation in the\nunderlying ASP solver clasp. No extension is needed for parsing and grounding\nclingcon's hybrid modeling language since both can be accommodated by the new\ngeneric theory handling capabilities of the ASP grounder gringo. As a whole,\nclingcon 3 is thus an extension of the ASP system clingo 5, which itself relies\non the grounder gringo and the solver clasp. The new approach of clingcon\noffers a seamless integration of CP propagation into ASP solving that benefits\nfrom the whole spectrum of clasp's reasoning modes, including for instance\nmulti-shot solving and advanced optimization techniques. This is accomplished\nby a lazy approach that unfolds the representation of constraints and adds it\nto that of the logic program only when needed. Although the unfolding is\nusually dictated by the constraint propagators during solving, it can already\nbe partially (or even totally) done during preprocessing. Moreover, clingcon's\nconstraint preprocessing and propagation incorporate several well established\nCP techniques that greatly improve its performance.

Answering a small batch of RMQs\nis a core computational task in many real-world applications, in particular due\nto the connection with the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem.

The droplets in\nthese formulations are limited to being spherical as a consequence of the\ninterfacial tension between the dispersed phase and continuous phase. The\nability to control emulsion droplet morphology and stabilise non-spherical\ndroplets would enable the modification of emulsion properties such as\nstability, substrate binding, delivery rate and rheology. One way of\ncontrolling droplet microstructure is to apply an elastic film around the\ndroplet to prevent it from relaxing into a sphere. We have previously shown\nthat BslA, an interfacial protein produced by the bacterial genus Bacillus,\nforms an elastic film when exposed to an oil- or air-water interface. Here, we\nhighlight BslA's ability to stabilise anisotropic emulsion droplets. First, we\nshow that BslA is capable of arresting dynamic emulsification processes leading\nto emulsions with variable morphologies depending on the conditions and\nemulsification technique applied. We then show that frozen emulsion droplets\ncan be manipulated to induce partial coalescence. The structure of the\npartially coalesced droplets is retained after melting, but only when there is\nsufficient free BslA in the continuous phase. That the fidelity of replication\ncan be tuned by adjusting the amount of free BslA in solution suggests that\nfreezing BslA-stabilised droplets disrupts the BslA film. Finally, we utilise\nBslA's ability to preserve emulsion droplet structural integrity throughout the\nmelting process to design emulsion droplets with a chosen shape and size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 14:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

The\nreason from one side is that they are met in various natural applications\n(fluid dynamics, mechanics, laser dynamics, etc.). At the same time, Lorenz\nattractors are robust, in the sense that they are generally not destroyed by\nsmall perturbations (autonomous, non-autonomous, stochastic). This allows us to\nbe sure that the observed in the experiment object is exactly the chaotic\nattractor, rather than a long-time periodic orbit. Discrete-time analogs of the\nLorenz attractor possess even more complicated structure -- they allow\nhomoclinic tangencies of invariant manifolds within the attractor. Thus,\ndiscrete Lorenz attractors belong to the class of wild chaotic attractors.\nThese attractors can be born in codimension-three local and certain global\n(homoclinic and heteroclinic) bifurcations. While various homoclinic\nbifurcations leading to such attractors were studied, for heteroclinic cycles\nonly cases when at least one of the fixed points is saddle-focus were\nconsidered to date. In the present paper the case of a heteroclinic cycle\nconsisting of saddle fixed points with a quadratic tangency of invariant\nmanifolds, is considered.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. We\nexpect that upcoming X-ray observatories will test these predictions, which\ntogether with additional gravitational wave detections will provide strict\nconstraints on the origin of the most massive BHs that can be produced by\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 17:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Motivated by Arctic\nintraannual variability phenomena such as reemergence of sea surface\ntemperature and sea ice anomalies, we use a prediction approach for sea ice\nanomalies based on analog forecasting. Traditional analog forecasting relies on\nidentifying a single analog in a historical record, usually by minimizing\nEuclidean distance, and forming a forecast from the analog's historical\ntrajectory. Here an ensemble of analogs are used to make forecasts, where the\nensemble weights are determined by a dynamics-adapted similarity kernel, which\ntakes into account the nonlinear geometry on the underlying data manifold. We\napply this method for forecasting pan-Arctic and regional sea ice area and\nvolume anomalies from multi-century climate model data, and in many cases find\nimprovement over the benchmark damped persistence forecast. Examples of success\ninclude the 3--6 month lead time prediction of pan-Arctic area, the winter sea\nice area prediction of some marginal ice zone seas, and the 3--12 month lead\ntime prediction of sea ice volume anomalies in many central Arctic basins.

In this pa- per, we propose a spectral graph wavelet\napproach for 3D shape classification using the bag-of-features paradigm. In an\neffort to capture both the local and global geometry of a 3D shape, we present\na three-step feature description framework. First, local descriptors are\nextracted via the spectral graph wavelet transform having the Mexican hat\nwavelet as a generating ker- nel. Second, mid-level features are obtained by\nembedding lo- cal descriptors into the visual vocabulary space using the soft-\nassignment coding step of the bag-of-features model. Third, a global descriptor\nis constructed by aggregating mid-level fea- tures weighted by a geodesic\nexponential kernel, resulting in a matrix representation that describes the\nfrequency of appearance of nearby codewords in the vocabulary. Experimental\nresults on two standard 3D shape benchmarks demonstrate the effective- ness of\nthe proposed classification approach in comparison with state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 01:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

In particular, to gain insight in the physical behavior of three\nstars namely, Her $X1$, SAX J $1808$-$3658$ and 4U $1820$-$30$, energy density,\nand radial and tangential pressures are calculated. The $f(R,G)$ gravity model\nis split into a Starobinsky like $f(R)$ model and a power law $f(G)$ model. The\nmain feature of the work is a $3$-dimensional graphical analysis in which,\nanisotropic measurements, energy conditions and stability attributes of these\nstars are discussed. It is shown that all three stars behave as usual for\npositive values of $f(G)$ model parameter $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 10:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 13:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

We reconstruct the underlying probability\ndistribution by maximizing the information entropy and applying the moments as\nconstraints. When the Wannier functions are localized within one unit cell, the\nprobability distribution so obtained corresponds to that of the Wannier\nfunction. We show that in the fully dimerized limit the magnitude of the\nmoments are all equal. In this limit, if the on-site interaction is decreased\ntowards zero, the distribution shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,\nbut the overall shape of the distribution remains the same. Away from this\nlimit, if alternate hoppings are finite, and the on-site interaction is\ndecreased, the distribution also shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,\nbut it does this by changing shape, by becoming asymmetric around the maximum,\nas well as by shifting. We also follow the probability distribution of the\npolarization in cycles around the topologically non-trivial point of the model.\nThe distribution moves across to the next unit cell, its shape distorting\nconsiderably in the process. If the radius of the cycle is large, the shift of\nthe distribution is accompanied by large variations in the maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 12:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

The\ncontribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying\nframework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main\nalgorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and\nthe Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large\nvariety of variants that can be investigated within this family.
