The definition of the polarization angle in BK14 maps\nhas gone through self-calibration in which the overall angle is adjusted to\nminimize the observed TB and EB power spectra. After this procedure, the QU\nmaps lose sensitivity to a uniform polarization rotation but are still\nsensitive to anisotropies of polarization rotation. This analysis places\nconstraints on the anisotropies of polarization rotation, which could be\ngenerated by CMB photons interacting with axionlike pseudoscalar fields or\nFaraday rotation induced by primordial magnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK14\nmaps ($\\sim 3\\mu$K-arcmin) makes it possible to reconstruct anisotropies of the\npolarization rotation angle and measure their angular power spectrum much more\nprecisely than previous attempts. Our data are found to be consistent with no\npolarization rotation anisotropies, improving the upper bound on the amplitude\nof the rotation angle spectrum by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the\nprevious best constraints.

It is due to strong interaction between velocity and/or\nvelocity gradient fluctuations, a high Reynolds number flow is a fascinating\nmixture of purely random, close to Gaussian, fields and coherent structures\nwhere substantial fraction of kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. To\nevaluate intensity of fluctuations, one usually studies different moments of\nvelocity increments and/or dissipation rate, characterized by scaling exponents\n$\\zeta_{n}$ and $d_{n}$, respectively.

The simulation is initialized with a\nnon-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field that best correlates with the\nobserved vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs). To focus on these\nideas, simulations are performed for the flaring AR 11283 noted for its\ncomplexity and well-documented dynamics. The simulated dynamics develops as the\ninitial Lorentz force pushes the plasma and facilitates successive magnetic\nreconnections at the two X-type null lines present in the initial field.\nImportantly, the simulation allows for the spontaneous development of mass\nflow, unique among contemporary works, that preferentially reconnects field\nlines at one of the X-type null lines. Consequently, a flux rope consisting of\nlow-lying twisted MFLs, which approximately traces the major polarity inversion\nline, undergoes an asymmetric monotonic rise. The rise is attributed to a\nreduction in the magnetic tension force at the region overlying the rope,\nresulting from the reconnection. A monotonic rise of the rope is in conformity\nwith the standard scenario of flares. Importantly, the simulated dynamics leads\nto bifurcations of the flux rope, which, being akin to the observed filament\nbifurcation in AR 11283, establishes the appropriateness of the initial field\nin describing ARs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 06:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

The DFS tree of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can\nbe built in $O(m+n)$ time. Till date, only a few algorithms have been designed\nfor maintaining incremental DFS. For undirected graphs, the two algorithms,\nnamely, ADFS1 and ADFS2 [ICALP14] achieve total $O(n^{3/2}\\sqrt{m})$ and\n$O(n^2)$ time respectively. For DAGs, the only non-trivial algorithm, namely,\nFDFS [IPL97] requires total $O(mn)$ time.\n  In this paper, we carry out extensive experimental and theoretical evaluation\nof existing incremental DFS algorithms in random and real graphs, and derive\nthe following results.\n  1- For insertion of uniformly random sequence of $n \\choose 2$ edges, ADFS1,\nADFS2 and FDFS perform equally well and are found to take $\\Theta(n^2)$ time\nexperimentally. This is quite surprising because the worst case bounds of ADFS1\nand FDFS are greater than $\\Theta(n^2)$ by a factor of $\\sqrt{m/n}$ and $m/n$\nrespectively. We complement this result by probabilistic analysis of these\nalgorithms proving $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bound on the update time. Here, we derive\nresults about the structure of a DFS tree in random graphs, which are of\nindependent interest.\n  2- These insights led us to design an extremely simple incremental DFS\nalgorithm for both undirected and directed graphs. This algorithm theoretically\nmatches and experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art in dense random\ngraphs. It can also be used as a single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for\nincremental DFS and strong connectivity in random graphs.\n  3- Even for real graphs, both ADFS1 and FDFS perform much better than their\ntheoretical bounds. Here again, we present two simple algorithms for\nincremental DFS for directed and undirected real graphs. In fact, our algorithm\nfor directed graphs almost always matches the performance of FDFS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 12:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

This greatly simplifies the accurate calculation of\nthe continuous spectrum by means of a spectral method, thereby yielding a very\neffective filtering of the pseudospectra as well as a clear identification of\ninstability regions. The regime of global instability is found to be matching\nthe regime of the favorable phase of the forcing by the flow on the compliant\nwall so as to enhance the amplitude of the wall. An energy-budget analysis for\nthe least-decaying hydroelastic (static-divergence, traveling-wave-flutter and\nnear-stationary transitional) and Tollmien--Schlichting modes in the parameter\nspace reveals the primary routes of energy flow. Moreover, the flow exhibits a\nslower transient growth for the maximum growth rate of a superposition of\nstreamwise-independent modes due to a complex dependence of the wall-boundary\ncondition with the Reynolds number. The initial and optimal perturbations are\ncompared with the boundary-layer flow over a solid wall; differences and\nsimilarities are discussed. Unlike the solid-wall case, viscosity plays a\npivotal role in the transient growth. A slowdown of the maximum growth rate\nwith the Reynolds number is uncovered and found to originate in the transition\nof the fluid-solid interaction from a two-way to a one-way coupling. Finally, a\nterm-by-term energy budget analysis is performed to identify the key\ncontributors to the transient growth mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 13:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 07:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

In this work, we study the formation and stability\nof various types of bound states in the Lugiato-Lefever equation by computing\ntheir interaction potential and by analyzing the properties of the oscillatory\ntails. Moreover, we study the effect of higher order dispersion and noise in\nthe pump intensity on the dynamics of bound states. In doing so, we reveal that\nperturbations to the Lugiato-Lefever equation that maintain reversibility, such\nas fourth order dispersion, lead to bound states that tend to separate from one\nanother in time when noise is added. This separation force is determined by the\nshape of the envelope of the interaction potential, as well as an additional\nBrownian ratchet effect. In systems with broken reversibility, such as third\norder dispersion, this ratchet effect continues to push solitons within a bound\nstate apart. However, the force generated by the envelope of the potential is\nnow such that it pushes the solitons towards each other, leading to a null net\ndrift of the solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 13:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The challenge lies not only in the increasing number of measured\nproperties and dynamics of the system (e.g. cell or human body) but also in the\nco-evolution of multiple states and overlapping properties, and degeneracy of\nstates.

Also,\nfor all $n$, $\\kappa_{\\text{in}}$ is found to be larger than\n$\\kappa_{\\text{out}}$ in the temperature range considered. At electron\nconcentrations present in experimental samples, scattering of phonons by\nelectrons is shown to be negligible except well below room temperature where it\ncan lead to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. This\nwork highlights the power of \\textit{ab initio} approaches in giving\nquantitative, predictive descriptions of thermal transport in materials. It\nhelps explain the qualitative disagreement that exists among different sets of\nmeasured thermal conductivity data and provides information of the relative\nquality of samples from which measured data was obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2017 15:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 00:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

The\nimpact of an arbitrary number $n$ of UED on both the $gg\\to H$ and $H\\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ subprocesses is studied. The 1-loop contributions of Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations to these subprocesses are proportional to discrete and continuous\nsums, which can diverge. By implementing dimensional regularization, it is\nshown that discrete regularized sums can naturally be expressed as\nmultidimensional Epstein functions, and that divergences, if exist, emerge\nthrough the poles of these functions. It is found that continuous sums\nconverge, but the discrete ones diverge, with the exception of the $n=1$ case,\nin which the 1-dimensional Epstein function converges. It is argued that\ndivergences that arise from discrete sums for $n\\geq 2$ are genuine UV\ndivergences, since they correspond to short-distance effects in the compact\nmanifold. Then, the amplitudes are renormalized in a modern sense by\nincorporating interactions of canonical dimension higher than four that allow\nus to generate the required counterterms, which are determined using a\n$\\overline{\\rm MS}$-like renormalization scheme.
