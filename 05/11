We observed larger sizes for early type and smaller\nsizes for massive late type galaxies in clusters in comparison to the field. We\nattribute this to longer quenching timescales of more massive galaxies in the\ncluster. Our analysis further revealed an increasing importance of recently\nquenched transition objects (\"red disks\"). This is a virialized population\nfound at higher cluster-centric radii with sizes similar to the quiescent,\nspheroid-dominated population of the cluster center, but with disks still\nin-tact. The mass-size relation of cluster galaxies may therefore be understood\nas the consequence of a mix of progenitors formed at different quenching\nepochs. We also find that galaxy sizes smoothly decreasing as a function of\nbulge fraction. At same bulge-to-total ratio and same stellar mass, quiescent\ngalaxies are smaller than star-forming galaxies. This is likely because of a\nfading of the outskirts of the disk, which we saw in comparing sizes of their\ndisk-components.

This phenomenon is crucial in\ndetermining the oxidative stability of nonaqeous electrolytes in high energy\ndensity electrochemical systems such as the Li-O$_2$ battery. On the basis of\npartially self-consistent first-principles ScGW0 calculations, we\nsystematically study how the electronic energy levels of four commonly used\nsolvent molecules, namely dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethoxyethane (DME),\ntetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetonitrile (ACN), renormalize when physisorbed on\nthe different stable surfaces of Li$_2$O$_2$, the main discharge product. Using\nband level alignment arguments, we propose that the difference between the\nsolvent's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the surface's\nvalence band maximum (VBM) is a refined metric of oxidative stability. This\nmetric and a previously used descriptor, solvent's gas phase HOMO level, agree\nquite well for physisorbed cases on pristine surfaces where ACN is oxidatively\nmost stable followed by DME, THF and DMSO. However, this effect is\nintrinsically linked to the surface chemistry of solvent's interaction with the\nsurfaces states and defects, and depends strongly on their nature. We\nconclusively show that the propensity of solvent molecules to oxidize will be\nsignificantly higher on Li$_2$O$_2$ surfaces with defects as compared to\npristine surfaces. This suggests that the oxidatively stability of solvent is\ndynamic and is a strong function of surface electronic properties. Thus, while\ngas phase HOMO levels could be used for preliminary solvent candidate\nscreening, a more refined picture of solvent stability requires mapping out the\nsolvent stability as a function of the state of the surface under the operating\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 17:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In particular, We find that the chiral anomaly is\nequivalent to the LSM theorem, whereas there is another anomaly, which is not\nrelated to the LSM theorem but is intrinsic to the SPT states. As an\napplication, we extend the conventional LSM theorem to multiple-charge\nmultiple-species problems and construct several exotic symmetric insulators.

Their\nlight curves often show secondary maxima, which cannot be explained in the\nprevious models of thermal energy diffusion or hydrogen recombination without\ninvoking multiple independent shell ejections. We propose that double-peaked\nlight curves are a natural consequence of a collision between\ndynamically-ejected fast shell and pre-existing equatorially-focused material,\nwhich was shed from the binary over many orbits preceding the dynamical event.\nThe fast shell expands freely in the polar directions, powering the initial\noptical peak through cooling envelope emission. Radiative shocks from the\ncollision in the equatorial plane power the secondary light curve peak on the\nradiative diffusion timescale of the deeper layers, similar to luminous Type\nIIn supernovae and some classical novae. Using a detailed 1D analytic model,\ninformed by complementary 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that\nshock-powered emission can explain the observed range of peak timescales and\nluminosities of the secondary peaks in LRN for realistic variations in the\nbinary parameters and fraction of the binary mass ejected. The dense shell\ncreated by the radiative shocks in the equatorial plane provides an ideal\nlocation for dust nucleation consistent with the the inferred aspherical\ngeometry of dust in LRN. For giant stars, the ejecta forms dust when the\nshock-powered luminosity is still high, which could explain the infrared\ntransients recently discovered by Spitzer.

Proposed\nscenarios involve dissipation processes above or below the photosphere of an\nultra-relativistic outflow. Aims: We search for observational features that\nwould favour one scenario over the others by constraining the dissipation\nradius, the outflow magnetization or by indicating the presence of shocks.\nBursts showing peculiarities can emphasize the role of a specific physical\ningredient, which becomes more apparent under certain circumstances. Methods:\nWe study GRB 070110, which exhibited several remarkable features during its\nearly afterglow: a very flat plateau terminated by an extremely steep drop and\nimmediately followed by a bump. We model the plateau as photospheric emission\nfrom a long lasting outflow of moderate Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma\\sim 20$) which\nlags behind an ultra-relativistic ($\\Gamma> 100$) ejecta responsible for the\nprompt emission. We compute the dissipation of energy in the forward and\nreverse shocks resulting from this ejecta's deceleration by the external\nmedium. Results: Photospheric emission from the long-lasting outflow can\naccount for the plateau properties (luminosity and spectrum) assuming some\ndissipation takes place in the flow. The geometrical timescale at the\nphotospheric radius is so short that the observed decline at the end of the\nplateau likely corresponds to the shut-down of the central engine. The\nfollowing bump results from dissipated power in the reverse shock, which\ndevelops when the slower material catches up with the initially fast component,\nafter it had been decelerated. Conclusions: Our interpretation suggests that\nthe prompt phase resulted from dissipation above the photosphere while the\nplateau had a photospheric origin. If the bump is produced by the reverse\nshock, it implies an upper limit ($\\sigma \\lesssim 0.1$) on the magnetization\nof the slower material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 18:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

However, there are certain scenarios, as in sequential data, where the\nproximity of a pair of points cannot be captured without considering their\nsurroundings or context. In videos, as for example, a particular frame is\nmeaningful only when it is seen in the context of its preceding and following\nframes. LSH has no mechanism to handle the con- texts of the data points. In\nthis article, a novel scheme of Context based Locality Sensitive Hashing\n(conLSH) has been introduced, in which points are hashed together not only\nbased on their closeness, but also because of similar context. The contribution\nmade in this article is three fold. First, conLSH is integrated with a recently\nproposed fast optimal sequence alignment algorithm (FOGSAA) using a layered\napproach. The resultant method is applied to video retrieval for extracting\nsimilar sequences. The pro- posed algorithm yields more than 80% accuracy on an\naverage in different datasets. It has been found to save 36.3% of the total\ntime, consumed by the exhaustive search. conLSH reduces the search space to\napproximately 42% of the entire dataset, when compared with an exhaustive\nsearch by the aforementioned FOGSAA, Bag of Words method and the standard LSH\nimplementations. Secondly, the effectiveness of conLSH is demon- strated in\naction recognition of the video clips, which yields an average gain of 12.83%\nin terms of classification accuracy over the state of the art methods using\nSTIP descriptors. The last but of great significance is that this article\nprovides a way of automatically annotating long and composite real life videos.\nThe source code of conLSH is made available at\nhttp://www.isical.ac.in/~bioinfo_miu/conLSH/conLSH.html\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 19:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 13:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

We want to investigate observational signatures of the\nchemical evolution in the post-burst phase for embedded sources. With such\nsignatures it is possible to identify targets that experienced a recent\nluminosity burst. We present a new model for episodic accretion chemistry based\non the 2D, radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo. We have extended\nProDiMo with a proper treatment for envelope structures. For a representative\nClass I model, we calculated the chemical abundances in the post-burst phase\nand produced synthetic observables like intensity maps and radial profiles.\nDuring a burst many chemical species, like CO, sublimate from the dust\nsurfaces. As the burst ends they freeze out again (post-burst phase). This\nfreeze-out happens from inside-out due to the radial density gradient in the\ndisk and envelope structure. This inside-out freeze-out produces clear\nobservational signatures in spectral line emission, like rings and distinct\nfeatures in the slope of radial intensity profiles.

In this context, the characterization of uncertainty in\nthe input variables is crucial. In this paper, input variables are modelled by\nprobability-boxes, which account for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty.\nTwo types of probability-boxes are distinguished: free and parametric (also\ncalled distributional) p-boxes. The use of probability-boxes generally\nincreases the complexity of structural reliability analyses compared to\ntraditional probabilistic input models.

For both types of probability-boxes, the extensive use of meta-models\nallows for an efficient estimation of the failure probability at a limited\nnumber of runs of the performance function. The capabilities of the proposed\napproaches are illustrated through a benchmark analytical function and two\nrealistic engineering problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 20:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

At $f=0$, there is a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T^*$, but at any small but\nnon-zero $f$, this transition is avoided, and replaced (presumably) by a\nvortex-ordering transition at much lower temperatures.

Consequently, radiation pressure dominates the gas\npressure and dust absorbs a large fraction of ionising photons. Radiation\npressure induces increasing density with radius. From a photoionisation\nanalysis we derive central star parameters; $\\log T_{\\mathrm eff} = 4.525$K,\n$\\log L_*/L_{\\odot} = 4.029$, $\\log g = 3.5$ and using stellar evolutionary\nmodels we estimate an initial mass of $2.5 < M/M_{\\odot} < 3.0$.

Of the 49\nGalactic TeV sources covered by 12 mm observations, NH3 (1,1) is detected\ntowards or adjacent to 38 of them. Dense gas counterparts have been detected\nnear several unidentified Galactic TeV sources which display morphology\npointing to a hadronic origin to the TeV gamma-rays. The dense gas detected\ntowards some TeV sources displays unusual emission characteristics, including\nvery broad linewidths and enhanced ortho-to-para NH3 abundance ratios towards\nHESS J1745-303 and HESS J1801-233, which reflects previous shock activity\nwithin the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 01:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

In this work, we explore the plausibility of detecting gene\nmodules by factorizing gene-phenotype associations from a phenotype ontology\nrather than the conventionally used gene expression data. In particular, the\nhierarchical structure of ontology has not been sufficiently utilized in\nclustering genes while functionally related genes are consistently associated\nwith phenotypes on the same path in the phenotype ontology. Results: We propose\na hierarchal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based method, called\nConsistent Multiple Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CMNMF), to factorize\ngenome-phenome association matrix at two levels of the hierarchical structure\nin phenotype ontology for mining gene functional modules. CMNMF constrains the\ngene clusters from the association matrices at two consecutive levels to be\nconsistent since the genes are annotated with both the child phenotype and the\nparent phenotype in the consecutive levels.

It is found that an\narbitrarily weak disorder drives the double-Weyl semimetal to undergo a quantum\nphase transition into a compressible diffusive metal, independent of the\ndisorder type and the Coulomb interaction strength. In contrast, the nature of\nthe ground state of triple-Weyl fermion system relies sensitively on the\nspecific disorder type in the noninteracting limit: The system is turned into a\ncompressible diffusive metal state by an arbitrarily weak random scalar\npotential or $z$ component of random vector potential but exhibits stable\ncritical behavior when there is only $x$ or $y$ component of random vector\npotential. In case the triple-Weyl fermions couple to random scalar potential,\nthe system becomes a diffusive metal in the weak interaction regime but remains\na semimetal if Coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong. Interplay of Coulomb\ninteraction and $x$, or $y$, component of random vector potential leads to a\nstable infrared fixed point that is likely to be characterized by critical\nbehavior. When Coulomb interaction coexists with the $z$ component of random\nvector potential, the system flows to the interaction-dominated strong coupling\nregime, which might drive a Mott insulating transition. It is thus clear that\ndouble- and triple-Weyl fermions exhibit distinct low-energy behavior in\nresponse to interaction and disorder.

The metal insulator transition\ntemperature (Tc) was found to be increased with increasing native defects.\nVanadium vacancy (VV) is envisaged to create local strains in the lattice which\nprevents twisting of the V-V dimers promoting metastable monoclinic, M2 and T\nphases at intermediate temperatures. It is argued that MIT is driven by strong\nelectronic correlation. The low temperature insulating phase can be considered\nas a collection of one-dimensional (1-D) half-filled band, which undergoes Mott\ntransition to 1-D infinitely long Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains leading to\nstructural distortion due to spin-phonon coupling. Presence of VV creates\nlocalized holes (d0) in the nearest neighbor, thereby fragmenting the spin 1/2\nchains at nanoscale, which in turn increase the Tc value more than that of an\ninfinitely long one. The Tc value scales inversely with the average size of\nfragmented Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains following a critical exponent of 2/3,\nwhich is exactly the same predicted theoretically for Heisenberg spin 1/2 chain\nat nanoscale undergoing SPT (spin-Peierls transition). Thus, the observation of\nMIT and SPT at the same time in VO2 can be explained from our phenomenological\nmodel of reduced 1-D Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains. The reported increase\n(decrease) in Tc value of VO2 by doping with metal having valency less (more)\nthan four, can also be understood easily with our unified model, for the first\ntime, considering finite size scaling of Heisenberg chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 04:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

According to\nseveral works, the primary limitation to graphene based transistor performance\nis not related to the material quality, but to extrinsic factors that affect\nthe electronic transport properties. One of the most important parasitic\nelement is the contact resistance appearing between graphene and the metal\nelectrodes functioning as the source and the drain. Ohmic contacts to graphene,\nwith low contact resistances, are necessary for injection and extraction of\nmajority charge carriers to prevent transistor parameter fluctuations caused by\nvariations of the contact resistance. The International Technology Roadmap for\nSemiconductors, toward integration and down-scaling of graphene electronic\ndevices, identifies as a challenge the development of a CMOS compatible process\nthat enables reproducible formation of low contact resistance. However, the\ncontact resistance is still not well understood despite it is a crucial barrier\ntowards further improvements. In this paper, we review the experimental and\ntheoretical activity that in the last decade has been focusing on the reduction\nof the contact resistance in graphene transistors.

Power system state estimation\n(PSSE) aims to obtain complete voltage magnitude and angle information at each\nbus given a number of system variables at selected buses and lines. Power flow\nanalysis is a special case of PSSE, and amounts to solving a set of noise-free\npower flow equations. Physical laws dictate quadratic relationships between\navailable quantities and unknown voltages, rendering general instances of power\nflow and PSSE nonconvex and NP-hard. Past approaches are largely based on\ngradient-type iterative procedures or semidefinite relaxation (SDR).

Recently, Censor-Hillel et. al. and Fraigniaud et al.\nshowed that in the property-testing regime it is possible to test $H$-freeness\nfor any graph $H$ of size 4 in constant time, $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ rounds,\nregardless of the network size.

We show that\n$C_k$-freeness can be tested in $O(1/\\epsilon)$ rounds for any cycle $C_k$,\nimproving on the running time of $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ of the previous algorithms\nfor triangle-freeness and $C_4$-freeness.

Since these networks form a critical backbone of our\ndigital society, it is important that they rely on robust routing algorithms\nwhich ensure connectivity despite such failures. While most modern\ncommunication networks feature robust routing mechanisms, these mechanisms are\noften fairly complex to design and verify, as they need to account for the\neffects of failures and rerouting on communication.\n  This paper revisits the design of robust routing mechanisms, with the aim to\navoid such complexity. In particular, we showcase simple and generic blackbox\ntransformations that increase resilience of routing against independently\ndistributed failures, which allows to simulate the routing scheme on the\noriginal network, even in the presence of non-benign node failures (henceforth\ncalled faults). This is attractive as the system specification and routing\npolicy can simply be preserved.\n  We present a scheme for constructing such a reinforced network, given an\nexisting (synchronous) network and a routing scheme. We prove that this\nalgorithm comes with small constant overheads, and only requires a minimal\namount of additional node and edge resources. At the same time, it allows to\ntolerate a large number of independent random (node) faults, asymptotically\nalmost surely. We complement our analytical results with simulations on\ndifferent real-world topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 07:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 21:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In the phase-field framework, the surface energy associated with\ncrack formation is calculated by evaluating a functional defined in terms of a\nscalar order parameter and its gradients, which in turn describe the fractures\nin a diffuse sense following a prescribed regularization length scale. Imposing\nstationarity of the total energy leads to a coupled system of partial\ndifferential equations, one enforcing stress equilibrium and another governing\nphase-field evolution. The two equations are coupled through an energy\ndegradation function that models the loss of stiffness in the bulk material as\nit undergoes damage. In the present work, we introduce a new parametric family\nof degradation functions aimed at increasing the accuracy of phase-field models\nin predicting critical loads associated with crack nucleation as well as the\npropagation of existing fractures. An additional goal is the preservation of\nlinear elastic response in the bulk material prior to fracture.

This is due to the fact that it suffers from lack of an\noscillatory phase at the end of the inflationary regime which is typically\naccompanied by the appearance of a negative squared propagation speed of the\nscalar mode leading to instabilities of small-scale perturbations. In this\nregard, the warm G-inflation scenario is proposed where for G-inflation to\nsurvive, the Galileon scalar field is coupled to the radiation field through a\ndissipation term which results in removing the reheating period due to the\ncharacteristics of warm inflationary scenario. In so doing, a linear stability\nanalysis is first performed to obtain the appropriate slow-roll conditions in\nsuch a proposal. Cosmological perturbations of the model are then investigated\nby utilizing fluctuation-dissipation theorem and analytical expressions are\nderived for observable quantities; the power spectrum, tilt spectral index and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio in terms of $PSR$ parameters and Galileon flow\nfunctions.

More precisely, we consider a Boltzmann model on the set of\nfinite planar triangulations, together with a percolation configuration (either\nsite-percolation or bond-percolation) on this triangulation. By enumerating\ntriangulations with boundaries according to both the boundary length and the\nnumber of vertices/edges on the boundary, we are able to identify a phase\ntransition for the geometry of the origin cluster. For instance, we show that\nthe probability that a percolation interface has length n decays exponentially\nwith n except at a particular value p\\_c of the percolation parameter p for\nwhich the decay is polynomial (of order n --10/3). Moreover, the probability\nthat the origin cluster has size n decays exponentially if p < p c and\npolynomially if p $\\ge$ p\\_c. The critical percolation value is p\\_c = 1/2 for\nsite percolation, and p c = 2 $\\sqrt$ 3--1 11 for bond percolation. These\nvalues coincide with critical percolation thresholds for infinite\ntriangula-tions identified by Angel for site-percolation, and by Angel \\&\nCurien for bond-percolation, and we give an independent derivation of these\npercolation thresholds. Lastly, we revisit the criticality conditions for\nrandom Boltzmann maps, and argue that at p\\_c , the percolation clusters\nconditioned to have size n should converge toward the stable map of parameter 7\n6 introduced by Le Gall \\& Miermont.

Recent findings suggest that the Solar\nSystem may have formed in a massive cluster since the presence of short-lived\nradioisotopes in meteorites can only be explained by the influence of a\nsupernova. The aim of this project is to determine the 14N/15N ratio towards a\nsample of cold, massive dense cores at the initial stages in their evolution.\nWe have observed the J=1-0 transitions of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C and H15NC\ntoward a sample of 22 cores in 4 Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs). IRDCs are\nbelieved to be the precursors of high-mass stars and star clusters. Assuming\nLTE and a temperature of 15K, the column densities of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C\nand H15NC are calculated and their 14N/15N ratio is determined for each core.\nThe 14N/15N ratio measured in our sample of IRDC cores range between ~70 and\n>763 in HCN and between ~161 and ~541 in HNC. They are consistent with the\nterrestrial atmosphere (TA) and protosolar nebula (PSN) values, and with the\nratios measured in low-mass pre-stellar cores. However, the 14N/15N ratios\nmeasured in cores C1, C3, F1, F2 and G2 do not agree with the results from\nsimilar studies toward the same massive cores using nitrogen bearing molecules\nwith nitrile functional group (-CN) and nitrogen hydrides (-NH) although the\nratio spread covers a similar range. Amongst the 4 IRDCs we measured relatively\nlow 14N/15N ratios towards IRDC G which are comparable to those measured in\nsmall cosmomaterials and protoplanetary disks. The low average gas density of\nthis cloud suggests that the gas density, rather than the gas temperature, may\nbe the dominant parameter influencing the initial nitrogen isotopic composition\nin young PSN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 09:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

While in case of athermal jamming for a\ngiven random starting configuration only the local energy minimum is\ndetermined, we allow the thermally excited crossing of energy barriers.\nInterestingly, we observe that a transition exists where the system becomes\neffectively non-ergodic if the density is increased. In the limit of small but\nnon-zero temperatures the density where the ergodicity breaking transition\noccurs approaches a value that is independent of temperature and below the\ntransition density of athermal jamming. This confirms recent computer\nsimulation studies where athermal jamming occurs deep inside the glass phase.\nIn addition, with our method we determined the critical behavior of the\nergodicity breaking transition and show that it is in the universality class of\ndirected percolation. Therefore, our approach not only makes the transition\nfrom an ergodic to an effectively non-ergodic systems easily accessible and\nhelps to reveal its universality class but also shows that it is fundamentally\ndifferent from athermal jamming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 10:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 13:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Analyzing the geometrical and topological\nproperties of sigma models is necessary to understand the underlying structures\nof string theory. The most general two-dimensional sigma model with manifest\nN=(2,2) supersymmetry can be parametrized by chiral, twisted chiral and\nsemichiral superfields. In the research presented in this thesis, N=(4,4)\n(twisted) supersymmetry is constructed for a semichiral sigma model. It is\nfound that the model can only have additional supersymmetry off-shell if the\ntarget space has a dimension larger than four. For four-dimensional target\nmanifolds, supersymmetry can be introduced on-shell, leading to a hyperk\\\"ahler\nmanifold, or pseudo-supersymmetry can be imposed off-shell, implying a target\nspace which is neutral hyperk\\\"ahler.\n  Different sigma models and corresponding geometries can be related to each\nother by T-duality, obtained by gauging isometries of the Lagrangian. The\nsemichiral vector multiplet and the large vector multiplet are needed for\ngauging isometries mixing semichiral superfields, and chiral and twisted chiral\nsuperfields, respectively. We find transformations that close off-shell to a\nN=(4,4) supersymmetry on the field strengths and gauge potentials of the\nsemichiral vector multiplet, and show that this is not possible for the large\nvector multiplet.\n  A sigma model parametrized by chiral and twisted chiral superfields can be\nrelated to a semichiral sigma model by T-duality. The N=(4,4) supersymmetry\ntransformations of the former model are linear and close off-shell, whereas\nthose of the latter are non-linear and close only on-shell. We show that this\ndiscrepancy can be understood from T-duality, and find the origin of the\nnon-linear terms in the transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 12:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

To\novercome the difficulty, we here propose a new empirical best predicting method\nby using a parametric family of transformations to estimate a suitable\ntransformation based on the data.

A general solution to the problem of\nfiltering and prediction entails some formidable mathematics. Efforts to\ncircumvent the mathematics has resulted in the need for introducing more\nexplicit descriptions of the underlying process. One such example, and a\nnoteworthy one, is the Kalman Filter Model, which is a special case of state\nspace models or what statisticians refer to as Dynamic Linear Models.\nImplementing the Kalman Filter Model in the era of \"big and high velocity\nnon-Gaussian data\" can pose computational challenges with respect to efficiency\nand timeliness.

Given a\nboolean predicate on network states, such schemes enable to check whether the\npredicate is satisfied by the actual state of the network, by having nodes\ninteracting with their neighbors only. Proof-labeling schemes are typically\ndesigned for enforcing fault-tolerance, by making sure that if the current\nstate of the network is illegal with respect to some given predicate, then at\nleast one node will detect it. Such a node can raise an alarm, or launch a\nrecovery procedure enabling the system to return to a legal state. In this\npaper, we introduce error-sensitive proof-labeling schemes. These are\nproof-labeling schemes which guarantee that the number of nodes detecting\nillegal states is linearly proportional to the edit-distance between the\ncurrent state and the set of legal states. By using error-sensitive\nproof-labeling schemes, states which are far from satisfying the predicate will\nbe detected by many nodes, enabling fast return to legality. We provide a\nstructural characterization of the set of boolean predicates on network states\nfor which there exist error-sensitive proof-labeling schemes. This\ncharacterization allows us to show that classical predicates such as, e.g.,\nacyclicity, and leader admit error-sensitive proof-labeling schemes, while\nothers like regular subgraphs don't.

Our main finding is that the\nnonzero misfit parameter of the model, which can be related with the linear\ngradient term (Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction), makes such a transition\nimpossible, what contradicts the previous consideration of this problem by\nnon-perturbative RG methods. To support the conclusion the initial PT model is\nreformulated in terms of the 2D theory of relativistic fermions using an\nanalogy between the 2D sine-Gordon and the massive Thirring models. In the new\nformalism the misfit parameter corresponds to an effective gauge field that\nenables to include it in the RG procedure on an equal footing with the other\nparameters of the theory. The Wetterich equation is applied to obtain flow\nequations for the parameters of the new fermionic action. We demonstrate that\nthese equations reproduce the KT type of behavior if the misfit parameter is\nzero. However, any small nonzero value of the quantity rules out a possibility\nof the KT transition. To confirm the finding we develop a description of the\nproblem in terms of the 2D Coulomb gas model. Within the approach the breakdown\nof the KT scenario gains a transparent meaning, the misfit gives rise to an\neffective in-plane electric field that prevents a formation of bound\nvortex-antivortex pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 13:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The greedy strategy provides an approximate solution to the\noptimization problem, and it is known to satisfy some performance bounds in\nterms of the total curvature. The total curvature depends on the value of\nobjective function on sets outside the constraint matroid. If we are given a\nfunction defined only on the matroid, the problem still makes sense, but the\nexisting bounds involving the total curvature do not apply. This is puzzling:\nIf the optimization problem is perfectly well defined, why should the bounds no\nlonger apply? This motivates an alternative formulation of such bounding\ntechniques. The first question that comes to mind is whether it is possible to\nextend a polymatroid function defined on a matroid to one on the entire power\nset. This was recently shown to be negative in general. Here, we provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an \\emph{incremental}\nextension of a polymatroid function defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k$\nto one defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k+1$, together with an algorithm\nfor constructing the extension. Whenever a polymatroid objective function\ndefined on a matroid can be extended to the entire power set, the greedy\napproximation bounds involving the total curvature of the extension apply.\nHowever, these bounds still depend on sets outside the constraint matroid.\nMotivated by this, we define a new notion of curvature called \\emph{partial\ncurvature}, involving only sets in the matroid. We derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for an extension of the function to have a total\ncurvature that is equal to the partial curvature. Moreover, we prove that the\nbounds in terms of the partial curvature are in general improved over the\nprevious ones......\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 17:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 23:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 14:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Here we analyze the temporal characteristics of online-petition\nsigning behavior in order to identify systematic differences between popular\npetitions, which receive a high volume of signatures, and unpopular ones. We\nfind that, in line with other temporal characterizations of human activity, the\nsigning process is typically non-Poissonian and non-homogeneous in time.\nHowever, this process exhibits anomalously high memory for human activity,\npossibly indicating that synchronized external influence or contagion play and\nimportant role. More interestingly, we find clear differences in the\ncharacteristics of the inter-event time distributions depending on the total\nnumber of signatures that petitions receive, independently of the total\nduration of the petitions. Specifically, popular petitions that attract a large\nvolume of signatures exhibit more variance in the distribution of inter-event\ntimes than unpopular petitions with only a few signatures, which could be\nconsidered an indication that the former are more bursty. However, petitions\nwith large signature volume are less bursty according to measures that consider\nthe time ordering of inter-event times. Our results, therefore, emphasize the\nimportance of accounting for time ordering to characterize human activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 14:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

However, when the resources are indivisible, a CE might not exist\neven when there is one resource and two agents with equal incomes. Recently,\nBabaioff and Nisan and Talgam-Cohen (2017) have suggested to consider the\nentire space of possible incomes, and check whether there exists a competitive\nequilibrium for almost all income-vectors --- all income-space except a subset\nof measure zero. They proved various existence and non-existence results, but\nleft open the cases of four goods and three or four agents with\nmonotonically-increasing preferences.\n  This paper proves non-existence in both these cases, thus completing the\ncharacterization of CE existence for almost all incomes in the domain of\nmonotonically increasing preferences. Additionally, the paper provides a\ncomplete characterization of CE existence in the domain of monotonically\ndecreasing preferences, corresponding to allocation of chores.\n  On the positive side, the paper proves that CE exists for almost all incomes\nwhen there are four goods and three agents with additive preferences. The proof\nuses a new tool for describing a CE, as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a\nspecific sequential game. The same tool also enables substantially simpler\nproofs to the cases already proved by Babaioff et al.\n  Additionally, this paper proves several strong fairness properties that are\nsatisfied by any CE allocation, illustrating its usefulness for fair allocation\namong agents with different entitlements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 14:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 16:17:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 06:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 15:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 05:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 14:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

It is the additive version of the approximation of simple closed\nplane curves by polynomial lemniscates all of whose points have the same\nproduct of distances from finitely many given points (focuses). Here we are\ngoing to generalize the classical version of Erd\\H{o}s-Vincze's theorem for\nregular polygons in the plane. We will conclude that the error of the\napproximation tends to zero as the number of the vertices of the regular\npolygon tends to the infinity. The decreasing tendency of the approximation\nerror gives the idea to construct curves in the topological closure of the set\nof polyellipses. If we use integration to compute the average distance of a\npoint from a given (focal) set in the plane then the curves all of whose points\nhave the same average distance from the focal set can be given as the Hausdorff\nlimit of polyellipses corresponding to partial sums.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 11:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 09:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for\nanalyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to\nseveral small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability\nto large scale systems is often intractable because of its\nexponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,\nalso known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". To overcome this problem, the\nsequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to\nvehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be\ndone with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems. In\nparticular, we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two different\nurban environments, a city environment and a multi-city environment, and use\nthe SPP algorithm for trajectory planning. SPP is able to efficiently design\ncollision-free trajectories in both environments despite the presence of\ndisturbances in vehicles' dynamics. To ensure a safe transition of vehicles to\ntheir destinations, our method automatically allocates space-time reservations\nto vehicles while accounting for the magnitude of disturbances such as wind in\na provably safe way. Our simulation results show an intuitive multi-lane\nstructure in airspace, where the number of lanes and the distance between the\nlanes depend on the size of disturbances and other problem parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 21:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

In the latter case, we identify the sources of the\ninstability as: (i) the cyclic diminution of the plug viscous resistance to\nmotion due to the decrease in the plug length and (ii) a cyclic reduction of\nthe plug interfacial resistance due to a lubrication effect. Since the flow is\nquasi-static and the forcing periodic, this cyclic evolution of the resistances\nrelies on the existence of flow memories stored in the length of the plug and\nthe thickness of the trailing film. Second, we show that contrary to\nunidirectional pressure forcing, cyclic forcing enables breaking of large plugs\nin confined space though it requires longer times.

Separating foreground from the background is\nchallenging job in videos captured by moving camera as both foreground and\nbackground information change in every consecutive frames of the image\nsequence; thus a pseudo-motion is perceptive in background. In the proposed\nalgorithm, the pseudo-motion in background is estimated and compensated using\nphase correlation of consecutive frames based on the principle of Fourier shift\ntheorem. Then a method is proposed to model an acting background from recent\nhistory of commonality of the current frame and the foreground is detected by\nthe differences between the background model and the current frame. Further\nexploiting the recent history of dissimilarities of the current frame, actual\nmoving objects are detected in the foreground. Next, a two-stepped\nmorphological operation is proposed to refine the object region for an optimum\nobject size. Each object is attributed by its centroid, dimension and three\nhighest peaks of its gray value histogram. Finally, each object is tracked\nusing Kalman filter based on its attributes. The major advantage of this\nalgorithm over most of the existing object detection and tracking algorithms is\nthat, it does not require initialization of object position in the first frame\nor training on sample data to perform. Performance of the algorithm is tested\non benchmark videos containing variable background and very satisfiable results\nis achieved.
