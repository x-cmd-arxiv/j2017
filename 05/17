In offline\n(static) signature verification, the dynamic information of the signature\nwriting process is lost, and it is difficult to design good feature extractors\nthat can distinguish genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. This reflects in\na relatively poor performance, with verification errors around 7% in the best\nsystems in the literature. To address both the difficulty of obtaining good\nfeatures, as well as improve system performance, we propose learning the\nrepresentations from signature images, in a Writer-Independent format, using\nConvolutional Neural Networks. In particular, we propose a novel formulation of\nthe problem that includes knowledge of skilled forgeries from a subset of users\nin the feature learning process, that aims to capture visual cues that\ndistinguish genuine signatures and forgeries regardless of the user.

The\npresence of obstacles also modifies the kinetics and equilibrium behavior of\ntracers. While previous theoretical studies of particle diffusion have\ntypically assumed either impenetrable obstacles or binding interactions that\nimmobilize the particle, in many cellular contexts bound particles remain\nmobile. Examples include membrane proteins or lipids with some entry and\ndiffusion within lipid domains and proteins that can enter into membraneless\norganelles or compartments such as the nucleolus. Using a lattice model, we\nstudied the diffusive movement of tracer particles which bind to soft\nobstacles, allowing tracers and obstacles to occupy the same lattice site. For\nsticky obstacles, bound tracer particles are immobile, while for slippery\nobstacles, bound tracers can hop without penalty to adjacent obstacles. In both\nmodels, binding significantly alters tracer motion. The type and degree of\nmotion while bound is a key determinant of the tracer mobility: slippery\nobstacles can allow nearly unhindered diffusion, even at high obstacle filling\nfraction. To mimic compartmentalization in a cell, we examined how obstacle\nsize and a range of bound diffusion coefficients affect tracer dynamics. The\nbehavior of the model is similar in two and three spatial dimensions.

Use of\nhigh magnetic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled a detailed study\nof the ground state in these systems.

The slope of the linear-in-field resistivity is\ntemperature-independent at very high fields. It mirrors the magnitude and\ndoping evolution of the linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been\nascribed to Planckian dissipation near a quantum critical point.

In order to detect event\npatterns that correspond to situations of interest, each operator correlates\nevents on its incoming streams according to a sliding window mechanism. To\nincrease the throughput of an operator, different windows can be assigned to\ndifferent operator instances---i.e., identical operator copies---which process\nthem in parallel. This implies that events that are part of multiple\noverlapping windows are replicated to different operator instances. The\ncommunication overhead of replicating the events can be reduced by assigning\noverlapping windows to the same operator instance. However, this imposes a\nhigher processing load on the single operator instance, possibly overloading\nit. In this paper, we address the trade-off between processing load and\ncommunication overhead when assigning overlapping windows to a single operator\ninstance. Controlling the trade-off is challenging and cannot be solved with\ntraditional reactive methods. To this end, we propose a model-based batch\nscheduling controller building on prediction.

Recent work achieved incremental type\nchecking for structurally typed functional languages through co-contextual\ntyping rules, a constraint-based formulation that removes any context\ndependency for expression typings.

Type checkers encode these features in the form\nof class tables, an additional form of typing context inhibiting\nincrementalization. In the present work, we demonstrate that an appropriate\nco-contextual notion to class tables exists, paving the way to efficient\nincremental type checkers for object-oriented languages. This yields a novel\nformulation of Igarashi et al.'s Featherweight Java (FJ) type system, where we\nreplace class tables by the dual concept of class table requirements and class\ntable operations by dual operations on class table requirements.

The complex chemistry, multiple\nformation pathways, and lack of easily identifiable spectral features\nassociated with aerosols make it especially challenging to constrain their key\nproperties. We propose a transmission spectroscopy technique to identify the\nprimary aerosol formation mechanism for the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters\n(HIHJs). The technique is based on the expectation that the two key types of\naerosols -- photochemically generated hazes and equilibrium condensate clouds\n-- are expected to form and persist in different regions of a highly irradiated\nplanet's atmosphere. Haze can only be produced on the permanent daysides of\ntidally-locked hot Jupiters, and will be carried downwind by atmospheric\ndynamics to the evening terminator (seen as the trailing limb during transit).\nClouds can only form in cooler regions on the night side and morning terminator\nof HIHJs (seen as the leading limb during transit). Because opposite limbs are\nexpected to be impacted by different types of aerosols, ingress and egress\nspectra, which primarily probe opposing sides of the planet, will reveal the\ndominant aerosol formation mechanism. We show that the benchmark HIHJ,\nWASP-121b, has a transmission spectrum consistent with partial aerosol coverage\nand that ingress-egress spectroscopy would constrain the location and formation\nmechanism of those aerosols. In general, using this diagnostic we find that\nobservations with JWST and potentially with HST should be able to distinguish\nbetween clouds and haze for currently known HIHJs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 03:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

The forsterite\nfeature at 69$\\mu$m was not detected in either of the sources, probably due to\nthe lack of (warm) crystalline dust in a flat disc. We find that cooling by\nmolecules is dominant in the Herbig Be stars, while this is not the case in\nHerbig Ae stars where cooling by [OI] dominates. Moreover, we show that in the\nHerbig Be star R Mon, outflow shocks are the dominant gas heating mechanism,\nwhile in Herbig Ae stars this is stellar. The outflow of R Mon contributes to\nthe observed line emission by heating the gas, both in the central spaxel/beam\ncovering the disc and the immediate surroundings, as well as in those\nspaxels/beams covering the parabolic shell around it. PDS 27, a B2 star, has\ndispersed a large part of its gas content and/or destroyed molecules; this is\nlikely given its intense UV field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 18:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We here present the detection of CO J=2-1 emission co-located with\ndust emission from the cometary belt in the 440 Myr-old Fomalhaut system.\nThrough spectro-spatial filtering, we achieve a 5.4$\\sigma$ detection and\ndetermine that the ring's sky-projected rotation axis matches that of the star.\nThe CO mass derived ($0.65-42 \\times10^{-7}$ M$_{\\oplus}$) is the lowest of any\ncircumstellar disk detected to date, and must be of exocometary origin.

Current sequential greedy approaches for structure\nselection require calculating spanning trees in hundreds of dimensions and\nfitting the pair copulas and their parameters iteratively throughout the\nstructure selection process. Our method uses a connection between the vine and\nstructural equation models (SEMs). The later can be estimated very fast using\nthe Lasso, also in very high dimensions, to obtain sparse models. Thus, we\nobtain a structure estimate independently of the chosen pair copulas and\nparameters. Additionally, we define the novel concept of regularization paths\nfor R-vine matrices.

On a technical level, we\ncalculate the exact SC RIXS responses of the Kitaev models on the\nhyperhoneycomb, stripyhoneycomb, hyperhexagon, and hyperoctagon lattices,\narguing that our main results also apply to generic 3D Kitaev spin liquids\nbeyond these exactly solvable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 19:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

However, in the nonlinear context, there may be\nother equilibria present, and this brings with it the possibility of a\ntransition to an alternative (remote) minimum. That is, given a sufficient\ndisturbance, the structure might buckle, perhaps suddenly, to another shape.\nThis paper considers the dynamic mechanisms under which such transitions\n(typically via saddle points) occur. A two-mode Hamiltonian is developed for a\nshallow arch/buckled beam. The resulting form of the potential energy---two\nstable wells connected by rank-1 saddle points---shows an analogy with\nresonance transitions in celestial mechanics or molecular reconfigurations in\nchemistry, whereas here the transition corresponds to switching between two\nstable structural configurations. Then, from Hamilton's equations, the\nanalytical equilibria are determined and linearization of the equations of\nmotion about the saddle is obtained. After computing the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the coefficient matrix associated with the linearization, a\nsymplectic transformation is given which puts the Hamiltonian into normal form\nand simplifies the equations, allowing us to use the conceptual framework known\nas tube dynamics. The flow in the equilibrium region of phase space as well as\nthe invariant manifold tubes in position space are discussed.

A central question is how the order\nparameters of phases near a QCP interact and determine the fundamental\ncharacter of the critical dynamics which drive the quantum critical behavior.\nOne of the most interesting proposals for the quantum critical behavior that\noccurs in correlated electron systems is that the behavior may arise from\nlocal, as opposed to long wavelength, critical fluctuations of the order\nparameter. The local criticality is believed to give rise to energy over\ntemperature ($E/T$) scaling of the dynamic susceptibility with a fractional\nexponent near the quantum critical point (QCP). Here we show that $E/T$ scaling\nis indeed observed for CeCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_x$ but on closer inspection, the\nfluctuations can be separated into two components, implying that multiple order\nparameters play an important role in the unconventional critical behavior.\nAdditionally, when the fluctuations corresponding to the magnetically ordered\nside of the phase diagram are separated, they are found to be three dimensional\nand to obey the scaling behavior expected for long wavelength fluctuations near\nan itinerant antiferromagnetic QCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 20:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 15:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 15:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

We consider the case where $M^2 \\sim \\Lambda^2_{\\rm\nQCD}/N_c$ so that to leading order in $N_c$ this symmetry breaking term\nvanishes. We present some arguments why this might be plausible. One might\nthink that such a radical assumption would contradict lattice Monte Carlo data\non QCD as function of $N_c$. We show that the linear sigma model gives a fair\ndescription of the data of DeGrand and Liu both for $N_c = 3$, and for variable\n$N_c$. The values of quark masses considered by DeGrand and Liu, and by Bali\net. al. turn out to be too large to resolve the case we consider from that of\nthe conventional large $N_c$ limit.

For example, splitting isolated points\nby cut-based criteria is essentially the sparsest subset bias, which is the\nopposite of the density mode bias. Our findings suggest that a principled\nsolution for density biases in kernel clustering should directly address data\ninhomogeneity. We show that density equalization can be implicitly achieved\nusing either locally adaptive weights or locally adaptive kernels. Moreover,\ndensity equalization makes many popular kernel clustering objectives\nequivalent. Our synthetic and real data experiments illustrate density biases\nand proposed solutions. We anticipate that theoretical understanding of kernel\nclustering limitations and their principled solutions will be important for a\nbroad spectrum of data analysis applications across the disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 23:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 15:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 14:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 03:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 16:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

The media properties (the\npermeability) contain multiple scales and high contrast. The proposed method\nsolves the flow equation in a mixed formulation on a coarse grid by\nconstructing multiscale basis functions. The resulting velocity field is mass\nconservative on the fine grid. Our main goal is to obtain first-order\nconvergence in terms of the mesh size which is independent of local contrast.\nThis is achieved, first, by constructing some auxiliary spaces, which contain\nglobal information that can not be localized, in general. This is built on our\nprevious work on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In\nthe auxiliary space, multiscale basis functions corresponding to small\n(contrast-dependent) eigenvalues are selected. These basis functions represent\nthe high-conductivity channels (which connect the boundaries of a coarse\nblock). Next, we solve local problems to construct multiscale basis functions\nfor the velocity field. These local problems are formulated in the oversampled\ndomain taking into account some constraints with respect to auxiliary spaces.\nThe latter allows fast spatial decay of local solutions and, thus, allows\ntaking smaller oversampled regions. The number of basis functions depends on\nsmall eigenvalues of the local spectral problems. Moreover, multiscale pressure\nbasis functions are needed in constructing the velocity space. Our multiscale\nspaces have a minimal dimension, which is needed to avoid contrast-dependence\nin the convergence. The method's convergence requires an oversampling of\nseveral layers. We present an analysis of our approach.

In this\npolar coded NOMA (PC-NOMA) framework, the original NOMA channel is decomposed\ninto multiple bit polarized channels by using a three-stage channel transform,\nthat is, user$\\to$signal$\\to$bit partitions. Specifically, for the first-stage\nchannel transform, we design two schemes, namely sequential user partition\n(SUP) and parallel user partition (PUP).

Outlier detection is highly sensitive to the choice of the\ndetection algorithm and the feature subspace used by the algorithm. Extracting\ndomain-relevant insights from outliers needs systematic exploration of these\nchoices since diverse outlier sets could lead to complementary insights. This\nchallenge is especially acute in an interactive setting, where the choices must\nbe explored in a time-constrained manner. In this work, we present REMIX, the\nfirst system to address the problem of outlier detection in an interactive\nsetting. REMIX uses a novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for\nautomatically selecting and executing a diverse set of outlier detectors within\na time limit. This formulation incorporates multiple aspects such as (i) an\nupper limit on the total execution time of detectors (ii) diversity in the\nspace of algorithms and features, and (iii) meta-learning for evaluating the\ncost and utility of detectors. REMIX provides two distinct ways for the analyst\nto consume its results: (i) a partitioning of the detectors explored by REMIX\ninto perspectives through low-rank non-negative matrix factorization; each\nperspective can be easily visualized as an intuitive heatmap of experiments\nversus outliers, and (ii) an ensembled set of outliers which combines outlier\nscores from all detectors. We demonstrate the benefits of REMIX through\nextensive empirical validation on real-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 02:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

The\nkey contribution of this work is an illustration of a means by which any CP-ABE\nsystem may be utilized in a black-box manner for attribute-based authentication\nand cryptographically enforced attribute-based access control in distributed\nstorage systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 04:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

We also\nconsider the effect of the advection wind originating from the protoplanetary\ndisk, following the results of Ormel et al. (2015). We show that for low mass\npebbles, once the planetary embryo is larger than ~1 Mearth, the envelope is\nlarge enough to destroy and vaporize pebbles completely before they can reach\nthe core. The material constituting pebbles is therefore released in the\nplanetary envelope, and later on dispersed in the protoplanetary disk, if the\nadvection wind is strong enough. As a consequence the growth of the planetary\nembryo is stopped at a mass that is so small that Kelvin-Helmholtz accretion\ncannot lead to the accretion of significant amounts of gas. For larger\nplanetesimals, a similar process occurs but at much larger mass, of the order\nof ten Earth masses, and is followed by rapid accretion of gas. If the effect\nof the advection is as efficient as described in Ormel al.

In 1967, Bregman introduced what is nowadays known as\nthe Bregman distance as a measure of discrepancy between two points\ngeneralizing the square of the Euclidean distance. Proximity operators based on\nthe Bregman distance have become a topic of significant research as they are\nuseful in the algorithmic solution of optimization problems. More recently, in\n2012, Kan and Song studied regularization aspects of the left Bregman-Moreau\nenvelope even for nonconvex functions. In this paper, we complement previous\nworks by analyzing the left and right Bregman-Moreau envelopes and by providing\nadditional asymptotic results. Several examples are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 06:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 22:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Such network\ndesigns can however be far from optimal when considering the actual workloads\nand traffic patterns which they serve. This insight led to the development of\ndemand-aware datacenter interconnects which can be reconfigured depending on\nthe workload.\n  Motivated by these trends, this paper initiates the algorithmic study of\ndemand-aware networks (DANs) designs, and in particular the design of\nbounded-degree networks. The inputs to the network design problem are a\ndiscrete communication request distribution, D, defined over communicating\npairs from the node set V , and a bound, d, on the maximum degree. In turn, our\nobjective is to design an (undirected) demand-aware network N = (V,E) of\nbounded-degree d, which provides short routing paths between frequently\ncommunicating nodes distributed across N. In particular, the designed network\nshould minimize the expected path length on N (with respect to D), which is a\nbasic measure of the efficiency of the network.\n  We show that this fundamental network design problem exhibits interesting\nconnections to several classic combinatorial problems and to information\ntheory. We derive a general lower bound based on the entropy of the\ncommunication pattern D, and present asymptotically optimal network-aware\ndesign algorithms for important distribution families, such as sparse\ndistributions and distributions of locally bounded doubling dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 06:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

FWIPS is\npreferred because it requires no additional infrastructure for deploying an\nFWIPS and achieving the position estimation by reusing the available WLAN and\nmobile devices, and capable of providing absolute position estimation. For\nfingerprinting based positioning (FbP), a model is created to provide reference\nvalues of observable features (e.g., signal strength from access point (AP)) as\na function of location during offline stage. One widely applied method to build\na complete and an accurate reference database (i.e. radio map (RM)) for FWIPS\nis carrying out a site survey throughout the region of interest (RoI). Along\nthe site survey, the readings of received signal strength (RSS) from all\nvisible APs at each reference point (RP) are collected. This site survey,\nhowever, is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in the case that the\nRoI is large (e.g., an airport or a big mall). This bottleneck hinders the wide\ncommercial applications of FWIPS (e.g., proximity promotions in a shopping\ncenter). To diminish the cost of site survey, we propose a probabilistic model,\nwhich combines fingerprinting based positioning (FbP) and RM generation based\non stochastic variational Bayesian inference (SVBI). This SVBI based position\nand RSS estimation has three properties: i) being able to predict the\ndistribution of the estimated position and RSS, ii) treating each observation\nof RSS at each RP as an example to learn for FbP and RM generation instead of\nusing the whole RM as an example, and iii) requiring only one time training of\nthe SVBI model for both localization and RSS estimation.

With a\nnon-linear reaction term of KPP-type, a phenomenon of front propagation has\nbeen proved in [9]. This behavior can be highlighted by considering a suitable\nhyperbolic limit of the kinetic equation, using a Hopf-Cole transform. It has\nbeen proved in [6, 8, 11] that the logarithm of the distribution function then\nconverges to the viscosity solution of a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\nThe hyperbolic scaling and the Hopf-Cole transform make the kinetic equation\nstiff. Thus, the numerical resolution of the problem is challenging, since the\nstandard numerical methods usually lead to high computational costs in these\nregimes. The Asymptotic Preserving (AP) schemes have been typically introduced\nto deal with this difficulty, since they are designed to be stable along the\ntransition to the macroscopic regime. The scheme we propose is adapted to the\nnon-linearity of the problem, enjoys a discrete maximum principle and solves\nthe limit equation in the sense of viscosity. It is based on a dedicated\nmicro-macro decomposition, attached to the Hopf-Cole transform.

A key objective in MCS is\nto efficiently schedule mobile users to perform multiple sensing tasks. Prior\nwork mainly focused on interactions between the task-layer and the user-layer,\nwithout considering tasks' similar data requirements and users' heterogeneous\nsensing capabilities. In this work, we propose a three-layer data-centric MCS\nmodel by introducing a new data-layer between tasks and users, enable different\ntasks to reuse the same data items, hence effectively leverage both task\nsimilarities and user heterogeneities. We formulate a joint task selection and\nuser scheduling problem based on the new framework, aiming at maximizing social\nwelfare. We first analyze the centralized optimization problem with the\nstatistical information of tasks and users, and show the bound of the social\nwelfare gain due to data reuse. Then we consider the two-sided information\nasymmetry of selfish task-owners and users, and propose a decentralized market\nmechanism for achieving the centralized social optimality. In particular,\nconsidering the NP-hardness of the optimization, we propose a truthful\ntwo-sided randomized auction mechanism that ensures computational efficiency\nand a close-to-optimal performance.

In nanocatalysis the nanoparticles can undergo\noxidation or reduction in situ, and thus the redox species are not what are\nobserved before and after reactions. We have used the novel environmental\nscanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) with 0.1 nm resolution in\nsystematic studies of complex dynamic oxidation and reduction mechanisms of\ncopper nanoparticles. The oxidation of copper has previously been reported to\nbe dependent on its crystallography and its interaction with the substrate. By\nfollowing the dynamic oxidation process in situ, in real time, with high-angle\nannular dark-field imaging in the ESTEM, we use conditions ideal to track the\noxidation front as it progresses across a copper nanoparticle by following the\nchanges in the atomic number (z) contrast with time. The oxidation occurs via\nthe nucleation of the oxide phase (Cu2O) from one area of the nanoparticle\nwhich then progresses unidirectionally across the particle, with the Cu-to-Cu2O\ninterface having a relationship of Cu{111} parallel to Cu2O{111}. The oxidation\nkinetics are related to the temperature and oxygen pressure. When the process\nis reversed in hydrogen, the reduction process is observed to be similar to the\noxidation, with the same crystallographic relationship between the two phases.\nThe dynamic observations provide unique insights into redox mechanisms which\nare important to understanding and controlling the oxidation and reduction of\ncopper-based nanoparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 09:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

Here we present a\nstudy on double coronal sources observed in both HXR and microwave regimes,\nrevealing new characteristics distinct from earlier reports. This event is\nassociated with a footpoint-occulted X1.3-class flare (25 April 2014, starting\nat 00:17 UT) and a coronal mass ejection that are likely triggered by the\nmagnetic breakout process, with the lower source extending upward from the top\nof the partially-occulted flare loops and the upper source co-incident with\nrapidly squeezing-in side lobes (at a speed of ~250 km/s on both sides). The\nupper source can be identified at energies as high as 70-100 keV. The X-ray\nupper source is characterized by flux curves different from the lower source, a\nweak energy dependence of projected centroid altitude above 20 keV, a shorter\nduration and a HXR photon spectrum slightly-harder than those of the lower\nsource. In addition, the microwave emission at 34 GHz also exhibits a similar\ndouble source structure and the microwave spectra at both sources are in line\nwith gyro-synchrotron emission given by non- thermal energetic electrons. These\nobservations, especially the co-incidence of the very-fast squeezing-in motion\nof side lobes and the upper source, indicate that the upper source is\nassociated with (possibly caused by) this fast motion of arcades. This sheds\nnew lights on the origin of the corona double-source structure observed in both\nHXRs and microwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 10:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Existing analytic models are able to reproduce\nspatially unresolved microstructure such as the iridescent appearance of\ncompact disks and similar materials.

In this paper we explore the properties of the mass\ndistribution of giant planet companions to solar-type stars, in a quest for\nclues about their formation process. With this goal in mind we studied, with\nthe help of standard statistical tests, the mass distribution of giant planets\nusing data from the exoplanet.eu catalog and the SWEET-Cat database of stellar\nparameters for stars with planets. We show that the mass distribution of giant\nplanet companions is likely to present more than one population with a change\nin regime around 4\\,M$_{Jup}$. Above this value host stars tend to be more\nmetal poor and more massive and have [Fe/H] distributions that are\nstatistically similar to those observed in field stars of similar mass. On the\nother hand, stars that host planets below this limit show the well-known\nmetallicity-giant planet frequency correlation. We discuss these results in\nlight of various planet formation models and explore the implications they may\nhave on our understanding of the formation of giant planets. In particular, we\ndiscuss the possibility that the existence of two separate populations of giant\nplanets indicates that two different processes of formation are at play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 11:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Yet, real incommensurate lattices come into contact in two\ndimensions ($2D$), at finite temperature, generally developing a mutual\nNovaco-McTague misalignment, conditions in which the existence of a sharp\ntransition is not clear. Using a model inspired by colloid monolayers in an\noptical lattice as a test $2D$ case, simulations show a sharp Aubry transition\nbetween an unpinned and a pinned phase as a function of corrugation. Unlike\n$1D$, the $2D$ transition is now of first order, and, importantly, remains well\ndefined at $T>0$. It is heavily structural, with a local rotation of moir\\'e\npattern domains from the nonzero initial Novaco-McTague equilibrium angle to\nnearly zero. In the temperature ($T$) -- corrugation strength ($W_0$) plane,\nthe thermodynamical coexistence line between the unpinned and the pinned phases\nis strongly oblique, showing that the former has the largest entropy. This\nfirst-order Aubry line terminates with a novel critical point $T=T_c$, marked\nby a susceptibility peak. The expected static sliding friction upswing between\nthe unpinned and the pinned phase decreases and disappears upon heating from\n$T=0$ to $T=T_c$. The experimental pursuit of this novel scenario is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 12:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Optimizing queries in such scenarios is\nparticularly challenging not only because of (i) the large variety of possible\nquery execution plans that correctly answer the query but also because (ii)\nthere is only limited access to statistics about schema and instance data of\nremote sources. To overcome these challenges, most federated query engines rely\non heuristics to reduce the space of possible query execution plans or on\ndynamic programming strategies to produce optimal plans. Nevertheless, these\nplans may still exhibit a high number of intermediate results or high execution\ntimes because of heuristics and inaccurate cost estimations. In this paper, we\npresent Odyssey, an approach that uses statistics that allow for a more\naccurate cost estimation for federated queries and therefore enables Odyssey to\nproduce better query execution plans. Our experimental results show that\nOdyssey produces query execution plans that are better in terms of data\ntransfer and execution time than state-of-the-art optimizers.

However, by using estimation theory, it is possible to obtain, under\ncertain limitations, some information on its dynamics. The quantum-speed-limit\n(QSL) theory was originally used to estimate the shortest time in which a\nHamiltonian drives an initial state to a final one for a given fidelity. Using\nthe QSL theory in a slightly different way, we are able to estimate the running\ntime of a given quantum process. For that purpose, we impose the saturation of\nthe Anandan-Aharonov bound in a rotating frame of reference where the state of\nthe system travels slower than in the original frame (laboratory frame).\nThrough this procedure it is possible to estimate the actual evolution time in\nthe laboratory frame of reference with good accuracy when compared to previous\nmethods. Our method is tested successfully to predict the time spent in the\nevolution of nuclear spins 1/2 and 3/2 in NMR systems. We find that the\nestimated time according to our method is better than previous approaches by up\nto four orders of magnitude. One disadvantage of our method is that we need to\nsolve a number of transcendental equations, which increases with the system\ndimension and parameter discretization used to solve such equations\nnumerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 13:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 19:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

We present\na convex quadratic programming relaxation which is provably stronger than both\nDS and spectral relaxations, with the same scalability as the DS relaxation.\nThe derivation of the relaxation also naturally suggests a projection method\nfor achieving meaningful integer solutions which improves upon the standard\nclosest-permutation projection.

Our algorithms\noperate in a very strong fault model: we require self-stabilisation, i.e., the\ninitial state of the system may be arbitrary, and there can be up to $f<n/3$\nongoing Byzantine faults, i.e., nodes that deviate from the protocol in an\narbitrary manner. Furthermore, we assume that the local clocks of the nodes may\nprogress at different speeds (clock drift) and communication has bounded delay.\nIn this model, we study the pulse synchronisation problem, where the task is to\nguarantee that eventually all correct nodes generate well-separated local pulse\nevents (i.e., unlabelled logical clock ticks) in a synchronised manner.\n  Compared to prior work, we achieve exponential improvements in stabilisation\ntime and the number of communicated bits, and give the first sublinear-time\nalgorithm for the problem:\n  - In the deterministic setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in\ntime $\\Theta(f)$ and have each node broadcast $\\Theta(f \\log f)$ bits per time\nunit.

The interaction model infers the velocity of each agent based\non the spatial orientation of other agents in his vicinity. During prediction,\nour approach infers the goal of the agent from its past trajectory and uses the\nlearned model to predict its future trajectory.

The baseline LSST\nsurvey approach is designed to make only two visits to a given field in a given\nnight, leading to two possible NEO detections per night. These nightly pairs\nmust be linked across nights to derive orbits of moving objects. However, the\npresence of false detections in the data stream leads to the possibility of\nhigh rates of false tracklets, and the ensuing risk that the resulting orbit\ncatalog may be contaminated by false orbits. To understand the challenges\nstemming from a two-visit-per-night cadence, we conducted high-fidelity linkage\ntests on a full-density simulated LSST detection stream. We also sought to\nquantify the overall performance of LSST as an NEO discovery system under the\nhypothesis that detections from the baseline cadence can be successfully\nlinked. Our simulations revealed that in 10 years LSST would catalog ~60% of\nNEOs with absolute magnitude H<22, which is a proxy for 140m and larger\nobjects. This results neglects linking losses and the contribution of any other\nNEO surveys. Including our worst-case linking efficiency we reach a overall\nperformance assessment of 55% completeness of NEOs with H<22. We estimate that\nsurvey mis-modeling could account for systematic errors of up to 5%. We find\nthat restricting the evaluation metric to so-called Potentially Hazardous\nAsteroids (PHAs) increases the completeness by 3-4%, and that including the\nbenefits of past and expected future NEO survey activity increases completeness\nat the end of the baseline LSST survey by 15-20%. Assembling these results\nleads to a projection that by the end of the baseline LSST survey the NEO\ncatalog will be 80+/-5% complete for PHAs with H < 22.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 15:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

We aim to study a small sample of galaxy groups that look promising as\npossible sources of intergalactic magnetic fields; for example data from radio\nsurveys suggest that most of the radio emission is due to extended, diffuse\nstructures in and out of the galaxies.

We study these\nproperties for the class of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, which is a\ngeneral framework for studying many important families of groups, including\nmapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, most 3-manifold\ngroups, and many others. A group that admits an acylindrical action on a\nhyperbolic space may admit many such actions on different hyperbolic spaces, so\nit is natural to search for a \"best\" one. The set of all cobounded acylindrical\nactions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure; in this paper we\nprove that all hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is\nthe largest in this poset. The action we construct is also universal in the\nsense that every element which acts loxodromically in some acylindrical action\non a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases of this result are\nthemselves new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that\nright-angled Coxeter groups admit universal acylindrical actions. The notion of\nquasigeodesic stability of subgroups provides a natural analogue of\nquasiconvexity outside the context of hyperbolic groups. We provide a complete\nclassification of stable subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups,\ngeneralizing and extending results that are known for mapping class groups and\nright-angled Artin groups. We also provide a characterization of contracting\nquasigeodesics; interestingly, in this generality the proof is much simpler\nthan in the special cases where it was already known.

More recently, advances in deep\nlearning have enabled depth estimation via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n[3], but training requires a large image dataset with ground truth depths.\nInspired by [4], we propose a deep learning framework for surgical scene depth\nestimation using self-supervision for scalable data acquisition. Our framework\nconsists of an autoencoder for depth prediction, and a differentiable spatial\ntransformer for training the autoencoder on stereo image pairs without ground\ntruth depths. Validation was conducted on stereo videos collected in robotic\npartial nephrectomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 11:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

In spectrum sensing, this limit calls for an analog\nfront-end that can sweep different bands quickly, in order to use the available\nspectrum opportunistically. In this paper we propose a new framework that\nallows to optimize a sub-Nyquist sampling front-end to combine the benefits of\noptimum sequential sensing with those of Compressive Spectrum Sensing (CSS).\nThe sensing strategy we propose is formulated as a sequential utility\noptimization problem. The utility function decreases linearly with the number\nof measurements (accrued to make a decision) and increases as a function of the\nsignal components binary states. The optimization selects the best linear\ncombinations of sub-bands to mix, in order to accrue maximum utility. The\nstructure of the utility represents the trade-off between exploration,\nexploitation and risk of making an error, that is characteristic of the\nspectrum sensing problem. We first present the analog front-end architecture,\nand then map the measurement model into the abstract optimization problem\nproposed, and analyzed, in the remainder of the paper. We characterize the\noptimal policy under constraints on the sensing matrix and derive the\napproximation factor of the greedy approach. Numerical simulations showcase the\nbenefits of combining opportunistic spectrum sensing with sub-Nyquist sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 21:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 14:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

This optimization problem is NP-hard. In\naddition, due to the incomplete CSI, the exact expression of UEs' rate\nexpression is intractable.
