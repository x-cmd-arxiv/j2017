With this decomposition, the requirement of a small enough residual\nin the iterative solver can be removed, consequently, this allows to exchange\nstability for efficiency. This decomposition transfers any residual occurring\nin the implicit equation of the implicit-step into the explicit part of the\ndecomposition. By balancing the residual, the accuracy of the local truncation\nerror of the time-stepping method becomes independent from the accuracy by\nwhich the implicit equation is solved. In order to balance the residual, the\noriginal IMEX decomposition is adjusted after the iterative solver has been\nstopped. For this to work, the traditional IMEX time-stepping algorithm needs\nto be changed. We call this new method the shortcut-IMEX (SIMEX). SIMEX can\ngain computational efficiency by exploring the trade-off between the\ncomputational effort placed in solving the implicit equation and the size of\nthe numerically stable time-step. Typically, increasing the number of solver\niterations increases the largest stable step-size. Both multi-step and\nRunge-Kutta (RK) methods are suitable for use with SIMEX. Here, we show the\nefficiency of a SIMEX-RK method in overcoming parabolic stiffness by applying\nit to a nonlinear reaction-advection-diffusion equation. In order to define a\nstability region for SIMEX, a region in the complex plane is depicted by\napplying SIMEX to a suitable PDE model containing diffusion and dispersion.

The main finding is that the Tb compound, known to order\nantiferromagnetically below (T_N=) 22 K, shows glassy characteristics at lower\ntemperatures (<15K), thus characterizing this compound as a re-entrant\nspin-glass. The data reveal that glassy phase is quite complex and is of a\ncluster type. Since the glassy behavior was not seen for the Gd analogue in the\npast literature, this finding for the Tb compound emphasizes that this kagome\nfamily could provide an opportunity to explore the role of higher order (such\nas quadrupole) in bringing out magnetic frustration. Additional findings\nreported here for this compound are: (i) The temperature dependence of magnetic\nsusceptibility and electrical resistivity in the range 12 - 20 K are found to\nbe hysteretic leading to a magnetic phase in this temperature range, mimicking\ndisorder-induced first-order magnetic phase-transition. (ii) Features\nattributable to an interesting magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in the\nmagnetoresistance in zero field, after cycling across metamagnetic transition\nfields, are observed.

For example it can perform tasks like \"putting exactly\nthose eyeglasses from image A on the nose of the person in image B\". Usage of\nexemplar images allows more precise specification of desired modifications and\nimproves the diversity of conditional image generation. However, previous\nmethods that rely on feature space operations, require paired data and/or\nappearance models for training or disentangling objects from background. In\nthis work, we propose a model that can learn object transfiguration from two\nunpaired sets of images: one set containing images that \"have\" that kind of\nobject, and the other set being the opposite, with the mild constraint that the\nobjects be located approximately at the same place. For example, the training\ndata can be one set of reference face images that have eyeglasses, and another\nset of images that have not, both of which spatially aligned by face landmarks.\nDespite the weak 0/1 labels, our model can learn an \"eyeglasses\" subspace that\ncontain multiple representatives of different types of glasses. Consequently,\nwe can perform fine-grained control of generated images, like swapping the\nglasses in two images by swapping the projected components in the \"eyeglasses\"\nsubspace, to create novel images of people wearing eyeglasses.\n  Overall, our deterministic generative model learns disentangled attribute\nsubspaces from weakly labeled data by adversarial training. Experiments on\nCelebA and Multi-PIE datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model\non real world data, in generating images with specified eyeglasses, smiling,\nhair styles, and lighting conditions etc. The code is available online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 08:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Advances in Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) makes it possible\nto use the information from geographical distant location to improve power\nsystem dynamics and performances. A speed deviation based Wide-Area Power\nSystem Stabilizer (WAPSS) is known to be effective in damping inter-area modes.\nHowever, the involvement of wide-area signals gives rise to the problem of\ntime-delay, which may degrade the system performance. In general, time-stamped\nsynchronized signals from Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) are used for WAPSS, in\nwhich delays are introduced in both local and remote signals.

This\nbehaviour was previously interpreted as the signature of an exceptionally\nstrong, quadrupole-dominated surface magnetic field geometry. We studied the\nmagnetic field structure and chemical abundance distributions of HR5624 with\nthe aim to verify the unusual quadrupolar nature of its magnetic field and to\ninvestigate correlations between the field topology and chemical spots. We\nanalysed high resolution, time series Stokes parameter spectra of HR5624 with\nthe help of a magnetic Doppler imaging inversion code based on detailed\npolarised radiative transfer modelling of the line profiles. Our magnetic\nDoppler inversions reveal that the field structure of HR5624 is considerably\nsimpler and the field strength is much lower than proposed by previous studies.\nWe find a maximum local field strength of 12 kG and a mean field strength of 4\nkG. Our model implies that overall large-scale field topology of HR5624 is\nbetter described as a distorted, asymmetric dipole. The chemical abundance maps\nof Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Nd obtained in our study are characterised by\nlarge-scale, high-contrast abundance patterns. These structures correlate\nweakly with the magnetic field geometry and show no distinct element\nconcentrations in the horizontal field regions predicted by theoretical atomic\ndiffusion calculations. We conclude that the surface magnetic field topology of\nHR5624 is not as unusual as previously proposed.

The key element of such instrument\nis a dispersive and filtering unit consisting of two narrowband volume-phase\nholographic gratings. Each of them provides high diffraction efficiency in a\nrelatively narrow spectral range of a few tens of nanometers. Besides, the\nposition of this working band is highly dependent on the angle of incidence. So\nwe propose to use a couple of such gratings to implement the two operational\nmodes. The gratings are mounted in a collimated beam one after another. In the\nspectroscopic mode the gratings are turned on such angle that the diffraction\nefficiency curves coincide, thus the beams diffracted on the first grating are\ndiffracted twice on the second one and a high-dispersion spectrum in a narrow\nrange is formed. If the collimating and camera lenses are corrected for a wide\nfield it is possible to use a long slit and register the spectra from its\ndifferent points separately. In the imaging mode the gratings are turned to\nsuch angle that the efficiency curves intersect in a very narrow wavelength\nrange. So the beams diffracted on the first grating are filtered out by the\nsecond one except of the spectral component, which forms the image. In this\ncase the instrument works without slit diaphragm on the entrance. We provide an\nexample design to illustrate the proposed concept. This optical scheme works in\nthe region around 656 nm with F/# of 6.3. In the spectroscopic mode it provides\na spectrum for the region from 641 to 671 nm with reciprocal linear dispersion\nof 1.4 nm/mm and the spectral resolving power higher than 14000. In the imaging\nmode it covers linear 12mm x 12mm field of view with spatial resolution of\n15-30 lines/mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 14:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

We establish by\ngraphical and statistical tests that while the IT sector of India has a strong\nassociation with DJIA index and the Dollar to Rupee exchange rate, the Indian\nCG sector exhibits a strong association with the NIFTY index. We contend that\nthese observations corroborate our hypotheses that the Indian IT sector is\nstrongly coupled with the world economy whereas the CG sector of India reflects\ninternal economic growth of India. We also present several models of regression\nbetween the time series which exhibit strong association among them. The\neffectiveness of these models have been demonstrated by very low values of\ntheir forecasting errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 12:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We have applied our proposed framework on eight well known mutual\nfunds of varying styles in the Indian financial market to check the consistency\nbetween their fund style and actual fund composition, and have obtained\nextensive results from our experiments. A detailed analysis of the results has\nshown that while in majority of the cases the actual allocations of funds are\nconsistent with the corresponding fund styles, there have been some notable\ndeviations too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 12:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

We recorded electrical signals\nfrom different plants by exposing them to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Ozone (O3)\nand Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) under laboratory conditions. After applying\npre-processing techniques such as filtering and drift removal, we extracted few\nstatistical features from the acquired plant electrical signals. Using these\nfeatures, combined with different classification algorithms, we used a decision\ntree based multi-class classification strategy to identify the three different\nexternal chemical stimuli. We here present our exploration to obtain the\noptimum set of ranked feature and classifier combination that can separate a\nparticular chemical stimulus from the incoming stream of plant electrical\nsignals. The paper also reports an exhaustive comparison of similar feature\nbased classification using the filtered and the raw plant signals, containing\nthe high frequency stochastic part and also the low frequency trends present in\nit, as two different cases for feature extraction. The work, presented in this\npaper opens up new possibilities for using plant electrical signals to monitor\nand detect other environmental stimuli apart from NaCl, O3 and H2SO4 in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}
