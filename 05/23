Although several advances have been reported in\nthe recent years for these tasks, the estimated information is often imprecise\nparticularly near depth discontinuities or creases. Studies have however shown\nthat precisely such depth edges carry critical cues for the perception of\nshape, and play important roles in tasks like depth-based segmentation or\nforeground selection. Unfortunately, the currently extracted channels often\ncarry conflicting signals, making it difficult for subsequent applications to\neffectively use them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of obtaining\nhigh-precision depth edges (i.e., depth contours and creases) by jointly\nanalyzing such unreliable information channels. We propose DepthCut, a\ndata-driven fusion of the channels using a convolutional neural network trained\non a large dataset with known depth.

In order to further assess this expectation, we study here how\nessentiality of a gene is connected with its degree of conservation among\nseveral unrelated bacterial species, each one characterised by its own codon\nusage bias. Confirming previous results on E. coli, we show the existence of a\nuniversal exponential relation between gene essentiality and conservation in\nbacteria.

However,\nvariations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet\nformation and evolution. Here, we present a new code, HERCULES, that solves for\nthe equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping\nconstant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of\nmorphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond\nwhich the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital\nvelocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a\nstructure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected\nto a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and\nmodels of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are\nsubstantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected\nangular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies\nwill exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot,\nrotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation\nand the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of\npost-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion,\ncore formation and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms\nfor satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for\nterrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 17:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

The use of\ntracers, namely massless particles that are advected with the flow, represents\na simple and effective way to solve this problem. Yet, the use of tracers in\nnumerical relativity is far from being settled and several issues, such as the\nimpact of different placements in time and space of the tracers, or the\nrelation between the placement and the description of the underlying fluid,\nhave not yet been addressed. In this paper we present the first detailed\ndiscussion of the use tracers in numerical-relativity simulations focussing on\nboth unbound material -- such as the one leading to r-process nucleosynthesis\nin binary mergers of neutron stars -- and on bound material -- such as the one\nin the core of the object produced from the merger of two neutron stars. In\nparticular, when interested in unbound matter, we have evaluated four different\nplacement schemes that could be used to initially distribute the tracers and\nhow well their predictions match those obtained when using information from the\nactual fluid flow. Countering our naive expectations, we found that the most\neffective method does not rely on the rest-mass density distribution nor on the\nfluid that is unbound, but simply distributes tracers uniformly in rest-mass\ndensity. This prescription leads to the closest matching with the information\nobtained from the hydrodynamical solution. When considering bound matter, we\ndemonstrate that tracers can provide insight into the fine details of the fluid\nmotion as they can be used to track the evolution of fluid elements or to\ncalculate the variation of quantities that are conserved along streamlines of\nadiabatic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 17:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 13:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Field winding can transport angular momentum\neffectively even when the toroidal field is limited by kinking. Magnetic\nhelicity is pumped into a growing radiative layer from an adjacent convective\nenvelope (or core). The receding convective envelope that forms during the\nearly accretion phase of a massive star is the dominant source of helicity in\nits core, yielding a $\\sim 10^{13}$ G polar magnetic field in a collapsed\nneutron star (NS) remnant.

We also supply a direct detection package that\nmodels a large range of direct detection experiments (DDcalc), and provides the\ncorresponding likelihoods for arbitrary combinations of spin-independent and\nspin-dependent scattering processes. Finally, we provide custom relic density\nroutines along with interfaces to DarkSUSY, micrOMEGAs, and the neutrino\ntelescope likelihood package nuLike. DarkBit is written in the framework of the\nGlobal And Modular Beyond the Standard Model Inference Tool (GAMBIT), providing\nseamless integration into a comprehensive statistical fitting framework that\nallows users to explore new models with both particle and astrophysics\nconstraints, and a consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties. In this\npaper we describe its main functionality, provide a guide to getting started\nquickly, and show illustrative examples for results obtained with DarkBit (both\nas a standalone tool and as a GAMBIT module). This includes a quantitative\ncomparison between two of the main dark matter codes (DarkSUSY and micrOMEGAs),\nand application of DarkBit's advanced direct and indirect detection routines to\na simple effective dark matter model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 18:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 01:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Hence, an understanding\nof the detailed dynamics driving the nonlinear saturation of the WI is\nimportant. This work considers the nonlinear saturation of the WI when\ncounter-streaming populations of initially unmagnetized electrons are perturbed\nby a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the direction of streaming.\nPrevious works have found magnetic trapping to be important and connected\nelectron skin depth spatial scales to the nonlinear saturation of the WI. 2\nResults presented in this work are consistent with these findings for a\nhigh-temperature case. However, using a high-order continuum kinetic simulation\ntool, this work demonstrates that, when the electron populations are colder, a\nsignificant electrostatic potential develops that works with the magnetic field\nto create potential wells. The electrostatic field develops due to transverse\nflows induced by the WI, and in some cases is strengthened by a secondary\ninstability.

If a macromolecule is modeled as an\nopen system, that is, it is subjected to an external energy supply and is in\ncontact with a thermal bath to dissipate the excess energy, the internal\nnonlinear couplings among the normal modes make the system undergo a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition when the energy input rate exceeds a threshold\nvalue. This transition takes place between a state where the energy is\nincoherently distributed among the normal modes, to a state where the input\nenergy is channeled into the lowest frequency mode entailing a coherent\noscillation of the entire molecule. The model put forward in the present work\nis derived as the classical counterpart of a quantum model proposed long time\nago by H.

The complex nature of a stock market challenges us on making a\nreliable prediction of its future movements. In this paper, we aim at building\na new method to forecast the future movements of Standard & Poor's 500 Index\n(S&P 500) by constructing time-series complex networks of S&P 500 underlying\ncompanies by connecting them with links whose weights are given by the mutual\ninformation of 60-minute price movements of the pairs of the companies with the\nconsecutive 5,340 minutes price records. We showed that the changes in the\nstrength distributions of the networks provide an important information on the\nnetwork's future movements. We built several metrics using the strength\ndistributions and network measurements such as centrality, and we combined the\nbest two predictors by performing a linear combination. We found that the\ncombined predictor and the changes in S&P 500 show a quadratic relationship,\nand it allows us to predict the amplitude of the one step future change in S&P\n500. The result showed significant fluctuations in S&P 500 Index when the\ncombined predictor was high. In terms of making the actual index predictions,\nwe built ARIMA models. We found that adding the network measurements into the\nARIMA models improves the model accuracy.

Without having any information on the underlying cardinal\nutilities, arguing about fairness of allocation requires extending the ordinal\nitem ranking to ordinal bundle ranking. The most commonly used such extension\nis stochastic dominance (SD), where a bundle X is preferred over a bundle Y if\nits score is better according to all additive score functions. SD is a very\nconservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while\nmany allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on\nthe underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference\nbetween two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at\nthe bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call\ndiminishing differences (DD), where X is preferred over Y if its score is\nbetter according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption.\nWe give a full characterization of allocations that are\nnecessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption.\nBased on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for\nfinding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation if it exists.

By allowing\nconcurrent channel probing and data transmission, our scheme can potentially\nachieve a higher throughput compared to traditional schemes using Half-duplex\nradios.

This latter approach identifies an integral over the\ncontinuum of normalizable states and a sum over an infinite tower of lighter\ndiscrete states, whose contribution we extract by analytically continuing\nstandard results to our HHLL setting. The sum over this tower reproduces the\nsum over those complex saddlepoints of the path integral that contribute to the\ncorrelator. Our path integral computations reveal that when the two light\noperators are inserted at equal time in radial quantization, the leading-order\nHHLL correlator is independent of their separation, and more generally that at\nthis order there is no short-distance singularity as the two light operators\napproach each other. The conformal block expansion likewise shows that in the\ndiscrete sum short-distance singularities are indeed absent for all\nintermediate states that contribute. In particular, the Virasoro vacuum block,\nwhich would have been singular at short distances, is not exchanged. The\nseparation-independence of equal-time correlators is due to cancelations\nbetween the discrete contributions.

The credit assignment\nproblem, i.e. determining the local contribution of each synapse to the\nnetwork's global output error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically\nplausible local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks\nimplementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of number of\nneurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from rate models. Finally,\nthese networks should be robust to noise and neural deaths in order to sustain\nthese representations in the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We\napproach this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking\nnetworks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control theory. Local learning rules are\nensured by feeding back into the network its own error, resulting in a synaptic\nplasticity rule depending solely on presynaptic inputs and post-synaptic\nfeedback. The spiking efficiency and robustness of the network are guaranteed\nby maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory balance, ensuring that each spike\nrepresents a local projection of the global output error and minimizes a loss\nfunction. The resulting networks can learn to implement complex dynamics with\nvery small numbers of neurons and spikes, exhibit the same spike train\nvariability as observed experimentally, and are extremely robust to noise and\nneuronal loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 22:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 00:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Each\nthread learns a local model in addition to a model combiner, which allows local\nmodels to be combined to produce the same result as what a sequential SGD would\nhave produced. This paper evaluates SYMSGD's accuracy and performance on 6\ndatasets on a shared-memory machine shows upto 11x speedup over our heavily\noptimized sequential baseline on 16 cores and 2.2x, on average, faster than\nHOGWILD!.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 22:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical\nsystems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a\nrecurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by\nthe credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent network, e.g. the\ncontribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined\nbased only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools\nfrom adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that\nneural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic\nplasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established\nneural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both\ntheir activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons\nshould maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the\ncircuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and\nproduce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally.\nYet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and\nrobust computation at the population level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 22:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

It facilitates optimal spatial prediction\n(kriging) on the most commonly used manifolds (in Euclidean space and on the\nsurface of the sphere), for both spatial and spatio-temporal fields. It differs\nfrom many of the packages for spatial modelling and prediction by avoiding\nstationary and isotropic covariance and variogram models, instead constructing\na spatial random effects (SRE) model on a fine-resolution discretised spatial\ndomain. The discrete element is known as a basic areal unit (BAU), whose\nintroduction in the software leads to several practical advantages. The\nsoftware can be used to (i) integrate multiple observations with different\nsupports with relative ease; (ii) obtain exact predictions at millions of\nprediction locations (without conditional simulation); and (iii) distinguish\nbetween measurement error and fine-scale variation at the resolution of the\nBAU, thereby allowing for reliable uncertainty quantification. The temporal\ncomponent is included by adding another dimension. A key component of the SRE\nmodel is the specification of spatial or spatio-temporal basis functions; in\nthe package, they can be generated automatically or by the user. The package\nalso offers automatic BAU construction, an expectation-maximisation (EM)\nalgorithm for parameter estimation, and functionality for prediction over any\nuser-specified polygons or BAUs. Use of the package is illustrated on several\nspatial and spatio-temporal datasets, and its predictions and the model it\nimplements are extensively compared to others commonly used for spatial\nprediction and modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 07:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 05:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 22:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

Although most recent\naction recognition methods are based on Recurrent Neural Networks which present\noutstanding performance, one of the shortcomings of these methods is the\ntendency to overemphasize the temporal information. Since 3D convolutional\nneural network(3D CNN) is a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from\nboth spatial and temporal dimensions through capturing the correlations between\nthree dimensional signals, this paper proposes a novel two-stream model using\n3D CNN. To our best knowledge, this is the first application of 3D CNN in\nskeleton-based action recognition. Our method consists of three stages. First,\nskeleton joints are mapped into a 3D coordinate space and then encoding the\nspatial and temporal information, respectively. Second, 3D CNN models are\nseperately adopted to extract deep features from two streams. Third, to enhance\nthe ability of deep features to capture global relationships, we extend every\nstream into multitemporal version. Extensive experiments on the SmartHome\ndataset and the large-scale NTU RGB-D dataset demonstrate that our method\noutperforms most of RNN-based methods, which verify the complementary property\nbetween spatial and temporal information and the robustness to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 07:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 11:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

We consider the evolution of solid cores embedded in evolving\nviscous discs that undergo gaseous envelope accretion in situ with orbital\nradii in the range $0.1-10\\rm au$. Additionally, we determine the long-term\nevolution of the planets that had no runaway gas accretion phase after disc\ndispersal. We find: (i) Planets with $5 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ cores never undergo\nrunaway accretion. The most massive envelope contained $2.8 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$\nwith the planet orbiting at $10 \\rm au$. (ii) Accretion is more efficient onto\n$10 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ and $15 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ cores.

Rodlike particles were considered as linear $k$-mers of two mutually\nperpendicular orientations ($k_x$- and $k_y$-mers) on a square lattice.

The concentration of $k$-mers, $p$, was varied in the range from 0.1\nto the jamming concentration, $p_j$. By means of the Monte Carlo technique,\ntranslational diffusion of the $k$-mers was simulated as a random walk, while\nrotational diffusion was ignored. We demonstrated that the diffusion\ncoefficients are strongly anisotropic and nonlinearly concentration-dependent.\nFor sufficiently large concentrations (packing densities) and $k \\geq 6$, the\nsystem tends toward a well-organized steady state. Boundary conditions (BC)\npredetermine the final state of the system. When periodic BCs are applied along\nboth directions of the square lattice, the system tends to a steady state in\nthe form of diagonal stripes. The formation of stripe domains takes longer time\nthe larger the lattice size, and is observed only for concentrations above a\nparticular critical value. When insulating (zero flux) BCs are applied along\nboth directions of the square lattice, each kind of $k$-mer tries to completely\noccupy a half of the lattice divided by a diagonal, e.g., $k_x$-mers locate in\nthe upper left corner, while the $k_y$-mers are situated in the lower right\ncorner (\"yin-yang\" pattern). From time to time, regions built of $k_x$- and\n$k_y$-mers exchange their locations through irregular patterns. When mixed BCs\nare used (periodic BCs are applied along one direction whereas insulating BCs\nare applied along the other one), the system still tends to form the stripes,\nbut they are unstable and change their spatial orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 09:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Therefore, our new model is a direct generalization of the analytical\naccretion model introduced by E. Tejeda, P. A. Taylor, and J. C. Miller (2013).\nWe use our generalized model to analyze the influence of a net charge of the\nblack hole, which will in general be very small, on the accretion of plasma.\nWithin the assumptions of our model we demonstrate that already a vanishingly\nsmall charge of the black hole may in general still have a non-negligible\neffect on the motion of the plasma, as long as the electromagnetic field of the\nplasma is still negligible. Furthermore, we argue that the inner and outer\nedges of the forming accretion disc strongly depend on the charge of the\naccreted plasma. The resulting possible configurations of accretion discs are\nanalyzed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 10:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 17:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

Here we investigate a coupled nonlinear delay differential system\nmodeling theEl-Ni\\~no/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which arises\nthrough the strong coupling of the ocean-atmosphere system. In particular, we\nstudy the temporal patterns of the sea surface temperature anomaly of the two\nsub-regions. For identical sub-regions we typically observe a co-existence of\namplitude and oscillator death behavior for low delays, and heterogeneous\noscillations for high delays, when inter-region coupling is weak. For moderate\ninter-region coupling strengths one obtains homogeneous oscillations for\nsufficiently large delays and amplitude death for small delays. When the\ninter-region coupling strength is large, oscillations are suppressed\naltogether, implying that strongly coupled sub-regions do not exhibit ENSO-like\noscillations. Further we observe that larger strengths of self-delay coupling\nfavours oscillations, while oscillations die out when the delayed coupling is\nweak. This indicates again that delayed feedback, incorporating oceanic wave\ntransit effects, is the principal cause of oscillatory behaviour. So the effect\nof trapped ocean waves propagating in a basin with closed boundaries is crucial\nfor the emergence of ENSO. Further, we show how non-uniformity in delays, and\ndifference in the strengths of the self-delay coupling of the sub-regions,\naffect the rise of oscillations. Interestingly we find that larger delays and\nself-delay coupling strengths lead to oscillations, while strong inter-region\ncoupling kills oscillatory behaviour. Thus, we find that coupling sub-regions\nhas a very significant effect on the emergence of oscillations, and strong\ncoupling typically suppresses oscillations, while weak coupling of\nnon-identical sub-regions can induce oscillations, thereby favouring ENSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 10:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Gas temperatures are derived from line-width\ncomparisons, densities from the [S II] doublet ratio, and ionization parameter\nfrom H-alpha/[N II] ratio. Although doubly-peaked emission profiles are rarely\nfound, line asymmetries often imply multiple velocity components along the line\nof sight.

More and more we see that achieving universally\nsecure, private, and fair systems is practically impossible. We have seen for\nexample how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn about the\nexpected private training data; how the exploitation of additional data can\nreveal private information in the original one; and how what looks like\nunrelated features can teach us about each other. Confronted with this\nchallenge, in this paper we open a new line of research, where the security,\nprivacy, and fairness is learned and used in a closed environment. The goal is\nto ensure that a given entity (e.g., the company or the government), trusted to\ninfer certain information with our data, is blocked from inferring protected\ninformation from it. For example, a hospital might be allowed to produce\ndiagnosis on the patient (the positive task), without being able to infer the\ngender of the subject (negative task). Similarly, a company can guarantee that\ninternally it is not using the provided data for any undesired task, an\nimportant goal that is not contradicting the virtually impossible challenge of\nblocking everybody from the undesired task. We design a system that learns to\nsucceed on the positive task while simultaneously fail at the negative one, and\nillustrate this with challenging cases where the positive task is actually\nharder than the negative one being blocked. Fairness, to the information in the\nnegative task, is often automatically obtained as a result of this proposed\napproach. The particular framework and examples open the door to security,\nprivacy, and fairness in very important closed scenarios, ranging from private\ndata accumulation companies like social networks to law-enforcement and\nhospitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 11:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

When these high-speed magnetized plasmas along with the energetic\nparticles arrive at the Earth, they may interact with the magnetosphere and\nionosphere, and seriously affect the safety of human high-tech activities in\nouter space. The travel time of a CME to 1 AU is about 1-3 days, while\nenergetic particles from the eruptions arrive even earlier. An efficient\nforecast of these phenomena therefore requires a clear detection of CMEs/flares\nat the stage as early as possible. To estimate the possibility of an eruption\nleading to a CME/flare, we need to elucidate some fundamental but elusive\nprocesses including in particular the origin and structures of CMEs/flares.\nUnderstanding these processes can not only improve the prediction of the\noccurrence of CMEs/flares and their effects on geospace and the heliosphere but\nalso help understand the mass ejections and flares on other solar-type stars.\nThe main purpose of this review is to address the origin and early structures\nof CMEs/flares, from multi-wavelength observational perspective. First of all,\nwe start with the ongoing debate of whether the pre-eruptive configuration,\ni.e., a helical magnetic flux rope (MFR), of CMEs/flares exists before the\neruption and then emphatically introduce observational manifestations of the\nMFR.

In this paper, we\ndescribe the design of a hybrid neural network for logical learning that is\nsimilar to the human reasoning through the introduction of an auxiliary input,\nnamely the indicators, that act as the hints to suggest logical outcomes. We\ngenerate these indicators by digging into the hidden information buried\nunderneath the original training data for direct or indirect suggestions. We\nused the MNIST data to demonstrate the design and use of these indicators in a\nconvolutional neural network. We trained a series of such hybrid neural\nnetworks with variations of the indicators. Our results show that these hybrid\nneural networks are very robust in generating logical outcomes with inherently\nhigher prediction accuracy than the direct use of the original input and output\nin apparent models. Such improved predictability with reassured logical\nconfidence is obtained through the exhaustion of all possible indicators to\nrule out all illogical outcomes, which is not available in the apparent models.\nOur logical learning process can effectively cope with the unknown unknowns\nusing a full exploitation of all existing knowledge available for learning. The\ndesign and implementation of the hints, namely the indicators, become an\nessential part of artificial intelligence for logical learning.

In the MSSM, it is known that the presence of a charge conserving\nminimum for the tree-level Higgs potential precludes a deeper (global)\ncharge-breaking minimum. We find that the inclusion of radiative correction to\nthe potential does not alter the situation while a deeper charge-conserving\nminimum could arise, albeit with no major practical consequences. In the NMSSM\nscenario, a charge-breaking global minimum, with or without an accompanying\ncharge-conserving deeper minimum, could appear even with the tree-level Higgs\npotential thanks to the presence of a charge-neutral scalar state which\ntransforms as a singlet under the Standard Model gauge group. Use of the NMSSM\nHiggs potential that includes both quantum and thermal corrections and the\nrequirement of a viable (stable or long-lived) vacuum that breaks the\nelectroweak symmetry, along with its compatibility with the latest Higgs data,\nlead to nontrivial constraints on the NMSSM parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 12:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 11:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 10:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}

However, truncation favors short-term dependencies: the gradient estimate\nof truncated BPTT is biased, so that it does not benefit from the convergence\nguarantees from stochastic gradient theory. We introduce Anticipated Reweighted\nTruncated Backpropagation (ARTBP), an algorithm that keeps the computational\nbenefits of truncated BPTT, while providing unbiasedness. ARTBP works by using\nvariable truncation lengths together with carefully chosen compensation factors\nin the backpropagation equation. We check the viability of ARTBP on two tasks.\nFirst, a simple synthetic task where careful balancing of temporal dependencies\nat different scales is needed: truncated BPTT displays unreliable performance,\nand in worst case scenarios, divergence, while ARTBP converges reliably.\nSecond, on Penn Treebank character-level language modelling, ARTBP slightly\noutperforms truncated BPTT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 12:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The\nobjective of this paper is to review the actual status of both experimental and\ntheoretical investigations. Aiming at making this material accessible to a\nlarge variety of readers, including young students and researchers, I gave some\ndetails on the schematic models which are able to unveil the main features of\nchirality in nuclei. Also, since most formalisms use a rigid triaxial rotor for\nthe nuclear system's core, I devoted some space to the semi-classical\ndescription of the rigid triaxial as well as of the tilted triaxial rotor. In\norder to answer the question whether the chiral phenomenon is spread over the\nwhole nuclear chart and whether it is specific only to a certain type of\nnuclei, odd-odd, odd-even or even-even, the current results in the mass regions\nof $A\\sim 60,80,100,130,180,200$ are briefly described for all kinds of\nodd/even-odd/even systems. The chiral geometry is a sufficient condition for a\nsystem of proton-particle, neutron-hole and a triaxial rotor to have the\nelectromagnetic properties of chiral bands. In order to prove that such\ngeometry is not unique for generating magnetic bands with chiral features, I\npresented a mechanism for a new type of chiral bands.

There was indeed a \"crisis\" before the introduction\nof the holographic principle and entropic force in physics. The vacuum energy\nwas spent for the organization of new microstates during the entire life of the\nUniverse, but in the initial period of its evolution the vacuum energy (78\norders) were reduced more effectively by the vacuum condensates produced by\nphase transitions, because the Universe lost the high symmetry during its\nexpansion. Important problems of physics and cosmology can be solved if the\nquarks, leptons, and gauge bosons are composite particles. The dark matter,\npartially or all consisting of familon-type pseudo-Goldstone bosons with a mass\nof 10^{-5} - 10^{-3} eV, can be explained in the composite model. Three\ngenerations of elementary particles are absolutely necessary in this model. In\naddition, this model realizes three relativistic phase transitions in a medium\nof familons at different red shifts, forming a large-scale structure of dark\nmatter that was \"repeated\" by baryons. We predict the detection of dark matter\ndynamics, the detection of familons as dark matter particles, and the\ndevelopment of spectroscopy for dark medium due to the probable presence of\ndark atoms in it.

A particularly appealing framework\nhere is the simultaneous communication model whereby each machine constructs a\nsmall representative summary of its own data and one obtains an\napproximate/exact solution from the union of the representative summaries. If\nthe representative summaries needed for a problem are small, then this results\nin a communication-efficient and round-optimal protocol. While many fundamental\ngraph problems admit efficient solutions in this model, two prominent problems\nare notably absent from the list of successes, namely, the maximum matching\nproblem and the minimum vertex cover problem. Indeed, it was shown recently\nthat for both these problems, even achieving a polylog$(n)$ approximation\nrequires essentially sending the entire input graph from each machine.\n  The main insight of our work is that the intractability of matching and\nvertex cover in the simultaneous communication model is inherently connected to\nan adversarial partitioning of the underlying graph across machines. We show\nthat when the underlying graph is randomly partitioned across machines, both\nthese problems admit randomized composable coresets of size $\\widetilde{O}(n)$\nthat yield an $\\widetilde{O}(1)$-approximate solution.

By con- sidering two oppositely charged molecular species\nin watery solution, that is, Lysozyme protein and a fluorescent dye molecule\n(Alexa488), the diffusion coefficient of the dye has been measured by means of\nthe FCS technique at different values of the concentration of Lysozyme\nmolecules, that is, at different average distances between the oppositely\ncharged molecules. For the model consid- ered long-range interactions are\nbuilt-in as electrostatic forces, the action radius of which can be varied by\nchanging the ionic strength of the solution. The experimental outcomes clearly\nprove the detectability of long-range intermolecular interactions by means of\nthe FCS technique. Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a clear and\nunambiguous interpretation of the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 14:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

D-vine quantile regression\nprovides very flexible models, that enable accurate and fast predictions.\nMoreover, it automatically takes care of major issues of classical quantile\nregression, such as quantile crossing and interactions between the covariates.\nThe first approach keeps the parametric estimation of the D-vines, but modifies\nthe formulas to account for the discreteness.

This\nnaturally makes the Cygnus X complex a highly interesting source in neutrino\nastronomy, in particular concerning a possible detection with the IceCube\nNeutrino Observatory, which has a good view of the northern hemisphere. In this\npaper, we model the multiwavelength spectrum of the Cygnus, for the first time\nusing a broad data set from radio, MeV (COMPTEL), GeV (Fermi), TeV (Argo) and\n10s of TeV (Milagro) energies. The modeling is performed assuming a\nleptohadronic model. We solve the steady-state transport equation for leptons\nand hadrons injected homogeneously in the region and test the role of diffusive\ntransport and energy loss by radiation and interaction. The result shows that\ndiffusion loss plays a significant role in Cygnus X and always exceeds the\nadvection loss as well as almost all other loss processes.

C&R's claim essentially\nmeans that in any hidden variable theory that is compatible with\nquantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are\nindependent of these hidden variables. On closer inspection, however, the\ngenerality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an\nassumption called 'Freedom of Choice'.

Coupled with the fact that in most cases the PBE requires\nto be solved multiple times for a large number of system configurations, this\nposes great computational challenges to conventional numerical techniques. To\naccelerate such computations, we here present the reduced basis method (RBM)\nwhich greatly reduces this computational complexity by constructing a reduced\norder model of typically low dimension.

Most of\nthe metallicity determinations are based on optical line ratios. However, the\noptical spectral range is subject to dust extinction and, for high-z objects (z\n> 3), some of the lines used in optical metallicity diagnostics are shifted to\nwavelengths not accessible to ground based observatories. For this reason, we\nexplore metallicity diagnostics using far-infrared (IR) line ratios which can\nprovide a suitable alternative in such situations. To investigate these far-IR\nline ratios, we modeled the emission of a starburst with the photoionization\ncode CLOUDY. The most sensitive far-IR ratios to measure metallicities are the\n[OIII]52$\\mu$m and 88$\\mu$m to [NIII]57$\\mu$m ratios. We show that this ratio\nproduces robust metallicities in the presence of an AGN and is insensitive to\nchanges in the age of the ionizing stellar. Another metallicity sensitive ratio\nis the [OIII]88$\\mu$m/[NII]122$\\mu$m ratio, although it depends on the\nionization parameter. We propose various mid- and far-IR line ratios to break\nthis dependency. Finally, we apply these far-IR diagnostics to a sample of 19\nlocal ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) observed with Herschel and Spitzer. We\nfind that the gas-phase metallicity in these local ULIRGs is in the range 0.7 <\nZ_gas/Z_sun < 1.5, which corresponds to 8.5 < 12 + log (O/H) < 8.9. The\ninferred metallicities agree well with previous estimates for local ULIRGs and\nthis confirms that they lie below the local mass-metallicity relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 15:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Instead of local order\nparameters, topological phases are described by global topological invariants\nand are therefore robust against perturbations. A prominent example thereof is\nthe two-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect. It is characterized by the\nfirst Chern number which manifests in the quantized Hall response induced by an\nexternal electric field. Generalizing the quantum Hall effect to\nfour-dimensional systems leads to the appearance of a novel non-linear Hall\nresponse that is quantized as well, but described by a 4D topological invariant\n- the second Chern number. Here, we report on the first observation of a bulk\nresponse with intrinsic 4D topology and the measurement of the associated\nsecond Chern number.

Two contrasting conceptual\naccounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles\nprovide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here\nthe basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both\nsituated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural\nelongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,\nwhich require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes\nto build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for\nearly nervous systems. Here the coordination of activity across extended parts\nof a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of\n(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest\nproto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were\ninitially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the\npatterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present\ncomputational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random\nneural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can\ngenerate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding\nelongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result\nsupports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very\nfirst full neurons and nervous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 09:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

In this work the genetic algorithm code StructOpt was utilized to\nidentify groundstate cluster structures in 3C-SiC. The genetic algorithm was\nused to explore clusters of up to ~30 interstitials of C-only, Si-only, and\nSi-C mixtures embedded in the SiC lattice.

We show how the inclusion of features\nextracted from the network data representation improves the score obtained by a\nstandard, neural network-based classification algorithm; and additionally how\nthis combined approach can outperform a commercial fraud detection system in\nspecific operation niches. Beyond these specific results, this contribution\nrepresents a new example on how complex networks and data mining can be\nintegrated as complementary tools, with the former providing a view to data\nbeyond the capabilities of the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 19:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}
