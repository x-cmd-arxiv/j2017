Modern civilization depends on it for\nindustry production, human mobility, and comfortable living. However, many\ncritical technologies such as the 60 Hz transformers were developed at the\nbeginning of the 20th century and have changed very little since then.1 The\ntraditional unidirectional power from the generation to the customer through\nthe transmission-distribution grid has also changed nominally, but it no longer\nmeets the need of the 21st century market energy customers. On one hand, 128m\nUS residential customers pay $15B/per month for their utility bill, yet they\nhave no option to select their energy supplier. In a world of where many\ntraditional industries are transformed by digital Internet technology (Amazon,\nEbay, Uber, Airbnb), the traditional electric energy market is lagging\nsignificantly behind. A move towards a true digital grid is needed. Such a\ndigital grid requires a tight integration of the physical layer (energy and\npower) with digital and cyber information to allow an open and real time market\nakin to the world of e-commerce. Another major factor that is pushing for this\nradical transformation are the rapidly changing patterns in energy resources\nownership and load flow. Driven by the decreasing cost in distributed solar,\nenergy storage, electric vehicle, on site generation and microgrids, the high\npenetration of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) is shifting challenges\nsubstantially towards the edge of grid from the control point of view. The\nenvisioned Digital Grid must facilitate the open competition and open\ninnovation needed to accelerate of the adoption of new DER technologies while\nsatisfying challenges in grid stability, data explosion and cyber security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 17:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

We show that the viable\nparameters space identified by requiring no-ghost instabilities and positive\nsquared speeds of propagation does not change by performing a field\nredefinition, while the requirement of the avoidance of tachyonic instability\nmight instead be different. Therefore, we find interesting to associate to the\ngeneral modified gravity theory described in the effective field theory\nframework, a perturbation field which will inherit the whole properties of the\ntheory.

On this background we\nalso investigate the value of the speed of propagation and we find that there\nexist classes of theories which admit a non-vanishing speed of propagation,\neven among the Horndeski model, for which in literature it has previously been\nfound a zero speed.

In deriving the light\ncurves, we tested two sets of atmospheric models (Brott & Hauschildt 2005,\nCastelli & Kurucz 2003) and found no significant difference between the\nresulting mean magnitudes.

The results for\nthe Galactic RRL are consistent with trigonometric parallax measurements from\nGaia's first data release.

This can reduce the effectiveness of the method and\nincrease computational cost. Therefore grouping samples together to minimize\nthis divergence is paramount in making the method effective for challenging\ncomputational simulations. In this work, a new grouping approach based on a\nsurrogate for computational cost built up during the uncertainty propagation is\ndeveloped and applied to model diffusion problems where computational cost is\ndriven by the number of (preconditioned) linear solver iterations.

To\nthis end, we developed a set of statistical methods based on Gaussian\nconcentration graph models (GCGM) and Gaussian directed acyclic graph models\n(GDAGM) that adapt the existing theory to perform covariance model selection\n(GCGM) or DAG selection (GDAGM) to genome-wide prediction.

The dot induces ABSs in the SC nanowire which\nshow complex behavior as a function of Zeeman splitting and chemical potential,\nand the specific question is whether two such ABSs can come together forming a\ntopological MBS.

As the ability to miniaturize\ntransistors is coming to an end, there is increasing attention on new\napproaches to computation, including renewed enthusiasm around the potential of\nneural computation. This paper describes how recent advances in\nneurotechnologies, many of which have been aided by computing's rapid\nprogression over recent decades, are now reigniting this opportunity to bring\nneural computation insights into broader computing applications. As we\nunderstand more about the brain, our ability to motivate new computing\nparadigms with continue to progress. These new approaches to computing, which\nwe are already seeing in techniques such as deep learning and neuromorphic\nhardware, will themselves improve our ability to learn about the brain and\naccordingly can be projected to give rise to even further insights. This paper\nwill describe how this positive feedback has the potential to change the\ncomplexion of how computing sciences and neurosciences interact, and suggests\nthat the next form of exponential scaling in computing may emerge from our\nprogressive understanding of the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 22:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 14:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

Here we present an efficient\nmethod to properly impose periodic boundary conditions using a near-far\nsplitting scheme. The near-field contribution is directly calculated with the\nKIFMM method, while the far-field contribution is calculated with a\nmultipole-to-local (M2L) operator which is independent of the source and target\npoint distribution. The M2L operator is constructed with the far-field portion\nof the kernel function to generate the far-field contribution with the downward\nequivalent source points in KIFMM.

Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the\nenergy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC\nsystems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g.,\nEnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to\ndetermine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI).

When an amorphous layer is attached to the surface,\nthe incident wave packet will be absorbed by the amorphous region, and results\nin quite diffusive reflection.

In this work, we novelly use the\ncrowdsourcing technique to collect argumentation annotations in Chinese hotel\nreviews. As the first Chinese argumentation dataset, our corpus includes 4814\nargument component annotations and 411 argument relation annotations, and its\nannotations qualities are comparable to some widely used argumentation corpora\nin other languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 03:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

The resulting linear system is overdetermined. Two\ndifferent approaches for solving the system are suggested (although others are\ndiscussed): (1) solving the associated normal equation with linear solvers for\nsymmetric positive-definite systems (e.g. Cholesky factorization); and (2)\nsolving the overdetermined system with orthogonalization algorithms (e.g. QR\nfactorization). The finite element assembly algorithm for each of these\napproaches is described in detail. The normal equation approach is usually\nfaster for direct solvers and requires less storage. The second approach\nreduces the condition number of the system by a power of two and is less\nsensitive to round-off error. The rectangular stiffness matrix of second\napproach is demonstrated to have condition number $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ for a\nvariety of formulations of Poisson's equation. The stiffness matrix from the\nnormal equation approach is demonstrated to be related to the monolithic\nstiffness matrices of least-squares finite element methods and it is proved\nthat the two are identical in some cases. An example with Poisson's equation\nindicates that the solutions of these two different linear systems can be\nnearly indistinguishable (if round-off error is not an issue) and rapidly\nconverge to each other. The orthogonalization approach is suggested to be\nbeneficial for problems which induce poorly conditioned linear systems.\nExperiments with Poisson's equation in single-precision arithmetic as well as\nthe linear acoustics problem near resonance in double-precision arithmetic\nverify this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 03:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

One theoretical problem is how to\nunify the visible and dark sectors by inducing the spontaneous breaking\n$G\\rightarrow{}G_{V}\\times{}G_{D}$ for some large gauge group $G$. In this\npaper, we discuss how to generate such a structure at low energies, in the\ncontext of 4+1-dimensional domain-wall brane model, by employing a\ngeneralization of the Dvali-Shifman mechanism, used to localized gauge bosons\non domain walls, called the clash-of-symmetries mechanism.

In this paper, we investigate the temporal evolution and north-south\n(N-S) asymmetry in the occurrence of solar flares during cycle 21, 22, and 23,\nand compare the results with traditional solar activity indices. Methods. The\nflare activity is characterized by a soft X-ray (SXR) flare index, which\nincorporates information about flare occurrences during a selected interval\nalong with the peak intensity of individual events. Results. The SXR flare\nindex correlates well with other conventional parameters of solar activity.\nFurther, it exhibits a significantly higher correlation with sunspot area over\nsunspot number, which suggests the variations in sunspot area to be more\nclosely linked with the transient energy release in the solar corona. The\ncumulative plots of the flare index indicate a slight excess of activity in the\nnorthern hemisphere during cycle 21, while a southern excess clearly prevails\nfor cycles 22 and 23. The study reveals a significant N-S asymmetry, which\nexhibits variations with the phases of solar cycle.

In the solving\nprocess, the deterministic part aims to exploit the structures of matrix\ninequalities, and the stochastic part is used to fully explore the decision\nvariable space. Simulation results show that the HMODE algorithm can produce an\napproximated Pareto front (APF) and Pareto-efficient controllers that stabilise\nthe associated controlled system. In contrast with single-objective designs\nusing LMI approaches, the proposed MO methodology can clearly illustrate how\nthe objectives involved affect each other, that is, a broad perspective on\noptimality is provided. This facilitates the selecting process for a\nrepresentative design, and particularly the design that corresponds to a\nnon-dominated vector lying in the knee region of the APF. In addition,\ncontroller gains can be readily modified to incorporate the preference or need\nof a system designer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 07:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

The importance of this radial\nmigration in shaping galactic light distributions is still unclear. However, if\nit is indeed important, galaxies with different surface brightness (SB)\nprofiles must display differences in their stellar population properties. Aims:\nWe investigate the role of radial migration on the light distribution and the\nradial stellar content by comparing the inner colour, age and metallicity\ngradients for galaxies with different SB profiles. We define these inner parts\navoiding the bulge and bar regions and up to around three disc scale-lengths\n(type I, pure exponential) or the break radius (type II, downbending; type III,\nupbending). Methods: We analyse 214 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey\ncovering different SB profiles. We make use of GASP2D and SDSS data to\ncharacterise their light distribution and obtain colour profiles. The stellar\nage and metallicity profiles are computed using a methodology based on\nfull-spectrum fitting techniques (pPXF, GANDALF, and STECKMAP) to the IFS\nCALIFA data. Results: The distributions of the colour, stellar age and stellar\nmetallicity gradients in the inner parts for galaxies displaying different SB\nprofiles are unalike as suggested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling\ntests. We find a trend in which type II galaxies show the steepest profiles of\nall and type III the shallowest, with type I galaxies displaying an\nintermediate behaviour. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a\nscenario in which radial migration is more efficient for type III galaxies than\nfor type I systems with type II galaxies presenting the lowest radial migration\nefficiency.

When dealing\nwith real-world data, the presence of outliers and impulsive noise must also be\naccounted for. In past decades, the vast majority of robust linear regression\nestimators has focused on robustness against rowwise contamination. Even so\ncalled `high breakdown' estimators rely on the assumption that a majority of\nrows of the regression matrix is not affected by outliers. Only very recently,\nthe first cellwise robust regression estimation methods have been developed. In\nthis paper, we define robust oracle properties, which an estimator must have in\norder to perform robust model selection for under-determined, or\nill-conditioned linear regression models that are contaminated by cellwise\noutliers in the regression matrix. We propose and analyze a robustly weighted\nand adaptive Lasso type regularization term which takes into account cellwise\noutliers for model selection. The proposed regularization term is integrated\ninto the objective function of the MM-estimator, which yields the proposed\nMM-Robust Weighted Adaptive Lasso (MM-RWAL), for which we prove that at least\nthe weak robust oracle properties hold. A performance comparison to existing\nrobust Lasso estimators is provided using Monte Carlo experiments. Further, the\nMM-RWAL is applied to determine the temporal releases of the European Tracer\nExperiment (ETEX) at the source location.

However, specific algorithms for automatic LCR detection and\nanalysis have not been developed in live, spontaneously beating pacemaker\ncells. Here we measured LCRs using a high-speed 2D-camera in spontaneously\ncontracting sinoatrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and\ndeveloped a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the LCRs spatially\nin two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline\nof the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine\ntransform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not\ncontract. Action potential-induced Ca transients and LCRs were thereafter\nisolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The LCR\nbirth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame)\nsensitivity algorithm. An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently\nquickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died\nwhen its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising\nwhole cell Ca transient. Our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as\nperiod, signal mass, duration, and path area. As LCRs propagate within cells,\nthe algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the\nimportance of Ca-induced-Ca-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a\npowerful ensemble Ca signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion\nartifacts and detect 2D local spatiotemporal Ca release events from recording\nnoise and global signals. While the algorithms detect LCRs in sinoatrial nodal\ncells, they have the potential to be used in other applications in biophysics\nand cell physiology, for example, to detect Ca wavelets (abortive waves),\nsparks and embers in muscle cells and Ca puffs and syntillas in neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 10:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Knowledge of the event labels\nconsiderably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species\ntrees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the\nevent types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled\ncase may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here\nwe investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation\nproblem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency\nfor the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a\nconvenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of\ntime-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak\nconditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which\nevolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an\nO(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent\nreconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit\ntiming maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking\nwhether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The combinatorial characterization\nof time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an\nimportant step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal\ntransfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees.\nThe fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context\nbecause it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree\nreconciliation problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 11:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

The\nefficiency of the AWS is assessed by quantifying the amount of acoustic energy\ntransmitted from the source device to the rock formation in terms of the\nemission frequency and the well configuration. A simple methodology to find\noptimal emission frequencies for a given well configuration is presented. The\nproposed model is based on the Helmholtz equation and an impedance boundary\ncondition that effectively accounts for the porous solid-fluid interaction at\nthe interface between the rock formation and the well perforations.

We\nshow that, surprisingly, velocity ranges of 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission are\npredominantly red-shifted with respect to corresponding CS(2-1) line velocity\nranges in the Perseus arm. We suggest that the predominance of the \"red-shifted\nmasers\" in the Perseus arm could be related to the alignment of gas flows\ncaused by the large-scale motions in the Galaxy. Large-scale galactic shock\nrelated to the spiral structure is supposed to affect the local kinematics of\nthe star-forming regions. Part of the Perseus arm, between galactic longitudes\nfrom 85deg to 124deg, does not contain blue-shifted masers at all. Radial\nvelocities of the sources are the greatest in this particular part of the arm,\nso the velocity difference is clearly pronounced. 13CO(1-0) and CS(2-1)\nvelocity maps of G183.35-0.58 show gas velocity difference between the center\nand the periphery of the molecular clump up to 1.2 km/s. Similar situation is\nlikely to occur in G85.40-0.00. This can correspond to the case when the\nlarge-scale shock wave entrains the outer parts of a molecular clump in motion\nwhile the dense central clump is less affected by the shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 13:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack\nof track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|>2.5$. This\npaper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits\njet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions.\nMeasurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set\nof 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in\nthe range $2.5<|\\eta|<4.5$ is estimated in simulated events with an average of\n22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum\nand, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between\n49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case\nstudy is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion\nprocess, showing that these techniques mitigate the background growth due to\nadditional proton--proton interactions, thus enhancing the reach for such\nsignatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 13:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

This triggered the development of theoretical models predicting\nnon-thermal photons from radio up to very-high-energy (VHE, E $\\geq 0.1$TeV)\ngamma rays. Subsequently, one bow shock was also detected in X-ray\nobservations. However, the data did not allow discrimination between a hot\nthermal and a non-thermal origin. Further observations of different candidates\nat X-ray energies showed no evidence for emission at the position of the bow\nshocks either. A systematic search in the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT energy regime\nresulted in flux upper limits for 27 candidates listed in the E-BOSS catalogue.\nHere we perform the first systematic search for VHE gamma-ray emission from bow\nshocks of runaway stars. Using all available archival H.E.S.S. data we search\nfor very-high-energy gamma-ray emission at the positions of bow shock\ncandidates listed in the second E-BOSS catalogue release. Out of the 73 bow\nshock candidates in this catalogue, 32 have been observed with H.E.S.S. None of\nthe observed 32 bow shock candidates in this population study show significant\nemission in the H.E.S.S. energy range. Therefore, flux upper limits are\ncalculated in five energy bins and the fraction of the kinetic wind power that\nis converted into VHE gamma rays is constrained. Emission from stellar bow\nshocks is not detected in the energy range between 0.14 and 18 TeV. The\nresulting upper limits constrain the level of VHE gamma-ray emission from these\nobjects down to 0.1-1 % of the kinetic wind energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 15:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

But our\ngeneral understanding of effect systems is limited primarily to systems where\nthe order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms of a\nlattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues, and provides\nguidance when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect\nsystems --- where the order of effects is important --- lack a clear algebraic\ncharacterization.\n  We derive an algebraic characterization from the shape of prior concrete\nsequential effect systems. We present an abstract polymorphic effect system\nwith singleton effects parameterized by an effect quantale --- an algebraic\nstructure with well-defined properties that can model a range of existing\norder-sensitive effect systems. We define effect quantales, derive useful\nproperties, and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential\neffect systems. We show that effect quantales provide a free, general notion of\niterating a sequential effect, and that for systems we consider the derived\niteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work.\nIdentifying and applying the right algebraic structure led us to subtle\ninsights into the design of order-sensitive effect systems, which provides\nguidance on non-obvious points of designing order-sensitive effect systems.\nEffect quantales have clear relationships to the recent category theoretic work\non order-sensitive effect systems, but are explained without recourse to\ncategory theory.

Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic\nstructure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph\npartitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into\nsmaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efficient.\nUnconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the\nmodularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum\nannealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into\nequal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required.

In particular, within the current\ntrend towards the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, microscopic\nengines have been attracting an ever-increasing interest. On the one hand,\nthere has been a quest to understand how biological molecular motors work. On\nthe other hand, several approaches have been proposed to realize artificial\nmicroscopic engines, which have been powered by the transfer of light momentum,\nby external magnetic fields, by in situ chemical reactions, or by the energy\nflow between hot and cold heat reservoirs, in scaled-down versions of\nmacroscopic heat engines. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a microscopic\nengine powered by the local reversible demixing of a critical mixture. We show\nthat, when an absorbing microsphere is optically trapped by a focused laser\nbeam in a sub-critical mixture, it is set into rotation around the optical axis\nof the beam because of the emergence of diffusiophoretic propulsion; this\nbehavior can be controlled by adjusting the optical power, the temperature, and\nthe criticality of the mixture. Given its simplicity, this microscopic engine\nprovides a powerful tool to power micro- and nanodevices. Furthermore, since\nmany biological systems are tuned near criticality, this mechanism might\nalready be at work within living organisms, for example in proteins and in\ncellular membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 12:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem\nsurprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical\nmodels. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect\nunderlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships\nbetween the elements of a biological system, according to the motto \"throw away\nthe physics, keep the organisation\". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic\nmodels that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might\nhave deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own\nwork. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R)\nsystems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach\ncould be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the\nmathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate\nto his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a\nparticular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions\nrather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The\nstrengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison\nwith current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's\ndefinition of life, \"organisms are closed to efficient causation\", should be\nconsidered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be\nimplemented in mathematical models are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 16:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

Sustainable growth of platform ecosystems is enabled by platform users\nsupplying and/or demanding content from each other: e.g. Facebook, YouTube or\nTwitter. The importance and value of user data in platform ecosystems is\naccentuated since platform owners use and sell the data for their business.\nSerious concern is increasing about data misuse or abuse, privacy issues and\nrevenue sharing between the different stakeholders. Traditional data governance\nfocuses on generic goals and a universal approach to manage the data of an\nenterprise. It entails limited support for the complicated situation and\nrelationship of a platform ecosystem where multiple participating parties\ncontribute, use data and share profits. This article identifies data governance\nfactors for platform ecosystems through literature review. The study then\nsurveys the data governance state of practice of four platform ecosystems:\nFacebook, YouTube, EBay and Uber. Finally, 19 governance models in industry and\nacademia are compared against our identified data governance factors for\nplatform ecosystems to reveal the gaps and limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 06:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

In this paper, we describe a new technique-called Series Expansion\nwith Accelerated Gradient Descent on Lippmann-Schwinger Equation (SEAGLE)-for\nrobust imaging under multiple scattering based on a combination of a new\nnonlinear forward model and a total variation (TV) regularizer. The proposed\nforward model can account for multiple scattering, which makes it advantageous\nin applications where linear models are inaccurate. Specifically, it\ncorresponds to a series expansion of the scattered wave with an\naccelerated-gradient method. This expansion guarantees the convergence even for\nstrongly scattering objects. One of our key insights is that it is possible to\nobtain an explicit formula for computing the gradient of our nonlinear forward\nmodel with respect to the unknown object, thus enabling fast image\nreconstruction with the state-of-the-art fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding\nalgorithm (FISTA).

In the light of this, we have\nconsidered C5H9N isomeric group in which the next higher member of the alkyl\ncyanide and other branched chain isomers belong. High-level quantum chemical\ncalculations have been employed in estimating accurate energies of these\nisomers. From the results, the only isomer of the group that has been\nastronomically searched, n-butyl cyanide is not the most stable isomer and\ntherefore, which might explain why its search could only yield upper limits of\nits column density without a successful detection. Rather, the two most stable\nisomers of the group are the branched chain isomers, tert-butylnitrile and\nisobutyl cyanide. Based on the rotational constants of these isomers, it is\nfound that the expected intensity of tert-butylnitrile is the maximum among\nthis isomeric group.
