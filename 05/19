Software engineers typically use software abstractions to\nhide and manage the high complexity of such systems. Without the presence of a\nunifying algebraic system to describe geometric models, the use of software\nabstractions alone can result in many design and maintenance problems.\nGeometric Algebra (GA) can be a universal abstract algebraic language for\nsoftware engineering geometric computing applications. Few sources, however,\nprovide enough information about GA-based software implementations targeting\nthe software engineering community. In particular, successfully introducing GA\nto software engineers requires quite different approaches from introducing GA\nto mathematicians or physicists. This article provides a high-level\nintroduction to the abstract concepts and algebraic representations behind the\nelegant GA mathematical structure. The article focuses on the conceptual and\nrepresentational abstraction levels behind GA mathematics with sufficient\nreferences for more details. In addition, the article strongly recommends\napplying the methods of Computational Thinking in both introducing GA to\nsoftware engineers, and in using GA as a mathematical language for developing\nGeometric Computing software systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 16:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

We\ndefine a Milky Way analog based on $K$-band luminosity and local environment.\nHere, we present satellite luminosity functions for 8 Milky Way analog galaxies\nbetween 20 to 40 Mpc. These systems have nearly complete spectroscopic coverage\nof candidate satellites within the projected host virial radius down to $ r_o <\n20.75 $ using low redshift $gri$ color criteria.

In this work, we investigate a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction\nfrom temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering\noff moving electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own\nintrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero cross-correlation with the CMB\nlensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure). This\nkSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its\ncross-correlation with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed\nby multifrequency foreground separation techniques because the kSZ effect\npreserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically negligible for\ncurrent datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and\nfailure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino\nmasses or the properties of dark energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias\ncan be as large as $\\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation with LSST galaxy\nlensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum\ntemperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 4000$,\nand about half of that when $\\ell_{\\rm max} = 3000$. Similarly, we find that\nthe CMB lensing auto-power spectrum can be biased by up to several percent.\nThese biases are many times larger than the expected statistical errors.\nReducing $\\ell_{\\rm max}$ can significantly mitigate the bias at the cost of a\ndecrease in the overall lensing reconstruction signal-to-noise.\nPolarization-only reconstruction may be the most robust mitigation strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 18:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 07:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 05:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

The low-rank tensor recovery is generally achieved by\nminimizing the loss function between the observed data and the factorization\nrepresentation. The loss function is designed in various forms under different\nnoise distribution assumptions, like $L_1$ norm for Laplacian distribution and\n$L_2$ norm for Gaussian distribution. However, they often fail to tackle the\nreal data which are corrupted by the noise with unknown distribution.

Here we apply the\nmethod to 52 so-called \"LEGACY\" main-sequence stars observed by the Kepler\nspace mission. For each star, we present estimates and uncertainties of mass,\nage, radius, luminosity, core hydrogen abundance, surface helium abundance,\nsurface gravity, initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity as well as\nestimates of their evolutionary model parameters of mixing length, overshooting\ncoefficient, and diffusion multiplication factor. We obtain median\nuncertainties in stellar age, mass, and radius of 14.8%, 3.6%, and 1.7%,\nrespectively.\n  The source code for all analyses and for all figures appearing in this\nmanuscript can be found electronically at:\nhttps://github.com/earlbellinger/asteroseismology\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 18:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)\ntackles this problem by using a set of temporally-extended actions, or options,\neach of which has its own subgoal. These subgoals are normally handcrafted for\nspecific tasks. Here, though, we introduce a generic class of subgoals with\nbroad applicability in the visual domain. Underlying our approach (in common\nwith work using \"auxiliary tasks\") is the hypothesis that the ability to\ncontrol aspects of the environment is an inherently useful skill to have. We\nincorporate such subgoals in an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning\nsystem and test two variants of our algorithm on a number of games from the\nAtari suite. We highlight the advantage of our approach in one of the hardest\ngames -- Montezuma's revenge -- for which the ability to handle sparse rewards\nis key. Our agent learns several times faster than the current state-of-the-art\nHRL agent in this game, reaching a similar level of performance. UPDATE\n22/11/17: We found that a standard A3C agent with a simple shaped reward, i.e.\nextrinsic reward + feature control intrinsic reward, has comparable performance\nto our agent in Montezuma Revenge. In light of the new experiments performed,\nthe advantage of our HRL approach can be attributed more to its ability to\nlearn useful features from intrinsic rewards rather than its ability to explore\nand reuse abstracted skills with hierarchical components. This has led us to a\nnew conclusion about the result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 19:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 15:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

J1804 also shows fainter radio emission at $L_X < 10^{35}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ than what is typically observed for accreting millisecond pulsars.\nThis suggests that J1804 is likely not an accreting X-ray or transitional\nmillisecond pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 20:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

In this paper, we\nstudy joint uplink and downlink coverage of cellular-based ambient RF energy\nharvesting IoT where the cellular network is assumed to be the only source of\nRF energy. We consider a time division-based approach for power and information\ntransmission where each time-slot is partitioned into three sub-slots: (i)\ncharging sub-slot during which the cellular base stations (BSs) act as RF\nchargers for the IoT devices, which then use the energy harvested in this\nsub-slot for information transmission and/or reception during the remaining two\nsub-slots, (ii) downlink sub-slot during which the IoT device receives\ninformation from the associated BS, and (iii) uplink sub-slot during which the\nIoT device transmits information to the associated BS.

We compare the polarization\nsignals in disk-center observations of the solar photosphere in quiet-Sun\nregions with those in Stokes spectra computed on the basis of 3D MHD\nsimulations having average magnetic flux densities of about 20, 56, 112 and 224\nG.

One of the key limitations of\ndeconvolutional operations is that they result in the so-called checkerboard\nproblem. This is caused by the fact that no direct relationship exists among\nadjacent pixels on the output feature map. To address this problem, we propose\nthe pixel deconvolutional layer (PixelDCL) to establish direct relationships\namong adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. Our method is based on a\nfresh interpretation of the regular deconvolution operation. The resulting\nPixelDCL can be used to replace any deconvolutional layer in a plug-and-play\nmanner without compromising the fully trainable capabilities of original\nmodels. The proposed PixelDCL may result in slight decrease in efficiency, but\nthis can be overcome by an implementation trick. Experimental results on\nsemantic segmentation demonstrate that PixelDCL can consider spatial features\nsuch as edges and shapes and yields more accurate segmentation outputs than\ndeconvolutional layers.

We additionally analyze a non-MCXC cluster associated with\none MCXC cluster. We show that H.E. masses for the MCXC clusters are correlated\nwith cluster richness from the CAMIRA catalog (Oguri et al. 2017), while that\nfor the non-MCXC cluster deviates from the scaling relation. The mass\nnormalization of the relationship between the cluster richness and H.E. mass is\ncompatible with one inferred by matching CAMIRA cluster abundance with a\ntheoretical halo mass function. The mean gas mass fraction based on H.E. masses\nfor the MCXC clusters is $\\langle f_{\\rm gas} \\rangle = 0.125\\pm0.012$ at\nspherical overdensity $\\Delta=500$, which is $\\sim80-90$ percent of the cosmic\nmean baryon fraction, $\\Omega_b/\\Omega_m$, measured by cosmic microwave\nbackground experiments. We find that the mean baryon fraction estimated from\nX-ray and HSC-SSP optical data is comparable to $\\Omega_b/\\Omega_m$. A\nweak-lensing shear catalog of background galaxies, combined with photometric\nredshifts, is currently available only for three clusters in our sample.\nHydrostatic equilibrium masses roughly agree with weak-lensing masses, albeit\nwith large uncertainty. This study demonstrates that further multiwavelength\nstudy for a large sample of clusters using X-ray, HSC-SSP optical and weak\nlensing data will enable us to understand cluster physics and utilize\ncluster-based cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 03:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 04:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Regulations require that operational risk\nlosses should be aggregated by originating event. The effect is that a large\nnumber of small and medium-sized losses are aggregated into a small number of\nvery large losses, such that a risk capital calculation produces a hugely\ninflated result. To solve this problem, a novel distribution based on a\none-parameter probability density with an exponential of a fourth power is\nproposed, where the parameter is to be estimated.

The fiber orientation\n(FO) is a key feature computed from dMRI for fiber tract reconstruction.\nBecause the number of FOs in a voxel is usually small, dictionary-based sparse\nreconstruction has been used to estimate FOs with a relatively small number of\ndiffusion gradients. However, accurate FO estimation in regions with complex FO\nconfigurations in the presence of noise can still be challenging. In this work\nwe explore the use of a deep network for FO estimation in a dictionary-based\nframework and propose an algorithm named Fiber Orientation Reconstruction\nguided by a Deep Network (FORDN). FORDN consists of two steps. First, we use a\nsmaller dictionary encoding coarse basis FOs to represent the diffusion\nsignals. To estimate the mixture fractions of the dictionary atoms (and thus\ncoarse FOs), a deep network is designed specifically for solving the sparse\nreconstruction problem. Here, the smaller dictionary is used to reduce the\ncomputational cost of training. Second, the coarse FOs inform the final FO\nestimation, where a larger dictionary encoding dense basis FOs is used and a\nweighted l1-norm regularized least squares problem is solved to encourage FOs\nthat are consistent with the network output. FORDN was evaluated and compared\nwith state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate FOs using sparse reconstruction\non simulated and real dMRI data, and the results demonstrate the benefit of\nusing a deep network for FO estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 06:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio\nprofile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation\nregulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust\nhalo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available\nsilicate gas condenses out.

Trait formation\nis intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a\nvariety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have emphasized the\nimportance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that\nare empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources,\nit has been suggested that culture has properties that are universally present,\nand that empirical cultural states differ systematically from randomized\ncounterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the\nobserved patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural\nmodel for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical\nproperties. One ingredient of the model, already used in previous work, assumes\nthat every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several,\nuniversal \"rationalities\", informally postulated by several social science\ntheories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that,\napart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure\nto the other rationalities. It is shown that both ingredients are required for\nreproducing the empirical regularities. This key result suggests that the\neffects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an interplay\nof multiple, mixing rationalities, and thus provides indirect evidence for the\nclass of social science theories postulating such mixing. The model should be\nseen as a static, effective description of culture, while a dynamical, more\nfundamental description is left for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 09:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

In this paper, we find for the first time, to our\nknowledge, that it also plays a concrete role in supervised classification. It\nturns out that two classifiers are inherently related to the theory: linear\nregression for classification (LRC) and normalized radial basis function\nnetwork (nRBFN), corresponding to linear and nonlinear kernel respectively. The\nspectral graph theory provides us with a new insight into a fundamental aspect\nof classification: the tradeoff between fitting error and overfitting risk.\nWith the theory, ideal working conditions for LRC and nRBFN are presented,\nwhich ensure not only zero fitting error but also low overfitting risk. For\nquantitative analysis, two concepts, the fitting error and the spectral risk\n(indicating overfitting), have been defined. Their bounds for nRBFN and LRC are\nderived. A special result shows that the spectral risk of nRBFN is lower\nbounded by the number of classes and upper bounded by the size of radial basis.\nWhen the conditions are not met exactly, the classifiers will pursue the\nminimum fitting error, running into the risk of overfitting. It turns out that\n$\\ell_2$-norm regularization can be applied to control overfitting. Its effect\nis explored under the spectral context. It is found that the two terms in the\n$\\ell_2$-regularized objective are one-one correspondent to the fitting error\nand the spectral risk, revealing a tradeoff between the two quantities.\nConcerning practical performance, we devise a basis selection strategy to\naddress the main problem hindering the applications of (n)RBFN. With the\nstrategy, nRBFN is easy to implement yet flexible. Experiments on 14 benchmark\ndata sets show the performance of nRBFN is comparable to that of SVM, whereas\nthe parameter tuning of nRBFN is much easier, leading to reduction of model\nselection time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 10:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

By calculating the\nmicroscopic viscosity on the basis of various theoretical assumptions and\nestimating the Kolmogorov length from the turbulent dissipation rate computed\nwith a subgrid-scale model, we are able to demonstrate that most of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium can sustain a fully turbulent state only if the\nmagnetic suppression of the viscosity is considerable.

This confirms the tight correlations\nbetween the mean thermal and non-thermal energy content for large samples of\nclusters in earlier studies, which can be interpreted as second self-similarity\non top of the self-similarity for different halo masses. Another long-standing\nquestion is how and to which extent turbulence contributes to the support of\nthe gas against gravity. From a global perspective, the ratio of turbulent and\nthermal pressures is significant for the clusters in our simulation. On the\nother hand, a local measure is provided by the compression rate, i.e. the\ngrowth rate of the divergence of the flow. Particularly for the intracluster\nmedium, we find that the dominant contribution against gravity comes from\nthermal pressure, while compressible turbulence effectively counteracts the\nsupport.

Theory predictions and simulation\nresults show good agreement. It is demonstrated how the theory can be used to\noptimally tune the absorbing layer parameters to minimize undesired wave\nreflection.

This research explores the usage of\nself-organized criticality to reduce user interaction in the process of\nselecting suitable parameters for particle swarm optimization (PSO) heuristics.\nA particle swarm variant (named Adaptive PSO) with self-organized criticality\nis developed and benchmarked against the standard PSO.

This software is used to test\nthe standard PSO as well as all other PSO variants developed in the process of\ncreating the Adaptive PSO.

R-CORK is an extension of the compact\nrational Krylov method (CORK) introduced very recently by Van Beeumen et al. to\nsolve a family of non-linear eigenvalue problems that can be expressed and\nlinearized in certain particular ways and which include arbitrary polynomial\neigenvalue problems, but not arbitrary rational eigenvalue problems. The R-CORK\nmethod exploits the structure of the linearized problem by representing the\nKrylov vectors in a compact form in order to reduce the cost of storage,\nresulting in a method with two levels of orthogonalization. The first level of\northogonalization works with vectors of the same size that the original\nproblem, and the second level works with vectors of size much smaller than the\noriginal problem. Since vectors of the size of the linearization are never\nstored or orthogonalized, R-CORK is more efficient from the point of views of\nmemory and orthogonalization than the classical rational Krylov method applied\ndirectly to the linearization. Taking into account that the R-CORK method is\nbased on a classical rational Krylov method, to implement implicit restarting\nis also possible and we show how to do it in a memory efficient way.

An important property of the oscillation\nmodes of rapidly rotating stars is that they can become secularly unstable due\nto the emission of gravitational radiation, that is so-called\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability. Such unstable modes are efficient\nemitters of gravitational radiation.

Usually the focus of\nresearch is on the spin polarization of the triplets, potentially enabling\nlow-dissipation magnetization switching and domain wall motion. However, the\nfundamental mechanism for generating triplet pairs [3,4] also permits control\nover a parameter which has not been addressed before, namely the spatial\ndistribution of the supercurrent. Here we demonstrate this control by tailoring\ndistinct supercurrent pathways in the ferromagnetic weak link of a Josephson\njunction. Combining micromagnetic simulations with three-dimensional critical\ncurrent calculations, based on the Usadel description of mesoscopic\nsuperconductivity [5], we designed a disk-shaped structure with a magnetic\nvortex, which induces two distinct supercurrent channels across the junction.\nThe design was successfully tested with superconducting quantum interferometry\n(SQI). Moreover, we show how the position of the pathways can be controlled by\nmoving the vortex with a magnetic field. This novel approach allows adaptable\nsupercurrent paths to be dynamically reconfigured to switch between different\nfunctionalities in the same device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 14:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

In this paper we propose BAMHealthCloud which\nis a cloud based system for management of healthcare data, it ensures security\nof data through biometric authentication. It has been developed after\nperforming a detailed case study on healthcare sector in a developing country.\nTraining of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performed\nin parallel on hadoop MapReduce framework using Resilient Backpropagation\nneural network. From rigorous experiments it can be concluded that it achieves\na speedup of 9x, Equal error rate (EER) of 0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and\nspecificity of 0.95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 11:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

These optimal strategies can be\nfound numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 15:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

In the\nsemi-classical approximation, the gravitational field will be analysed as a\nclassical field, and the matter fields will be treated quantum mechanically.\nThus, using this approximation, this system will be represented by a\ndeformation of Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation by the generalised uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP). We will analyse the effects of this GUP deformed\nSchr\\\"odinger-Newton equation on the behaviour of such a semi-classical\ngravitational system. As the quantum mechanical virial theorem can be obtained\nusing the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation, a short distance modification of the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Newton equation will also result in a short distance modification\nof the quantum mechanical virial theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 05:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}
