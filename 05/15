Most of these margins, however, are wasted after manufacturing,\nbecause process variations cause only some chips to be really slow, while other\nchips can easily meet given timing specifications. To reduce this pessimism, we\ncan reserve less timing margin and tune failed chips after manufacturing with\nclock buffers to make them meet timing specifications. With this post-silicon\nclock tuning, critical paths can be balanced with neighboring paths in each\nchip specifically to counter the effect of process variations.

On a fundamental level,\nit enables the study of soliton physics in driven nonlinear cavities.\nMicroresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode\ninteractions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as\n\"avoided mode crossings\". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but\ncan also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e.g. the formation of\ndispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing\ntemporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied,\nbut is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the\ndiscovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs\nwithin a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative\nsolitons are expected. We demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon in two\nmicroresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic\nchip-based silicon nitride microresonators), and theoretically describe the\ndynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We demonstrate\nexperimentally that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange\nbetween the soliton and another optical mode family. We further show that\ninter-mode interactions can be modeled by a response function acting on\ndissipative solitons. The observation of breathing dynamics in the\nconventionally stable soliton regime is critical to applications, ranging from\nlow-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis to spectroscopy.

The JUNO collaboration is preparing equipment for the\nmass tests of all PMTs using 4 dedicated containers. This approach allows us to\ntest 144 PMTs in parallel. The primary measurement in the container will be the\nPMT response to illumination of its photocathode by a low-intensity uniform\nlight. Each of the 20 000 PMTs will undergo the container test. Additionally, a\ndedicated scanning system was constructed for sampled tests of PMTs that allows\nus to study the variation of the PDE over the entire PMT photocathode surface.\nThe core of the scanning station is a rotating frame with 7 LED sources of\ncalibrated short light flashes that are placed along the photocathode surface\ncovering zenith angles from the top of a PMT to its equator. The collection\nefficiency of a large PMT is known to be very sensitive to the Earth Magnetic\nField (EMF), therefore, understanding the necessary level of EMF suppression is\ncrucial for the JUNO Experiment.

Two feedback\nmodes have been identified, namely the radiative and kinetic modes, which\ncorrespond to the luminous AGNs and low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), respectively.\nIn this paper, we investigate the radiative heating in the kinetic mode. This\nprocess is potentially important because: 1) the radiation power of LLAGNs is\nhigher than the jet power over a wide parameter range, 2) the spectral energy\ndistribution of LLAGNs is such that the radiative heating is more effective\ncompared to that of luminous AGNs with the same luminosity, and 3) most of the\ntime in the lifecycle of an AGN is spent in the LLAGNs phase. In this paper,\nadopting the characteristic broad-band spectral energy distributions of LLAGNs,\nwe calculate the value of \"Compton temperature\" ($T_{\\rm c}$), which determines\nthe radiative heating by Compton scattering. We find that $T_{\\rm c}\\sim\n(5-15)\\times 10^7$ K, depending on the spectrum of individual LLAGN and at\nwhich distance from the black hole we evaluate the heating.

Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD.

A common assumption is that halo centres\ncorrespond to the location of their brightest member galaxies. In this paper,\nwe study the dynamics of brightest galaxies with respect to other halo members\nin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Specifically, we look at the line-of-sight\nvelocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours.\nWe compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution,\ndark-matter-only $N$-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite\ngalaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on\nthe fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}$ of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the\ncentral. Compared to previous studies we explicitly take into account the\nunrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and\ncorrelations between $f_{\\rm BNC}$ and the satellite occupation. We find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy\nand increases with the mass of the host halo.

In general, the harmonics of a frequency comb\nare identically polarized in a single microresonator. In this work, we report\nthat one comb in one polarization is generated by an orthogonally polarized\nsoliton comb and two low-noise, orthogonally polarized combs interact with each\nother and exist simultaneously in a single microresonator. The second comb\ngeneration is attributed to the strong cross-phase modulation with the\northogonally polarized soliton comb and the high peak power of the intracavity\nsoliton pulse. Experimental results show that a second frequency comb is\nexcited even when a continuous wave light as a \"seed\"-with power as low as 0.1\nmW-is input, while its own power level is below the threshold of comb\ngeneration. Moreover, the second comb has a concave envelope, which is\ndifferent from the sech2 envelope of the soliton comb. This is due to the\nfrequency mismatch between the harmonics and the resonant frequency. We also\nfind that the repetition rates of these two combs coincide, although two\northogonal resonant modes are characterized by different free spectral ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 00:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 19:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

However, coherent superposition of many longitudinal and transverse\nmodes in a laser has received little attention. The multitude of disparate\nfrequency spacings, strong dispersions, and complex nonlinear interactions\namong modes greatly favor decoherence over the emergence of order.

Sometimes, multiple dependent vectors\n$x^{(j)}, j\\in \\{1,...,J\\}$, are measured at the same time, forming the\nso-called multi-measurement vector (MMV) problem. Both SMV and MMV are linear\nmodels (LM's), and the process of estimating the underlying vector(s) $x$ from\nan LM given the matrices, noisy measurements, and knowledge of the noise\nstatistics, is called a linear inverse problem. In some scenarios, the matrix A\nis stored in a single processor and this processor also records its\nmeasurements $y$; this is called centralized LM. In other scenarios, multiple\nsites are measuring the same underlying unknown vector $x$, where each site\nonly possesses part of the matrix A; we call this multi-processor LM. Recently,\ndue to an ever-increasing amount of data and ever-growing dimensions in LM's,\nit has become more important to study large-scale linear inverse problems. In\nthis dissertation, we take advantage of tools in statistical physics and\ninformation theory to advance the understanding of large-scale linear inverse\nproblems. The intuition of the application of statistical physics to our\nproblem is that statistical physics deals with large-scale problems, and we can\nmake an analogy between an LM and a thermodynamic system. In terms of\ninformation theory, although it was originally developed to characterize the\ntheoretic limits of digital communication systems, information theory was later\nfound to be rather useful in analyzing and understanding other inference\nproblems.

In contrast to the graph structure data, the i.i.d. node embedding\ncan be processed efficiently in terms of both time and space. Current\nsemi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the labelled nodes are given,\nwhich may not be always true in the real world. While manually label all\ntraining data is inapplicable, how to select the subset of training data to\nlabel so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great\nimportance. This motivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework,\nin which we design a general active learning query strategy for any\nsemi-supervised graph embedding algorithm.

A system that can\nautomatically annotate images with meaningful text can be highly beneficial for\nsuch engines. Currently, the approaches to develop such systems try to\nestablish relationships between keywords and visual features of images. In this\npaper, We make three main contributions to this area: (i) We transform this\nproblem from the low-level keyword space to the high-level semantics space that\nwe refer to as the \"{\\em image theme}\", (ii) Instead of treating each possible\nkeyword independently, we use latent Dirichlet allocation to learn image themes\nfrom the associated texts in a training phase. Images are then annotated with\nimage themes rather than keywords, using a modified continuous relevance model,\nwhich takes into account the spatial coherence and the visual continuity among\nimages of common theme. (iii) To achieve more coherent annotations among images\nof common theme, we have integrated ConceptNet in learning the semantics of\nimages, and hence augment image descriptions beyond annotations provided by\nhumans. Images are thus further annotated by a few most significant words of\nthe prominent image theme. Our extensive experiments show that a coherent\ntheme-based image annotation using high-level semantics results in improved\nprecision and recall as compared with equivalent classical keyword annotation\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 07:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

These systems provide good multimodal\nembeddings and are also capable of translating from one representation space to\nthe other. Operating on representation spaces, these networks lack the ability\nto operate in the original spaces (text or image), which makes it difficult to\nvisualize the crossmodal function, and do not generalize well to unseen data.\nRecently, generative adversarial networks have gained popularity and have been\nused for generating realistic synthetic data and for obtaining high-level,\nsingle-modal latent representation spaces.

Most existing subspace clustering approaches\nassume that input data lie on linear subspaces. In practice, however, this\nassumption usually does not hold. To achieve nonlinear subspace clustering, we\npropose a novel method, called kernel truncated regression representation. Our\nmethod consists of the following four steps: 1) projecting the input data into\na hidden space, where each data point can be linearly represented by other data\npoints; 2) calculating the linear representation coefficients of the data\nrepresentations in the hidden space; 3) truncating the trivial coefficients to\nachieve robustness and block-diagonality; and 4) executing the graph cutting\noperation on the coefficient matrix by solving a graph Laplacian problem. Our\nmethod has the advantages of a closed-form solution and the capacity of\nclustering data points that lie on nonlinear subspaces. The first advantage\nmakes our method efficient in handling large-scale datasets, and the second one\nenables the proposed method to conquer the nonlinear subspace clustering\nchallenge.

Stability of some\nkey solar observers has been evaluated against the composite series.

They are successful for measuring the average\naccuracy of an IQA metric in ranking multiple processed images. However, two\nimportant perceptual properties are ignored by them as well. Firstly, the\nsorting accuracy (SA) of high quality images are usually more important than\nthe poor quality ones in many real world applications, where only the\ntop-ranked images would be pushed to the users. Secondly, due to the subjective\nuncertainty in making judgement, two perceptually similar images are usually\nhardly sortable, whose ranks do not contribute to the evaluation of an IQA\nmetric. To more accurately compare different IQA algorithms, we explore a\nperceptually weighted rank correlation indicator in this paper, which rewards\nthe capability of correctly ranking high quality images, and suppresses the\nattention towards insensitive rank mistakes. More specifically, we focus on\nactivating `valid' pairwise comparison towards image quality, whose difference\nexceeds a given sensory threshold (ST). Meanwhile, each image pair is assigned\nan unique weight, which is determined by both the quality level and rank\ndeviation. By modifying the perception threshold, we can illustrate the sorting\naccuracy with a more sophisticated SA-ST curve, rather than a single rank\ncorrelation coefficient. The proposed indicator offers a new insight for\ninterpreting visual perception behaviors.

Here I show that the illusion of disconnected rings and the size\nof bifurcated features can be explained through a natural geometry which\ncombines the properties of both the cone and the fan beam. It is a flaring\nspiral which makes several revolutions around the dipole axis on its way to\nleave the magnetosphere. Such geometry is consistent with a stream of\noutflowing and laterally drifting plasma. The bifurcated components are so\nwide, because the curvature on such a spiral is larger than that of the dipolar\nmagnetic field, hence they are consistent with the extraordinary mode curvature\nradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 09:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Using such techniques, however, the structural\ndetails of feature separation and the temporal evolution of features undergoing\ntopological changes are difficult to analyze. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for the spatio-temporal visualization of feature separation that\nsegments feature volumes into regions with respect to their contribution to\ndistinct features after separation. To this end, we employ particle-based\nfeature tracking to find volumetric correspondences between features at two\ndifferent instants of time. We visualize this segmentation by constructing mesh\nboundaries around each volume segment of a feature at the initial time that\ncorrespond to the separated features at the later time. To convey temporal\nevolution of the partitioning within the investigated time interval, we\ncomplement our approach with spatio-temporal separation surfaces. For the\napplication of our approach to multiphase flow, we additionally present a\nfeature-based corrector method to ensure phase-consistent particle\ntrajectories. The utility of our technique is demonstrated by application to\ntwo-phase (liquid-gas) and multi-component (liquid-liquid) flows where the\nscalar field represents the fraction of one of the phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 09:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 08:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions,\nand mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional\nin decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore,\ncomputational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision\nmaking architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in\nRL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML)\nresearchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the\ninteractive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can\ncommunicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective\nmodelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a\nsuccessful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory\nand RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g.,\nhomeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled\nin RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these\ndimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning\nefficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically\ncompare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains\nlike (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides\nboth a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their\nRL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 11:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

When arrayed in a crystal, the coherent sum\nof the continuous diffracted wave-fields from all objects gives rise to strong\nBragg peaks that modulate the single-object transform. Wilson statistics\ndescribe the distribution of continuous diffraction intensities to the same\nextent that they apply to Bragg diffraction. The continuous diffraction\nobtained from translationally-disordered molecular crystals consists of the\nincoherent sum of the wave-fields from the individual rigid units (such as\nmolecules) in the crystal, which is proportional to the incoherent sum of the\ndiffraction from the rigid units in each of their crystallographic\norientations. This sum over orientations modifies the statistics in a similar\nway that crystal twinning modifies the distribution of Bragg intensities. These\nstatistics are applied to determine parameters of continuous diffraction such\nas its scaling, the beam coherence, and the number of independent wave-fields\nor object orientations contributing. Continuous diffraction is generally much\nweaker than Bragg diffraction and may be accompanied by a background that far\nexceeds the strength of the signal. Instead of just relying upon the smallest\nmeasured intensities to guide the subtraction of the background it is shown how\nall measured values can be utilised to estimate the background, noise, and\nsignal, by employing a modified \"noisy Wilson\" distribution that explicitly\nincludes the background. Parameters relating to the background and signal\nquantities can be estimated from the moments of the measured intensities. The\nanalysis method is demonstrated on previously-published continuous diffraction\ndata measured from imperfect crystals of photosystem II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 11:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Based on the hopping mechanism, the pedestrian traffic light\nscheduling problems are formulated by two different performance standards:\npedestrian delay and pedestrian unhappiness. Then the mathematical technique\nand the meta-heuristic approach are both adopted to solve the scheduling\nproblem: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for pedestrian\ndelay model and discrete harmony search algorithm (DHS) for both pedestrian\ndelay model and unhappiness model.

Thirdly, a traffic light scheduling\nstrategy to minimize the trade-off of the delays between pedestrians and\nvehicles is proposed. Finally, we translate this traffic signal scheduling\nproblem for both pedestrians and vehicles into a MILP problem which can be\nsolved by several existing tools, e.g., GUROBI.

As the\nconsidered weighted sum rate maximization is a non-convex problem, successive\nconvex approximation techniques, based on weighted mean-squared error\nminimization, are applied to devise algorithms with tractable computational\ncomplexity. Decentralized algorithms are proposed to enable JP even with\nlimited backhaul connectivity.

Time division duplexing is exploited to design transceiver training\ntechniques for two scenarios: stream specific estimation and direct estimation.\nIn the stream specific estimation, the base station and user equipment estimate\nall of the stream specific precoded pilots individually and construct the\ntransmit/receive covariance matrices based on these pilot estimates.

We propose a periodic confining\npotential emulating the atomistic oscillation of the confining walls, which\nallows varying the lattice parameter and amplitude of the oscillation.

The liquid maintains a bi-layer\ntriangular structure, however, despite the fact that it is not favoured by the\nexternal periodicity. The first-principles liquid is significantly affected by\nthe modulation in its layering and stacking even at relatively small amplitudes\nof the confinement modulation.

Atomic and biexciton cascades have been exploited as sources of\npolarization-entangled photon pairs. Because the photons are emitted\nsequentially, their intensities are strongly correlated in time, as measured in\na double-beam coincidence experiment. Perhaps less intuitively, their phases\ncan also be correlated, provided a single emitter is deterministically prepared\ninto a superposition state, and the emitted radiation is detected in a\nphase-sensitive manner and with high efficiency. Here we have met these\nrequirements by using a superconducting artificial atom, coherently driven to\nits second-excited state and decaying into a well-defined microwave mode.

However, the underlying mechanism is still far\nfrom being understood, especially on the atomic level. Here, we unexpectedly\nobserved that a decrease in phospholipid (PL) bilayer fluidity caused by Cu2+\nwas much more significant than those induced by Zn2+ and Ca2+, while a\ncomparable reduction occurred in the last two ions. This finding clearly\ndisagrees with the placement in the periodic table of Cu just next to Zn and\nfar from Ca. The physical nature was revealed to be a special attraction\nbetween Cu+ cations, which can induce a motif forming of two phospholipids\ncoupled by Cu-Cu bond (PL-diCu-PL). Namely, upon Cu2+ ion binding to a\nnegatively charged phosphate group of lipid, Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+. The\nspecial attraction of the cations then caused one Cu+ ion simultaneously\nbinding to two lipids and another Cu+, resulting in the formation of PL-diCu-PL\nstructure. In contrast, this attraction cannot occur in the cases of Zn and Ca\nions due to their electron structure. Remarkably, besides lipids, the phosphate\ngroup widely exists in other biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, ADP and\nATP, which would also induce the similar structure of Cu ions with the\nmolecules. Our findings thus provide a new view for understanding the\nbiological functions of copper and the mechanism underlying copper-related\ndiseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 14:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Similar to\nthe recently developed AMS for incompressible (linear) flows [Wang et al., JCP,\n2014], C-AMS operates by defining primal and dual-coarse blocks on top of the\nfine-scale grid. These coarse grids facilitate the construction of a\nconservative (finite volume) coarse-scale system and the computation of local\nbasis functions, respectively. However, unlike the incompressible (elliptic)\ncase, the choice of equations to solve for basis functions in compressible\nproblems is not trivial. Therefore, several basis function formulations\n(incompressible and compressible, with and without accumulation) are considered\nin order to construct an efficient multiscale prolongation operator. As for the\nrestriction operator, C-AMS allows for both multiscale finite volume (MSFV) and\nfinite element (MSFE) methods. Finally, in order to resolve high-frequency\nerrors, fine-scale (pre- and post-) smoother stages are employed. In order to\nreduce computational expense, the C-AMS operators (prolongation, restriction,\nand smoothers) are updated adaptively. In addition to this, the linear system\nin the Newton-Raphson loop is infrequently updated. Systematic numerical\nexperiments are performed to determine the effect of the various options,\noutlined above, on the C-AMS convergence behaviour. An efficient C-AMS strategy\nfor heterogeneous 3D compressible problems is developed based on overall CPU\ntimes. Finally, C-AMS is compared against an industrial-grade Algebraic\nMultiGrid (AMG) solver.

First,\nmultiscale coarse grids are independently constructed for both porous matrix\nand fracture networks. Then, a map between coarse- and fine-scale is obtained\nby algebraically computing basis functions with local support. In order to\nextend the localization assumption to the fractured media, four types of basis\nfunctions are investigated: (1) Decoupled-AMS, in which the two media are\ncompletely decoupled, (2) Frac-AMS and (3) Rock-AMS, which take into account\nonly one-way transmissibilities, and (4) Coupled-AMS, in which the matrix and\nfracture interpolators are fully coupled. In order to ensure scalability, the\nF-AMS framework permits full flexibility in terms of the resolution of the\nfracture coarse grids. Numerical results are presented for two- and\nthree-dimensional heterogeneous test cases. During these experiments, the\nperformance of F-AMS, paired with ILU(0) as second-stage smoother in a\nconvergent iterative procedure, is studied by monitoring CPU times and\nconvergence rates. Finally, in order to investigate the scalability of the\nmethod, an extensive benchmark study is conducted, where a commercial algebraic\nmultigrid solver is used as reference. The results show that, given an\nappropriate coarsening strategy, F-AMS is insensitive to severe fracture and\nmatrix conductivity contrasts, as well as the length of the fracture networks.\nIts unique feature is that a fine-scale mass conservative flux field can be\nreconstructed after any iteration, providing efficient approximate solutions in\ntime-dependent simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 12:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

A\nPopperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical\ndescription of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible\nrealization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer\nprinciple of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The\ndifferent point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs\ncorresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG\nindistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard\n2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs\nindistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever\nangles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the\nOR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL\ngate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the\nself-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according\nto the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate\nit is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective\nAND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally,\nby other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible\nto obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more\nsophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All\nthis leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device\nplus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to\nproduce in a self-reversible way, by choosing one of these latter, the logic\nconnectives now listed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 12:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 17:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

Based on the\nanalysis using geometric probability, we discuss the observability of these\nparameters: which parameters we can estimate and what conditions are required\nto estimate them. For a convex target object, its size and perimeter length are\nobservable, and other parameters are not observable. For a general polygon\ntarget object, convexity in addition to its size and perimeter length is\nobservable. Parameters related to a concave vertex can be observable when some\nconditions are satisfied. We also propose a method for estimating the convexity\nof a target object and the perimeter length of the target object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 05:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}
