In each of these processes cell shape\nis studied extensively, whereas variation of shape from cell-to-cell is\ndismissed most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and variation\nof cell shape come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variation are\nmutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That\nrelationship is shown to govern maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial\nepithelial layer cultured from both non-asthmatic and asthmatic donors as well\nas formation of the ventral furrow in the epithelial monolayer of the\nDrosophila embryo in vivo. Across these and other vastly different epithelial\nsystems, cell shape variation collapses to a family of distributions that is\ncommon to all and potentially universal. That distribution, in turn, is\naccounted for quantitatively by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction\nshowing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable\nas the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings thus uncover a\nconnection between jamming and geometry that is generic -spanning jammed living\nand inert systems alike- and demonstrate that proximity of the cell layer to\nthe jammed state is the principal determinant of the most primitive features of\nepithelial cell shape and shape variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 17:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The\nmethodology is inspired by negative sampling, which has seen success in natural\nlanguage processing, where an embedding is learned by correlating and\nde-correlating a given input vector with output weights. Although the matrix\ndetermined by the output weights is dependent on a set of known speakers, we\nonly use the input vectors during inference.

Our approach is similar to recent\ndeep neural network clustering and permutation-invariant training research; we\nuse weighted spectral features and masks to augment individual speaker\nfrequencies while filtering out other speakers. We avoid, however, the severe\ncomputational burden of other approaches with our technique. Furthermore, by\ntraining a vector space rather than combinations of different speakers or\ndifferences thereof, we avoid the so-called permutation problem during\ntraining.

This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

As this object sweeps through material with a\nsteep radial gradient of density, net angular momentum is introduced into the\nflow, potentially leading to the formation of an accretion disk. The presence\nof a disk would have dramatic consequences for the outcome of the interaction\nbecause accretion might be accompanied by strong, polar outflows with enough\nenergy to unbind the entire envelope. Without a detailed understanding of the\nnecessary conditions for disk formation during common envelope, therefore, it\nis difficult to accurately predict the population of merging compact binaries.\nThis paper examines the conditions for disk formation around objects embedded\nwithin common envelopes using the `wind tunnel' formalism developed by MacLeod\net al. (2017). We find that the formation of disks is highly dependent on the\ncompressibility of the envelope material. Disks form only in the most\ncompressible of stellar envelope gas, found in envelopes' outer layers in zones\nof partial ionization. These zones are largest in low-mass stellar envelopes,\nbut comprise small portions of the envelope mass and radius in all cases. We\nconclude that disk formation and associated accretion feedback in common\nenvelope is rare, and if it occurs, transitory. The implication for LIGO black\nhole binary assembly is that by avoiding strong accretion feedback, common\nenvelope interactions should still result in the substantial orbital tightening\nneeded to produce merging binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Using exactly solvable models, we show\nthat these origami tilings can have phase transitions as a function of crease\nstate variables, as a function of the arrangement of creases around vertices,\nand as a function of local layer orderings of neighboring faces. We use the\nexactly solved cases of the staggered odd 8-vertex model as well as Baxter's\nexactly solved 3-coloring problem on the square lattice to study these origami\ntilings. By treating the crease-reversal defects as a lattice gas, we find\nexact analytic expressions for their density, which is directly related to the\norigami material's elastic modulus. The density and phase transition analysis\nhas implications for the use of these origami tilings as tunable metamaterials;\nour analysis shows that Miura-ori's density is more tunable than Barreto's\nMars, for example. We also find that there is a broader range of tunability as\na function of the density of layering defects compared to as a function of the\ndensity of crease order defects before the phase transition point is reached;\nmaterial and mechanical properties that depend on local layer ordering\nproperties will have a greater amount of tunability. The defect density of\nBarreto's Mars, on the other hand, can be increased until saturation without\npassing through a phase transition point.

However, a theory may represent knowledge that is\nsubject to change, as a result of executing actions that have effects on some\nof the initial properties mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a\ndecomposition of a theory, it is advantageous to know whether a decomposition\nhas to be computed again in the newly-changed theory (obtained from taking into\naccount changes resulting from execution of an action). In the paper, we\naddress this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where a change of\nan initial theory is related to the notion of progression. Progression provides\na form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those\nproperties, which are subject to change, and computing new values for them. We\nconsider decomposability and inseparability, two component properties known\nfrom the literature, and contribute by 1) studying the conditions when these\nproperties are preserved and 2) when they are lost wrt progression and the\nrelated operation of forgetting.

An increasing use of\nautonomous robots in a broad range of applications creates a need for\nefficient, general purpose motion planning algorithms that are applicable in\nany of these new application domains.\n  This thesis presents a resolution complete optimal kinodynamic motion\nplanning algorithm based on a direct forward search of the set of admissible\ninput signals to a dynamical model. The advantage of this generalized label\ncorrecting method is that it does not require a local planning subroutine as in\nthe case of related methods.\n  Preliminary material focuses on new topological properties of the canonical\nproblem formulation that are used to show continuity of the performance\nobjective. These observations are used to derive a generalization of Bellman's\nprinciple of optimality in the context of kinodynamic motion planning. A\ngeneralized label correcting algorithm is then proposed which leverages these\nresults to prune candidate input signals from the search when their cost is\ngreater than related signals.\n  The second part of this thesis addresses admissible heuristics for\nkinodynamic motion planning. An admissibility condition is derived that can be\nused to verify the admissibility of candidate heuristics for a particular\nproblem. This condition also characterizes a convex set of admissible\nheuristics.\n  A linear program is formulated to obtain a heuristic which is as close to the\noptimal cost-to-go as possible while remaining admissible. This optimization is\njustified by showing its solution coincides with the solution to the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Lastly, a sum-of-squares relaxation of this\ninfinite-dimensional linear program is proposed for obtaining provably\nadmissible approximate solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 18:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

In this work, we reduce the training complexity of CNNs by replacing\ncertain weight kernels of a CNN with Gabor filters. The convolutional layers\nuse the Gabor filters as fixed weight kernels, which extracts intrinsic\nfeatures, with regular trainable weight kernels. This combination creates a\nbalanced system that gives better training performance in terms of energy and\ntime, compared to the standalone CNN (without any Gabor kernels), in exchange\nfor tolerable accuracy degradation.

The absolute temperature scale is a critical\nmeasurement for much of ALMA solar science, including the understanding of\nenergy transfer through the solar atmosphere, the properties of prominences,\nand the study of shock heating in the chromosphere. In order to provide an\nabsolute temperature scale, ALMA solar observing will take advantage of the\nremarkable fast-scanning capabilities of the ALMA 12m dishes to make\nsingle-dish maps of the full Sun.

Here, we propose a\nfamily of complexity measures for time series based on a generalization of the\ncomplexity-entropy causality plane. By replacing the Shannon entropy by a\nmono-parametric entropy (Tsallis $q$-entropy) and after considering the proper\ngeneralization of the statistical complexity ($q$-complexity), we build up a\nparametric curve (the $q$-complexity-entropy curve) that is used for\ncharacterizing/classifying time series. Based on simple exact results and\nnumerical simulations of stochastic processes, we show that these curves can\ndistinguish among different long-range, short-range and oscillating correlated\nbehaviors. Also, we verify that simulated chaotic and stochastic time series\ncan be distinguished based on whether these curves are open or closed. We\nfurther test this technique in experimental scenarios related to chaotic laser\nintensity, stock price, sunspot, and geomagnetic dynamics, confirming its\nusefulness. Finally, we prove that these curves enhance the automatic\nclassification of time series with long-range correlations and interbeat\nintervals of healthy subjects and patients with heart disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 01:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

First we find that the lepton\nflavor symmetry structure becomes less manifest in the light neutrino masses in\nthe seesaw mechanism, and this tendency becomes most prominent when\nright-handed neutrinos are degenerate. Secondly, the Dirac CP phase turns out\nto be sensitive to whether the shift symmetry breaking depends on the lepton\nflavor symmetry. When the flavor symmetry is imposed only on the stabilizer\nYukawa couplings, distributions of the CP phases are peaked at $\\delta \\simeq\n\\pm \\pi/4, \\pm 3\\pi/4$ and $\\alpha = 0$, while the vanishing and maximal Dirac\nCP phases are disfavored. On the other hand, when the flavor symmetry is\nimposed on both the inflaton and stabilizer Yukawa couplings, it is rather\ndifficult to explain the observed neutrino data, and those parameters\nconsistent with the observation prefer the vanishing CP phases $\\delta = 0,\n\\pi$ and $\\alpha = 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 07:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 03:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

A key issue\nwith plasma mirrors is the need for a high carrier concentration, of order\n10^21 cm^-3, to achieve an appreciable reflectivity. To generate such high\ncarrier concentrations, short laser pulses with extreme power densities of the\norder >10^15 W/cm^2 are required. Here, we introduce a novel waveguide-based\nmethod for generating relativistically moving plasma mirrors that requires much\nlower pump powers and much less carrier concentration. Specifically, we achieve\nan experimental demonstration of 35% reflection for a carrier concentration of\n5*10^17/cm^3 generated by a power density of only 1.2*10^9 W/cm^2. Both the\nplasma mirror and the signal are confined and propagating within a solid state\nsilicon slow light photonic crystal waveguide. This extraordinary effect only\nbecomes possible because we exploit an indirect intraband optical transition in\na dispersion engineered slow light waveguide, where the incident light cannot\ncouple to other states beyond the moving front and has to reflect from it. The\nmoving free carrier (FC) plasma mirror is generated by two photon absorption of\n6 ps long pump pulse with a peak power of 6.2 W. The reflection was\ndemonstrated by the interaction of a continuous wave (CW) probe wave\nco-propagating with the relativistic FC plasma mirror inside a 400 micro-meter\nlong slow light waveguide. Upon interaction with the FC plasma mirror, the\nprobe wave packets, which initially propagate slower than the plasma mirror,\nare bounced and accelerated, finally escaping from the front in forward\ndirection. The forward reflection of the probe wave packets are accompanied by\na frequency upshift. The reflection efficiency is estimated for the part of the\nCW probe interacting with the pump pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 11:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Located\nnext to active region 12335, the sigmoidal filament was observed by the\nground-based H$\\alpha$ telescopes from GONG and by AIA aboard SDO. The filament\noscillations were most probably triggered by the magnetic reconnection in the\nfilament channel. The directions of oscillations have angles of\n4$^\\circ$-36$^\\circ$ with respect to the filament axis. The whole filament did\nnot oscillate in phase as a rigid body. Meanwhile, the periods (3100$-$4400 s)\nof oscillations have a spatial dependence. The values of $R$ are estimated to\nbe 69.4$-$133.9 Mm, and the minimum transverse magnetic field of the dips is\nestimated to be 15 G. The amplitudes of S5-S8 grew with time, while the\namplitudes of S9-S14 damped with time. The amplitudes of oscillations range\nfrom a few to ten Mm, and the maximal velocity can reach 30 km s$^{-1}$.\nInterestingly, the filament experienced mass drainage southwards at a speed of\n$\\sim$27 km s$^{-1}$. The oscillations continued after the mass drainage and\nlasted for more than 11 hr. After the mass drainage, the phases of oscillations\ndid not change a lot.

Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in\nmany practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden\nMarkov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image\nsegmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process.\nThis modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function. Conjugate\nGradient algorithm (CG) is one of the best known optimization techniques. This\npaper proposes the use of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) for image\nsegmentation, based on the Hidden Markov Random Field. Since derivatives are\nnot available for this expression, finite differences are used in the CG\nalgorithm to approximate the first derivative. The approach is evaluated using\na number of publicly available images, where ground truth is known. The Dice\nCoefficient is used as an objective criterion to measure the quality of\nsegmentation.

We propose to combine\nthis approach with the original Im2GPS approach in which a query image is\nmatched against a database of geotagged images and the location is inferred\nfrom the retrieved set. We estimate the geographic location of a query image by\napplying kernel density estimation to the locations of its nearest neighbors in\nthe reference database. Interestingly, we find that the best features for our\nretrieval task are derived from networks trained with classification loss even\nthough we do not use a classification approach at test time.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that forms coalitions of\nagents, called prosumers, that both produce and consume. It is designed to be\nused by aggregators that aim at selling the aggregated surplus of production of\nthe prosumers they control. We rely on real weather data sampled across\nstations of a given territory in order to simulate realistic production and\nconsumption patterns for each prosumer. This approach enables us to capture\ngeographical correlations among the agents while preserving the diversity due\nto different behaviors. As aggregators are bound to the grid operator by a\ncontract, they seek to maximize their offer while minimizing their risk. The\nproposed graph based algorithm takes the underlying correlation structure of\nthe agents into account and outputs coalitions with both high productivity and\nlow variability. We show then that the resulting diversified coalitions are\nable to generate higher benefits on a constrained energy market, and are more\nresilient to random failures of the agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 14:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

To realize\nefficient power transfer, the system is typically brought to resonance, and the\ncoupled-antenna mode is optimized to reduce radiation into the surrounding\nspace. In this scheme, any modification of the receiver position or of its\nelectromagnetic properties results in the necessity of dynamically tuning the\nwhole system to restore the resonant matching condition. It implies poor\nrobustness to the receiver location and load impedance, as well as additional\nenergy consumption in the control network. In this study, we introduce a new\nparadigm for wireless power delivery based on which the whole system, including\ntransmitter and receiver and the space in between, forms a unified microwave\npower generator. In our proposed scenario the load itself becomes part of the\ngenerator. Microwave oscillations are created directly at the receiver\nlocation, eliminating the need for dynamical tuning of the system within the\nrange of the self-oscillation regime. The proposed concept has relevant\nconnections with the recent interest in parity-time symmetric systems, in which\nbalanced loss and gain distributions enable unusual electromagnetic responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 13:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 17:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The lattice is designed\nto feature K point Dirac cones that are well separated from the other numerous\nelastic wave modes characterizing this continuous structure. We exploit the\narrangement of localized masses at the nodes to break mirror symmetry at the\nunit cell level, which opens a frequency bandgap. This produces a non-trivial\nband structure that supports topologically protected edge states along the\ninterface between two realizations of the lattice obtained through mirror\nsymmetry. Detailed numerical models support the investigations of the\noccurrence of the edge states, while their existence is verified through\nfull-field experimental measurements. The test results show the confinement of\nthe topologically protected edge states along pre-defined interfaces and\nillustrate the lack of significant backscattering at sharp corners. Experiments\nconducted on a trivial waveguide in an otherwise uniformly periodic lattice\nreveal the inability of a perturbation to propagate and its sensitivity to\nbackscattering, which suggests the superior waveguiding performance of the\nclass of non-trivial interfaces investigated herein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 15:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}
