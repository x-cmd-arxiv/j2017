To address this issue, software engineers may\nuse specification mining techniques, which can automatically derive models that\ncapture the behavior of the system under analysis. So far, most specification\nmining techniques focused on the functional behavior of the systems, with\nspecific emphasis on models that represent the ordering of operations, such as\ntempo- ral rules and finite state models. Although useful, these models are\ninherently partial. For instance, they miss the timing behavior, which is\nextremely relevant for many classes of systems and com- ponents, such as shared\nlibraries and user-driven applications. Mining specifications that include both\nthe functional and the timing aspects can improve the applicability of many\ntesting and analysis solutions. This paper addresses this challenge by\npresenting the Timed k-Tail (TkT) specification mining technique that can mine\ntimed automata from program traces. Since timed automata can effectively\nrepresent the interplay between the functional and the timing behavior of a\nsystem, TkT could be exploited in those contexts where time-related information\nis relevant. Our empirical evaluation shows that TkT can efficiently and\neffectively mine accurate models. The mined models have been used to identify\nexecutions with anomalous timing. The evaluation shows that most of the\nanomalous executions have been correctly identified while producing few false\npositives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 16:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Res. 52 5167 (2016)]. The results agree with simulations of a diffusion\nequation with constant pressure at one of the borders of those fractals, but\nthe exponent n is very different from the anomalous exponent nu=1/D_W of single\nparticle diffusion in the same fractals (D_W is the random walk dimension).\nHere we use a scaling approach to show that those exponents are related as\nn=nu(D_F-D_B), where D_F and D_B are the fractal dimensions of the bulk and of\nthe border from which diffusing particles come, respectively. This relation is\nsupported by accurate numerical estimates in two SCs and in two generalized\nMenger sponges (MSs), in which we performed simulations of single particle\nrandom walks (RWs) with a rigid impermeable border and of a diffusive\ninfiltration model in which that border is permanently filled with diffusing\nparticles.

We also show that the\nmean-square displacement of single particle RWs has log-periodic oscillations,\nwhose periods are similar for fractals with the same scaling factor in the\ngenerator (even with different embedding dimensions), which is consistent with\nthe discrete scale invariance scenario. The roughness of a diffusion front\ndefined in the infiltration problem also shows this type of oscillation, which\nis enhanced in fractals with narrow channels between large lacunas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 17:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

We show that the interplay between curvature energy,\nentropic forces, and the geometric constraints on the membrane can result in\nthe formation of patterns of highly-curved/protein-rich and\nweakly-curved/protein-poor domains on the membrane. The spontaneous formation\nof such patterns can be triggered either by an increase in the average density\nof curvature-inducing proteins, or by a relaxation of the geometric constraints\non the membrane imposed by the membrane tension or by the tethering of the\nmembrane to a rigid cell wall or cortex. These parameters can also be tuned to\nselect the size and number of the protein-rich domains that arise upon pattern\nformation.

In\nour application of TPRN, internal representations learned by end-to-end\noptimization in a deep neural network performing a textual question-answering\n(QA) task can be interpreted using basic concepts from linguistic theory. No\nperformance penalty need be paid for this increased interpretability: the\nproposed model performs comparably to a state-of-the-art system on the SQuAD QA\ntask. The internal representation which is interpreted is a Tensor Product\nRepresentation: for each input word, the model selects a symbol to encode the\nword, and a role in which to place the symbol, and binds the two together. The\nselection is via soft attention. The overall interpretation is built from\ninterpretations of the symbols, as recruited by the trained model, and\ninterpretations of the roles as used by the model. We find support for our\ninitial hypothesis that symbols can be interpreted as lexical-semantic word\nmeanings, while roles can be interpreted as approximations of grammatical roles\n(or categories) such as subject, wh-word, determiner, etc. Fine-grained\nanalysis reveals specific correspondences between the learned roles and parts\nof speech as assigned by a standard tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003), and finds\nseveral discrepancies in the model's favor.

Using the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we find that this relationship arises because a single massive\nmassive progenitor contributes the bulk of the mass to the accreted stellar\ncomponent as well as sets its metallicity. Moreover, in the Illustris\nsimulations, this relationship extends over 3 orders of magnitude in accreted\nstellar mass for central galaxies. We show that for Milky Way-like mass\ngalaxies, the scatter in accreted metallicity at a fixed accreted stellar mass\nencodes information about the stellar mass of the dominant accreted progenitor,\nwhile the radial density and metallicity gradients of the accreted stellar\ncomponent encodes information about the time of accretion of the dominant\nprogenitor.

To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we\nuse a semi-analytic model to quantify the \"observational bias\" that RPS\nintroduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral\nfield spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic\ndisks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at\nz=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of\n-0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a\nmean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas\nremoval and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low\nmass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the\nmore massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS\nproduces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of -0.05 log(M_*/M_sun)/Mpc.\nThis mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient\nof -0.03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher\nmetallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z=0.35.

At this instant, the velocity becomes\nmulti-valued and the density singular. Shell-crossing is well understood in one\ndimension (1D), but not in higher dimensions. This paper is about\nquasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) flow that depends on all three coordinates but\ndiffers only slightly from a strictly 1D flow, thereby allowing a perturbative\ntreatment of shell-crossing using the Euler--Poisson equations written in\nLagrangian coordinates. The signature of shell-crossing is then just the\nvanishing of the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, a regular perturbation\nproblem. In essence the problem of the first shell-crossing, which is highly\nsingular in Eulerian coordinates, has been desingularized by switching to\nLagrangian coordinates, and can then be handled by perturbation theory. Here,\nall-order recursion relations are obtained for the time-Taylor coefficients of\nthe displacement field, and it is shown that the Taylor series has an infinite\nradius of convergence. This allows the determination of the time and location\nof the first shell-crossing, which is generically shown to be taking place\nearlier than for the unperturbed 1D flow.

Lansbury and collaborators recently completed a catalog of 497\nsources serendipitously detected in the 3-24 keV band using 13 deg2 of NuSTAR\ncoverage. Here, we report on an optical and X-ray study of 16 Galactic sources\nin the catalog. We identify eight of them as stars (but some or all could have\nbinary companions), and use information from Gaia to report distances and X-ray\nluminosities for three of them. There are four CVs or CV candidates, and we\nargue that NuSTAR J233426-2343.9 is a relatively strong CV candidate based\npartly on an X-ray spectrum from XMM-Newton. NuSTAR J092418-3142.2, which is\nthe brightest serendipitous source in the Lansbury catalog, and NuSTAR\nJ073959-3147.8 are LMXB candidates, but it is also possible that these two\nsources are CVs. One of the sources is a known HMXB, and NuSTAR J105008-5958.8\nis a new HMXB candidate, which has strong Balmer emission lines in its optical\nspectrum and a hard X-ray spectrum. We discuss the implications of finding\nthese HMXBs for the surface density (logN-logS) and luminosity function of\nGalactic HMXBs. We conclude that, with the large fraction of unclassified\nsources in the Galactic plane detected by NuSTAR in the 8-24 keV band, there\ncould be a significant population of low luminosity HMXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 18:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The main\nidea is to incorporate a parallel path that sends representations of input\nvalues forward to deeper network layers. This scheme is substantially different\nfrom \"deep supervision\" in which the loss layer is re-introduced to earlier\nlayers. The parallel path provided by fast-forwarding enhances the training\nprocess in two ways. First, it enables the individual layers to combine\nhigher-level information (from the standard processing path) with lower-level\ninformation (from the fast-forward path). Second, this new architecture reduces\nthe problem of vanishing gradients substantially because the fast-forwarding\npath provides a shorter route for gradient backpropagation. In order to\nevaluate the utility of the proposed technique, a Fast-Forward Network (FFNet),\nwith 20 convolutional layers along with parallel fast-forward paths, has been\ncreated and tested. The paper presents empirical results that demonstrate\nimproved learning capacity of FFNet due to fast-forwarding, as compared to\nGoogLeNet (with deep supervision) and CaffeNet, which are 4x and 18x larger in\nsize, respectively.

A coherent eddy diffusivity is derived to quantify the contribution of\nRCLVs to meridional transport; it is found that RCLVs contribute less than 1%\nto net meridional dispersion and diffusion in this sector, implying that eddy\ntransport of tracers is mostly due to incoherent motions, such as swirling and\nfilamentation outside of the eddy cores, rather than coherent meridional\ntranslation of eddies themselves.

The overall method produces solutions of good quality on the\nclassical benchmark instances and scales very well with an increase of problem\nsize. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to measure the\nrespective contribution of each proposed neighborhood. In particular, the\n0-cost moves and the large neighborhood based on set covering contribute very\nsignificantly to the search.

This view, however, largely\noverlooks the free energy gain following passive cross-linker binding, which,\neven in the absence of active fluctuations, provides a thermodynamic drive\ntowards highly overlapping filamentous states. In this work, we shed light on\nthis phenomenon, showing that passive cross-linkers, when considered in the\ncontext of two anti-parallel filaments, generate noticeable contractile forces.\nHowever, as binding free energy of cross-linkers is increased, a sharp onset of\nkinetic arrest follows, greatly diminishing effectiveness of this contractility\nmechanism, allowing the network to contract only with weakly resisting tensions\nat its boundary. We have carried out stochastic simulations elucidating this\nmechanism, followed by a mean-field treatment that predicts how contractile\nforces asymptotically scale at small and large binding energies, respectively.\nFurthermore, when considering an active contractile filament pair, based on\nnon-muscle myosin II, we found that the non-processive nature of these motors\nleads to highly inefficient force generation, due to recoil slippage of the\noverlap during periods when the motor is dissociated. However, we discovered\nthat passive cross-linkers can serve as a structural ratchet during these\nunbound motor time spans, resulting in vast force amplification. Our results\nshed light on the non-equilibrium effects of transiently binding proteins in\nbiological active matter, as observed in the non-muscle actin cytoskeleton,\nshowing that highly efficient contractile force dipoles result from synergy of\npassive cross-linker and active motor dynamics, via a ratcheting mechanism on a\nfunneled energy landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 19:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Candidate\nconfigurations explored by the algorithm are trained to a small number of\nepochs, and only the most promising candidates receive full training. The\nperformance of the proposed methodology is assessed on benchmark sets and in\nthe context of predicting drug-drug interactions, showing promising results.\nThe optimization tool used in this paper is open-source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 20:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

The Dynamically\nOrthogonal (DO) approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which\nthe corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original\nsystem dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold. The embedded geometry\nof the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed. The curvature of the\nmanifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through\nthe study of the Weingarten map. Differentiability results for the orthogonal\nprojection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit\ndynamical system for tracking the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\nof a time-dependent matrix. It is demonstrated that the error made by the DO\napproximation remains controlled under the minimal condition that the original\nsolution stays close to the low rank manifold, which translates into an\nexplicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values. The DO\napproximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies\ninstantaneously the SVD truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the\nreduced solution. Riemannian matrix optimization is investigated in this\nextrinsic framework to provide algorithms that adaptively update the best low\nrank approximation of a smoothly varying matrix. The related gradient flow\nprovides a dynamical system that converges to the truncated SVD of an input\nmatrix for almost every initial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 20:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

In this paper, we\nconsider a stochastic model and show that it is possible to obtain good welfare\nand revenue guarantees with simple mechanisms that do not make use of the\ninformation on some of these parameters. In particular, we prove that a\nmechanism that sets the same price per time step for jobs of any length\nachieves at least 50% of the welfare and revenue obtained by a mechanism that\ncan set different prices for jobs of different lengths, and the ratio can be\nimproved if we have more specific knowledge of some parameters.

In this study,\nwe simulate populations of young stars to investigate whether this apparent\ndependence of estimated age on spectral type may be explained by the star\nformation history of the association. Solar and intermediate mass stars begin\ntheir pre-main sequence evolution on the Hayashi track, with fully convective\ninteriors and cool photospheres. Intermediate mass stars quickly heat up and\ntransition onto the radiative Henyey track. As a consequence, for clusters in\nwhich star formation occurs on a similar timescale as the transition from a\nconvective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages\nare calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass.

Second, a new distribution approach is\npresented to further improve the security of these algorithms.

We consider two-stage\nvariable selection techniques (TVS) in which the first stage uses bridge\nestimators to obtain an estimate of the regression coefficients, and the second\nstage simply thresholds this estimate to select the \"important\" predictors. The\nasymptotic false discovery proportion (AFDP) and true positive proportion\n(ATPP) of these TVS are evaluated. We prove that for a fixed ATPP, in order to\nobtain a smaller AFDP, one should pick a bridge estimator with smaller\nasymptotic mean square error in the first stage of TVS. Based on such\nprincipled discovery, we present a sharp comparison of different TVS, via an\nin-depth investigation of the estimation properties of bridge estimators.\nRather than \"order-wise\" error bounds with loose constants, our analysis\nfocuses on precise error characterization. Various interesting signal-to-noise\nratio and sparsity settings are studied. Our results offer new and thorough\ninsights into high-dimensional variable selection. For instance, we prove that\na TVS with Ridge in its first stage outperforms TVS with other bridge\nestimators in large noise settings; two-stage LASSO becomes inferior when the\nsignal is rare and weak.

Accordingly, developing an\nultra-low-cost alternative, affordable even to groups at the bottom of the\neconomic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative. Against this backdrop,\nwe propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram(ECG)\nmonitoring service. Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring\nof premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could\nindicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia. Note that a traditional\ntelecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional\ndiagnostic centre without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic\naccuracy of a bedside setup, albeit at high bandwidth cost. In this context, we\naim at reducing cost without significantly sacrificing reliability. To this\nend, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that detects with high sensitivity\nthe anomalous beats only which are then transmitted. We further compress those\ntransmitted beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable\nreconstruction/diagnostic fidelity. Such a scheme would not only reduce the\noverall bandwidth requirement, but also localising anomalous beats, thereby\nreducing physicians' burden. Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on\nMIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed\nsystem. In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC\nin one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than\n9% (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99.15%\nreduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118-fold savings over traditional\ntelecardiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 06:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

Here we present precise data on 144 Taurid fireballs observed by\nnew digital cameras of the European Fireball Network in the enhanced activity\nyear 2015. Orbits of 113 fireballs show common characteristics and form\ntogether a well defined orbital structure, which we call new branch. We found\nthat this branch is characterized by longitudes of perihelia lying between\n155.9-160o and latitudes of perihelia between 4.2-5.7o. Semimajor axes are\nbetween 2.23-2.28 AU and indeed overlap with the 7:2 resonance. Eccentricities\nare in wide range 0.80-0.90. The orbits form a concentric ring in the inner\nsolar system. The masses of the observed meteoroids were in a wide range from\n0.1 g to more than 1000 kg. We found that all meteoroids larger than 300 g were\nvery fragile, while those smaller than 30 g were much more compact. Based on\norbital characteristics, we argue that asteroids 2015 TX24 and 2005 UR, both of\ndiameters 200-300 meters, are direct members of the new branch. It is therefore\nvery likely that the new branch contains also numerous still not discovered\nobjects of decameter or even larger size. Since asteroids of sizes of tens to\nhundreds meters pose a treat to the ground even if they are intrinsically weak,\nimpact hazard increases significantly when the Earth encounters the Taurid new\nbranch every few years. Further studies leading to better description of this\nreal source of potentially hazardous objects, which can be large enough to\ncause significant regional or even continental damage on the Earth, are\ntherefore extremely important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 07:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Several earlier investigations examined vorticity production\nin simpler systems; here all the relevant processes can be considered\nsimultaneously. We also investigate the mechanisms for the generation of net\nhelicity and large-scale flow in the system.

Reversing the sign of shear vs.\nrotation allows us to separate the rotation- and shear-generated contributions.\nAs in earlier studies, we find the generation of significant amounts of\nvorticity, with on average 65% of the kinetic energy being in the rotational\nmodes. The vorticity production can be related to the baroclinicity of the\nflow, especially in the regions of hot, dilute clustered supernova bubbles. In\nthese regions, the vortex stretching acts as a sink of vorticity. The net\nhelicities produced by rotation and shear are of opposite signs for physically\nmotivated rotation laws, with the solar neighbourhood parameters resulting in\nthe near cancellation of the total net helicity.

A famous algorithm by Lenstra solves ILPs in time that is\nexponential only in the dimension of the program, and polynomial in the size of\nthe ILP. That algorithm became a ubiquitous tool in the design of\nfixed-parameter algorithms for NP-hard problems, where one wishes to isolate\nthe hardness of a problemby some parameter. However, in many cases using\nLenstra's algorithm has two drawbacks: First, the run time of the resulting\nalgorithms is often doubly-exponential in the parameter, and second, an ILP\nformulation in small dimension cannot easily express problems involving many\ndifferent costs.\n  Inspired by the work of Hemmecke, Onn and Romanchuk [Math.

We then apply\nour algorithm to a few representative problems like Closest String, Swap\nBribery, Weighted Set Multicover, and obtain exponential speedups in the\ndependence on the respective parameters, the input size, or both.\n  Unlike Lenstra's algorithm, which is essentially a bounded search tree\nalgorithm, our result uses the technique of augmenting steps. At its heart is a\ndeep result stating that in combinatorial n-fold IPs, existence of an\naugmenting step implies existence of a \\local\" augmenting step, which can be\nfound using dynamic programming. Our results provide an important insight into\nmany problems by showing that they exhibit this phenomenon, and highlights the\nimportance of augmentation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 08:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 19:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

They normally operate at low copy numbers and\nin spatial settings, but this is often ignored and well-stirred conditions are\nassumed. Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that even microscopic spatial\ninhomogeneities oftentimes can induce significant differences on the\nmacroscopic level. Since experimental observation of single-molecule behavior\nis extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the\nsingle-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in\nbiochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable\nhere, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical\nprocesses with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different\ntechniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and\nexplain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and\nefficient. We illustrate non-negligible accuracy issues arising even in the\nmost simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal\nwith them. We first explain how Brownian Dynamics, a widely used particle-based\ndiffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to\nincorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate\non this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation\nmethods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with\nsituation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a\ncomputationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical\nfunctions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion\nwith large jumps in time and space. We end by briefly presenting recent\ndevelopments in the field of spatial-stochastic biochemical simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 09:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

For M-type AGB stars, the\nnature of the wind-driving dust species has been a matter of intense debate. A\nproposed source of the radiation pressure triggering the outflows is photon\nscattering on Fe-free silicate grains. This wind-driving mechanism requires\ngrain radii of about 0.1 - 1 micron in order to make the dust particles\nefficient at scattering radiation around the stellar flux maximum. Grain size\nis therefore an important parameter for understanding the physics behind the\nwinds of M-type AGB stars. We seek to investigate the diagnostic potential of\nscattered polarized light for determining dust grain sizes. We have developed a\nnew tool for computing synthetic images of scattered light in dust and gas\nshells around AGB stars, which can be applied to detailed models of dynamical\natmospheres and dust-driven winds. We present maps of polarized light using\ndynamical models computed with the DARWIN code. The synthetic images clearly\nshow that the intensity of the polarized light, the position of the inner edge\nof the dust shell, and the size of the dust grains near the inner edge are all\nchanging with the luminosity phase. Non-spherical structures in the dust shells\ncan also have an impact on the polarized light. We simulate this effect by\ncombining different pulsation phases into a single 3D structure before\ncomputing synthetic images. An asymmetry of the circumstellar envelope can\ncreate a net polarization, which can be used as diagnostics for the grain size.\nThe ratio between the size of the scattering particles and the observed\nwavelength determines at what wavelengths net polarization switches direction.\nIf observed, this can be used to constrain average particle sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 11:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

However, the\nrelationship between Lisp and SNMP haven't been studied enough during past 20\nyears.\n  The cl-net-snmp project has developed a new Common Lisp package which\nimplemented the SNMP protocol. On client side, it can be used to query remote\nSNMP peers, and on server side, it brings SNMP capability into Common Lisp\nbased applications, which could be monitored from remote through any SNMP-based\nmanagement system. It's also a flexible platform for researches on network\nmanagement and SNMP itself.

During the development, an general ASN.1 compiler and runtime\npackage and an portable UDP networking package are also implemented, which\nwould be useful for other related projects.\n  In this paper, the author first introduces the SNMP protocol and a quick\ntutorial of cl-net-snmp on both client and server sides, and then the Lisp\nnative design and the implementation details of the ASN.1 and SNMP package,\nespecially the \"code generation\"' approach on compiling SNMP MIB definitions\nfrom ASN.1 into Common Lisp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 11:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

During\ntheir 3 dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid\ncollisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak\nlong-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in\nboth space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred\nvalue, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range\nattraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents\nin space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space\nrequires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy\nof the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion,\nfriction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical\nseparation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays\nare inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus,\nnext we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that\nthe amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not\nsufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes\nthe transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that\nordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than\nto uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing\ninteraction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate,\nwhereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model\ndiscussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled\nphenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of\nlarge flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

Topography of a surface is directly related to the range difference\nbetween two antennas configured at different positions. Doppler-SAR is a novel\nimaging modality that uses ultra-narrowband continuous waves (UNCW). It takes\nadvantage of high resolution Doppler information provided by UNCWs to form high\nresolution SAR images.\n  We introduced the theory of Doppler-SAR interferometry.

These methods update the weights using\ntheir gradient, estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has\nbeen observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent\ndegradation in generalization performance - known as the \"generalization gap\"\nphenomena. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an\nopen problem.\n  Contributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We\nfind that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically\nwith the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a \"random walk on\nrandom landscape\" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar\n\"ultra-slow\" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted\nexperiments to show empirically that the \"generalization gap\" stems from the\nrelatively small number of updates rather than the batch size, and can be\ncompletely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further\ninvestigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and\npresent a novel algorithm named \"Ghost Batch Normalization\" which enables\nsignificant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of\nupdates.

The outcome is determined by whether the word\nobtained by concatenating the letters $B$ picked lies in a prescribed target\nset $X$ (a win for player $A$) or not (a win for player $B$). Typically, we\nconsider $X$ to be a subshift. The winning shift $W(X)$ of a subshift $X$ is\ndefined as the set of choice sequences for which $A$ has a winning strategy\nwhen the target set is the language of $X$. The winning shift $W(X)$ mirrors\nsome properties of $X$.

Such approaches typically find a set of local\nanchors that indicate plausible matches between substrings of a read to\nsubpaths of the graph. These anchor matches are then combined to form a\n(semi-local) alignment of the complete read on a subpath. Co-linear chaining is\nan algorithmically rigorous approach to combine the anchors. It is a well-known\napproach for the case of two sequences as inputs. Here we extend the approach\nso that one of the inputs can be a directed acyclic graph (DAGs), e.g. a\nsplicing graph in transcriptomics or a variant graph in pan-genomics.\n  This extension to DAGs turns out to have a tight connection to the minimum\npath cover problem, asking for a minimum-cardinality set of paths that cover\nall the nodes of a DAG. We study the case when the size $k$ of a minimum path\ncover is small, which is often the case in practice. First, we propose an\nalgorithm for finding a minimum path cover of a DAG $(V,E)$ in $O(k|E|\\log|V|)$\ntime, improving all known time-bounds when $k$ is small and the DAG is not too\ndense. Second, we introduce a general technique for extending dynamic\nprogramming (DP) algorithms from sequences to DAGs. This is enabled by our\nminimum path cover algorithm, and works by mimicking the DP algorithm for\nsequences on each path of the minimum path cover. This technique generally\nproduces algorithms that are slower than their counterparts on sequences only\nby a factor $k$. Our technique can be applied, for example, to the classical\nlongest increasing subsequence and longest common subsequence problems,\nextended to labeled DAGs. Finally, we apply this technique to the co-linear\nchaining problem. We also implemented the new co-linear chaining approach.\nExperiments on splicing graphs show that the new method is efficient also in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 13:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 08:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 11:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

This contribution tackles this\nchallenge by combining a Bayesian filtering technique for environment\nrepresentation, and machine learning as long-term predictor. More specifically,\na dynamic occupancy grid map is utilized as input to a deep convolutional\nneural network. This yields the advantage of using spatially distributed\nvelocity estimates from a single time step for prediction, rather than a raw\ndata sequence, alleviating common problems dealing with input time series of\nmultiple sensors.

The main\ncharacteristics of the powerful energy recovery linac experiment facility\n(PERLE) are derived from the design of the Large Hadron electron Collider, an\nelectron beam upgrade under study for the LHC, for which it would be the key\ndemonstrator. PERLE is thus projected as a facility to investigate efficient,\nhigh current (> 10 mA) ERL operation with three re-circulation passages through\nnewly designed SCRF cavities, at 801.58 MHz frequency, and following\ndeceleration over another three re-circulations.

A\nphysics programme possibly associated with PERLE is sketched, consisting of\nhigh precision elastic electron-proton scattering experiments, as well as\nphoto-nuclear reactions of unprecedented intensities with up to 30 MeV photon\nbeam energy as may be obtained using Fabry-Perot cavities.

Besides a chapter on operation aspects, the report\ncontains detailed considerations on the choices for the SCRF structure, optics\nand lattice design, solutions for arc magnets, source and injector and on\nfurther essential components. A suitable configuration derived from the here\npresented design concept may next be moved forward to a technical design and\npossibly be built by an international collaboration which is being established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 14:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Reliable metallicity values for M dwarfs are important for studies\nof the chemical evolution and advancement of planet formation theory in\nlow-mass environments. Historically the determination of stellar parameters of\nlow-mass stars has been challenging due to the low surface temperature, causing\nseveral molecules to form in the photospheric layers. In our work we use the\nfact that infrared high-resolution spectrographs have opened up a new window\nfor investigating M dwarfs.\n  Aims. Metallicity determination using high-resolution spectra is more\naccurate than the use of low-resolution spectra, but rather time-consuming. In\nthis paper we expand our sample analyzed with this precise method both in\nmetallicity and effective temperature in order to build up a calibration sample\nfor a future revised empirical calibration.\n  Methods. Because of the relatively few molecular lines in the J-band,\ncontinuum rectification is possible for high-resolution spectra, allowing the\nstellar parameters to be determined with greater accuracy than using optical\nspectra. The metallicity was determined using synthetic spectral fitting of\nseveral atomic species.\n  Results. We have analyzed sixteen targets, with a range of effective\ntemperature from 3350-4550 K. The resulting metallicities lie between -0.5 <\n[M/H] < +0.4. A few targets have previously been analyzed using low-resolution\nspectra, and we find a rather good agreement with our values. A comparison with\navailable photometric calibrations shows varying agreement, and the spread\nwithin all empirical calibrations is large.\n  Conclusions. Including the targets from our previous paper, we have analyzed\n28 M dwarfs using high-resolution infrared spectra. The targets spread\napproximately one dex in metallicity and 1400 K in effective temperature. For\nindividual M dwarfs we achieve uncertainties of 0.05 dex and 100 K on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 14:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Detailed\nanalysis unravels the mechanisms involving the competition between the\nstretching-induced upshift of the highest occupied molecular orbital-related\nstates toward the Fermi level of electrodes and the deterioration of\nmolecule-electrode electronic couplings in different contact CN cases.\nMoreover, we experimentally find a higher chance to observe the conductance\nenhancement mode under a faster elongation speed, which is explained by ab\ninitio molecular dynamics simulations that reveal an important role of thermal\nfluctuations in aiding deformations of contacts into low-coordination\nconfigurations that include monoatomic Au chains.

While the concept of\nfunction enrichment as an efficient discretization technique for turbulent\nboundary layers has been proposed in an earlier article by Krank & Wall (J.\nComput. Phys. 316 (2016) 94-116), the contribution of this work is a rigorous\nderivation of a new multiscale turbulence modeling approach and a corresponding\ndiscontinuous Galerkin discretization scheme. In the near-wall area, the\nNavier-Stokes equations are explicitly solved for an LES and a RANS component\nin one single equation. This is done by providing the Galerkin method with an\nindependent set of shape functions for each of these two methods; the standard\nhigh-order polynomial basis resolves turbulent eddies where the mesh is\nsufficiently fine and the enrichment automatically computes the\nensemble-averaged flow if the LES mesh is too coarse. As a result of the\nderivation, the RANS model is consistently applied solely to the RANS degrees\nof freedom, which effectively prevents the typical issue of a log-layer\nmismatch in attached boundary layers. As the full Navier-Stokes equations are\nsolved in the boundary layer, spatial refinement gradually yields wall-resolved\nLES with exact boundary conditions. Numerical tests show the outstanding\ncharacteristics of the wall model regarding grid independence, superiority\ncompared to equilibrium wall models in separated flows, and achieve a speed-up\nby two orders of magnitude compared to wall-resolved LES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 15:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 14:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The problem of\nexistence and optimal cardinality of uniform generators has lead us to new\nchallenges in the theory of symbolic extensions. At the beginning we show that\nuniform generators can be identified with so-called symbolic extensions with an\nembedding, i.e., symbolic extensions admitting an equivariant measurable\nselector from preimages. From here we focus on such extensions and we strive to\ncharacterize the collection of the corresponding extension entropy functions on\ninvariant measures. For aperiodic zero-dimensional systems we show that this\ncollection coincides with that of extension entropy functions in arbitrary\nsymbolic extensions, which, by the general theory of symbolic extensions, is\nknown to coincide with the collection of all affine superenvelopes of the\nentropy structure of the system. In particular, we recover, after [Bu16], that\nan aperiodic zero-dimensional system is asymptotically h- expansive if and only\nif it admits an isomorphic symbolic extension. Next we pass to systems with\nperiodic points, and we introduce the notion of a period tail structure, which\ncaptures the local growth rate of periodic orbits. Finally, we succeed in\nprecisely identifying the wanted collection of extension entropy functions in\nsymbolic extensions with an embedding: these are all the affine superenvelopes\nof the usual entropy structure which lie above certain threshold function\ndetermined by the period tail structure. This characterization allows us, among\nother things, to give estimates (and in examples to compute precisely) the\noptimal cardinality of a uniform generator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 15:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

Various feedback conditions\nare investigated and optimum levels determined for narrowest linewidth and\nreduced timing jitter for both single and dual loop configurations.

It is here shown that further resolution\nimprovements can arise by relying on multiple receivers, to interpolate the\nsampled data along the low-bandwidth dimension. The ensuing multiple-sensor\ninterpolation is akin to recently introduced SPEN interleaving procedures,\nalbeit without requiring multiple shots.\n  Methods: By casting SPEN's spatial rasterization in k-space, it becomes\nevident that local k-data interpolations enabled by multiple receivers are akin\nto real-space interleaving of SPEN images. The practical implementation of such\nresolution-enhancing procedure becomes similar to those normally used in SMASH\nor SENSE, yet relaxing these methods' fold-over constraints.\n  Results: Experiments validating the theoretical expectations were carried out\non phantoms and human volunteers on a 3T scanner. The experiments showed the\nexpected resolution enhancement, at no cost in the sequence's complexity. With\nthe addition of multibanding and stimulated echo procedures, 48-slices\nfull-brain coverage could be recorded free from distortions at sub-mm\nresolution, in 3 sec.\n  Conclusion: Super-resolved SPEN with SENSE (SUSPENSE) achieves the goals of\nmulti-shot SPEN interleaving within one single scan, delivering single-shot\nsub-mm in-plane resolutions in scanners equipped with suitable multiple\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 09:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful method for\ninvestigation of glass, namely, of correlation of the structure-chemical\ncomposition. Therefore, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used for\nexamination of degradation processes in cloudy turquoise glass beads, which in\ncontrast to other color ones deteriorate especially strongly. Micro-X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometry of samples has shown that lead-potassium glass\nPbO-K$_2$O-SiO$_2$ with small amount of Cu and Sb was used for manufacture of\ncloudy turquoise beads. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study of the\nbeads at different stages of glass corrosion was carried out in the range from\n200 to 4000 cm$^{-1}$ in the attenuated total reflection mode. In all the\nspectra, we have observed shifts of two major absorption bands to low-frequency\nrange (~1000 and ~775 cm$^{-1}$) compared to ones typical for amorphous SiO2\n(~1100 and 800 cm$^{-1}$, respectively). Such an effect is connected with\nPb$^{2+}$ and K$^+$ appending to the glass network. The presence of a weak band\nat ~1630 cm$^{-1}$ in all the spectra is attributed to the adsorption of\nH$_2$O. After annealing of the beads, the band disappeared completely in less\ndeteriorated samples and became significantly weaker in more destroyed ones.\nBased on that we conclude that there is adsorbed molecular water on the beads.\nHowever, products of corrosion (e.g., alkali in the form of white crystals or\ndroplets of liquid alkali) were not observed on the glass surface.

Results of this modelling are presented\nfrom the following experiments: apatite fission-track age combined with apatite\nU-Th/He age; apatite fission-track confined track-length distribution plus\napatite U-Th/He age. The modelling precision using this method is related to\nthe relative errors of the apatite U-Th/He ages and the helium diffusion model.\nThis combination of apatite fission-track length and apatite U-Th/He ages has\nnot been implemented before but is presented here as an alternative way of\ndetermining thermal histories without the addition of apatite fission-track\nages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 06:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

The novelty in our approach is that it can be successfully applicable\nin variable background as well as static background and application of quantum\nPSO makes the algorithm runs lot faster where other basic PSO algorithm failed\nto do so due to heavy computation.In our approach firstly dominants points of\ntracked objects detected, then a group of particles form a swarm are\ninitialized randomly over the image search space and then start searching the\ncurvature connected between two consecutive dominant points until they satisfy\nfitness criteria. Obviously it is a Multi-Swarm approach as there are multiple\ndominant points, as they moves, the curvature moves and the curvature movement\nis tracked by the swarm throughout the video and eventually when the swarm\nreaches optimal solution , a bounding box drawn based on particles final\nposition.Experimental results demonstrate this proposed QPSO based method work\nefficiently and effectively in visual object tracking in both dynamic and\nstatic environments and run time shows that it runs closely 90% faster than\nbasic PSO.in our approach we also apply parallelism using MatLab Parfor command\nto show how very less number of iteration and swarm size will enable us to\nsuccessfully track object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 10:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

High performance and extreme energy efficiency are\ncritical for deployments of CNNs in a wide range of situations, especially\nmobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal\nassistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator\narchitecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting\nthe zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and\nzero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator applied during\ninference. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining\nthe sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates\nunnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the\nSCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations\nto the multiplier array, where they are extensively reused. In addition, the\naccumulation of multiplication products are performed in a novel accumulator\narray. Our results show that on contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve\nboth performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a\ncomparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 22:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}
