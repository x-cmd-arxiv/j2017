Among all frameworks, the Bayesian framework based on\nGaussian processes has the potential of highest accuracy. However, the Bayesian\nframework requires optimization for estimating hyper-parameters, and there is a\nrisk of estimating inappropriate hyper-parameters as Kriging surrogate often\ndoes, especially in the presence of noisy data. We propose an easy and yet\npowerful framework for practical design and applications. In this technical\nnote, we revised a heuristic framework which minimizes the prediction errors at\nhigh-fidelity samples using optimization. The system behavior (high-fidelity\nbehavior) is approximated by a linear combination of the low-fidelity\npredictions and a polynomial-based discrepancy function. The key idea is to\nconsider the low-fidelity model as a basis function in the multi-fidelity model\nwith the scale factor as a regression coefficient. The design matrix for\nleast-square estimation consists of both the low-fidelity model and discrepancy\nfunction.

Our goal is to design a\nutility function for a non-cooperative game such that all of its pure Nash\nequilibria have close to optimal global performance.

We\npropose a novel technique to analyze the Nash equilibria of a random\ninterference game, determined by the random channel gains. Our analysis is\nasymptotic in the number of users. First we present a natural non-cooperative\ngame where the utility of each user is his achievable rate.

We consider two distinct BS\narchitectures that partition the antenna array into clusters, each associated\nwith independent radio-frequency chains and signal processing hardware, and the\nresults of each cluster are fused in a feedforward network. For both\narchitectures, we consider ZF, MMSE, and a novel, non-linear equalization\nalgorithm that builds upon approximate message passing (AMP), and we\ntheoretically analyze the achievable rates of these methods. Our results\ndemonstrate that decentralized equalization with our AMP-based methods incurs\nno or only a negligible loss in terms of achievable rates compared to that of\ncentralized solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 17:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

However, in these systems the study of\nthe so called excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have not\nreceived so much attention.\n  Purpose: A quantum analysis of the ESQPTs in the two-fluid Lipkin model is\npresented in this work. The study is performed through the Hamiltonian\ndiagonalization for selected values of the control parameters in order to cover\nthe most interesting regions of the system phase diagram. [Method:] A\nHamiltonian that resembles the consistent-Q Hamiltonian of the interacting\nboson model (IBM) is diagonalized for selected values of the parameters and\nproperties such as the density of states, the Peres lattices, the\nnearest-neighbor spacing distribution, and the participation ratio are\nanalyzed.\n  Results: An overview of the spectrum of the two-fluid Lipkin model for\nselected positions in the phase diagram has been obtained.

The ESQPT\nsignatures in composed systems behave in the same way as in single ones,\nalthough the evidences of their presence can be sometimes blurred.

This decomposition is unique only if the true\narchetypes are non-negative and sufficiently sparse (or the weights are\nsufficiently sparse), a regime that is captured by the separability condition\nand its generalizations.\n  In this paper, we study an approach to NMF that can be traced back to the\nwork of Cutler and Breiman (1994) and does not require the data to be\nseparable, while providing a generally unique decomposition. We optimize the\ntrade-off between two objectives: we minimize the distance of the data points\nfrom the convex envelope of the archetypes (which can be interpreted as an\nempirical risk), while minimizing the distance of the archetypes from the\nconvex envelope of the data (which can be interpreted as a data-dependent\nregularization).

However,\ncapturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern\nlight field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current\nconsumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal\ninterpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible\nas too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames.\nInstead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video\ncamera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence\nand a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field\nvideo at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed\ninto two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The\nflow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field\nsequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The\nappearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final\npixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural\nnetworks.

In this paper, the Wiener Filter reconstruction technique is applied\nto galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogs to understand how the Hubble\nconstant (H0) value and the grouping scheme affect the reconstructions. While\nH0 is used to derive radial peculiar velocities from galaxy distance\nmeasurements and total velocities, the grouping scheme serves the purpose of\nremoving non linear motions. Two different grouping schemes (based on the\nliterature and a systematic algorithm) as well as five H0 values ranging from\n72 to 76 km/s/Mpc are selected. The Wiener Filter is applied to the resulting\ncatalogs. Whatever grouping scheme is used, the larger H0 is, the larger the\ninfall onto the local Volume is. However, this conclusion has to be strongly\nmitigated: a bias minimization scheme applied to the catalogs after grouping\nsuppresses this effect. At fixed H0, reconstructions obtained with catalogs\ngrouped with the different schemes exhibit structures at the proper location in\nboth cases but the latter are more contrasted in the less aggressive scheme\ncase: having more constraints permits an infall from both sides onto the\nstructures to reinforce their overdensity. Such findings highlight the\nimportance of a balance between grouping to suppress non linear motions and\npreserving constraints to produce an infall onto structures expected to be\nlarge overdensities. Such an observation is promising to perform constrained\nsimulations of the local Universe including its massive clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

It is composed\nof dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened\nsheets and vast low density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused\nprimarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the\nenvironmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety\nof different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web -- depending\non the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other.\nIn this paper we bring twelve of these methods together and apply them to the\nsame data set in order to understand how they compare. In general these cosmic\nweb classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind,\nand to study different questions. Therefore one would not {\\it a priori} expect\nagreement between different techniques however, many of these methods do\nconverge on the identification of specific features. In this paper we study the\nagreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method\nfinds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that\nvoids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find\nsubstantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification\nscheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example,\nwe find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e.\n$M_{\\rm halo}\\sim10^{13.5}h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) as being in filaments. Lastly, so\nthat any future cosmic web classification scheme can be compared to the 12\nmethods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

Here, a Nickel-tetraphenylporphyrin\nadsorbed on the Si(100) surface is used to study the CT process ruling the\nreversible activation of two chiral molecular conformations. Via the electrons\nof a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), a statistical study of the molecular\nswitching reveals two specific locations of the molecule for which their\nefficiency is optimized. The CT mechanism is shown to propagate from two\nlateral aryls groups towards the porphyrin macrocycle inducing an\nintramolecular movement of two symmetric pyrroles. The measured switching\nefficiencies can thus be related with a Markus-Jordner model to estimate\nrelevant parameters that describe the dynamics of the CT process.

The binary\nstar parameters are chosen to mimic those of the Kepler-16, -34 and -35\nsystems; the aim of this study is to examine the role of disc mass in\ndetermining the stopping locations of migrating planets at the edge of the\ncavity created by the central binary. Disc self-gravity can cause significant\nshrinkage of the cavity for disc masses in excess of 5--10 $\\times$ the minimum\nmass solar nebula model. Planets forming early in the disc lifetime can migrate\nthrough the disc and stall at locations closer to the central star than is\nnormally the case for lower mass discs, resulting in closer agreement between\nsimulated and observed orbital architecture. The presence of a planet orbiting\nin the cavity of a massive disc can prevent the cavity size from expanding to\nthe size of a lower mass disc. As the disc mass reduces over long time scales,\nthis indicates that circumbinary planet systems retain memory of their initial\nconditions. Our simulations produce planetary orbits in good agreement with\nKepler-16b without the need for self-gravity; Kepler-34 analogue systems\nproduce wide and highly eccentric cavities, and self-gravity improves the\nagreement between simulations and data. Kepler-35b is more difficult to explain\nin detail due to it's relatively low mass, which results in the simulated\nstopping location being at a larger radius than that observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The detailed evolution of such rapidly evolving \"violent\"\njets remained a mystery after our previous investigation of active region jets\n(Sterling et al. 2016, Paper 1). The jets we investigate here erupt from three\nlocalized subregions, each containing a rapidly evolving (positive)\nminority-polarity magnetic-flux patch bathed in a (majority) negative-polarity\nmagnetic-flux background. At least several of the jets begin with eruptions of\nwhat appear to be thin (thickness <~2\") miniature-filament (minifilament)\n\"strands\" from a magnetic neutral line where magnetic flux cancelation is\nongoing, consistent with the magnetic configuration presented for coronal-hole\njets in Sterling et al.

Some jets strands are difficult/impossible to\ndetect, perhaps due to, e.g. their thinness, obscuration by surrounding bright\nor dark features, or the absence of erupting cool-material minifilaments in\nthose jets. Tracing in detail the flux evolution in one of the subregions, we\nfind bursts of strong jetting occurring only during times of strong flux\ncancelation. Averaged over seven jetting episodes, the cancelation rate was\n~1.5x10^19 Mx/hr. An average flux of ~5x10^18 Mx canceled prior to each\nepisode, arguably building up ~10^28 - 10^29 ergs of free magnetic energy per\njet. From these and previous observations, we infer that flux cancelation is\nthe fundamental process responsible for the pre-eruption buildup and triggering\nof at least many jets in active regions, quiet regions, and coronal holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

We performed a series\nof 12 hydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies, 10 barred and 2 unbarred,\nwith various initial gas fractions and AGN feedback prescriptions. In barred\ngalaxies, gas is driven toward the centre of the galaxy and causes a starburst,\nfollowed by a slow decay, while in unbarred galaxies the SFR increases slowly\nand steadily. AGN feedback suppresses star formation near the central black\nhole. Gas is pushed away from the black hole, and collides head-on with\ninflowing gas, forming a dense ring at a finite radius where star formation is\nenhanced. We conclude that both negative and positive feedback are present, and\nthese effects mostly cancel out. There is no net quenching or enhancement in\nstar formation, but rather a displacement of the star formation sites to larger\nradii. In unbarred galaxies, where the density of the central gas is lower,\nquenching of star formation near the black hole is more efficient, and\nenhancement of star formation at larger radii is less efficient. As a result,\nnegative feedback dominates. Lowering the gas fraction reduces the star\nformation rate at all radii, whether or not there is a bar or an AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 19:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Agents are nodes, connecting to another agent by\nbuilding a directed edge has a cost, and reaching other agents via short\ndirected paths has a benefit; in effect, an agent wants to reach others\nquickly, but without the cost of directly connecting each and every one. Even\nin its simplest form, edges in this framework are neither substitutes or\ncomplements in general; hence, standard techniques are required to study the\nmodel's properties and dynamics do not apply.\n  We prove that an asynchronous edge dynamics always converge to a stable\nnetwork; in fact, for this convergence is fast for a range of parameters.\nMoreover, the set of stable networks are nontrivial and can support the type of\nnetwork structures that have been observed to appear in social information\nnetworks -- from community clusters to broadcast networks, depending on the\nparameters many natural formations can emerge. We further study the static\ngame, and give classes of stable and efficient networks for nontrivial\nparameter ranges. We close several problems, and leave many interesting ones\nopen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 19:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

In \\cite{Bizon:2011gg} the onset of such\nnonlinear instability was associated with the existence of irremovable secular\nresonances at third order in perturbation theory. Furthermore, it was also\nconjectured in \\cite{Bizon:2011gg} that certain very fine tuned initial data\nwould not collapse. Such solutions, upon linearisation, correspond to\nindividual normal modes of AdS, which can be consistently backreacted to all\norders in perturbation theory.

Existing X-ray studies of N103B have indicated a Type\nIa supernova origin. Radiative shock emission from clumpy material surrounding\nthe SNR may result from interaction of the forward shock with relic stellar\nwind material, possibly implicating a thermonuclear explosion in a\nsingle-degenerate binary system.

Job schedulers allocate computing resources and control the execution\nof processes on those resources. Historically, job schedulers were the domain\nof supercomputers, and job schedulers were designed to run massive,\nlong-running computations over days and weeks. More recently, big data\nworkloads have created a need for a new class of computations consisting of\nmany short computations taking seconds or minutes that process enormous\nquantities of data. For both supercomputers and big data systems, the\nefficiency of the job scheduler represents a fundamental limit on the\nefficiency of the system. Detailed measurement and modeling of the performance\nof schedulers are critical for maximizing the performance of a large-scale\ncomputing system. This paper presents a detailed feature analysis of 15\nsupercomputing and big data schedulers. For big data workloads, the scheduler\nlatency is the most important performance characteristic of the scheduler. A\ntheoretical model of the latency of these schedulers is developed and used to\ndesign experiments targeted at measuring scheduler latency. Detailed\nbenchmarking of four of the most popular schedulers (Slurm, Son of Grid Engine,\nMesos, and Hadoop YARN) are conducted. The theoretical model is compared with\ndata and demonstrates that scheduler performance can be characterized by two\nkey parameters: the marginal latency of the scheduler $t_s$ and a nonlinear\nexponent $\\alpha_s$. For all four schedulers, the utilization of the computing\nsystem decreases to < 10\\% for computations lasting only a few seconds.\nMultilevel schedulers that transparently aggregate short computations can\nimprove utilization for these short computations to > 90\\% for all four of the\nschedulers that were tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 21:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

As a result, information and updated bounds can be\nshared in real time, creating a synergy between threads. We design and\nimplement two algorithms that take advantage of such theory.

It is therefore\nvaluable to use a supervised approach for resolving how a network encodes\ndistinct inputs of interest, and the superposition of those inputs from sampled\nmultiple node time series. In this paper we show that accomplishing such a task\ninvolves finding a low-dimensional state space from supervised recordings. We\ndemonstrate that standard methods for dimension reduction are unable to provide\nthe desired functionality of optimal separation of the fixed points and\ntransient trajectories to them. However, the combination of dimension reduction\nwith selection and optimization can successfully provide such functionality.\nSpecifically, we propose two methods: Exclusive Threshold Reduction (ETR) and\nOptimal Exclusive Threshold Reduction (OETR) for finding a basis for the\nclassification state space.

In the counter-diabatic driving approach, an auxiliary\nHamiltonian which is called the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is appended to an\noriginal Hamiltonian to cancel out diabatic transitions. The counter-diabatic\nHamiltonian is constructed by using the eigenstates of the original\nHamiltonian. Therefore, it is in general difficult to construct the\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems. Even if the\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems is obtained, it is\ngenerally non-local and even diverges at critical points. We construct an\napproximated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for the infinite-range Ising model by\nmaking use of the mean-field approximation. An advantage of this method is that\nthe mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is constructed by only local\noperators. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through\nquantum annealing processes going the vicinity of the critical point. It is\nalso confirmed that the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is still\nwell-defined in the limit to the critical point. The present method can take\nhigher order contributions into account and is consistent with the variational\napproach for local counter-diabatic driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 03:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

The Weibel (or\nthe filamentation) instability is particularly important because it can rapidly\ngenerate strong magnetic fields, even in the absence of seed fields. Particles\npropagating in collisionless plasmas with such small-scale magnetic fields\nundergo stochastic deflections similar to Coulomb collisions, with the magnetic\npitch-angle diffusion coefficient representing the effective \"collision\"\nfrequency. We show that this effect of the plasma \"quasi-collisionality\" can\nstrongly affect the growth rate and evolution of the Weibel instability in the\ndeeply nonlinear regime. This result is especially important for understanding\ncosmic-ray-driven turbulence in an upstream region of a collisionless shock of\na gamma-ray burst or a supernova.

It is well known that\nearly citations (within 1-2 years after publication) acquired by a paper\npositively affects its LTSI. However, there is no work that investigates if the\nset of authors who bring in these early citations to a paper also affect its\nLTSI. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time, the impact of these\nauthors whom we call early citers (EC) on the LTSI of a paper. Note that this\nstudy of the complex dynamics of EC introduces a brand new paradigm in citation\nbehavior analysis. Using a massive computer science bibliographic dataset we\nidentify two distinct categories of EC - we call those authors who have high\noverall publication/citation count in the dataset as influential and the rest\nof the authors as non-influential. We investigate three characteristic\nproperties of EC and present an extensive analysis of how each category\ncorrelates with LTSI in terms of these properties. In contrast to popular\nperception, we find that influential EC negatively affects LTSI possibly owing\nto attention stealing. To motivate this, we present several representative\nexamples from the dataset. A closer inspection of the collaboration network\nreveals that this stealing effect is more profound if an EC is nearer to the\nauthors of the paper being investigated. As an intuitive use case, we show that\nincorporating EC properties in the state-of-the-art supervised citation\nprediction models leads to high performance margins.

In this work we study structural and\ncomputational aspects of linear projections of Vandermonde polynomials.\nFirstly, we consider the problem of testing if a given polynomial is linearly\nequivalent to the Vandermonde polynomial. We obtain a deterministic polynomial\ntime algorithm to test if the polynomial f is linearly equivalent to the\nVandermonde polynomial when f is given as product of linear factors. In the\ncase when the polynomial f is given as a black-box our algorithm runs in\nrandomized polynomial time.

This construction requires all the side-information at\nthe receivers to decode their wanted messages and also requires large field\nsize. In an earlier work, we constructed binary matrices of size $m \\times n\n(m\\geq n)$ such that any $n$ adjacent rows of the matrix are linearly\nindependent over every field.

Besides, quantum steering from Alice to Bob experiences a \"sudden\ndeath\" with increasing decoherence strength.

First, an\nalgorithm, considering spatial relationship constrains between image\nfootprints, is designed for match pair selection with assistant of UAV flight\ncontrol data and oblique camera mounting angles. Second, a topological\nconnection network (TCN), represented by an undirected weighted graph, is\nconstructed from initial match pairs, which encodes overlap area and\nintersection angle into edge weights. Then, an algorithm, termed MST-Expansion,\nis proposed to extract the match graph from the TCN where the TCN is firstly\nsimplified by a maximum spanning tree (MST). By further analysis of local\nstructure in the MST, expansion operations are performed on the nodes of the\nMST for match graph enhancement, which is achieved by introducing critical\nconnections in two expansion directions. Finally, guided by the match graph, an\nefficient SfM solution is proposed, and its validation is verified through\ncomprehensive analysis and comparison using three UAV datasets captured with\ndifferent oblique multi-camera systems. Experiment results demonstrate that the\nefficiency of image matching is improved with a speedup ratio ranging from 19\nto 35, and competitive orientation accuracy is achieved from both relative\nbundle adjustment (BA) without GCPs (Ground Control Points) and absolute BA\nwith GCPs. At the same time, images in the three datasets are successfully\noriented. For orientation of oblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a\nmore efficient solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 07:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

This paper presents an algorithm to compute the\noptimal placement of synthetic inertia and damping in the system with respect\nto explicit time-domain constraints on the rate of change of frequency, the\nfrequency overshoot after a step disturbance, and actuation input. A case study\nhints that the approach delivers reliable results, and it is scalable and\napplicable to realistic power system models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 09:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

This energy barrier thus represents the selectivity of the membrane.\nFurthermore, this energy barrier induces additional force terms in the momentum\nand the mass balances on the fluid and the colloids phases.

Using betweenness centrality\n(BC) and diversity, we elaborate on the question of how to distinguish and rank\njournals in terms of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, however, is\ndifficult to operationalize in the absence of an operational definition of\ndisciplines, the diversity of a unit of analysis is sample-dependent. BC can be\nconsidered as a measure of multi-disciplinarity. Diversity of co-citation in a\nciting document has been considered as an indicator of knowledge integration,\nbut an author can also generate trans-disciplinary--that is,\nnon-disciplined--variation by citing sources from other disciplines. Diversity\nin the bibliographic coupling among citing documents can analogously be\nconsidered as diffusion of knowledge across disciplines. Because the citation\nnetworks in the cited direction reflect both structure and variation, diversity\nin this direction is perhaps the best available measure of interdisciplinarity\nat the journal level. Furthermore, diversity is based on a summation and can\ntherefore be decomposed, differences among (sub)sets can be tested for\nstatistical significance.

Using grand\ncanonical Monte Carlo simulation and classical density functional theory we\nexamine both cases in detail. We find that for the LR case wetting is first\norder, while drying is continuous (critical) and occurs exactly at zero\nattractive wall strength, ie. in the limit of a hard wall. In the SR case,\ndrying is also critical but the order of the wetting transition depends on the\ntruncation range of the wall-fluid potential. We characterize the approach to\ncritical drying and wetting in terms of the density and local compressibility\nprofiles and via the finite-size scaling properties of the probability\ndistribution of the overall density.

Best Complex Antipodal Spherical Codes (BCASCs) are known to\nbe optimal in terms of coherence.

To achieve this aim, we\npresent an SBD technique based on spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN). Since current datasets are not large enough to train an accurate SBD\nCNN, we present a new dataset containing more than 3.5 million frames of sharp\nand gradual transitions. The transitions are generated synthetically using\nimage compositing models. Our dataset contain additional 70,000 frames of\nimportant hard-negative no transitions. We perform the largest evaluation to\ndate for one SBD algorithm, on real and synthetic data, containing more than\n4.85 million frames. In comparison to the state of the art, we outperform\ndissolve gradual detection, generate competitive performance for sharp\ndetections and produce significant improvement in wipes. In addition, we are up\nto 11 times faster than the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 11:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

The simulations performed for a mobile asymmetric\nwall separating two chambers containing an equal number of active dumbbells\nhighlight some subtle and unexpected properties of the system.

The resulting connectome code derived via semiparametric\nGMM composed with ASE captures latent connectome structure and elucidates\nbiologically relevant neuronal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 12:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

We refer to them as the\ninner and the outer type theory. In our case of interest, the inner theory is\nhomotopy type theory (HoTT) which may include univalent universes and higher\ninductive types. The outer theory is a traditional form of type theory\nvalidating uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP). One point of view on it is as\ninternalised meta-theory of the inner type theory.\n  There are two motivations for 2LTT. Firstly, there are certain results about\nHoTT which are of meta-theoretic nature, such as the statement that\nsemisimplicial types up to level $n$ can be constructed in HoTT for any\nexternally fixed natural number $n$. Such results cannot be expressed in HoTT\nitself, but they can be formalised and proved in 2LTT, where $n$ will be a\nvariable in the outer theory. This point of view is inspired by observations\nabout conservativity of presheaf models.\n  Secondly, 2LTT is a framework which is suitable for formulating additional\naxioms that one might want to add to HoTT. This idea is heavily inspired by\nVoevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), which constitutes one specific instance\nof a 2LTT. HTS has an axiom ensuring that the type of natural numbers behaves\nlike the external natural numbers, which allows the construction of a universe\nof semisimplicial types. In 2LTT, this axiom can be stated simply be asking the\ninner and outer natural numbers to be isomorphic.\n  After defining 2LTT, we set up a collection of tools with the goal of making\n2LTT a convenient language for future developments. As a first such\napplication, we develop the theory of Reedy fibrant diagrams in the style of\nShulman. Continuing this line of thought, we suggest a definition of\n(infinity,1)-category and give some examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 09:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:32:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The low-energy excitation spectrum and quadrupole shape invariants of\nthe two lowest $0^{+}$ states of even-even nuclei are obtained as solutions of\na five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) model, with parameters\ndetermined by constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the\nrelativistic energy density functional PC-PK1, and a finite-range pairing\ninteraction.

It is observed that the\ncycle period increases with rotation period along the so-called active and\ninactive sequences. In this picture the Sun occupies a solitary position in\nbetween the two sequences. Our goal is to measure cyclic variations of the\nstellar light curve amplitude and the rotation period using four years of\nKepler data. Periodic changes of the light curve amplitude or the stellar\nrotation period are associated with an underlying activity cycle. Using the\nMcQuillan et al. 2014 sample we compute the rotation period and the variability\namplitude for each Kepler quarter and search for periodic variations of both\ntime series. To test for periodicity in each stellar time series we consider\nLomb-Scargle periodograms and use a selection based on a False Alarm\nProbability (FAP). We detect amplitude periodicities in 3203 stars between\n0.5-6 years covering rotation periods between 1-40 days. Given our sample size\nof 23,601 stars and our selection criteria that the FAP is less than 5%, this\nnumber is almost three times higher than that expected from pure noise. We do\nnot detect periodicities in the rotation period beyond those expected from\nnoise. Our measurements reveal that the cycle period shows a weak dependence on\nrotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation period. We further show\nthat the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent\nwith observations of the solar cycle. Our measurements do not support the\nexistence of distinct sequences in the P_rot-P_cyc plane, although there is\nsome evidence for the inactive sequence for rotation periods between 5-25 days.\nUnfortunately, the total observing time is too short to draw sound conclusions\non activity cycles with similar length as the solar cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

The derivation relies on\nassociating the spreading matrix with the adjacency matrix of a large\nsemiregular bipartite graph. For a simple repetition-based sparse spreading\nscheme, the result directly follows from a rigorous analysis of spectral\nmeasures of infinite graphs. Turning to random (sparse) binary spreading, we\nharness the cavity method from statistical physics, and show that the limiting\nspectral density coincides in both cases.

So far, most of the\nobservations have concerned only hydrogen atoms. In this paper, we present\nperspectives for observations of helium energetic neutral atoms (He ENAs). We\ncalculated the expected intensities of He ENAs created by the neutralization of\nhelium ions in the inner heliosheath and through the secondary ENA mechanism in\nthe outer heliosheath. We found that the dominant source region for He ENAs is\nthe inner heliosheath. The obtained magnitudes of intensity spectra suggest\nthat He ENAs can be observed with future ENA detectors, as those planned on\nInterstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. Observing He ENAs is most likely\nfor energies from a few to a few tens of keV/nuc. Estimates of the expected\ncount rates show that the ratio of helium to hydrogen atoms registered in the\ndetectors can be as low as 1:10^4. Consequently, the detectors need to be\nequipped with an appropriate mass spectrometer capability, allowing for\nrecognition of chemical elements. Due to the long mean free paths of helium\nions in the inner heliosheath, He ENAs are produced also in the distant\nheliospheric tail. This implies that observations of He ENAs can resolve its\nstructure, which seems challenging from observations of hydrogen ENAs since\nenergetic protons are neutralized before they progress deeper in the\nheliospheric tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Whereas, these\nconjectures were based on indirect measures of loading mechanisms, in this work\nwe take advantage of advances in bioimaging to directly assess collagen fibers\nand wall architecture during loading. A custom biaxial mechanical testing\nsystem compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to directly\nmeasure the layer dependent collagen fiber recruitment in bladder tissue from 9\nmale Fischer rats (4 adult and 5 aged). As for other soft tissues, the bladder\nloading curve was exponential in shape and could be divided into toe,\ntransition and high stress regimes. The relationship between collagen\nrecruitment and loading curves were evaluated in the context of the inner\nbladder wall (lamina propria) and outer detrusor smooth muscle layer. The large\nextensibility of the bladder was found to be possible due to folds in the wall\n(rugae) that provide a mechanism for low resistance flattening without any\ndiscernible recruitment of collagen fibers throughout the toe regime. For\nelastic bladders, as the loading extended into the transition regime, a gradual\ncoordinated recruitment of collagen fibers between the lamina propria and\ndetrusor smooth muscle layers was found. A second important finding is that\nwall extensibility could be lost by premature recruitment of collagen in the\nouter wall that cut short the toe region. This work provides, for the first\ntime, a mechanistic understanding of the role of collagen recruitment in\ndetermining bladder capacitance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Important issues with deep\narchitectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning\nalgorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we\npropose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to\nwell-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks.\n  The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a\nparameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this\nformulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use\nthis new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the\nexploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete\nODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep\nnetworks.

The effectiveness of decoherence is controlled by\na new length scale $l_{\\rm corr}$. It represents the noise correlation length\nand its effect has not been included in existing phenomenological studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 14:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 06:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

This mass term renders the\nperturbative expansion infrared-finite and allows to study it directly in the\nlarge-N and infinite-volume limits using the Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo approach.\nOn the exactly solvable example of a large-N O(N) sigma model in D=2 dimensions\nwe show that this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion contains, in addition\nto powers of bare coupling, also powers of its logarithm, reminiscent of\nre-summed perturbation theory in thermal field theory and resurgent\ntrans-series without exponential terms. We numerically demonstrate the\nconvergence of these double series to the manifestly non-perturbative dynamical\nmass gap.

One of the reasons for this progress\nis the continuous improvement in the instrumental techniques of observation.\nBut the lack of real time methods does not allow the detection of indicators of\nthe upcoming fracture process and thus to anticipate the phenomenon. Here, we\nhave performed uniaxial compression experiments to analyse the response of a\ngranular rock material sample to different shocks. We use a novel\ninterferometric laser sensor based on the nonlinear self-mixing interferometry\ntechnique to observe in real time the deformations of the sample and assess its\nusefulness as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of geomaterial dynamics. Due\nto the high spatial and temporal resolution of this approach, we observe both\nvibrations processes in response to a dynamic loading and the onset of failure.\nThe latter is preceded by a continuous variation of vibration period of the\nmaterial. After several shocks, the material response is no longer reversible\nand we detect a progressive accumulation of irreversible deformation leading to\nthe fracture process. We demonstrate that material failure is anticipated by\nthe critical slowing down of the surface vibrational motion, which may\ntherefore be envisioned as an early warning signal or predictor to the\nmacroscopic failure of the sample.

We characterize the high-energy extra component of GRB\n090926A using Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), which\noffer a greater sensitivity than any data set used in previous studies of this\nburst, particularly in the 30-100 MeV energy band. Then, we combine the LAT\ndata with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in joint spectral fits in\norder to characterize the time evolution of the broad-band spectrum from keV to\nGeV energies. Careful attention is paid to the LAT systematic effects. Finally,\nwe perform a temporal analysis of the light curves and we compute the\nvariability time scales during and after the bright spike at ~10 s\npost-trigger. Our analysis confirms and better constrains the spectral break in\nthe high-energy extra component, which has been previously reported during the\nbright spike. Furthermore, it reveals that the spectral attenuation persists at\nlater times, with an increase of the break characteristic energy up to the GeV\ndomain until the end of the prompt phase. We interpret the high-energy spectral\nbreak as caused by photon opacity to pair creation. Requiring that all\nemissions are produced above the photosphere of GRB 090926A, we compute the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the outflow, $\\Gamma$. The latter decreases from 230\nduring the spike to 100 at the end of the prompt emission. Assuming, instead,\nthat the spectral break reflects the natural curvature of the inverse Compton\nspectrum, lower limits corresponding to larger values of $\\Gamma$ are also\nderived. Combined with the extreme temporal variability of GRB 090926A, these\nLorentz factors lead to emission radii $R\\sim10^{14}$ cm which are consistent\nwith an internal origin of both the keV-MeV and GeV prompt emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The recent advances in automation of\nmicroscopes and development of methods and markers for live cell imaging has\nled to rapid growth in the amount of image data being captured. To efficiently\nand reliably extract useful insights from these captured sequences, automated\ncell tracking is essential. This is a challenging problem due to large\nvariation in the appearance and shapes of cells depending on many factors\nincluding imaging methodology, biological characteristics of cells, cell matrix\ncomposition, labeling methodology, etc. Often cell tracking methods require a\nsequence-specific segmentation method and manual tuning of many tracking\nparameters, which limits their applicability to sequences other than those they\nare designed for. In this paper, we propose 1) a deep learning based cell\nproposal method, which proposes candidates for cells along with their scores,\nand 2) a cell tracking method, which links proposals in adjacent frames in a\ngraphical model using edges representing different cellular events and poses\njoint cell detection and tracking as the selection of a subset of cell and edge\nproposals.

Therefore, the deuteration fraction D$_{frac}$ is expected to\nbe enhanced in cold, dense prestellar cores and to decrease after protostellar\nbirth. Previous studies have shown that the deuterated forms of species such as\nN2H+ (formed in the gas phase) and CH3OH (formed on grain surfaces) can be used\nas evolutionary indicators and to constrain their dominant formation processes\nand time-scales. Formaldehyde (H2CO) and its deuterated forms can be produced\nboth in the gas phase and on grain surfaces. However, the relative importance\nof these two chemical pathways is unclear. Comparison of the deuteration\nfraction of H2CO with respect to that of N2H+, NH3 and CH3OH can help us to\nunderstand its formation processes and time-scales. With the new SEPIA Band 5\nreceiver on APEX, we have observed the J=3-2 rotational lines of HDCO and D2CO\nat 193 GHz and 175 GHz toward three massive star forming regions hosting\nobjects at different evolutionary stages: two High-mass Starless Cores (HMSC),\ntwo High-mass Protostellar Objects (HMPOs), and one Ultracompact HII region\n(UCHII). By using previously obtained H2CO J=3-2 data, the deuteration\nfractions HDCO/H2CO and D2CO/HDCO are estimated. Our observations show that\nsingly-deuterated H2CO is detected toward all sources and that the deuteration\nfraction of H2CO increases from the HMSC to the HMPO phase and then sharply\ndecreases in the latest evolutionary stage (UCHII). The doubly-deuterated form\nof H2CO is detected only in the earlier evolutionary stages with D2CO/H2CO\nshowing a pattern that is qualitatively consistent with that of HDCO/H2CO,\nwithin current uncertainties. Our initial results show that H2CO may display a\nsimilar D$_{frac}$ pattern as that of CH3OH in massive young stellar objects.\nThis finding suggests that solid state reactions dominate its formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 04:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

In many situations, mobile methods,\nwhich allow users to undertake every day activities, are required. However,\ncurrent monitoring systems can be obtrusive, requiring users to wear\nrespiration belts or nasal probes. Recent advances in thermographic systems\nhave shrunk their size, weight and cost, to the point where it is possible to\ncreate smart-phone based respiration rate monitoring devices that are not\naffected by lighting conditions. However, mobile thermal imaging is challenged\nin scenes with high thermal dynamic ranges.

It has\nthree main contributions. The first is a novel Optimal Quantization technique\nwhich adaptively constructs a color mapping of absolute temperature to improve\nsegmentation, classification and tracking. The second is the Thermal Gradient\nFlow method that computes thermal gradient magnitude maps to enhance accuracy\nof the nostril region tracking.

Moreover , we\nare able to prove that there is essentially only one optimal decomposition of\nthe product of 3 x 2 by 2 x 3 matrices up to the action of some group of\nautomorphisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 06:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 13:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 16:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

The coupling between these two potentials are\nassumed to be a Dirac Delta function in our model. We evaluate two rate\nconstants, the long term and the average rate constant. We have also\nincorporated the effect of all other chemical reactions involving at least one\nend of the open chain polymer molecule - on rate of end-to-end loop formation.\nThe closed chain polymer molecule can be converted to a open chain molecule by\nbreaking of any bond - the effect of this reaction on the rate of end-to-end\nloop formation is also considered in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 15:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

However, with the recent introduction of\nconditionally automated driving, we have also seen accidents. Test protocols\nfor both, conditionally automated (e.g., on highways) and automated vehicles do\nnot exist yet and leave researchers and practitioners with different\nchallenges. For instance, current test procedures do not suffice for fully\nautomated vehicles, which are supposed to be completely in charge for the\ndriving task and have no driver as a back up. This paper presents current\nchallenges of testing the functionality and safety of automated vehicles\nderived from conducting focus groups and interviews with 26 participants from\nfive countries having a background related to testing automotive safety-related\ntopics.We provide an overview of the state-of-practice of testing active safety\nfeatures as well as challenges that needs to be addressed in the future to\nensure safety for automated vehicles. The major challenges identified through\nthe interviews and focus groups, enriched by literature on this topic are\nrelated to 1) virtual testing and simulation, 2) safety, reliability, and\nquality, 3) sensors and sensor models, 4) required scenario complexity and\namount of test cases, and 5) handover of responsibility between the driver and\nthe vehicle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 10:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}
