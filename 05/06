The algorithms in this setting are considered non-adaptive as they\nhave to choose the subgraph $H$ without knowing any information about the set\nof realized edges in $G$. Originally motivated by an application to kidney\nexchange, the stochastic matching problem and its variants have received\nsignificant attention in recent years.\n  The state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms for stochastic matching achieve\nan approximation ratio of $\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$,\nnaturally raising the question that if $1/2$ is the limit of what can be\nachieved with a non-adaptive algorithm. In this work, we resolve this question\nby presenting the first algorithm for stochastic matching with an approximation\nguarantee that is strictly better than $1/2$: the algorithm computes a subgraph\n$H$ of $G$ with the maximum degree $O(\\frac{\\log{(1/ p)}}{p})$ such that the\nratio of expected size of a maximum matching in realizations of $H$ and $G$ is\nat least $1/2+\\delta_0$ for some absolute constant $\\delta_0 > 0$. The degree\nbound on $H$ achieved by our algorithm is essentially the best possible (up to\nan $O(\\log{(1/p)})$ factor) for any constant factor approximation algorithm,\nsince an $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{p})$ degree in $H$ is necessary for a vertex to\nacquire at least one incident edge in a realization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

It can unveil a great deal of information about the lenses dark\nmatter content when combined with the study of the lenses light profile.\nHowever, gravitational lensing galaxies, by definition, appear surrounded by\npoint-like and diffuse lensed signal that is irrelevant to the lens flux.\nTherefore, the observer is most often restricted to studying the innermost\nportions of the galaxy, where classical fitting methods show some\ninstabilities. We aim at subtracting that lensed signal and at characterising\nsome lenses light profile by computing their shape parameters. Our objective is\nto evaluate the total integrated flux in an aperture the size of the Einstein\nring in order to obtain a robust estimate of the quantity of ordinary matter in\neach system. We are expanding the work we started in a previous paper that\nconsisted in subtracting point-like lensed images and in independently\nmeasuring each shape parameter. We improve it by designing a subtraction of the\ndiffuse lensed signal, based only on one simple hypothesis of symmetry. This\nextra step improves our study of the shape parameters and we refine it even\nmore by upgrading our half-light radius measurement. We also calculate the\nimpact of our specific image processing on the error bars. The diffuse lensed\nsignal subtraction makes it possible to study a larger portion of relevant\ngalactic flux, as the radius of the fitting region increases by on average\n17\\%. We retrieve new half-light radii values that are on average 11\\% smaller\nthan in our previous work, although the uncertainties overlap in most cases.\nThis shows that not taking the diffuse lensed signal into account may lead to a\nsignificant overestimate of the half-light radius. We are also able to measure\nthe flux within the Einstein radius and to compute secure error bars to all of\nour results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 16:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

It was shown that, over $n$\nindependent channel uses, $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ bits can transmitted reliably\nover a public channel while achieving an arbitrarily low probability of\ndetection (LPD) by other stations. This result is well known as square-root law\nand even to achieve this diminishing rate of covert communication, some form of\nshared secret is needed between the transmitter and the receiver. In this\npaper, we establish the limits of LPD communication over the MIMO AWGN channel.\nWe define the notion of $\\epsilon$-probability of detection ($\\epsilon$-PD) and\nprovide a formulation to evaluate the maximum achievable rate under the\n$\\epsilon$-PD constraint. We first show that the capacity-achieving input\ndistribution is the zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Then, assuming channel\nstate information (CSI) on only the main channel at the transmitter, we derive\nthe optimal input covariance matrix, hence, establishing the $\\epsilon$-PD\ncapacity. We evaluate $\\epsilon$-PD rates in the limiting regimes for the\nnumber of channel uses (asymptotic block length) and the number of antennas\n(massive MIMO). We show that, in the asymptotic block-length regime, while the\nSRL still holds for the MIMO AWGN, the number of bits that can be transmitted\ncovertly scales exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas.\nFurther, we derive the $\\epsilon$-PD capacity \\textit{with no shared secret}.\nFor that scenario, in the massive MIMO limit, higher covert rate up to the non\nLPD constrained capacity still can be achieved, yet, with much slower scaling\ncompared to the scenario with shared secret. The practical implication of our\nresult is that, MIMO has the potential to provide a substantial increase in the\nfile sizes that can be covertly communicated subject to a reasonably low delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 17:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 15:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 14:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 20:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

Using a set of Monte Carlo clusters simulations, we investigate\nthe role of the onset of energy equipartition in shaping the mass-to-light\nratio (M/L) in GCs. Our simulations show that the M/L profiles cannot be\nconsidered constant and their specific shape strongly depends on the dynamical\nage of the clusters. Dynamically younger clusters display a central peak up to\nM/L $\\simeq25$ $M_\\odot/L_\\odot$ caused by the retention of dark remnants; this\npeak flattens out for dynamically older clusters. Moreover, we find that also\nthe global values of M/L correlate with the dynamical state of a cluster\nquantified as either the number of relaxation times a system has experienced\n$n_{rel}$ or the equipartition parameter $m_{eq}$: clusters closer to full\nequipartition (higher $n_{rel}$ or lower $m_{eq}$) display a lower M/L.

The mock H$\\alpha$ luminosity function agrees reasonably\nwell with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration\naffects observed H$\\alpha$ fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is\nbimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20$\\%$ of galaxies deemed `passive'\nfor the SKIRT model, i.e. exhibiting D4000 $> 1.8$, are classified `active'\nwhen ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with\nstellar mass greater than $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ that are deemed passive is\nslightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star\nformation in these simulated galaxies. Colour images, fluxes and spectra of\nEAGLE galaxies are to be made available through the public EAGLE database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 17:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Examples are hot Jupiters (HJs) in stellar triple\nsystems, and planetary companions to HJs in stellar binaries. The secular\ndynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic\nmotion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely\nhigh eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal\nevolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the\nformation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper\nunderstanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here\nwe study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical\nquadruple systems in either the `2+2' or `3+1' configurations. We show how the\nequations of motion can be cast in a form representing a perturbed hierarchical\nthree-body system, in which the outer orbital angular momentum vector is\nprecessing steadily around a fixed axis. In this case, we show that\neccentricity excitation can be significantly enhanced when the precession\nperiod is comparable to the Lidov-Kozai oscillation time-scale of the inner\norbit. This arises from an induced large mutual inclination between the inner\nand outer orbits driven by the precession of the outer orbit, even if the\ninitial mutual inclination is small. We present a simplified semi-analytic\nmodel that describes the latter phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 17:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 01:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

These\nsystems can exhibit a prevalent form of complex dynamics, dubbed doubly\ntransient chaos because not only typical trajectories but also the (otherwise\ninvariant) chaotic saddles are transient. This property, along with a manifest\nlack of scale invariance, has hindered the study of the geometric properties of\nbasin boundaries in these systems--most remarkably, the very question of\nwhether they are fractal across all scales has yet to be answered. Here we\nderive a general dynamical condition that answers this question, which we use\nto demonstrate that the basin boundaries can indeed form a true fractal; in\nfact, they do so generically in a broad class of transiently chaotic undriven\ndissipative systems. Using physical examples, we demonstrate that the\nboundaries typically form a slim fractal, which we define as a set whose\ndimension at a given resolution decreases when the resolution is increased. To\nproperly characterize such sets, we introduce the notion of equivalent\ndimension for quantifying their relation with sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions at all scales. We show that slim fractal boundaries can exhibit\ncomplex geometry even when they do not form a true fractal and fractal scaling\nis observed only above a certain length scale at each boundary point. Thus, our\nresults reveal slim fractals as a geometrical hallmark of transient chaos in\nundriven dissipative systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 18:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 18:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

Characterizing the UV environment on\nM-dwarfs planets is important to understanding whether life as we know it could\nemerge on such worlds. In this work, we couple radiative transfer models to\nobserved M-dwarf spectra to determine the UV environment on prebiotic\nEarth-analog planets orbiting M-dwarfs.

This defines\ntwo distinct frequencies that vary on the radiation-reaction timescale: the\nnutation frequency $\\omega \\equiv 2\\pi/\\tau$ and the precession frequency\n$\\Omega \\equiv \\alpha/\\tau$. We use analytic solutions for generic spin\nprecession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital\nangular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency $\\Omega -\nn\\omega$ for integer $n$.

We study the dependency of the final\norbital radius, mass, and atmospheric chemistry of planets forming in disk\nmodels with initial disk masses that vary by 0.02 $M_\\odot$ above and below our\nfiducial model ($M_{disk,0} = 0.1 ~M_\\odot$). We compute C/O and C/N for the\natmospheres formed in our 3 models and find that C/O$_{\\rm planet}\\sim$\nC/O$_{\\rm disk}$, which does not vary strongly between different planets formed\nin our model. The nitrogen content of atmospheres can vary in planets that grow\nin different disk models. These differences are related to the formation\nhistory of the planet, the time and location that the planet accretes its\natmosphere, and are encoded in the bulk abundance of NH$_3$. These results\nsuggest that future observations of atmospheric NH$_3$ and an estimation of the\nplanetary C/O and C/N can inform the formation history of particular planetary\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Deep networks\ntrained on pristine images perform poorly when tested on such distortions.

We achieve this goal by identifying four\ndistinct quantum security classes, or domains, each of them encompassing the\nsecurity notions and constructions related to a particular scenario.

IB works by encoding $X$ in a compressed \"bottleneck\" random variable $M$\nfrom which $Y$ can be accurately decoded. However, finding the optimal\nbottleneck variable involves a difficult optimization problem, which until\nrecently has been considered for only two limited cases: discrete $X$ and $Y$\nwith small state spaces, and continuous $X$ and $Y$ with a Gaussian joint\ndistribution (in which case optimal encoding and decoding maps are linear). We\npropose a method for performing IB on arbitrarily-distributed discrete and/or\ncontinuous $X$ and $Y$, while allowing for nonlinear encoding and decoding\nmaps.

In this paper, we show that angular\nspreads give rise to a useful low-rank structure that, along with the sparsity,\ncan be simultaneously utilized to reduce the sample complexity, i.e. the number\nof samples needed to successfully recover the mmWave channel. Specifically, to\neffectively leverage the joint sparse and low-rank structure, we develop a\ntwo-stage compressed sensing method for mmWave channel estimation, where the\nsparse and low-rank properties are respectively utilized in two consecutive\nstages, namely, a matrix completion stage and a sparse recovery stage. Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that the proposed two-stage scheme can achieve a\nlower sample complexity than a direct compressed sensing method that exploits\nonly the sparse structure of the mmWave channel. Simulation results are\nprovided to corroborate our theoretical results and to show the superiority of\nthe proposed two-stage method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 07:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

This\nproblem can be viewed as a label-assignment problem by a classifier dealing\nwith a very large set of labels, i.e., the vocabulary set. We propose a novel\nannotation method that employs two layers of sparse coding and performs\ncoarse-to-fine labeling. Themes extracted from the training data are treated as\ncoarse labels. Each theme is a set of training images that share a common\nsubject in their visual and textual contents. Our system extracts coarse labels\nfor training and test images without requiring any prior knowledge. Vocabulary\nwords are the fine labels to be associated with images. Most of the annotation\nmethods achieve low recall due to the large number of available fine labels,\ni.e., vocabulary words. These systems also tend to achieve high precision for\nhighly frequent words only while relatively rare words are more important for\nsearch and retrieval purposes. Our system not only outperforms various\npreviously proposed annotation systems, but also achieves symmetric response in\nterms of precision and recall. Our system scores and maintains high precision\nfor words with a wide range of frequencies. Such behavior is achieved by\nintelligently reducing the number of available fine labels or words for each\nimage based on coarse labels assigned to it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 08:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

Here, we report an X-ray driven\nfirst-order tetrahedral-octahedral phase transition in GeO2 glass at high\npressure using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) with a\nnano-polycrystalline diamond anvil (NPD) cell. Upon X-ray irradiation from an\nundulator device, the XAFS spectrum at 5.4 GPa, which is below the threshold\npressure of tetrahedral to pentahedral transition, starts to progressively\napproach the spectrum of octahedral GeO2 at 20.4 GPa.

We note at least\nthree uncharted territories of existing EISs: data uncertainty, temporal system\ndynamic, redundant data streams. This book chapter aims at delivering a\nconcrete solution of this problem with the algorithmic development of a novel\nlearning algorithm, namely PANFIS++. PANFIS++ is a generalized version of the\nPANFIS by putting forward three important components: 1) An online active\nlearning scenario is developed to overcome redundant data streams. This module\nallows to actively select data streams for the training process, thereby\nexpediting execution time and enhancing generalization performance, 2) PANFIS++\nis built upon an interval type-2 fuzzy system environment, which incorporates\nthe so-called footprint of uncertainty. This component provides a degree of\ntolerance for data uncertainty. 3) PANFIS++ is structured under a recurrent\nnetwork architecture with a self-feedback loop. This is meant to tackle the\ntemporal system dynamic. The efficacy of the PANFIS++ has been numerically\nvalidated through numerous real-world and synthetic case studies, where it\ndelivers the highest predictive accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 12:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

The (exponentional) generating\nfunctions of such sequences are called codimension series of varieties, or\ngenerating series of operads.\n  We show that in general there does not exist an algorithm to decide whether\nthe growth exponent of a codimension sequence of a variety defined by given\nfinite sets of operations and identities is equal to a given rational number.\nIn particular, we solve negatively a recent conjecture by Bremner and Dotsenko\nby showing that the set generating series of binary quadratic operads with\nbounded number of generators is infinite. Then we recall algorithms which in\nmany cases calculate the codimension series in the form of a defining algebraic\nor differential equation. For a more general class of varieties, these\nalgorithms give upper and lower bounds for the codimensions in terms of\ngenerating functions and asymptotical bounds for the growth of codimensions.\nThe upper bound (based on an operadic version of the Golod--Shafarevich\ntheorem) is just a formal power series satisfying an algebraic equation defined\neffectively by the generators and the identities of the variety. The first\nstage of an algorithm for the lower bound is the construction of a Groebner\nbasis of the operad. If the Groebner basis happens to be finite and satisfies\nmild restrictions, a recent theorem by the author and Anton Khoroshkin\nguarantees that the desired generating function is either algebraic or\ndifferential algebraic.

In the\ncase of infinite Groebner basis, these algorithms applied to its finite subsets\ngive lower bounds for the generating function of the codimension sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 22:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2017 21:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

For sample space reducing\n(SSR) processes, which are simple path-dependent processes that are associated\nwith power law statistics, the information rate is $S_{\\rm IT}=1+ \\frac12 \\log\nW$, the extensive entropy is $S_{\\rm EXT}=H(p)$, and the maxent result is\n$S_{\\rm MEP}(p)=H(p/p_1)+H(1-p/p_1)$. Finally, for multinomial mixture\nprocesses, the information rate is given by the conditional entropy $\\langle\nH\\rangle_f$, with respect to the mixing kernel $f$, the extensive entropy is\ngiven by $H$, and the MEP functional corresponds one-to-one to the logarithm of\nthe mixing kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 10:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}
