The status of individual\nbands can be tracked over time, allowing for a detailed remote analysis of how\nhuman populations affect the vital balance of dryland ecosystems. In this\nstudy, we characterize vegetation change in areas of the Horn of Africa where\nimagery taken in the early 1950s is available. We find that substantial change\nis associated with steep increases in human activity, which we infer primarily\nthrough the extent of road and dirt track development. A seemingly paradoxical\nsignature of human impact appears as an increase in the widths of the\nvegetation bands, which effectively increases the extent of vegetation cover in\nmany areas. We show that this widening occurs due to altered rates of\nvegetation colonization and mortality at the edges of the bands, and conjecture\nthat such changes are driven by human-induced shifts in plant species\ncomposition. Our findings suggest signatures of human impact that may aid in\nidentifying and monitoring vulnerable drylands in the Horn of Africa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 16:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 20:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 21:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Emergent phenomena such as\nhigh-temperature superconductivity are linked to the proximity to a QCP.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in understanding quantum critical\nbehavior in some low dimensional magnetic insulators, the situation in metallic\nsystems is much less clear. Here we demonstrate that NiCoCrx single crystal\nalloys are remarkable model systems for investigating QCP physics in a metallic\nenvironment. For NiCoCrx alloys with x = 0.8, the critical exponents associated\nwith a ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FQCP) are experimentally\ndetermined from low temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements.\nFor the first time, all of the five critical exponents ( gamma-subT =1/2 ,\nbeta-subT = 1, delta = 3/2, nuz-subm = 2, alpha-bar-subT = 0) are in remarkable\nagreement with predictions of Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta (BKV) theory in the\nasymptotic limit of high disorder. Using these critical exponents, excellent\nscaling of the magnetization data is demonstrated with no adjustable\nparameters.

MHFs are egalitarian, in the sense that evaluating them on\ndedicated hardware (like FPGAs or ASICs) is not much cheaper than on\noff-the-shelf hardware (like x86 CPUs). MHFs have interesting cryptographic\napplications, most notably to password hashing and securing blockchains.\n  Alwen and Serbinenko [STOC'15] define the cumulative memory complexity (cmc)\nof a function as the sum (over all time-steps) of the amount of memory required\nto compute the function. They advocate that a good MHF must have high cmc.\nUnlike previous notions, cmc takes into account that dedicated hardware might\nexploit amortization and parallelism. Still, cmc has been critizised as\ninsufficient, as it fails to capture possible time-memory trade-offs, as memory\ncost doesn't scale linearly, functions with the same cmc could still have very\ndifferent actual hardware cost.\n  In this work we address this problem, and introduce the notion of\nsustained-memory complexity, which requires that any algorithm evaluating the\nfunction must use a large amount of memory for many steps.

Higgs sectors\nbeyond the Standard Model (SM) can substantially modify this cross section\nthrough novel couplings not present in the SM or the on-shell production of new\nheavy Higgs bosons that subsequently decay into Higgs pairs. CP violation in\nthe Higgs sector is important for the explanation of the observed\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry through electroweak baryogenesis. In this work we\ncompute the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections in the heavy top quark\nlimit, including the effects of CP violation in the Higgs sector. We choose the\neffective theory (EFT) approach, which provides a rather model-independent way\nto explore New Physics (NP) effects by adding dimension-6 operators, both\nCP-conserving and CP-violating ones, to the SM Lagrangian. Furthermore, we\nperform the computation within a specific UV-complete model and choose as\nbenchmark model the general 2-Higgs-Doublet Model with CP violation, the C2HDM.\nDepending on the dimension-6 coefficients, the relative NLO QCD corrections are\naffected by several per cent through the new CP-violating operators.

The absolute cross sections both in the\nEFT and the C2HDM can be modified by more than an order of magnitude.

Taking advantage of recent advances in parallelization, we\npropose a novel approach for the application of strong local consistencies\n(SLCs) that can improve their performance by largely preserving the speed-ups\nthey offer in cases where they are successful, and eliminating the run time\npenalties in cases where they are unsuccessful. This approach is presented in\nthe form of two search algorithms.

To show this, we describe a numerical study of a size-structured,\nmultispecies, population-dynamic model; the model has a single resource,\nsupporting an arbitrary number of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. If the\nnumber of plankton species is large enough, the death rate of prey and cell\ngrowth rate of predators have approximate allometric scalings with cell size.\nTogether, these scalings give rise to an equilibrium distribution of abundance\nnear the power law, on which many species can coexist. Scalings of this kind\ncannot be achieved if the number of species is small. This suggests that the\nconjunction of species-richness and power-law structures in plankton\ncommunities is more than a coincidence. Although the exact allometric scalings\nused here should not be expected in practice, exclusion of species should be\nrelatively slow if they lie close to the power law. Thus the forces needed to\nachieve coexistence could be effective, even if they are relatively weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

We used a length scale\n$L_{CS}$, dubbed the Compton-Schwarzschild length, to which the Compton\nwavelength and Schwarzschild radius are small mass and large mass\napproximations, respectively. Here we write down the field equations which\nfollow from this action. We argue that the large mass limit yields Einstein\nequations, provided we assume wave function collapse and localisation for large\nmasses. The small mass limit yields the Dirac equation. We explain why the\nKerr-Newman black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as the Dirac electron,\nboth being twice the classical value. The small mass limit also provides\ncompelling reasons for introducing torsion, which is sourced by the spin\ndensity of the Dirac field. There is thus a symmetry between torsion and\ngravity: torsion couples to quantum objects through Planck's constant $\\hbar$\n(but not $G$) and is important in the microscopic limit. Whereas gravity\ncouples to classical matter, as usual, through Newton's gravitational constant\n$G$ (but not $\\hbar$), and is important in the macroscopic limit. We construct\nthe Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations which include the length $L_{CS}$. We find\na potentially significant change in the coupling constant of the torsion driven\ncubic non-linear self-interaction term in the Dirac-Hehl-Datta equation.

For more massive BHs with\n$M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim 5\\times 10^5~M_{\\odot}$, neutral gas through the equatorial\nplane totally covers the central radiating region due to the non-radial gas\nmotions, and thus the emergent radiation in all directions is blocked. Because\nof efficient recombination by hydrogen, the entire flow results in neutral and\nwarm gas with $T \\simeq 8000~{\\rm K}$ . The central BH is fed through the\nequator at the averaged rate of $\\sim 5\\times 10^4~L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$, which\ncorresponds to $\\sim 50~\\%$ of the inflow rate from the Bondi radius.

We\nstart with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new\ncalibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (i.e. UVI\ndiagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on\nCANDELS, UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and\nredshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of\n0.2--2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global\n$A_V$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti\nextinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than\nstellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting $A_V$\nprofiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured\nradial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching\nsignatures, except for $M_*>10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$, where central declines of\n20--25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous\nradial sSFR and (continuum) $A_V$ measurements. They are also consistent with\nthe sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas\nprofiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking\nfindings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of\ngalaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low\nstellar-mass surface densities there.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 18:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

Next, we classify the\nexisting research on RWSN as well as the relevant state-of-the-arts from\nrobotics and WSN community according to the problems and trends identified in\nthe first step. Lastly, we analyze what is missing in the existing literature,\nand identify topics that require more research attention in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 19:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 07:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 23:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling. If confirmed, the trend would have far-reaching implications\nfor grain evolution and, ultimately, the formation of planetesimals and\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 20:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 12:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

To do so, we study the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) information\ncontent as a function of the orientation of galaxy clustering modes with\nrespect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the\nLOS, as observed in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has\ncontributions from clustering modes with a range of orientations with respect\nto the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z \\geq 0.02(1+z)$ we find\nthat while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes in\nthe true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space.

Given points in a domain, a tree\nstructure is first constructed based on an adaptive partitioning of the\ncomputational domain to facilitate subsequent approximation procedures. In\ncontrast to existing schemes based on either analytic or purely algebraic\napproximations, SMASH takes advantage of both approaches and greatly improves\nthe efficiency. The algorithm follows a bottom-up traversal of the tree and is\nable to perform the operations associated with each node on the same level in\nparallel. A strong rank-revealing factorization is applied to the initial\nanalytic approximation in the separation regime so that a special structure is\nincorporated into the final nested bases. As a consequence, the storage is\nsignificantly reduced on one hand and a hierarchy of the original grid is\nconstructed on the other hand. Due to this hierarchy, nested bases at upper\nlevels can be computed in a similar way as the leaf level operations but on\ncoarser grids. The main advantages of SMASH include its simplicity of\nimplementation, its flexibility to construct various hierarchical rank\nstructures and a low storage cost. Rigorous error analysis and complexity\nanalysis are conducted to show that this scheme is fast and stable.

Similarly, when studying zonally symmetric meridional\ncirculations near the equator (the tropical Hadley cells) or the katabatically\nforced meridional circulation over Antarctica, there also arises a second order\nelliptic equation. These elliptic equations are usually derived in the pressure\ncoordinate or the potential temperature coordinate, since the thermal wind\nequation has simple non-Jacobian forms in these two vertical coordinates.\nBecause of the large variations in surface pressure that can occur in tropical\ncyclones and over the Antarctic ice sheet, there is interest in using other\nvertical coordinates, e.g., the height coordinate, the classical\n$\\sigma$-coordinate, or some type of hybrid coordinate typically used in global\nnumerical weather prediction or climate models. Because the thermal wind\nequation in these coordinates takes a Jacobian form, the derivation of the\nelliptic transverse circulation equation is not as simple. Here we present a\nmethod for deriving the elliptic transverse circulation equation in a\ngeneralized vertical coordinate, which allows for many particular vertical\ncoordinates, such as height, pressure, log-pressure, potential temperature,\nclassical $\\sigma$, and most hybrid cases. Advantages and disadvantages of the\nvarious coordinates are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 21:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

It turns out\nthat we may be on the verge of measuring the Schwarzschild-type 1pN static\ncomponent of the SMBH's field with the S2 star for which RV measurements\naccurate to about $\\simeq 30-50~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ dating back to $t_0 =\n2003.271$ are currently available, and whose orbital period amounts to\n$P_\\textrm{b} = 16$ yr. Indeed, while its expected general relativistic RV net\nshift per orbit amounts to just $\\left\\langle\\Delta V^\\textrm{GE}\\right\\rangle\n= -11.6~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, it should reach a peak value as large as $\\Delta\nV_\\textrm{max}^\\textrm{GE}\\left(t_\\textrm{max}\\right) = 551~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$\nat $t_\\textrm{max} = 2018.35$. The periastron shift $\\Delta\\omega^\\textrm{GE}$\nof S2 over the same time span will not be larger than $0.2$ deg, while the\ncurrent accuracy in estimating such an orbital element for this star is of the\norder of $0.6$ deg. The frame-dragging and quadrupole-induced RV shifts are far\nsmaller for S2, amounting to, at most, $0.19~\\textrm{km\ns}^{-1},0.0039~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, respectively. Further studies should be\ndedicated to the impact on the RV of possible diffused mass distribution in the\nGC and of other individual stars inside and outside the orbit of S2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 22:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 20:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 12:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 22:22:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 14:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 13:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

In addition to providing collimating media for gamma-ray\nburst jets, unbound outflows from these disks are an important source of mass\nejection and rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We present the\nfirst three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations of neutrino-cooled accretion disks in neutron star mergers,\nincluding a realistic equation of state valid at low densities and\ntemperatures, self-consistent evolution of the electron fraction, and neutrino\ncooling through an approximate leakage scheme. After initial magnetic field\namplification by magnetic winding, we witness the vigorous onset of turbulence\ndriven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The disk quickly reaches a\nbalance between heating from MRI-driven turbulence and neutrino cooling, which\nregulates the midplane electron fraction to a low equilibrium value $Y_\\text{e}\n\\approx 0.1$.

Users can annotate entities using a graphical\nweb-based user interface (BRAT): the annotations are then used to train an ANN,\nwhich in turn predict entities' locations and categories in new texts. NeuroNER\nmakes this annotation-training-prediction flow smooth and accessible to anyone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 00:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

This setting captures the potential adversarial attacks\nfaced by Federated Learning -- a modern machine learning paradigm that is\nproposed by Google researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring\nuser privacy. Formally, we focus on a distributed system consisting of a\nparameter server and $m$ working machines. Each working machine keeps $N/m$\ndata samples, where $N$ is the total number of samples. The goal is to\ncollectively learn the underlying true model parameter of dimension $d$.\n  In classical batch gradient descent methods, the gradients reported to the\nserver by the working machines are aggregated via simple averaging, which is\nvulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine\ngradient descent method based on the geometric median of means of the\ngradients. We show that our method can tolerate $q \\le (m-1)/2$ Byzantine\nfailures, and the parameter estimate converges in $O(\\log N)$ rounds with an\nestimation error of $\\sqrt{d(2q+1)/N}$, hence approaching the optimal error\nrate $\\sqrt{d/N}$ in the centralized and failure-free setting.

Although\nbeamforming by directly minimizing probability of error (MPE) has potential\nadvantages over classical beamforming methods such as zero-forcing and minimum\nmean square error beamforming, MPE beamforming results in a non-convex and a\nhighly nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, by adding a set of\nmodulation-based constraints, the MPE beamforming problem is transformed into a\nconvex programming problem. Then, a simplified version of the MPE beamforming\nis proposed which reduces the exponential number of constraints in the MPE\nbeamforming problem. The simplified problem is also shown to be a convex\nprogramming problem. The complexity of the simplified problem is further\nreduced by minimizing a convex function which serves as an upper bound on the\nerror probability.

An important objective of plasma\nastrophysics is therefore the characterization of nonthermal particle\nacceleration (NTPA) effected by reconnection. Reconnection-powered NTPA has\nbeen demonstrated over a wide range of physical conditions using large\ntwo-dimensional (2D) kinetic simulations. However, its robustness in realistic\n3D reconnection -- in particular, whether the 3D relativistic drift-kink\ninstability (RDKI) disrupts NTPA -- has not been systematically investigated,\nalthough pioneering 3D simulations have observed NTPA in isolated cases. Here\nwe present the first comprehensive study of NTPA in 3D relativistic\nreconnection in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, characterizing NTPA as\nthe strength of 3D effects is varied systematically via the length in the third\ndimension and the strength of the guide magnetic field. We find that, while the\nRDKI prominently perturbs 3D reconnecting current sheets, it does not suppress\nparticle acceleration, even for zero guide field; fully 3D reconnection\nrobustly and efficiently produces nonthermal power-law particle spectra closely\nresembling those obtained in 2D. This finding provides strong support for\nreconnection as the key mechanism powering high-energy flares in various\nastrophysical systems. We also show that strong guide fields significantly\ninhibit NTPA, slowing reconnection and limiting the energy available for plasma\nenergization, yielding steeper and shorter power-law spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 02:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

In this\ncontext, the present review focuses on perovskites, including both organic\nhalide perovskites and inorganic oxide perovskites, due to their proven\nproperties as photovoltaic materials and their intriguing potential for\nadditional functionality, such as ferroelectricity. Ferroelectrics are a\nspecial class of perovskites that have been studied in detail for photoferroic,\npyroelectric and thermoelectric effects and energy storage, which we briefly\nreview here. Furthermore, the possibilities of simultaneously tuning these\nmechanisms in perovskite materials for multiple energy conversion mechanisms\nand storage for ultra-high density capacitor and battery applications is also\nexamined in order to attain a better understanding and to present novel\nopportunities.

The cyclotron line energy showed a marginal\nnegative dependence on the luminosity. The cyclotron line parameters were found\nto be variable with pulse phase and interpreted as due to the effect of\nemission geometry or complicated structure of the pulsar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 06:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

However, the emergence of \"thinking\" that is a typical higher function\nis difficult to realize because \"thinking\" needs non fixed-point, flow-type\nattractors with both convergence and transition dynamics. Furthermore, in order\nto introduce \"inspiration\" or \"discovery\" in \"thinking\", not completely random\nbut unexpected transition should be also required.\n  By analogy to \"chaotic itinerancy\", we have hypothesized that \"exploration\"\ngrows into \"thinking\" through learning by forming flow-type attractors on\nchaotic random-like dynamics. It is expected that if rational dynamics are\nlearned in a chaotic neural network (ChNN), coexistence of rational state\ntransition, inspiration-like state transition and also random-like exploration\nfor unknown situation can be realized.\n  Based on the above idea, we have proposed new reinforcement learning using a\nChNN as an actor. The positioning of exploration is completely different from\nthe conventional one. The chaotic dynamics inside the ChNN produces exploration\nfactors by itself. Since external random numbers for stochastic action\nselection are not used, exploration factors cannot be isolated from the output.\nTherefore, the learning method is also completely different from the\nconventional one.\n  At each non-feedback connection, one variable named causality trace takes in\nand maintains the input through the connection according to the change in its\noutput. Using the trace and TD error, the weight is updated.\n  In this paper, as the result of a recent simple task to see whether the new\nlearning works or not, it is shown that a robot with two wheels and two visual\nsensors reaches a target while avoiding an obstacle after learning though there\nare still many rooms for improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 06:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

For a\ngeneric nonlinear coupling, one encounters a special regime of transitions,\ncharacterized by extremely narrow fronts, far supersonic velocities of\npropagation and long waves in the oscillatory tail. This regime can be\nqualitatively associated with a shock wave. The front propagation can be\ndescribed with the help of a simple reduced-order model; the latter delivers a\nkinetic law, which is almost not sensitive to fine details of the on-site\npotential. Besides, it is possible to predict all main characteristics of the\ntransition front, including its shape and frequency and amplitude of the\noscillatory tail. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the\nanalytical predictions. The suggested approach allows one to consider the\neffects of an external pre-load and on-site damping. When the damping is\nmoderate, the analysis remains in the frame of the reduced-order model. It is\npossible to consider the solution for the front propagating in the damped chain\nas a perturbation of the undamped dynamics. This approach yield reasonable\npredictions.

A well-studied distributed algorithm for this problem is\nthe 3-majority dynamics, which works as follows: per round, each node gathers\nthree opinions --- say by taking its own and two of other nodes sampled at\nrandom --- and then it sets its opinion equal to the majority of this set; ties\nare broken arbitrarily, e.g., towards the node's own opinion.\n  Becchetti et al. [SODA'16] showed that the 3-majority dynamics converges to\nconsensus in O((k^2\\sqrt{\\log n} + k\\log n)(k+\\log n)) rounds, even in the\npresence of a limited adversary. We prove that, even with a stronger adversary,\nthe convergence happens within O(k\\log n) rounds. This bound is known to be\noptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 08:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

Furthermore, we find a measurement pattern for generating non\nabelian anyons where measurement induced defects on a toric code state play the\nrole of Ising anyons. We also support our scheme by a graphical notation where,\nby following a few simple graphical transformations, one will be able to\nconvert a CSS topological state to a cluster state. Our scheme can be also used\nfor experimental realization of anyons on cluster states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 09:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

One major challenge in this context is how to\nmaximize the user's quality-of-experience (QoE) while ensuring at the same time\nthe stability of the global control loop in the presence of communication\ndelay. In this paper, we propose a dynamic control scheme switching strategy\nfor teleoperation systems, which maximizes the QoE for time-varying\ncommunication delay. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed\napproach, we perform a dedicated case study for a virtual teleoperation\nenvironment consisting of a one-dimensional spring-damper system, and conduct\nextensive subjective tests under various delay conditions for two control\nschemes: (1) teleoperation with the time-domain passivity approach (TDPA),\nwhich is highly delay-sensitive but supports highly dynamic interaction between\nthe operator and a potentially quickly changing remote environment; (2)\nmodel-mediated teleoperation (MMT), which is tolerable to relatively larger\ncommunication delays, but unsuitable for quickly changing, highly dynamic\nremote environments. For both schemes, we use recently proposed extensions,\nwhich incorporate perceptual data reduction to reduce the required packet rate\nbetween the operator and the teleoperator. One key contribution of this paper\nlies in the exploration of the intrinsic relationship among QoE, communication\ndelay and the control schemes which provides a fundamental guidance, not only\nto this research, but also to the future joint optimization of communication\nand control for time-delayed teleoperation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 09:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

We show that the proposed approach based on denoising\nautoencoders recovers the bi-modality in the galaxy population in an\nunsupervised manner, without using any prior knowledge on galaxy SED\nclassification. This technique has been compared to principal component\nanalysis (PCA) and to standard color/color representations. In addition,\npreliminary results illustrate that this enables the capturing of extra\nphysically meaningful information, such as redshift dependence, galaxy mass\nevolution and variation over the specific star formation rate. PCA also results\nin an unsupervised representation with physical properties, such as mass and\nsSFR, although this representation separates out. less other characteristics\n(bimodality, redshift evolution) than denoising autoencoders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 09:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

Two variants of such measurement are considered, the first\nof which is the measurement of ITR between two bonded layers of different\nmaterials which had been studied before by various researchers. The second\ntested measurement method is targeted at determination of ITR in particulate\ncomposites with low and moderate filler content based on their effective\nthermal conductivity. Method of such measurement is proposed and tested on two\ncases of particle-filled polymer composites. Positive verification results were\nobtained for polymer/glass composite in which the difference between thermal\nconductivities of matrix and filler is low. For a polymer filled with aluminum\nparticles the evaluation of average ITR in the samples was impossible as the\neffective medium models applied in the method strongly underestimated the\nthermal conductivity of that material.

We grouped the bursts according to the source spectral state during\nwhich they were observed (hard or soft), flagging those bursts that showed\nsigns of photospheric radius expansion (PRE).

The aim is to minimize\nthe expected time until the first agent finds it. Searchers run in parallel\nwhere at each time step each searcher can \"peek\" into a box. A basic family of\nalgorithms which are inherently robust is \\emph{non-coordinating} algorithms.\nSuch algorithms act independently at each searcher, differing only by their\nprobabilistic choices. We are interested in the price incurred by employing\nsuch algorithms when compared with the case of full coordination. We first show\nthat there exists a non-coordination algorithm, that knowing only the relative\nlikelihood of boxes according to $p$, has expected running time of at most\n$10+4(1+\\frac{1}{k})^2 T$, where $T$ is the expected running time of the best\nfully coordinated algorithm. This result is obtained by applying a refined\nversion of the main algorithm suggested by Fraigniaud, Korman and Rodeh in\nSTOC'16, which was designed for the context of linear parallel search.We then\ndescribe an optimal non-coordinating algorithm for the case where the\ndistribution $p$ is known. The running time of this algorithm is difficult to\nanalyse in general, but we calculate it for several examples. In the case where\n$p$ is uniform over a finite set of boxes, then the algorithm just checks boxes\nuniformly at random among all non-checked boxes and is essentially $2$ times\nworse than the coordinating algorithm.We also show simple algorithms for Pareto\ndistributions over $M$ boxes. That is, in the case where $p(x) \\sim 1/x^b$ for\n$0< b < 1$, we suggest the following algorithm: at step $t$ choose uniformly\nfrom the boxes unchecked in ${1, . . . ,min(M, \\lfloor t/\\sigma\\rfloor)}$,\nwhere $\\sigma = b/(b + k - 1)$. It turns out this algorithm is asymptotically\noptimal, and runs about $2+b$ times worse than the case of full coordination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 13:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

This claim is investigated via reexamination of\npreviously reported width measures. Then, a sample of peak-flux GRB spectra are\nfit with an idealized, physical synchrotron model. It is found that many\nspectra can be adequately fit by this model even when the width measures would\nreject it. Thus, the results advocate for fitting a physical model to be the\nsole tool for testing that model. Finally, a smoothly-broken power law is fit\nto these spectra allowing for the spectral curvature to vary during the fitting\nprocess in order to understand why the previous width measures poorly predict\nthe spectra. It is found that the failing of previous width measures is due to\na combination of inferring physical parameters from unfolded spectra as well as\nthe presence of multiple widths in the data beyond what the Band function can\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 14:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 07:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

One possible route to improve the thermal\nconductance ($G$) of metal/graphene interfaces is through additional heat\nconduction by electrons, since graphene can be easily doped by metals. In this\npaper, we evaluate the electronic heat conduction across metal/graphene\ninterfaces by measuring the thermal conductance of Pd/transferred graphene\n(trG)/Pd interfaces, prepared by either thermal evaporation or radio-frequency\n(rf) magnetron sputtering, over a wide temperature range of 80 to 500 K. We\nfind that for the samples prepared by thermal evaporation, the thermal\nconductance of Pd/trG/Pd is 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. The thermal conductance\nonly weakly depends on temperature, which suggests that heat is predominantly\ncarried by phonons across the intrinsic Pd/graphene interface. However, for\nPd/trG/Pd samples with the top Pd films deposited by rf magnetron sputtering,\nwe observe a significant increment of thermal conductance from the intrinsic\nvalue of 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ to 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and $G$ is\nroughly proportional to $T$. We attribute the enhancement of thermal\nconductance to an additional channel of heat transport by electrons via\natomic-scale pinholes formed in the graphene during the sputtering process.

Current approaches to deal with\ninterference, in theory and in practice, often make restrictive assumptions on\nits structure---for instance, assuming that interference is local---even when\nusing otherwise nonparametric inference strategies. This reliance on explicit\nrestrictions on the interference mechanism suggests a shared intuition that\ninference is impossible without any assumptions on the interference structure.\nIn this paper, we begin by formalizing this intuition in the context of a\nclassical nonparametric approach to inference, referred to as design-based\ninference of causal effects. Next, we show how, always in the context of\ndesign-based inference, even parametric structural assumptions that allow the\nexistence of unbiased estimators, cannot guarantee a decreasing variance even\nin the large sample limit. This lack of concentration in large samples is often\nobserved empirically, in randomized experiments in which interference of some\nform is expected to be present. This result has direct consequences for the\ndesign and analysis of large experiments---for instance, in online social\nplatforms---where the belief is that large sample sizes automatically guarantee\nsmall variance. More broadly, our results suggest that although strategies for\ncausal inference in the presence of interference borrow their formalism and\nmain concepts from the traditional causal inference literature, much of the\nintuition from the no-interference case do not easily transfer to the\ninterference setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 15:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

An\nHFIT produces an optimum treelike structure, i.e., a natural hierarchical\nstructure that accommodates simplicity by combining several low-dimensional\nfuzzy inference systems (FISs). Such a natural hierarchical structure provides\na high degree of approximation accuracy. The construction of HFIT takes place\nin two phases. Firstly, a nondominated sorting based multiobjective genetic\nprogramming (MOGP) is applied to obtain a simple tree structure (a low\ncomplexity model) with a high accuracy. Secondly, the differential evolution\nalgorithm is applied to optimize the obtained tree's parameters. In the derived\ntree, each node acquires a different input's combination, where the\nevolutionary process governs the input's combination. Hence, HFIT nodes are\nheterogeneous in nature, which leads to a high diversity among the rules\ngenerated by the HFIT. Additionally, the HFIT provides an automatic feature\nselection because it uses MOGP for the tree's structural optimization that\naccepts inputs only relevant to the knowledge contained in data. The HFIT was\nstudied in the context of both type-1 and type-2 FISs, and its performance was\nevaluated through six application problems. Moreover, the proposed\nmultiobjective HFIT was compared both theoretically and empirically with\nrecently proposed FISs methods from the literature, such as McIT2FIS,\nTSCIT2FNN, SIT2FNN, RIT2FNS-WB, eT2FIS, MRIT2NFS, IT2FNN-SVR, etc. From the\nobtained results, it was found that the HFIT provided less complex and highly\naccurate models compared to the models produced by the most of other methods.\nHence, the proposed HFIT is an efficient and competitive alternative to the\nother FISs for function approximation and feature selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 15:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

In contrast to microwave systems, at\nshorter mmWave wavelengths such blockage can be caused by human bodies, where\ntheir mobility within environment makes wireless channel alternate between the\nblocked and non-blocked LoS states. Following the recent 3GPP requirements on\nmodeling the dynamic blockage as well as the temporal consistency of the\nchannel at mmWave frequencies, in this paper a new model for predicting the\nstate of a user in the presence of mobile blockers for representative 3GPP\nscenarios is developed: urban micro cell (UMi) street canyon and\npark/stadium/square. It is demonstrated that the blockage effects produce an\nalternating renewal process with exponentially distributed non-blocked\nintervals, and blocked durations that follow the general distribution. The\nfollowing metrics are derived (i) the mean and the fraction of time spent in\nblocked/non-blocked state, (ii) the residual blocked/non-blocked time, and\n(iii) the time-dependent conditional probability of having blockage/no blockage\nat time t1 given that there was blockage/no blockage at time t0. The latter is\na function of the arrival rate (intensity), width, and height of moving\nblockers, distance to the mmWave access point (AP), as well as the heights of\nthe AP and the user device. The proposed model can be used for system-level\ncharacterization of mmWave cellular communication systems. For example, the\noptimal height and the maximum coverage radius of the mmWave APs are derived,\nwhile satisfying the required mean data rate constraint. The system-level\nsimulations corroborate that the use of the proposed method considerably\nreduces the modeling complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 18:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 11:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

Involving\nall sensors increases the energy budget unnecessarily and decreases the\nlifetime of the WASN. Using microphone subset selection, also termed as sensor\nselection, the most informative sensors can be chosen from a set of candidate\nsensors to achieve a prescribed inference performance. In this paper, we\nconsider microphone subset selection for minimum variance distortionless\nresponse (MVDR) beamformer based noise reduction. The best subset of sensors is\ndetermined by minimizing the transmission cost while constraining the output\nnoise power (or signal-to-noise ratio). Assuming the statistical information on\ncorrelation matrices of the sensor measurements is available, the sensor\nselection problem for this model-driven scheme is first solved by utilizing\nconvex optimization techniques. In addition, to avoid estimating the statistics\nrelated to all the candidate sensors beforehand, we also propose a data-driven\napproach to select the best subset using a greedy strategy. The performance of\nthe greedy algorithm converges to that of the model-driven method, while it\ndisplays advantages in dynamic scenarios as well as on computational\ncomplexity. Compared to a sparse MVDR or radius-based beamformer, experiments\nshow that the proposed methods can guarantee the desired performance with\nsignificantly less transmission costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 14:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

To improve accuracy, FNT parameters\nwere optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of\nthe FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques:\nmultilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning\ntree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die\nfilling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a\nmodel shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose\n(MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were\nroll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into\nsamples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at\ndifferent shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset\nconsisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as\nthe inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation\n(CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate\nthe predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV\nmethods) performed much better than other CI models.
