Local helioseismology has detected spatially extended converging\nsurface flows into solar active regions. These play an important role in\nflux-transport models of the solar dynamo.\n  Aims. We aim to validate the existence of the inflows by deriving horizontal\nflow velocities around active regions with local correlation tracking of\ngranulation.\n  Methods. We generate a six-year long-time series of full-disk maps of the\nhorizontal velocity at the solar surface by tracking granules in continuum\nintensity images provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).\n  Results. On average, active regions are surrounded by inflows extending up to\n10 deg from the center of the active region of magnitudes of 20-30 m/s,\nreaching locally up to 40 m/s, which is in agreement with results from local\nhelioseismology.

Here, we propose a scheme for\nnonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with nitrogen-vacancy center\nelectron spins, which are characterized by fast quantum gates and long qubit\ncoherence times. By varying the detuning, amplitudes, and phase difference of\nlasers applied to a nitrogen-vacancy center, one can directly realize an\narbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate on the spin. Meanwhile, with the help of\ncavity-assisted interactions, a nontrivial two-qubit holonomic quantum gate can\nalso be induced. The distinct merit of this scheme is that all the quantum\ngates are obtained via an all-optical geometric manipulation of the solid-state\nspins. Therefore, our scheme opens the possibility for robust quantum\ncomputation using solid-state spins in an all-optical way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 16:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 06:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

However, such tools depend on system\ntopology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in\ndistribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to\nfind line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately,\nthe linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the\ninput measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output\nmeasurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even\nwith a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of\nfinding the topology using non-zero line parameters with a proper metric. To\nmodel input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the\nerror-in-variables (EIV) model in a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)\nframework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly\nsolving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a\ngeneralized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and\nnoise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with\nparameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization\nfashion in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a\nradial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior\nperformance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder\ndata from South California Edison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 17:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

For example, for\nbosonic quantum channels, the cost associated with an input state is the number\nof photons, which is proportional to the energy consumed. In such a setting, it\nis often useful to know the maximum amount of information that can be reliably\ntransmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the capacity per unit cost. In\nthis paper, we generalize the capacity per unit cost to various communication\ntasks involving a quantum channel such as classical communication,\nentanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and\nquantum communication. For each task, we define the corresponding capacity per\nunit cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity.\nFurthermore, for the special and natural case in which there is a zero-cost\nstate, we obtain expressions in terms of an optimized relative entropy\ninvolving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an\nexplicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the capacity per\nunit cost. Finally, we compute capacities per unit cost for various bosonic\nGaussian channels and introduce the notion of a blocklength constraint as a\nproposed solution to the long-standing issue of infinite capacities per unit\ncost.

We investigate three observable metrics that\ncould allow constraints on cloud properties from transmission spectra, namely,\nthe optical slope, the uniformity of this slope, and condensate features in the\ninfrared. We derive these metrics using model transmission spectra considering\nMie extinction from a wide range of condensate species, particle sizes, and\nscale heights. Firstly, we investigate possible degeneracies among the cloud\nproperties for an observed slope. We find, for example, that spectra with very\nsteep optical slopes suggest sulphide clouds (e.g. MnS, ZnS, Na$_2$S) in the\natmospheres. Secondly, (non)uniformities in optical slopes provide additional\nconstraints on cloud properties, e.g., MnS, ZnS, TiO$_2$, and Fe$_2$O$_3$ have\nsignificantly non-uniform slopes.

In\nthis work, we revisit whether this possible discrepancy can be attributed to\nnew interactions in the dark matter sector. Focusing on a cosmological model\nwhere dark matter interacts with a dark radiation species until the epoch of\nmatter-radiation equality, we find that measurements of the Lyman-alpha flux\npower spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides no support to the\nhypothesis that new dark matter interactions can resolve the possible tension\nbetween CMB and large-scale structure (LSS).

In our approach,\ndust grains are efficiently produced in the clumpy ejecta of core-collapse\nsupernovae, fragmented into small pieces ($\\lesssim 0.05$ $\\mu$m) as they are\nincorporated into the hot and dense ISM, heated via frequent collisions with\nelectrons and the absorption of energetic photons. Grains with small sizes can\nmore easily acquire the high temperatures ($\\sim 1000$ K) required to produce a\nNIR-MIR excess with respect to the emission of foreground PAHs and starlight.\nHowever, the extreme conditions inside young massive clusters make difficult\nfor these small grains to have a persistent manifestation at NIR-MIR\nwavelengths as they are destroyed by efficient thermal sputtering.\nNevertheless, the chances for a persistent manifestation are increased by\ntaking into account that small grains become increasingly transparent to their\nimpinging ions as their size decreases. For an individual SN event, we find\nthat the NIR-MIR excess last longer if the time required to incorporate all the\ngrains into the thermalized medium is also longer, and in some cases,\ncomparable to the characteristic interval between supernova explosions.

The validity of the parametrised bias model\nis established using a parametrisation-independent extraction of the bias\nfunction. This average bias model is then combined with the dark matter PDF,\nneglecting any scatter around it: it nevertheless yields an excellent model for\ndensities-in-cells statistics of mass tracers that is parametrised in terms of\nthe underlying dark matter variance and three bias parameters.

A partial answer to\nthis intriguing question was recently provided by the 'no-short hair' theorem\nwhich asserts that the external fields of a spherically-symmetric electrically\nneutral hairy black-hole configuration must extend beyond the null circular\ngeodesic which characterizes the corresponding black-hole spacetime. One\nnaturally wonders whether the no-short hair inequality\n$r_{\\text{hair}}>r_{\\text{null}}$ is a generic property of all electrically\nneutral hairy black-hole spacetimes? In this paper we provide evidence that the\nanswer to this interesting question may be positive. In particular, we prove\nthat the recently discovered cloudy Kerr black-hole spacetimes --\nnon-spherically symmetric non-static black holes which support linearized\nmassive scalar fields in their exterior regions -- also respect this no-short\nhair lower bound. Specifically, we analytically derive the lower bound\n$r_{\\text{field}}/r_+>r_+/r_-$ on the effective lengths of the external\nbound-state massive scalar clouds (here $r_{\\text{field}}$ is the peak location\nof the stationary bound-state scalar fields and $r_{\\pm}$ are the horizon radii\nof the black hole). Remarkably, this lower bound is universal in the sense that\nit is independent of the physical parameters (proper mass and angular harmonic\nindices) of the exterior scalar fields.

Experiments with unlabeled synthetic\nand real-world videos demonstrated that the neural networks equipped with UL\nlayers and trained with the proposed online learning algorithm can extract\nshape and motion information from video sequences of moving objects.

It is widely agreed that the combined use of\nvisual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently,\nStatistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for\nreasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich\nknowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are an SRL framework which integrates\nneural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning\nfrom noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with\nlogical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we\ndevelop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the\nclassification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant\npart-of relations between objects.

We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of\noperators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D\nand higher dimensions, and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to\noperator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that\nthe out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation,\nwhich gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC, and the\nbutterfly speed $v_{B}$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens\ndiffusively, with a width scaling in time as $t^{1/2}$. We address fluctuations\nin the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that\nthey are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front. Turning to\nhigher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a\nremarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies\nthat the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as $t^{1/3}$ in 2+1D\nand $t^{0.24}$ in 3+1D (KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with\nsimulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in a lattice model, the late time shape\nof the spreading operator is in general not spherical. However when full\nspatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact\nasymptotic form for the OTOC in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an\nalternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition\nfunction of an Ising-like model. As a result of special structure arising from\nunitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which\ncan be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for\nentanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 21:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 10:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Such methods motivated the recently developed\nPlug-and-Play prior method, which provides a framework to use advanced\ndenoising algorithms as regularizers in inversion. However, the need to\nformulate regularized inversion as the solution to an optimization problem\nlimits the possible regularity conditions and physical sensor models.\n  In this paper, we introduce Consensus Equilibrium (CE), which generalizes\nregularized inversion to include a much wider variety of both forward\ncomponents and prior components without the need for either to be expressed\nwith a cost function. CE is based on the solution of a set of equilibrium\nequations that balance data fit and regularity. In this framework, the problem\nof MAP estimation in regularized inversion is replaced by the problem of\nsolving these equilibrium equations, which can be approached in multiple ways.\n  The key contribution of CE is to provide a novel framework for fusing\nmultiple heterogeneous models of physical sensors or models learned from data.\nWe describe the derivation of the CE equations and prove that the solution of\nthe CE equations generalizes the standard MAP estimate under appropriate\ncircumstances.\n  We also discuss algorithms for solving the CE equations, including ADMM with\na novel form of preconditioning and Newton's method.

Today it is incredibly easy and affordable to set up a fixed camera\nand record athletes in a wide range of sports, such as diving, gymnastics,\ngolf, tennis, etc. However, the manual analysis of the obtained footage is a\ntime-consuming task which involves isolating actions of interest and\ncategorizing them using domain-specific knowledge. In order to automate this\nkind of task, three challenging sub-problems are often encountered: 1)\ntemporally cropping events/actions of interest from continuous video; 2)\ntracking the object of interest; and 3) classifying the events/actions of\ninterest.\n  Most previous work has focused on solving just one of the above sub-problems\nin isolation. In contrast, this paper provides a complete solution to the\noverall action monitoring task in the context of a challenging real-world\nexemplar. Specifically, we address the problem of diving classification. This\nis a challenging problem since the person (diver) of interest typically\noccupies fewer than 1% of the pixels in each frame. The model is required to\nlearn the temporal boundaries of a dive, even though other divers and\nbystanders may be in view. Finally, the model must be sensitive to subtle\nchanges in body pose over a large number of frames to determine the\nclassification code. We provide effective solutions to each of the sub-problems\nwhich combine to provide a highly functional solution to the task as a whole.\nThe techniques proposed can be easily generalized to video footage recorded\nfrom other sports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 00:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

Furthermore, observations of radial density profiles and the\nradio continua of numerous MC cores evolving towards protostars also suggest\nthat polytropic dynamic spheres of $\\gamma$ > 1 should be used in physical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 01:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

By considering the Langevin diffusion as a gradient flow in the\nspace of probability distributions, we obtain an elegant analysis that applies\nto the stronger property of convergence in KL-divergence and gives a\nconceptually simpler proof of the best-known convergence results in weaker\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 05:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 03:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}

In the vicinity of\nthe angular momentum compensation point, the dynamics of the vortex resemble\nthose of an antiferromagnetic vortex, which is described by equations of motion\nanalogous to Newton's second law for the motion of particles. Owing to the\nantiferromagnetic nature of the dynamics, the vortex oscillation frequency can\nbe an order of magnitude larger than the frequency of a ferromagnetic vortex,\namounting to tens of GHz in common transition-metal based alloys.

In photonics, localized states are\nextensively used to confine and manipulate photons. Up to now, all the proposed\nlocalized states are reciprocal and restricted by time reversal symmetry.\nConsequently, localization is bidirectional and photons at the allowed passband\nin the otherwise forbidden stop band are confined irrespective of the direction\nof incident beam. In this report, by embedding a single defect in a\none-dimensional spatiotemporally modulated photonic lattice, we demonstrate\nthat it is possible to have localization of photon only in one direction. In a\nspatiotemporally modulated photonics lattice, a time dependent potential\ngenerates an effective magnetic biasing, which breaks the reciprocity.\nMoreover, in such moving lattices the dispersion relation obtains a shift\ndepending on the direction of effective magnetic biasing. A static defect\nsynthesized in a temporally modulated lattice will generate a spatial\nlocalization of light in the bandgap. However, due to the shift of the bandgap\nthe localization occurs in different frequencies depending on the direction of\nincident field. We envisage that this phenomenon might has impact not only in\nphotonics but also other areas of physics and engineering such as condensed\nmatter and acoustics, opens the doors for designing new types of devices such\nas non-reciprocal traps, sensors, unidirectional tunable filters, and might\nresult in unconventional transports such as unidirectional lasing.

Here, for the\nfirst time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural\nnetwork (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an\nexternal classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal\ncoding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less\nactivated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron\nwas assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus\ncategory was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was\ncorrect, the neuron was rewarded, i.e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)\nwas applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP\nwas applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As\ndemonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward\nmodulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual\nfeatures, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that\nconsistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets.\nFurthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic\nchanges such as label permutations.

The proof can be refined, if one considers an\norbital distribution close to purely radial, but not entirely radial, which\nallows to avoid the central singularity. For this purpose we employ\nnon-singular analogs of generalised polytropes elaborated recently in our work\nin order to derive and solve new integral equations adopted for calculation of\nunstable eigenmodes in systems with nearly radial orbits. In addition, we\nestablish a link between our and Antonov's approaches and uncover the meaning\nof infinite entities in the purely radial case. Maximum growth rates tend to\ninfinity as the system becomes more and more radially anisotropic. The\ninstability takes place both for even and odd spherical harmonics, with all\nunstable modes developing rapidly, i.e. having eigenfrequencies comparable to\nor greater than typical orbital frequencies. This invalidates orbital\napproximation in the case of systems with all orbits very close to purely\nradial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 12:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

It is shown that the existence of comparable OPMs and of the large V\nresults from a coherent addition of phase-delayed waves in natural propagation\nmodes, which are produced by an incident linearly polarised signal. The\ncoherent mode summation implies opposite polarisation properties to those known\nfrom the incoherent case, in particular, the OPM jumps occur at peaks of V ,\nwhereas V changes sign at a maximum of the linear polarisation fraction L/I.\nThese features are indispensable to interpret various observed polarisation\neffects.

We prove that given a schema $S$ which is predicate-linear,\nfree and liberal, such that the true and false parts of every if predicate\nsatisfy a simple additional condition, and a slicing criterion defined by the\nfinal value of a given variable after execution of any program defined by $S$,\nthe minimal subschema of $S$ which respects this slicing criterion contains all\nthe function and predicate symbols `needed' by the variable according to the\ndata dependence and control dependence relations used in program slicing, which\nis the symbol set given by Weiser's static slicing algorithm. Thus this\nalgorithm gives predicate-minimal slices for classes of programs represented by\nschemas satisfying our set of conditions. We also give an example to show that\nthe corresponding result with respect to the slicing criterion defined by\ntermination behaviour is incorrect. This complements a result by the authors in\nwhich $S$ was required to be function-linear, instead of predicate-linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 09:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

It is demonstrated\nnumerically that localized states can be excited in the system when it is\ninitialized with single-site excitations; depending on the amplitude of those\ninitial states, the localization is either due to the flat-band or to nonlinear\neffects.

Strategies for managing these flood risks\npresent decision challenges that require a combination of geophysical,\neconomic, and infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new\nground on the considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading\ninfrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme flood events.\nHowever, many risk-based adaptation strategies remain silent on certain\npotentially important uncertainties, as well as the trade-offs between\ncompeting objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic\ndecision-analytical model (van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture trade-offs across\nconflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of\nstructural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge models, and\n(iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most strongly influence each\nobjective using global sensitivity analysis. We find that the flood adaptation\nmodel produces potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional\nmean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective problem\nformulation to one with multi-objective trade-offs dramatically expands the\ndecision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address\nstakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties that have large\neffects on the model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for\nthe greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively identifies\nimportant parameter interactions that local methods overlook, and which could\nhave critical implications for flood adaptation strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 17:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}
