To\nachieve this level of accuracy, we use as a first modelling step a regularized\nself-stretching term in the framework of the Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD)\napproximation that was shown to give a realistic picture of small scales\nstatistics of turbulence only up to moderate Reynolds numbers.

This probabilistic closure uses as a building block a\nrandom field that fulfils the statistical description of the intermittency,\ni.e. multifractal, phenomenon. To do so, we define and generalize to a\nstatistically stationary framework a proposition made by Schmitt (2003). These\nconsiderations lead us to propose a non-linear and non-Markovian closed\ndynamics for the elements of the velocity gradient tensor.

These estimators that\nadjust for measurement error are broadly referred to as density deconvolution\nestimators. While most methods in the literature assume the distribution of the\nmeasurement error to be fully known, a recently proposed method based on the\nempirical phase function (EPF) can deal with the situation when the measurement\nerror distribution is unknown. The EPF density estimator has only been\nconsidered in the context of additive and homoscedastic measurement error;\nhowever, the measurement error of many biomedical variables is heteroscedastic\nin nature. In this paper, we developed a phase function approach for density\ndeconvolution when the measurement error has unknown distribution and is\nheteroscedastic. A weighted empirical phase function (WEPF) is proposed where\nthe weights are used to adjust for heteroscedasticity of measurement error. The\nasymptotic properties of the WEPF estimator are evaluated. Simulation results\nshow that the weighting can result in large decreases in mean integrated\nsquared error (MISE) when estimating the phase function.

This giant tunablility is rooted in the\ndominance of excitonic effects in the refractive index of the monolayers and\nthe strong susceptibility of the excitons to the influence of injected charge\ncarriers. The tunability mainly results from the effects of injected charge\ncarriers to broaden the spectral width of excitonic interband transitions and\nto facilitate the interconversion of neutral and charged excitons. The other\neffects of the injected charge carriers, such as renormalizing bandgap and\nchanging exciton binding energy, only play negligible roles.

The joints passively preserve\ntheir angles until one of the actuators moves them again. This actuation can be\napplied to any serial robot with two or more links.

However, for continuous optimisation problems or\nproblems with a large number of actions, bandit based approaches can be\nhindered by slow learning. Gradient based approaches, on the other hand,\nnavigate quickly in high-dimensional continuous spaces through local\noptimisation, following the gradient in fine grained steps. Yet, apart from\nbeing susceptible to local optima, these schemes are less suited for online\nlearning due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error before the optimum\ncan be identified. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that unifies\nthe above two paradigms in one single framework, with the aim of combining\ntheir advantages. At the heart of our approach we find a stochastic linear\napproximation of the function to be optimised, where both the gradient and\nvalues of the function are explicitly captured. This allows us to learn from\nboth noisy function and gradient observations, and predict these properties\nacross the action space to support optimisation. We further propose an\naccompanying bandit driven exploration scheme that uses Bayesian credible\nbounds to trade off exploration against exploitation. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate that by unifying bandit and gradient based learning, one obtains\nconsistently improved performance across a wide spectrum of problem\nenvironments. Furthermore, even when gradient feedback is unavailable, the\nflexibility of our model, including gradient prediction, still allows us\noutperform competing approaches, although with a smaller margin. Due to the\npervasiveness of bandit based optimisation, our scheme opens up for improved\nperformance both in meta-optimisation and in applications where gradient\nrelated information is readily available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 09:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

We\ninvestigate,for the first time,via extensive DNSs,the statistical properties of\nspiral-and scroll-wave turbulence in two- and three-dimensional excitable media\nby using approaches employed in studies of classical turbulence. We use the\nPanfilov and the Aliev-Panfilov mathematical models for cardiac tissue. We show\nthat once electrical-wave turbulence has been initiated,there is a forward\ncascade,in which spirals or scrolls form,interact,and break to yield a\nturbulent state that is statistically steady and,far away from boundaries,is\nstatistically homogeneous and isotropic. For the transmembrane potential $V$\nand the slow recovery variable $g$,which define our models,we define $E_V(k)$\nand $E_g(k)$,the electrical-wave analogs of the fluid energy spectrum $E(k)$ in\nfluid turbulence. We show that $E_V(k)$ and $E_g(k)$ are spread out over\nseveral decades in $k$. Thus spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence involves a wide\nrange of spatial scales. $E_V(k)$ and $E_g(k)$ show approximate power laws,in\nsome range of $k$, however,their exponents cannot be determined as accurately\nas their fluid-turbulence counterparts. The dimensionless ratio $L/\\lambda$ is\na convenient control parameter like the Reynolds number for fluid\nturbulence,where $L$ is the linear size of the domain and $\\lambda$ the\nwavelength of a plane wave in the medium. By comparing several other\nstatistical properties for spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence with their\nfluid-turbulence counterparts,we show that,although spiral- and scroll-wave\nturbulence have some statistical properties like those of fluid\nturbulence,overall these types of turbulence are special and differ in\nimportant ways from fluid turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 12:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

One popular approach is to use L1-norm function. However, the\nrobustness of L1-norm function is not well understood so far. In this paper, we\npresent a new outlier regularization framework to understand and analyze the\nrobustness of L1-norm function. There are two main features for the proposed\noutlier regularization. (1) A key property of outlier regularization is that\nhow far an outlier lies away from its theoretically predicted value does not\naffect the final regularization and analysis results. (2) Another important\nfeature of outlier regularization is that it has an equivalent continuous\nrepresentation that closely relates to L1 function. This provides a new way to\nunderstand and analyze the robustness of L1 function. We apply our outlier\nregularization framework to PCA and propose an outlier regularized PCA (ORPCA)\nmodel. Comparing to the trace-normbased robust PCA, ORPCA has several benefits:\n(1) It does not suffer singular value suppression. (2) It can retain small high\nrank components which help retain fine details of data.

Modified Chaplygin gas\nis a particular type of dark energy model which mimics of radiation era to\nphantom era depending on the different values of its parameters. We compare the\ndrak energy accretion with the flow of adiabatic gas. An accretion disc flow\naround a black hole is an example of a transonic flow. To make the model, we\nconsider three components of Navier Stokes' equation, the equation of\ncontinuity and the modified Chaplygin gas's equation of state. As a transonic\nflow passes through the sonic point, the velocity gradient being apparently\nsingular there, gives rise to two flow branches : one infalling, the accretion\nand the other outgoing, the wind. We show that the wind curve is stronger and\nwind speed reaches to that of light at a finite distance from the black hole\nwhen dark energy is considered. Besides, if we increase the viscosity,\naccretion disc is being shortened. This two process acting together deviates\nmuch from adiabatic accretion case. It shows a weakening process for the\naccretion procedure by the works of viscous system influenced angular momentum\ntransport and the repulsive force of the modified Chaplygin gas together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 09:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The relative intensities of the two pulses\nof the Two-bunch beam were measured, after and before the gas cell, from the\nX-ray scattering off thin targets by using fast diodes with sufficient temporal\nresolution. It was found that the after-to-before ratio of the intensities of\nthe second pulse was consistently higher than that of the first pulse,\nrevealing lower effective attenuation of the gas cell due to the heating and\nsubsequent gas density reduction in the beam path by the first pulse.

However, these techniques fail for lognormal fading\nchannels because the Taylor series of the PDF of a lognormal random variable is\nzero at the origin and the MGF does not have an explicit form. Although\nlognormal fading model has been widely applied in wireless communications and\nfree-space optical communications, few analytical tools are available to\nprovide elegant performance expressions for correlated lognormal channels. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the asymptotic outage\nprobabilities of selection combining (SC), equal-gain combining (EGC) and\nmaximum-ratio combining (MRC) over equally correlated lognormal fading\nchannels. Based on these closed-form results, we reveal the followings: i) the\noutage probability of EGC or MRC becomes an infinitely small quantity compared\nto that of SC at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); ii) channel correlation can\nresult in an infinite performance loss at large SNR. More importantly, the\nanalyses reveal insights into the long-standing problem of performance analyses\nover correlated lognormal channels at high SNR, and circumvent the\ntime-consuming Monte Carlo simulation and numerical integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 03:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}
