Efforts to protect and restore the remaining forests\nof Borneo hinge on recognising the ecosystem services they provide, including\ntheir ability to store and sequester carbon. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is a\nremote sensing technology that allows forest structural properties to be\ncaptured in great detail across vast geographic areas. In recent years ALS has\nbeen integrated into state-wide assessment of forest carbon in Neotropical and\nAfrican regions, but not yet in Asia. For this to happen new regional models\nneed to be developed for estimating carbon stocks from ALS in tropical Asia, as\nthe forests of this region are structurally and compositionally distinct from\nthose found elsewhere in the tropics. By combining ALS imagery with data from\n173 permanent forest plots spanning the lowland rain forests of Sabah, on the\nisland of Borneo, we develop a simple-yet-general model for estimating forest\ncarbon stocks using ALS-derived canopy height and canopy cover as input\nmetrics. An advanced feature of this new model is the propagation of\nuncertainty in both ALS- and ground-based data, allowing uncertainty in\nhectare-scale estimates of carbon stocks to be quantified robustly. We show\nthat the model effectively captures variation in aboveground carbons stocks\nacross extreme disturbance gradients spanning tall dipterocarp forests and\nheavily logged regions, and clearly outperforms existing ALS-based models\ncalibrated for the tropics, as well as currently available satellite-derived\nproducts. Our model provides a simple, generalised and effective approach for\nmapping forest carbon stocks in Borneo, providing a key tool to support the\nprotection and restoration of its tropical forests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 16:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

We introduce a procedure to classify these block states,\nwhich surprisingly reproduces a classification of cSPT phases recently obtained\nby Thorngren and Else using very different methods, for all wallpaper and space\ngroups. The explicit constructions underlying our results clarify the physical\nproperties of the phases classified by Thorngren and Else, and expose\nadditional structure in the classification. Moreover, the states we classify\ncan be completely characterized by point group SPT (pgSPT) invariants and\nrelated weak pgSPT invariants that we introduce.

We apply our classification to propose a\nLieb-Shultz-Mattis type constraint for two-dimensional spin systems with only\ncrystalline symmetry, and establish this constraint by a dimensional reduction\nargument. Finally, the surprising matching with the Thorngren-Else\nclassification leads us to conjecture that all SPT phases protected only by\ncrystalline symmetry can be built from lower-dimensional blocks of invertible\ntopological states.

Our work obtains the first\nprovably efficient algorithms for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the\npresence of heavy-tailed data. The main tool in this result is the centroid\nbody (a well-known topic in convex geometry), along with optimization and\nrandom walks for sampling from a convex body. This is the first algorithmic use\nof the centroid body and it is of independent theoretical interest, since it\neffectively replaces the estimation of covariance from samples, and is more\ngenerally accessible.\n  This reduction relies on a non-linear transformation of samples from such an\nintersection of halfspaces (i.e. a simplex) to samples which are approximately\nfrom a linearly transformed product distribution. Through this transformation\nof samples, which can be done efficiently, one can then use an ICA algorithm to\nrecover the vertices of the intersection of halfspaces.\n  Finally, we again use ICA as an algorithmic primitive to construct an\nefficient solution to the widely-studied problem of learning the parameters of\na Gaussian mixture model. Our algorithm again transforms samples from a\nGaussian mixture model into samples which fit into the ICA model and, when\nprocessed by an ICA algorithm, result in recovery of the mixture parameters.\nOur algorithm is effective even when the number of Gaussians in the mixture\ngrows polynomially with the ambient dimension\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 17:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

However, estimation of\nmultitype cardiac indices with consistently reliable and high accuracy is still\na great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structures and\ncomplexity of temporal dynamics in cardiac MR sequences. While efforts have\nbeen devoted into cardiac volumes estimation through feature engineering\nfollowed by a independent regression model, these methods suffer from the\nvulnerable feature representation and incompatible regression model. In this\npaper, we propose a semi-automated method for multitype cardiac indices\nestimation. After manual labelling of two landmarks for ROI cropping, an\nintegrated deep neural network Indices-Net is designed to jointly learn the\nrepresentation and regression models. It comprises two tightly-coupled\nnetworks: a deep convolution autoencoder (DCAE) for cardiac image\nrepresentation, and a multiple output convolution neural network (CNN) for\nindices regression. Joint learning of the two networks effectively enhances the\nexpressiveness of image representation with respect to cardiac indices, and the\ncompatibility between image representation and indices regression, thus leading\nto accurate and reliable estimations for all the cardiac indices.\n  When applied with five-fold cross validation on MR images of 145 subjects,\nIndices-Net achieves consistently low estimation error for LV wall thicknesses\n(1.44$\\pm$0.71mm) and areas of cavity and myocardium (204$\\pm$133mm$^2$).

However, it has a major drawback: it\ndoes not preclude suboptimal play in branches of the game tree that are not\nreached in equilibrium. Equilibrium refinements can mend this issue, but have\nexperienced little practical adoption. This is largely due to a lack of\nscalable algorithms.\n  Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be\namong the most effective algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in\nlarge-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. In this paper, we\nprovide, to our knowledge, the first extension of these methods to equilibrium\nrefinements.

This enables one to compute an approximate variant of\nextensive-form perfect equilibria. Experiments show that our smoothing approach\nleads to solutions with dramatically stronger strategies at information sets\nthat are reached with low probability in approximate Nash equilibria, while\nretaining the overall convergence rate associated with fast algorithms for Nash\nequilibrium. This has benefits both in approximate equilibrium finding (such\napproximation is necessary in practice in large games) where some probabilities\nare low while possibly heading toward zero in the limit, and exact equilibrium\ncomputation where the low probabilities are actually zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 18:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

In this formulation the\nwarping of the extra dimension emerges from a partial breaking of the conformal\nsymmetry in five dimensions. The solution of the system can be described in two\nalternative gauges: by the metric or by the conformon. By considering this as a\nfundamental symmetry we construct a conformally invariant action for a vector\nfield which provides a massless photon localized over a Minkowski brane. This\nis obtained by a conformal non-minimal coupling that breaks the gauge symmetry\nin five dimensions. We further consider a generalization of the model by\nincluding conformally invariant torsion. By coupling torsion non-minimally to\nfermions we obtain a localized zero mode of both chiralities completing the\nconsistence of the model. The inclusion of torsion introduces a fermion quartic\ninteraction that can be used to probe the existence of large extra dimensions\nand the validity of the model.

One such recent application is cloud computing, where jobs\narrive in an online fashion with capacity requirements and need to be\nimmediately scheduled on physical machines in data centers. It is often\nobserved that the requested capacities are not fully utilized, hence offering\nan opportunity to employ an overcommitment policy, i.e., selling resources\nbeyond capacity. Setting the right overcommitment level can induce a\nsignificant cost reduction for the cloud provider, while only inducing a very\nlow risk of violating capacity constraints. We introduce and study a model that\nquantifies the value of overcommitment by modeling the problem as a bin packing\nwith chance constraints. We then propose an alternative formulation that\ntransforms each chance constraint into a submodular function. We show that our\nmodel captures the risk pooling effect and can guide scheduling and\novercommitment decisions. We also develop a family of online algorithms that\nare intuitive, easy to implement and provide a constant factor guarantee from\noptimal. Finally, we calibrate our model using realistic workload data, and\ntest our approach in a practical setting. Our analysis and experiments\nillustrate the benefit of overcommitment in cloud services, and suggest a cost\nreduction of 1.5% to 17% depending on the provider's risk tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 19:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

This study explores partial Fourier transform\napproaches that acting along either the readout or the spatiotemporally-encoded\ndimensions, reduce these penalties.\n  Methods: xSPEN uses an orthogonal gradient to read, in direct space, the\nlowbandwidth dimension. This changes substantially the nature of partial\nFourier acquisitions vis-a-vis conventional imaging counterparts. A suitable\ntheoretical analysis, however, allows one to implement these procedures along\neither the low-bandwidth or readout axes.\n  Results: Partial Fourier single-shot xSPEN methods are illustrated on\npreclinical and human scanners.

Therefore, we train a deep residual network using surrogate classes.\nThe surrogate classes are created by clustering the training dataset, where\neach cluster index represents one surrogate class. The activations from the\npenultimate CNN layer serve as features for subsequent classification tasks. We\nevaluate the feature representations on two publicly available datasets. The\nfocus lies on the ICDAR17 competition dataset on historical document writer\nidentification (Historical-WI). We show that the activation features trained\nwithout supervision are superior to descriptors of state-of-the-art writer\nidentification methods. Additionally, we achieve comparable results in the case\nof handwriting classification using the ICFHR16 competition dataset on\nhistorical Latin script types (CLaMM16).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 21:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 11:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 09:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

It is found that the network capacity has a\nfundamental bandwidth scaling limit, beyond which the network becomes\npower-limited. An infrastructure multi-hop protocol achieves the optimal\nnetwork capacity scaling for all network parameters.

However, optimization algorithms often entail\nconsiderable complexity, which creates a serious gap between theoretical\ndesign/analysis and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose\na new learning-based approach. The key idea is to treat the input and output of\na resource allocation algorithm as an unknown non-linear mapping and use a deep\nneural network (DNN) to approximate it. If the non-linear mapping can be\nlearned accurately by a DNN of moderate size, then resource allocation can be\ndone in almost real time -- since passing the input through a DNN only requires\na small number of simple operations.\n  In this work, we address both the thereotical and practical aspects of\nDNN-based algorithm approximation with applications to wireless resource\nmanagement. We first pin down a class of optimization algorithms that are\n`learnable' in theory by a fully connected DNN. Then, we focus on DNN-based\napproximation to a popular power allocation algorithm named WMMSE (Shi {\\it et\nal} 2011).

In this paper, we introduce\nHierarchical Cellular Automata (HCA) -- a temporally evolving model to\nintelligently detect salient objects. HCA consists of two main components:\nSingle-layer Cellular Automata (SCA) and Cuboid Cellular Automata (CCA). As an\nunsupervised propagation mechanism, Single-layer Cellular Automata can exploit\nthe intrinsic relevance of similar regions through interactions with neighbors.\nLow-level image features as well as high-level semantic information extracted\nfrom deep neural networks are incorporated into the SCA to measure the\ncorrelation between different image patches. With these hierarchical deep\nfeatures, an impact factor matrix and a coherence matrix are constructed to\nbalance the influences on each cell's next state. The saliency values of all\ncells are iteratively updated according to a well-defined update rule.\nFurthermore, we propose CCA to integrate multiple saliency maps generated by\nSCA at different scales in a Bayesian framework. Therefore, single-layer\npropagation and multi-layer integration are jointly modeled in our unified HCA.\nSurprisingly, we find that the SCA can improve all existing methods that we\napplied it to, resulting in a similar precision level regardless of the\noriginal results.

Seismology is the most compelling\ntechnique with which to infer the internal properties of the Sun and stars.\nWaves in the Sun, nominally acoustic, are sensitive to the emergence and\ncyclical strengthening of magnetic field, evidenced by measured changes in\nresonant oscillation frequencies that are correlated with the solar cycle. The\ninference of internal Lorentz stresses from these measurements has the\npotential to significantly advance our appreciation of the dynamo. Indeed,\nseismological inverse theory for the Sun is well understood for perturbations\nin composition, thermal structure and flows but, is not fully developed for\nmagnetism, owing to the complexity of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nequation. Invoking first-Born perturbation theory to characterize departures\nfrom spherically symmetric hydrostatic models of the Sun and applying the\nnotation of generalized spherical harmonics, we calculate sensitivity functions\nof seismic measurements to the general time-varying Lorentz stress tensor. We\nfind that eigenstates of isotropic (i.e. acoustic only) background models are\ndominantly sensitive to isotropic deviations in the stress tensor and much more\nweakly so to anisotropic stresses (and therefore challenging to infer). The\napple cannot fall far from the tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 04:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 12:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

Calculating all possible higher order affinities is\ncomputationally expensive. Hence in most cases only a subset is used. In this\npaper, we propose an effective sampling method to obtain a highly accurate\napproximation of the full graph required to solve multi-structural model\nfitting problems in computer vision.

This will increase its\nluminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design\nvalue and the integrated luminosity (total collisions created) by a factor ten.\nThe LHC is already a highly complex and exquisitely optimised machine so this\nupgrade must be carefully conceived and will require about ten years to\nimplement. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will\nrely on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its\npresent limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11-12 tesla superconducting\nmagnets, compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise\nphase control, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation and\n300 metre-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy\ndissipation. The present document describes the technologies and components\nthat will be used to realise the project and is intended to serve as the basis\nfor the detailed engineering design of HL-LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 06:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

Although widely sought after, the\ndevelopment of an invisible watermark is a challenging task that has not yet\nbeen accomplished.\n  In this paper we take a step forward in addressing the invisibility problem\nwith DROPWAT, an active network flow watermarking technique developed for\ntracing Internet flows directed to the staging server that is the final\ndestination in a data exfiltration attack, even in the presence of several\nintermediate stepping stones or an anonymous network.

In this paper, we propose a\nnew method to learn non-linear robust features by taking advantage of the data\nmanifold structure. We first follow the commonly used trick of the trade, that\nis learning robust features with artificially corrupted data, which are\ntraining samples with manually injected noise. Following the idea of the\nauto-encoder, we first assume features should contain much information to well\nreconstruct the input from its corrupted copies. However, merely reconstructing\nclean input from its noisy copies could make data manifold in the feature space\nnoisy. To address this problem, we propose a new method, called Incremental\nAuto-Encoders, to iteratively denoise the extracted features. We assume the\nnoisy manifold structure is caused by a diffusion process. Consequently, we\nreverse this specific diffusion process to further contract this noisy\nmanifold, which results in an incremental optimization of model parameters .\nFurthermore, we show these learned non-linear features can be stacked into a\nhierarchy of features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe proposed method can achieve better classification performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 08:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

This paper proposes PL-SLAM, a stereo visual SLAM\nsystem that combines both points and line segments to work robustly in a wider\nvariety of scenarios, particularly in those where point features are scarce or\nnot well-distributed in the image. PL-SLAM leverages both points and segments\nat all the instances of the process: visual odometry, keyframe selection,\nbundle adjustment, etc. We contribute also with a loop closure procedure\nthrough a novel bag-of-words approach that exploits the combined descriptive\npower of the two kinds of features. Additionally, the resulting map is richer\nand more diverse in 3D elements, which can be exploited to infer valuable,\nhigh-level scene structures like planes, empty spaces, ground plane, etc. (not\naddressed in this work). Our proposal has been tested with several popular\ndatasets (such as KITTI and EuRoC), and is compared to state of the art methods\nlike ORB-SLAM, revealing a more robust performance in most of the experiments,\nwhile still running in real-time.

The magnetic island and turbulence mutually\ninteract via the coupling between the electron temperature ($T_e$) gradient,\nthe $T_e$ turbulence, and the poloidal flow. The $T_e$ gradient altered by the\nmagnetic island is peaked outside and flattened inside the island. The $T_e$\nturbulence can appear in the increased $T_e$ gradient regions. The combined\neffects of the $T_e$ gradient and the the poloidal flow shear determine\ntwo-dimensional distribution of the $T_e$ turbulence. When the reversed\npoloidal flow forms, it can maintain the steepest $T_e$ gradient and the\nmagnetic island acts more like a electron heat transport barrier.\nInterestingly, when the $T_e$ gradient, the $T_e$ turbulence, and the flow\nshear increase beyond critical levels, the magnetic island turns into a fast\nelectron heat transport channel, which directly leads to the minor disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 09:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 05:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

It is often desirable for the constructed\ngraph to satisfy two properties: first, data points that are similar in the\nfeature space should be strongly connected on the graph, and second, the class\nlabel information should vary smoothly with respect to the graph, where\nsmoothness is measured using the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian\nmatrix. Recent works have justified some of these smoothness conditions by\nshowing that they are strongly linked to the semi-supervised smoothness\nassumption and its variants. In this work, we reinforce this connection by\nviewing the problem from a graph sampling theoretic perspective, where class\nindicator functions are treated as bandlimited graph signals (in the\neigenvector basis of the graph Laplacian) and label prediction as a bandlimited\nreconstruction problem. Our approach involves analyzing the bandwidth of class\nindicator signals generated from statistical data models with separable and\nnonseparable classes. These models are quite general and mimic the nature of\nmost real-world datasets. Our results show that in the asymptotic limit, the\nbandwidth of any class indicator is also closely related to the geometry of the\ndataset.

This is strikingly\ndifferent from the situation in isolated radio pulsars. We investigate this\nproblem in the framework of the fallback disc model. The optical spectra can be\npowered by magnetic stresses on the innermost disc matter, as the energy\ndissipated is emitted as blackbody radiation mainly from the inner rim of the\ndisc. In the fallback disc model, XDINs are the sources evolving in the\npropeller phase with similar torque mechanisms. In this this model, the ratio\nof the total magnetic work that heats up the inner disc matter is expected to\nbe similar for different XDINs. Optical luminosities that are calculated\nconsistently with the the optical spectra and the theoretical constraints on\nthe inner disc radii give very similar ratios of the optical luminosity to the\nrotational energy loss rate for all these sources. These ratios indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of the magnetic torque heats up the disc matter while the\nremaining fraction expels disc matter from the system. For XDINs, the\ncontribution of heating by X-ray irradiation to the optical luminosity is\nnegligible in comparison with the magnetic heating.

Construction of a prognostic predictive model following FRAMR-EMR\nyielded a predictive model capable of estimating 5-year risk of osteoarthritis\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression was used to predict osteoarthritis based on age,\nsex, BMI, previous leg injury, and osteoporosis. Internal validation of the\nmodels performance demonstrated good discrimination and moderate calibration.\nConclusions-This study provides guidance to those interested in developing\nprognostic predictive models based on EMR data.

For the Pascal VOC 2007 test\nset trained with VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 training sets, the proposed network with\nthe input size of 300 x 300 achieved 78.5% mAP (mean average precision) at the\nspeed of 35.0 FPS (frame per second), while the network with a 512 x 512 sized\ninput achieved 80.8% mAP at 16.6 FPS using Nvidia Titan X GPU. The proposed\nnetwork shows state-of-the-art mAP, which is better than those of the\nconventional SSD, YOLO, Faster-RCNN and RFCN. Also, it is faster than\nFaster-RCNN and RFCN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 14:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Previously, efficient\nnonparametric genotype-specific risk estimation in censored mixture data has\nbeen proposed without considering covariates. With multiple predictive risk\nfactors available, risk estimation requires a multivariate model to account for\nadditional covariates that may affect disease risk simultaneously. Therefore,\nit is important to consider the role of covariates in the genotype-specific\ndistribution estimation using family history data.

In this paper, with the\nhelp of the least favorable submodel technique, we first derive the\nsemiparametric efficient scores for linear quantile regression models that are\nassumed for a single quantile level, multiple quantile levels and all the\nquantile levels in $(0,1)$ respectively.

In this paper, we exploit a\nnovel hierarchical tree-like structured CNN, in which branches are trained to\nbecome specialized in predefined subsets of hand joints, called local poses. We\nfurther fuse local pose features, extracted from hierarchical CNN branches, to\nlearn higher order dependencies among joints in the final pose by end-to-end\ntraining.

In more detail, the\nmobile telephone model differs from the classical telephone model in three\nways: (1) each device can participate in at most one connection per round; (2)\nthe network topology can undergo a parameterized rate of change; and (3)\ndevices can advertise a parameterized number of bits about their state to their\nneighbors in each round before connection attempts are initiated. We begin by\ndescribing and analyzing new randomized gossip algorithms in this model under\nthe harsh assumption of a network topology that can change completely in every\nround. We prove a significant time complexity gap between the case where nodes\ncan advertise $0$ bits to their neighbors in each round, and the case where\nnodes can advertise $1$ bit. For the latter assumption, we present two\nsolutions: the first depends on a shared randomness source, while the second\neliminates this assumption using a pseudorandomness generator we prove to exist\nwith a novel generalization of a classical result from the study of two-party\ncommunication complexity.

However, in studying\nentanglement in the continuum Chern-Simons description, we must confront the\nproblem of non-factorization of the Hilbert space, which is a standard property\nof gauge theories.

Pioneering works in this direction have shown the\neffects of this regime in the excited state reactivity of molecular systems and\nat the same time has opened up the question of whether it is possible to\nintroduce any modifications in the electronic ground energy landscape which\ncould affect chemical thermodynamics and/or kinetics. In this work, we use a\nmodel system of many molecules coupled to a surface-plasmon field to gain\ninsight on the key parameters which govern the modifications of the\nground-state Potential Energy Surface (PES). Our findings confirm that the\nenergetic changes per molecule are determined by single-molecule-light\ncouplings which are essentially local, in contrast with those of the\nelectronically excited states, for which energetic corrections are of a\ncollective nature. Still, we reveal some intriguing quantum-coherent effects\nassociated with pathways of concerted reactions, where two or more molecules\nundergo reactions simultaneously, and which can be of relevance in low-barrier\nreactions. Finally, we also explore modifications to nonadiabatic dynamics and\nconclude that, for this particular model, the presence of a large number of\ndark states yields negligible changes. Our study reveals new possibilities as\nwell as limitations for the emerging field of polariton chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 21:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

The solution of\nthis system can be expressed in terms of the solution of a 4x4 matrix\nRiemann-Hilbert (RH) problem formulated in the complex k-plane. Furthermore,\nthe relevant jump matrices with explicit (x, t)-dependence of the matrix RH\nproblem can be explicitly found via three spectral functions {s(k), S(k),\nS_L(k)} arising from the initial data and the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary\nconditions at x=0 and x=L, respectively. The global relation is also found to\ndeduce two distinct but equivalent types of representations (i.e., one via the\nlarge $k$ of asymptotics of the eigenfunctions and another one in terms of the\nGel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko (GLM) approach) for the Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary value problems. In particular, the formulae for IBV problems on the\nfinite interval can reduce to ones on a half-line as the length $L$ of the\ninterval approaches to infinity. Moreover, we also present the linearizable\nboundary conditions for the GLM representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 00:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}
