Previous attempts to quantify the effect of turbulence on reconnection\nusually prescribed Alfv\\'enic or other low-frequency fluctuations or\ninvestigated collisionless kinetic effects in just two-dimensional\nconfigurations and antiparallel magnetic fields. In view of this, we analyzed\nthe kinetic turbulence self-generated by three-dimensional guide-field\nreconnection through force-free current sheets in frequency and wavenumber\nspaces, utilizing 3D particle-in-cell code numerical simulations. Our\ninvestigations reveal reconnection rates and kinetic turbulence with features\nsimilar to those obtained by current in-situ spacecraft observations of MMS as\nwell as in the laboratory reconnection experiments MRX, VTF and\n\\textsc{Vineta}-II. In particular we found that the kinetic turbulence\ndeveloping in the course of 3D guide-field reconnection exhibits a broadband\npower-law spectrum extending beyond the lower-hybrid frequency and up to the\nelectron frequencies. In the frequency space the spectral index of the\nturbulence appeared to be close to -2.8 at the reconnection X-line. In the\nwavenumber space it also becomes -2.8 as soon as the normalized reconnection\nrate reaches 0.1. The broadband kinetic turbulence is mainly due to\ncurrent-streaming and electron-flow-shear instabilities excited in the\nsufficiently thin current sheets of kinetic reconnection. The growth of the\nkinetic turbulence corresponds to high reconnection rates which exceed those of\nfast laminar, non-turbulent reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 16:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 13:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

In contrast to conventional two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons in\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess coupled spin and\nvalley degrees of freedom by the spin-orbit interaction. The electrons are also\nstrongly interacting even in the high-density regime because of the weak\ndielectric screening in two dimensions and a large band mass.

In this setting, Alice\nis given a function $f$ and an input string $x$, and Bob is given a function\n$g$ and an input string $y$. The pair $(x,y)$ comes from a known distribution\n$\\mu$ and $f$ and $g$ are guaranteed to be close under this distribution. Alice\nand Bob wish to compute $g(x,y)$ with high probability. The previous work\nshowed that any problem with one-way communication complexity $k$ in the\nstandard model has public-coin communication $O(k(1+I))$ bits in the uncertain\ncase, where $I$ is the mutual information between $x$ and $y$. A lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{I})$ bits on the public-coin uncertain communication was also\nshown.

Can Alice and Bob achieve\nefficient communication amid uncertainty without using public randomness? How\npowerful are public-coin protocols in overcoming uncertainty?

For [OII]\nemitters, the faintest emitters are found in $10^{10.5} \\rm{M}_\\odot$ halos and\nthe brightest emitters in $10^{12.6}\\rm{M}_\\odot$ halos. A redshift-independent\nstellar mass dependency is also observed where the halo mass increases from\n$10^{11}\\rm{M}_\\odot$ to $10^{12.5} \\rm{M}_\\odot$ for stellar masses of\n$10^{8.5}\\rm{M}_\\odot$ to $10^{11.5}\\rm{M}_\\odot$, respectively. We investigate\nthe interdependencies of these trends by repeating our analysis in a\n$L_\\textrm{line} - \\rm{M}_\\textrm{star}$ grid space for our most populated\nsamples (H$\\beta$+[OIII] $z = 0.84$ and [OII] $z = 1.47$) and find that the\nline luminosity dependency is stronger than the stellar mass dependency on halo\nmass. For $L > L^\\star$ emitters at all epochs, we find a relatively flat trend\nwith halo masses of $10^{12.5 - 13}\\rm{M}_\\odot$ which may be due to quenching\nmechanisms in massive halos which is consistent with a transitional halo mass\npredicted by models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Both events require a powerful central energy source, usually\nattributed to a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole. The GRB-SLSN\nlink raises several theoretical questions: What distinguishes the engines\nresponsible for these different phenomena? Can a single engine power both a GRB\nand a luminous SN in the same event? We propose a new unifying model for\nmagnetar thermalization and jet formation: misalignment between the rotation\n(${\\bf \\Omega}$) and magnetic dipole (${\\bf \\mu}$) axes thermalizes a fraction\nof the spindown power by reconnection in the striped equatorial wind, providing\na guaranteed source of \"thermal\" emission to power the supernova. The remaining\nun-thermalized power energizes a relativistic jet. In this picture, the\nGRB-SLSN dichotomy is directly linked to ${\\bf \\Omega \\cdot \\mu}$. We extend\nearlier work to show that even weak relativistic jets of luminosity\n$\\sim10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can escape the expanding SN ejecta hours after the\nexplosion, implying that escaping relativistic jets may accompany many SLSNe.\nWe calculate the observational signature of these jets. We show that they may\nproduce transient UV cocoon emission lasting a few hours when the jet breaks\nout of the ejecta surface. A longer-lived optical/UV signal may originate from\na mildly-relativistic wind driven from the interface between the jet and the\nejecta walls. This provides a new explanation for the secondary early-time\nmaximum observed in some SLSNe light curves, such as LSQ14bdq. This scenario\nalso predicts a population of GRB from on-axis jets with extremely long\ndurations, potentially similar to the population of \"jetted tidal disruption\nevents\", in coincidence with a small subset of SLSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

This is the basis for a polaritonic Hall\neffect, called optical spin Hall effect (OSHE), which is related to the\nformation of spin/polarization textures in momentum space, determining\nanisotropic ballistic transport, as well as related textures in real space.\nOwing to Coulombic interactions between the excitonic components of the\npolaritons, optical excitation of polaritons can affect the OSHE.

There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply. The specific\naccretion-rate distribution evolves such that the fraction of AGN among\ngalaxies drops toward lower redshifts. This decrease in the AGN duty cycle is\nresponsible for the strong evolution of the accretion density of the Universe\nfrom redshift $z\\approx1-1.5$ to the present day. Our analysis also suggests\nthat this evolution is accompanied by a decoupling of accretion events onto\nblack holes from the formation of stars in galaxies. There is also evidence\nthat at earlier times the relative probability of high vs low specific\naccretion-rate events among galaxies increases. We argue that this differential\nredshift evolution of the AGN duty cycle with respect to $\\lambda$ produces the\nAGN downsizing trend, whereby luminous sources peak at earlier epochs compared\nto less luminous ones. Finally, we also find a stellar-mass dependence of the\nspecific accretion-rate distribution, with more massive galaxies avoiding high\nspecific accretion-rate events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 18:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and\ncontrolling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most\noften estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which\nimplicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary\ncase. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household\nwith m susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(m, p)\nrandom variable where p is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that\ntransmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple\ngenerations of transmission can be safely neglected when p is small. We use\nprobability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a\nmistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be\nsubstantially larger than the SAR even when p is small. As a result, binomial\nestimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor\ncoverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and\ninterval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial\nmodels or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of\ntransmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the\nhousehold, and incomplete follow-up. We illustrate the practical implications\nof these results in an analysis of household surveillance data collected by the\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health during the 2009 influenza A\n(H1N1) pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 18:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 05:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

However HIV can\nrapidly evolve resistance to CTL attack at different epitopes, inducing a\ndynamic network of interacting viral and immune response variants.

Stability of\nfeasible equilibria and corresponding uniform persistence of distinct variants\nare characterized via a Lyapunov function.

Principal component\nanalysis (PCA) is a traditional technique for unsupervised dimensionality\nreduction, which is often employed to seek a projection to best represent the\ndata in a least-squares sense, but if the original data is nonlinear structure,\nthe performance of PCA will quickly drop. An supervised dimensionality\nreduction algorithm called Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) seeks for an\nembedding transformation, which can work well with Gaussian distribution data\nor single-modal data, but for non-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal\ndata, it gives undesired results. What is worse, the dimension of LDA cannot be\nmore than the number of classes. In order to solve these issues, Local shrunk\ndiscriminant analysis (LSDA) is proposed in this work to process the\nnon-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal data, which not only incorporate\nboth the linear and nonlinear structures of original data, but also learn the\npattern shrinking to make the data more flexible to fit the manifold structure.\nFurther, LSDA has more strong generalization performance, whose objective\nfunction will become local LDA and traditional LDA when different extreme\nparameters are utilized respectively.

Motivated by the key idea of non-orthogonal\nmultiple access, the non-orthogonal random access (NORA) scheme based on\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) is proposed in this paper to\nalleviate the access congestion problem. Specifically, NORA utilizes the\ndifference of time of arrival to identify multiple UEs with the identical\npreamble, and enables power domain multiplexing of collided UEs in the\nfollowing access process, while the base station performs SIC based on the\nchannel conditions obtained through preamble detection. Our analysis show that\nthe performance of NORA is superior to the conventional orthogonal random\naccess (ORA) scheme in terms of the preamble collision probability, access\nsuccess probability and throughput of random access. Simulation results verify\nour analysis and further show that our NORA scheme can improve the number of\nthe supported UEs by more than 30%. Moreover, the number of preamble\ntransmissions and the access delay for successfully accessed UEs are also\nreduced significantly by using the proposed random access scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 02:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

One main problem with multiview methods\nis that resampling from nonuniform samples (provided by LR images) and the\ninversion of the PSF are highly nonlinear and ill-posed problems. Non-linearity\nand ill-posedness are typically overcome by linearization and regularization,\noften through an iterative optimization process, which essentially trade off\nthe very same information (i.e. high frequency) that we want to recover. We\npropose a novel point of view for multiview SRIR: Unlike existing multiview\nmethods that reconstruct the entire spectrum of the HR image from the multiple\ngiven LR images, we derive explicit expressions that show how the\nhigh-frequency spectra of the unknown HR image are related to the spectra of\nthe LR images. Therefore, by taking any of the LR images as the reference to\nrepresent the low-frequency spectra of the HR image, one can reconstruct the\nsuper-resolution image by focusing only on the reconstruction of the\nhigh-frequency spectra. This is very much like single-image methods, which\nextrapolate the spectrum of one image, except that we rely on information\nprovided by all other views, rather than by prior constraints as in\nsingle-image methods (which may not be an accurate source of information). This\nis made possible by deriving and applying explicit closed-form expressions that\ndefine how the local high frequency information that we aim to recover for the\nreference high resolution image is related to the local low frequency\ninformation in the sequence of views.

The\nconstituent particles are confined by an attractive interaction whose strength\nincreases with increasing particle separation and as a consequence, individual\nparticles are not found in isolation. This phenomenon is well known in particle\nphysics where quarks are confined in baryons and mesons. An analogous\nphenomenon occurs in certain magnetic insulators; weakly coupled chains of\nspins S=1/2. The collective excitations in these systems is spinons (S=1/2). At\nlow temperatures weak coupling between chains can induce an attractive\ninteraction between pairs of spinons that increases with their separation and\nthus leads to confinement. In this paper, we employ inelastic neutron\nscattering to investigate the spinon confinement in the quasi-1D S=1/2 XXZ\nantiferromagnet SrCo2V2O8. Spinon excitations are observed above TN in\nquantitative agreement with established theory. Below TN the pairs of spinons\nare confined and two sequences of meson-like bound states with longitudinal and\ntransverse polarizations are observed. Several theoretical approaches are used\nto explain the data. A new theoretical technique based on Tangent-space Matrix\nProduct States gives a very complete description of the data and provides good\nagreement not only with the energies of the bound modes but also with their\nintensities. We also successfully explained the effect of temperature on the\nexcitations including the experimentally observed thermally induced resonance\nbetween longitudinal modes below TN ,and the transitions between thermally\nexcited spinon states above TN. In summary, our work establishes SrCo2V2O8 as a\nbeautiful paradigm for spinon confinement in a quasi-1D quantum magnet and\nprovides a comprehensive picture of this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 05:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

We propose a radical extension of the\nbosonization technique that overcomes both limitations, allowing computations\nwith microscopic lattice Hamiltonians, from the Fermi level down to the bottom\nof the band. The formalism rests on the simple idea of representing the fermion\nkinetic term in the energy domain, after which it can be expressed in terms of\nfree bosonic degrees of freedom. As a result, one- and two-body fermionic\nscattering processes generate anharmonic boson-boson interactions, even in the\nforward channel. We show that up to moderate interaction strengths, these\nnonlinearities can be treated analytically at all energy scales, using the\nx-ray emission problem as a showcase. In the strong interaction regime, we\nemploy a systematic variational solution of the bosonic theory, and obtain\nresults that agree quantitatively with an exact diagonalization of the original\none-particle fermionic model.

In the 1-d situation, this problem is usually\ntackled by means of tail estimation techniques: univariate observations are\nviewed as all the more `abnormal' as they are located far in the tail(s) of the\nunderlying probability distribution. It would be desirable as well to dispose\nof a scalar valued `scoring' function allowing for comparing the degree of\nabnormality of multivariate observations. Here we formulate the issue of\nscoring anomalies as a M-estimation problem by means of a novel functional\nperformance criterion, referred to as the Mass Volume curve (MV curve in\nshort), whose optimal elements are strictly increasing transforms of the\ndensity almost everywhere on the support of the density. We first study the\nstatistical estimation of the MV curve of a given scoring function and we\nprovide a strategy to build confidence regions using a smoothed bootstrap\napproach. Optimization of this functional criterion over the set of piecewise\nconstant scoring functions is next tackled. This boils down to estimating a\nsequence of empirical minimum volume sets whose levels are chosen adaptively\nfrom the data, so as to adjust to the variations of the optimal MV curve, while\ncontroling the bias of its approximation by a stepwise curve. Generalization\nbounds are then established for the difference in sup norm between the MV curve\nof the empirical scoring function thus obtained and the optimal MV curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 08:44:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 09:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The magnetic\ntunnel junction is the most developed spintronic memory device in which the\nmagnetization of the storage layer is switched by spin-transfer-torque or\nspin-orbit torque interactions. Whereas these novel spin-torque interactions\nexemplify the potential of electron-spin-based devices and memory, the\nswitching speed is limited to the ns regime by the precessional motion of the\nmagnetization. All-optical magnetization switching, based on the inverse\nFaraday effect, has been shown to be an attractive method for achieving\nmagnetization switching at ps speeds. Successful magnetization reversal in thin\nfilms has been demonstrated by using circularly polarized light. However, a\nmethod for all-optical switching of on-chip nanomagnets in high density memory\nmodules has not been described. In this work we propose to use plasmonics, with\nCMOS compatible plasmonic materials, to achieve on-chip magnetization reversal\nin nanomagnets. Plasmonics allows light to be confined in dimensions much\nsmaller than the diffraction limit of light. This in turn, yields higher\nlocalized electromagnetic field intensities. In this work, through simulations,\nwe show that using localized surface plasmon resonances, it is possible to\ncouple light to nanomagnets and achieve significantly higher opto-magnetic\nfield values in comparison to free space light excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 08:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

This can be achieved by exchanging known deterministic\npilot signals between both partners from which the random fading gains can be\nestimated and processed. However, the entropy and thus quality of the generated\nkey depends on the channel coherence time. This can result in poor key\ngeneration rates in a low mobility environment, where the fading gains are\nnearly constant. Therefore, wide-spread deployment of wireless channel-based\nsecret key generation is limited. To overcome these issues, we follow up on a\nrecent idea which uses unknown random pilots and enables \"on-the-fly\" key\ngeneration. In addition, the scheme is able to incorporate local sources of\nrandomness but performance bounds are hard to obtain with standard methods. In\nthis paper, we analyse such a scheme analytically and derive achievable key\nrates in the Alice-Bob-Eve setting. For this purpose, we develop a novel\napproximation model which is inspired by the linear deterministic and the lower\ntriangular deterministic model. Using this model, we can derive key rates for\nspecific scenarios. We claim that our novel approach provides an intuitive and\nclear framework to analyse similar key generation problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 09:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

New stars formed from the accreted gas have chemical\nabundances that are different from those of the original SCC. Using\nhydrodynamical simulations of GC formation based on this scenario, we show that\nthe main cluster with the initial mass as large as [2-5]x10^5 Msun can accrete\nmore than 10^5 Msun gas from AGB stars of the SCC. We suggest that merging of\nhierarchical star cluster complexes can play key roles in stellar halo\nformation around GCs and self-enrichment processes of GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 10:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

We explore this question by proposing\nseveral estimators that recover the weights of a noisy linear model from labels\nthat are shuffled by an unknown permutation.

The result is a\nframework that enables robust inference, as we demonstrate by experiments on\nboth synthetic and standard datasets, where we are able to recover approximate\nweights using only shuffled labels.

In a fog network, nodes connect with each other directly to get content\nlocally whenever possible. As the topology of the network directly influences\nthe nodes' connectivity, there has been some work to compute the graph\ncentrality of each node within that network topology. The centrality is then\nused to distinguish nodes in the fog network, or to prioritize some nodes over\nothers to participate in the caching fog. We argue that, for an\nInformation-Centric Fog Computing approach, graph centrality is not an\nappropriate metric. Indeed, a node with low connectivity that caches a lot of\ncontent may provide a very valuable role in the network.\n  To capture this, we introduce acontent-based centrality (CBC) metric which\ntakes into account how well a node is connected to the content the network is\ndelivering, rather than to the other nodes in the network. To illustrate the\nvalidity of considering content-based centrality, we use this new metric for a\ncollaborative caching algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed\ncollaborative caching with typical centrality based, non-centrality based, and\nnon-collaborative caching mechanisms. Our simulation implements CBC on three\ninstances of large scale realistic network topology comprising 2,896 nodes with\nthree content replication levels. Results shows that CBC outperforms benchmark\ncaching schemes and yields a roughly 3x improvement for the average cache hit\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 10:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

Existing algorithms typically\nfocus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a\npurely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes.

In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to\njointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over\nmultiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the\nmotion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under\nsmall baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search\nproblem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is\ntreated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method.\nThe resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 10:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

In its conventional form, rotation averaging is stated as a\nminimization over multiple rotation constraints. As these constraints are\nnon-convex, this problem is generally considered challenging to solve globally.\nWe show how to circumvent this difficulty through the use of Lagrangian\nduality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to\nprovide a tight relaxation.

By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads\nto lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we\nexperimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However,\nshaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant\nfigure of merit as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed\nstudy of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies\nfor optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally\ncompared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping\nscheme generates a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear\nadditive white Gaussian noise channel.

Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be\nrelatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained\ndistributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59%.

End user\nnetwork switching and multihoming are two promising mechanisms that could allow\nsuch exploitation. However these mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored\nat a general system level with QoE metrics. Therefore, in this work we analyze\nthese mechanisms in a variety of diverse scenarios through a system level model\nbased on an agent based modeling framework. In terms of results, we find that\nin all scenarios end user network switching provides significant benefits in\nterms of both throughput and mean opinion score as the number of available\nnetworks increases. However, contrastingly, end user multihoming in most\nscenarios does not provide significant benefits over network switching given\nthe same number of available networks. The major reason is inefficient radio\nresource allocation resulting from individual networks not taking the\nmultihoming nature of end users into account. Though, in low user density\nsituations this inefficiency is not a problem and multihoming does provide\nincreased throughput though not increased mean opinion scores. Finally,\nscenarios that vary the fraction of users adopting multihoming suggests that\nboth early and late adopters will have similar gains over users not adopting\nmultihoming. Thus the adoption dynamics of multihoming appear favorable.\nOverall, the results support the applicability of end user network switching\nfor improving mobile user experience and the applicability of end user\nmultihoming in more limited situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 13:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 12:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

The game is played by\nmoving a token throughout a graph to produce an infinite path. There are\nseveral common modes to determine how the players move the token through the\ngraph; e.g., in turn-based games the players alternate turns in moving the\ntoken. We study the {\\em bidding} mode of moving the token, which, to the best\nof our knowledge, has never been studied in infinite-duration games. The\nfollowing bidding rule was previously defined and called Richman bidding. Both\nplayers have separate {\\em budgets}, which sum up to $1$. In each turn, a\nbidding takes place: Both players submit bids simultaneously, where a bid is\nlegal if it does not exceed the available budget, and the higher bidder pays\nhis bid to the other player and moves the token. The central question studied\nin bidding games is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning the\ngame: a {\\em threshold} budget in a vertex is a value $t \\in [0,1]$ such that\nif Player $1$'s budget exceeds $t$, he can win the game, and if Player $2$'s\nbudget exceeds $1-t$, he can win the game. Threshold budgets were previously\nshown to exist in every vertex of a reachability game, which have an\ninteresting connection with {\\em random-turn} games -- a sub-class of simple\nstochastic games in which the player who moves is chosen randomly. We show the\nexistence of threshold budgets for a qualitative class of infinite-duration\ngames, namely parity games, and a quantitative class, namely mean-payoff games.\nThe key component of the proof is a quantitative solution to strongly-connected\nmean-payoff bidding games in which we extend the connection with random-turn\ngames to these games, and construct explicit optimal strategies for both\nplayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 13:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 10:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 10:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Focusing on a binary system of\na main-sequence star and a super-massive black hole, driven by the emission of\ngravitational radiation, we show that it may sustain stable mass transfer,\nalong with mass loss through L2.

Their extension to dynamical processes has been\ninstead elusive so far since classical implementations lead to unscalable\nalgorithms. We then propose a novel procedure to address this problem by\ncoupling GP regression and Kalman filtering.

Moving digital learning from\na simple use of tools to understanding the processes of the internal\nfunctioning of these tools is an old / new debate originated with the digital\nlaboratories of the 1960. Today, it is emerging again under impulse of the\nlarge - scale public sphere digitalization and the new constructivist education\ntheories. Teachers and educators discuss not only the viability of code\nteaching in the classroom, but also the intellectual and cognitive advantages\nfor students. The debate thus takes several orientations and is resourced in\nthe entanglement of arguments and interpretations of any order, technical,\neducational, cultural, cognitive and psychological. However, that phenomenon\nwhich undoubtedly augurs for a profound transformation in the future models of\nlearning and teaching , is predicting a new and almost congenital digital\nhumanism\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 09:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}
