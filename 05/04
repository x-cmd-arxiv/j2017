Thus, even if one subsystem happens to be macroscopic as in the\nentangled \"Schrodinger's cat\" state resulting from an ideal measurement, this\nstate is not the paradoxical macroscopic superposition it is generally presumed\nto be. It is, instead, a \"macroscopic correlation,\" a coherent quantum\ncorrelation in which one of the two correlated sub-systems happens to be\nmacroscopic. This clarifies the physical meaning of entanglement: When a\nsuperposed quantum system A is unitarily entangled with a second quantum system\nB, the coherence of the original superposition of different states of A is\ntransferred to different correlations between states of A and B, so the\nentangled state becomes a superposition of correlations rather than a\nsuperposition of states.

In this work, we present a\nfundamental relationship between the quality of computing the value of a\nboolean function and the energy needed to compute it in a mathematically\nrigorous and general setting. On this basis, one can study the tradeoff between\nthe quality of the solution to a problem and the amount of energy that is\nconsumed. We accomplish this by introducing a computational model to classify\nproblems based on notions of symmetry inspired by physics. We show that some\nproblems are symmetric in that every input bit is, in a sense, equally\nimportant, while other problems display a great deal of asymmetry in the\nimportance of input bits. We believe that our model is novel and provides a\nfoundation for inexact Computing. Building on this, we show that asymmetric\nproblems allow us to invest resources favoring the important bits -- a feature\nthat can be leveraged to design efficient inexact algorithms. On the negative\nside and in contrast, we can prove that the best inexact algorithms for\nsymmetric problems are no better than simply reducing the resource investment\nuniformly across all bits. Akin to classical theories concerned with space and\ntime complexity, we believe the ability to classify problems as shown in our\npaper will serve as a basis for formally reasoning about the effectiveness of\ninexactness in the context of a range of computational problems with energy\nbeing the primary resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 16:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 13:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Existing criteria for three-dimensional\nquasicrystal formation are quite complicated and rather inconvenient for\nparticle simulations. So to localize numerically the quasicrystal phase, one\nshould usually simulate over a wide range of system parameters. We show how to\nuniversally localize the parameters values at which dodecagonal quasicrystal\norder may appear for a given particle system. For that purpose, we use a\ncriterion recently proposed for predicting decagonal quasicrystal formation in\none-component two-length-scale systems.

The proposed method allows\nreducing the time spent for searching the parameters favoring certain solid\nstructure for a given system.

For the BASS sample as a whole, we\nfind a statistically significant, albeit very weak correlation between Gamma_X\nand L/L_Edd. The best-fitting relations we find, Gamma_X=0.15\nlog(L/L_Edd)+const., are considerably shallower than those reported in previous\nstudies. Moreover, we find no corresponding correlations among the subsets of\nAGN with different M_BH determination methodology.

As a frustrated spin model, it is well outside the\ncommuting models of topological quantum codes that are typically studied, but\nits exact solubility makes it more amenable to analysis of effects arising in\nthis noncommutative setting than a generic topologically ordered Hamiltonian.\nHere we study quantum error correction in the honeycomb model using both\nanalytic and numerical techniques. We first prove explicit exponential bounds\non the approximate degeneracy, local indistinguishability, and correctability\nof the code space. These bounds are tighter than can be achieved using known\ngeneral properties of topological phases. Our proofs are specialized to the\nhoneycomb model, but some of the methods may nonetheless be of broader\ninterest. Following this, we numerically study noise caused by thermalization\nprocesses in the perturbative regime close to the toric code renormalization\ngroup fixed point. The appearance of non-topological excitations in this\nsetting has no significant effect on the error correction properties of the\nhoneycomb model in the regimes we study. Although the behavior of this model is\nfound to be qualitatively similar to that of the standard toric code in most\nregimes, we find numerical evidence of an interesting effect in the\nlow-temperature, finite-size regime where a preferred lattice direction emerges\nand anyon diffusion is geometrically constrained.

In the ionic limit, such changes are described by the formal\noxidation states (FOS) whereby a single atom type is presumed to absorb the\nfull burden of the perturbation (change in charge) of the whole compound. In\nthis picture, when the solar absorber CsSnI3 loses 50 % of its Sn atoms thereby\nforming the ordered vacancy compound Cs2SnI6, the Sn is said to change from\nSn2+ to Sn4+. In reality, the charge redistribution is more complex. To\nunderstand the electronic properties of these two groups and to gauge the\ntrends in s-electron charge on the nucleus, we studied the 113/216 compound\npairs CsSnCl3/Cs2SnCl6; CsSnBr3/Cs2SnBr6, and CsSnI3/Cs2SnI6.

Our first main\nresult is a very clean characterization of the economy's core (the standard\nsolution concept in public goods). Specifically, we prove that a point is in\nthe core iff it is Pareto efficient, individually rational, and the set of\npoints it dominates is path connected.\n  While this structural theorem has a few interesting implications in economic\ntheory, the main focus of the second part of this paper is on a particular\nalgorithmic application that demonstrates its utility. Since the 1960s,\neconomists have looked for an efficient computational process that decides\nwhether or not a given point is in the core. All known algorithms so far run in\nexponential time (except in some artificially restricted settings). By heavily\nexploiting our new structure, we propose a new algorithm for testing core\nmembership whose computational bottleneck is the solution of $O(n)$ convex\noptimization problems on the utility function governing the economy. It is\nfairly natural to assume that convex optimization should be feasible, as it is\nneeded even for very basic economic computational tasks such as testing Pareto\nefficiency.

The gaugino mass pattern is that of mirage-mediation. The\nmagnitudes of various SM Yukawa couplings point to a picture where scalar soft\nSUSY breaking terms are related to the geography of fields in the compactified\ndimensions. Higgs fields and third generation scalars extend to the bulk and\noccur in split multiplets with TeV scale soft masses. First and second\ngeneration scalars, localized at orbifold fixed points or tori with enhanced\nsymmetry, occur in complete GUT multiplets and have much larger masses. This\npicture can be matched onto the parameter space of generalized mirage\nmediation. Naturalness considerations, the requirement of the observed\nelectroweak symmetry breaking pattern, and LHC bounds on m(gluino) together\nlimit the gravitino mass to the m_{3/2}~ 5-60 TeV range. The mirage unification\nscale is bounded from below with the limit depending on the ratio of squark to\ngravitino masses.

This\nsynchronization is not a trivial consequence of the rhythmic production of\nCVSs, since it takes several minutes to be fully established and is observed at\nthe frequency of CVS production and at its second harmonic. The phase of\nfiltered voltages at which CVSs are produced varies systematically across the\ngrid of electrodes, consistently with the propagation of traveling waves (TWs).\nUsing these synchronized phases we isolate a first TW in voltages (filtered at\nthe median CVS-production frequency) moving from primary auditory to premotor\ncortex, and a second TW in high-gamma amplitude (coupled to phase at the\nCVS-production frequency) moving along the same path but in opposite direction.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of rhythmic motor acts synchronizing\nspatio-temporally organized cortical activity in the human brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 20:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

In\nparticular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, $pgg$ and\n$p4g$, allow for a new topological insulating phase, whose surface spectrum\nconsists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion. Like the\nsurface state of a conventional topological insulator, the surface Dirac\nfermion in this \"nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator\" provides a theoretical\nexception to a fermion doubling theorem. Unlike the surface state of a\nconventional topological insulator, it can be gapped into topologically\ndistinct surface regions while keeping time-reversal symmetry, allowing for\nnetworks of topological surface quantum spin Hall domain walls.

One method for assessment involves\npartitioning delineated regions of interest and comparing the relative\ncontributions or importance to clinical outcomes. We show that an intuitive\nmethod for dividing organ contours, compound (sub-)segmentation, can\nunintentionally lead to sub-segments with inconsistent volumes, which will bias\nrelative importance assessment. An improved technique, nested segmentation, is\nintroduced and compared. Methods: Clinical radiotherapy planning parotid\ncontours from 510 patients were segmented. Counts of radiotherapy dose matrix\nvoxels interior to sub-segments were used to determine the equivalency of\nsub-segment volumes. The distribution of voxel counts within sub-segments were\ncompared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and characterized by their dispersion.\nAnalytical solutions for 2D/3D analogues were derived and sub-segment\narea/volume were compared directly. Results: Both parotid and 2D/3D region of\ninterest analogue segmentation confirmed compound segmentation intrinsically\nproduces sub-segments with volumes that depend on the region of interest shape\nand selection location. Significant volume differences were observed when\nsub-segmenting parotid contours into 18ths, and vanishingly small sub-segments\nwere observed when sub-segmenting into 96ths. Central sub-segments were\nconsiderably smaller than sub-segments on the periphery. Nested segmentation\ndid not exhibit these shortcomings and produced sub-segments with equivalent\nvolumes when dose grid and contour collinearity was addressed, even when\ndividing the parotid into 96ths. Nested segmentation was always faster or\nequivalent in runtime to compound segmentation. Conclusions: Nested\nsegmentation is more suited than compound segmentation for analyses requiring\nequal weighting of sub-segments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 22:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

This problem was originally introduced by\nDobzinski, Nisan, and Oren (STOC'14) as the following simple market scenario:\n$m$ items are to be allocated among $n$ bidders in a distributed setting where\nbidders valuations are private and hence communication is needed to obtain an\nefficient allocation. The communication happens in rounds: in each round, each\nbidder, simultaneously with others, broadcasts a message to all parties\ninvolved and the central planner computes an allocation solely based on the\ncommunicated messages. Dobzinski et.al. showed that no non-interactive\n($1$-round) protocol with polynomial communication (in the number of items and\nbidders) can achieve approximation ratio better than $\\Omega(m^{{1}/{4}})$,\nwhile for any $r \\geq 1$, there exists $r$-round protocols that achieve\n$\\widetilde{O}(r \\cdot m^{{1}/{r+1}})$ approximation with polynomial\ncommunication; in particular, $O(\\log{m})$ rounds of interaction suffice to\nobtain an (almost) efficient allocation.\n  A natural question at this point is to identify the \"right\" level of\ninteraction (i.e., number of rounds) necessary to obtain an efficient\nallocation. In this paper, we resolve this question by providing an almost\ntight round-approximation tradeoff for this problem: we show that for any $r\n\\geq 1$, any $r$-round protocol that uses polynomial communication can only\napproximate the social welfare up to a factor of $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{r} \\cdot\nm^{{1}/{2r+1}})$.

Therefore, in the\nsimulation and risk assessment of cascading outages in power systems, it is\nnecessary to consider the weather and environmental effects. This paper\nproposes a method for the risk assessment of weather-related cascading outages.\nBased on the analysis of historical outage records and temperature-dependent\nphysical outage mechanisms of transmission lines, an outage rate model\nconsidering weather condition and conductor temperature is proposed, and the\nanalytical form of outage probability of lines are derived. With the\nweather-dependent outage model, a two-stage risk assessment method based on\nMarkovian tree (MT) search is proposed, which consists of offline full\nassessment, and online efficient update of risk assessment results and\ncontinued MT search using updated NWP data. The test cases on NPCC 140-bus test\nsystem model in winter and summer scenarios verify the advantages of the\nproposed risk assessment method in both accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 01:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

In this paper, we present an\nalternative approximation in a time- and memory- efficient manner which is\ndenoted as Semi-Global Weighed Least Squares (SG-WLS). Instead of solving a\nlarge linear system, we propose to iteratively solve a sequence of subsystems\nwhich are one-dimensional WLS models. Although each subsystem is\none-dimensional, it can take two-dimensional neighborhood information into\naccount due to the proposed special neighborhood construction. We show such a\ndesirable property makes our SG-WLS achieve close performance to the original\ntwo-dimensional WLS model but with much less time and memory cost. While\nprevious related methods mainly focus on the 4-connected/8-connected\nneighborhood system, our SG-WLS can handle a more general and larger\nneighborhood system thanks to the proposed fast solution. We show such a\ngeneralization can achieve better performance than the 4-connected/8-connected\nneighborhood system in some applications. Our SG-WLS is $\\sim20$ times faster\nthan the WLS model.

Assuming the convective transport of fluid and heat to be\nnegligible, we perform a small-deformation perturbation analysis to obtain the\ndroplet migration velocity. The droplet dynamics strongly depends on the\ndistribution of surfactants along the droplet interface, which is governed by\nthe relative strength of convective transport of surfactants as compared with\nthe diffusive transport of surfactants. The present study is focused on the\nfollowing two limits: (i) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface\ndiffusion, and (ii) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface\nconvection. In the first limiting case, it is seen that the axial velocity of\nthe droplet decreases with increase in the advection of the surfactants along\nthe surface. The variation of cross-stream migration velocity, on the other\nhand, is analyzed over three different regimes based on the ratio of the\nviscosity of the droplet phase to that of the carrier phase. In the first\nregime the migration velocity decreases with increase in surface advection of\nthe surfactants although there is no change in direction of droplet migration.\nFor the second regime, the direction of the cross-stream migration of the\ndroplet changes depending on different parameters. In the third regime, the\nmigration velocity is merely affected by any change in the surfactant\ndistribution. For the other limit of higher surface advection in comparison to\nsurface diffusion of the surfactants, the axial velocity of the droplet is\nfound to be independent of the surfactant distribution. However, the\ncross-stream velocity is found to decrease with increase in non-uniformity in\nsurfactant distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 02:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Complementary\nto these simulation models, stochastic geometry-based approach, modeling the\nlocations of the users and the K tiers of BSs as independent and homogeneous\nPoisson point processes (PPPs), has gained prominence in the past few years.\nDespite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based K-tier HetNet\nmodel is not rich enough to capture spatial coupling between user and BS\nlocations that exists in real-world HetNet deployments and is included in 3GPP\nsimulation models.

We apply our\npower law approximation results to analyze the performance of receiver\ndiversity schemes for URLLC-relevant statistics and obtain a new simplified\nexpression for Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) in channels with power law tail\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 07:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

Compared to the Lieb-Robinson velocity\nthat bounds the propagation speed of all perturbations, the butterfly velocity,\nstudied in thermal ensembles, is an \"effective\" Lieb-Robinson velocity for a\nsubspace of the Hilbert space defined by the microcanonical ensemble. In this\npaper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case\nto a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider\nthe code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.\nUsing local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation\nbetween the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk\ncausal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given\nLieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light\ncone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the\nbutterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the\nlocal reconstructions of bulk local operators. If the bulk geometry satisfies\nEinstein equation and the null energy condition, for rotation symmetric\ngeometries we prove that infrared operators always have a slower butterfly\nvelocity that the ultraviolet one. For asymptotic AdS geometries, this also\nimplies that the butterfly velocities of all operators are upper bounded by the\nspeed of light. We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the\nspeed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its\nentanglement wedge. Finally, we discuss the implication of our result to\ngeometries that are not asymptotically AdS, and in particular, obtain\nconstraints that must be satisfied by a dual theory of flat space gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 08:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to\nconsider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space,\nand to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as\ncompared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to\nexplore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a\npopulation improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so,\nthen by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the\nmetric space?\n  We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice\nsetting: a population of voters, two independently drawn candidates, and a\nmajority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the\npopulation, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be\nthrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one. We examine how\nthis ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population\nof voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio\nimproves from $3$ to $4-2\\sqrt{2}$, roughly $1.1716$; this bound is tight. When\nthe metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of $1.5$ and a constant upper\nbound strictly better than $2$ on the approximation ratio of the majority rule.\n  The positive result depends in part on the assumption that candidates are\nindependent and identically distributed.

Both reliability\nand energy efficiency are critical for many of these applications that involve\ncommunication with short packets which undermine the coding gain achievable\nfrom large packets. In this paper, we study a cross-layer approach to optimize\nthe performance of low-power wireless links. At first, we derive a simple and\naccurate packet error rate (PER) expression for uncoded schemes in block fading\nchannels based on a new proposition that shows that the waterfall threshold in\nthe PER upper bound in Nakagami-m fading channels is tightly approximated by\nthe m-th moment of an asymptotic distribution of PER in AWGN channel. The\nproposed PER approximation establishes an explicit connection between the\nphysical and link layers parameters, and the packet error rate. We exploit this\nconnection for cross-layer design and optimization of communication links. To\nthis end, we propose a semi-analytic framework to jointly optimize\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and modulation order at physical layer, and the\npacket length and number of retransmissions at link layer with respect to\ndistance under the prescribed delay and reliability constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 10:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

It has been suggested that\naccretion-driven turbulence can maintain clouds in a highly turbulent state,\npreventing runaway collapse, and explaining the observed non-thermal velocity\ndispersions. We present 3D, AMR, MHD simulations of a kiloparsec-scale,\nstratified, supernova-driven, self-gravitating, interstellar medium, including\ndiffuse heating and radiative cooling. These simulations model the formation\nand evolution of a molecular cloud population in the turbulent interstellar\nmedium. We use zoom-in techniques to focus on the dynamics of the mass\naccretion and its history for individual molecular clouds. We find that mass\naccretion onto molecular clouds proceeds as a combination of turbulent and near\nfree-fall accretion of a gravitationally bound envelope. Nearby supernova\nexplosions have a dual role, compressing the envelope, boosting accreted mass,\nbut also disrupting parts of the envelope and eroding mass from the cloud's\nsurface. It appears that the inflow rate of kinetic energy onto clouds from\nsupernova explosions is insufficient to explain the net rate of charge of the\ncloud kinetic energy. In the absence of self-consistent star formation,\nconversion of gravitational potential into kinetic energy during contraction\nseems to be the main driver of non-thermal motions within clouds. We conclude\nthat although clouds interact strongly with their environments, bound clouds\nare always in a state of gravitational contraction, close to runaway, and their\nproperties are a natural result of this collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 10:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 23:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

To this end we introduce\na novel approach, named ProgressNet, capable of predicting when an action takes\nplace in a video, where it is located within the frames, and how far it has\nprogressed during its execution. To provide a general definition of action\nprogress, we ground our work in the linguistics literature, borrowing terms and\nconcepts to understand which actions can be the subject of progress estimation.\nAs a result, we define a categorization of actions and their phases. Motivated\nby the recent success obtained from the interaction of Convolutional and\nRecurrent Neural Networks, our model is based on a combination of the Faster\nR-CNN framework, to make frame-wise predictions, and LSTM networks, to estimate\naction progress through time. After introducing two evaluation protocols for\nthe task at hand, we demonstrate the capability of our model to effectively\npredict action progress on the UCF-101 and J-HMDB datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 10:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:11:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 13:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 01:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

However, it is challenging to visualize and\nassess separability and full symmetry from spatio-temporal observations. In\nthis work, we propose a functional data analysis approach that constructs test\nfunctions using the cross-covariances from time series observed at each pair of\nspatial locations.

However, the algorithm differs from GPCG not only because it\ndeals with a more general class of problems, but mainly for the way it stops\nthe minimization phase. This is based on a comparison between a measure of\noptimality in the reduced space and a measure of bindingness of the variables\nthat are on the bounds, defined by extending the concept of proportioning,\nwhich was proposed by some authors for box-constrained problems. If the\nobjective function is bounded, the algorithm converges to a stationary point\nthanks to a suitable application of the gradient projection method in the\nidentification phase.

However, in most disk studies, only average\noptical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an\nensemble of grains with different radii. We investigate the impact of\nsubdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the\nresulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED).\nThese quantities were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius\ndistribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals,\nand (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged\noptical properties (reference). Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of\ngrain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a\nparameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In\noptically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and\nthe relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the\nreference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane\ntemperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature\ndecreases. Furthermore, below ~20K, this fraction is higher for the reference\ndisk than for the case of multiple grain radii, while it shows the opposite\nbehavior for temperatures above this threshold.

In this paper, a novel solution\ntowards the scalability issue of k-means is presented. In the proposal, k-means\nis supported by an approximate k-nearest neighbors graph. In the k-means\niteration, each data sample is only compared to clusters that its nearest\nneighbors reside.

Understanding rotation evolution over the stellar lifetime is therefore\nan important goal within stellar astrophysics. In recent years, there has been\nincreased focus on how the complexity of the stellar magnetic field affects the\nrate of angular momentum-loss from a star. This is a topic that Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging (ZDI), a technique that is capable of reconstructing the large-scale\nmagnetic field topology of a star, can uniquely address.\n  Using a potential field source surface model, we estimate the open flux, mass\nloss-rate and angular momentum-loss rates for a sample of 66 stars that have\nbeen mapped with ZDI. We show that the open flux of a star is predominantly\ndetermined by the dipolar component of its magnetic field for our choice of\nsource surface radius. We also show that, on the main sequence, the open flux,\nmass- and angular momentum-loss rates increase with decreasing Rossby number.\nThe exception to this rule is stars less massive than $0.3M_{\\odot}$. Previous\nwork suggests that low mass M dwarfs may possess either strong, ordered and\ndipolar fields or weak and complex fields. This range of field strengths\nresults in a large spread of angular momentum-loss rates for these stars and\nhas important consequences for their spin down behaviour. Additionally, our\nmodels do not predict a transition in the mass-loss rates at the so called wind\ndividing line noted from Ly$\\alpha$ studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 13:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

Metal pollution\nof white dwarfs and transient spectroscopic signatures of young stars like\n$\\beta$-Pic provide growing evidence that extra solar planetesimals can attain\nextreme orbital eccentricities and fall onto their parent stars. We aim to\ndevelop a general, practically implementable, semi-analytical theory of secular\neccentricity excitation of small bodies in mean motion resonances with an\neccentric planet valid for arbitrary values of the eccentricities and including\nthe short-range force due to General Relativity. Our semi-analytic model for\nthe restricted planar three-body problem does not make use of any series\nexpansion and therefore is valid for any values of eccentricities and\nsemi-major axes ratios. The model is based on the application of the adiabatic\nprinciple, which is valid when the precession period of the longitude of\npericenter of the planetesimal is much longer than the libration period in the\nmean motion resonance. This holds down to vanishingly small eccentricities in\nresonances of order larger than 1. We provide a Mathematica notebook with the\nimplementation of the model allowing direct use to the interested reader. We\nconfirm that the 4:1 mean motion resonance with a moderately eccentric planet\nis the most powerful one to lift the eccentricity of planetesimals from nearly\ncircular orbits to star-grazing ones. However, if the planet is too eccentric,\nwe find that this resonances becomes unable to pump the planetesimal's\neccentricity to very high value. The inclusion of the General Relativity effect\nimposes a condition on the mass of the planet to drive the planetsimals into\nstar-grazing orbits. For a planetesimal at $\\sim$1 AU around a solar-mass star\n(or white dwarf), we find a threshold planetary mass of about 17 Earth masses.\nWe finally derive an analytical formula for this critical mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 13:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 08:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

A possible\ntilt of such a disc, with respect to the black hole spin equator, is important.\nThis is because such a tilt affects the observed spectral and timing properties\nof the disc X-ray emission via Lense-Thirring precession, which could be used\nto test the theoretical predictions regarding the strong gravity. Here, we\nanalytically solve the steady, warped accretion disc equation of Scheurer and\nFeiler (1996), and find an expression of the radial profile of the disc tilt\nangle. In our exact solution, considering a prograde disc around a slowly\nspinning black hole, we include the inner part of the disc, which was not done\nearlier in this formalism. Such a solution is timely, as a tilted inner disc\nhas recently been inferred from X-ray spectral and timing features of the\naccreting black hole H1743-322. Our tilt angle radial profile expression\nincludes observationally measurable parameters, such as black hole mass and\nKerr parameter, and the disc inner edge tilt angle $W_{\\rm in}$, and hence can\nbe ideal to confront observations. Our solution shows that the disc tilt angle\nin $10-100$ gravitational radii is a significant fraction of the disc outer\nedge tilt angle, even for $W_{\\rm in} = 0$. Moreover, tilt angle radial\nprofiles have humps in $\\sim 10-1000$ gravitational radii for some sets of\nparameter values, which should have implications for observed X-ray features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 14:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Their excitation\nproperties are investigated by means of a hybrid density functional theory\n(DFT) and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach to elucidate\nthe role of the carbonyl group: the bright transition is of {\\pi}{\\pi}*\ncharacter, as expected, but the presence of a C=O moiety reduces the energy of\nn{\\pi}* transitions which may become closer to the {\\pi}{\\pi}* transition, in\nparticular as the conjugation chain decreases. This can be related to the\npresence of a low-lying charge transfer state typical of short carbonyl-\ncontaining carotenoids.

Very natural (and\nvirtually inescapable) generalizations of the idea of description are the\nprobability distribution and of its quantum mechanical counterpart, the density\noperator.\n  We track the process of dynamically updating entropy as a system evolves.\nThree factors may cause entropy to change: (1) the system's INTERNAL DYNAMICS;\n(2) unsolicited EXTERNAL INFLUENCES on it; and (3) the approximations one has\nto make when one tries to predict the system's future state. The latter task is\nusually hampered by hard-to-quantify aspects of the original description,\nlimited data storage and processing resource, and possibly algorithmic\ninadequacy. Factors 2 and 3 introduce randomness into one's predictions and\naccordingly degrade them. When forecasting, as long as the entropy bookkeping\nis conducted in an HONEST fashion, this degradation will ALWAYS lead to an\nentropy increase.\n  To clarify the above point we introduce the notion of HONEST ENTROPY, which\ncoalesces much of what is of course already done, often tacitly, in responsible\nentropy-bookkeping practice.

A locally Lorentz covariant\n$f(T)$ gravity theory has been devised recently, and this local causality\nproblem has been overcome. The nonlocal question, however, is left open. If\ngravitation is to be described by this covariant $f(T)$ gravity theory there\nare a number of issues that ought to be examined in its context, including the\nquestion as to whether its field equations allow homogeneous G\\\"odel-type\nsolutions, which necessarily leads to violation of causality on nonlocal scale.\nHere, to look into the potentialities and difficulties of the covariant $f(T)$\ntheories, we examine whether they admit G\\\"odel-type solutions. We take a\ncombination of a perfect fluid with electromagnetic plus a scalar field as\nsource, and determine a general G\\\"odel-type solution, which contains special\nsolutions in which the essential parameter of G\\\"odel-type geometries, $m^2$,\ndefines any class of homogeneous G\\\"odel-type geometries. We extended to the\ncontext of covariant $f(T)$ gravity a theorem, which ensures that any\nperfect-fluid homogeneous G\\\"odel-type solution defines the same set of G\\\"odel\ntetrads $h_A^{~\\mu}$ up to a Lorentz transformation. We also shown that the\nsingle massless scalar field generates G\\\"odel-type solution with no closed\ntimelike curves. Even though the covariant $f(T)$ gravity restores Lorentz\ncovariance of the field equations and the local validity of the causality\nprinciple, the bare existence of the G\\\"odel-type solutions makes apparent that\nthe covariant formulation of $f(T)$ gravity does not preclude non-local\nviolation of causality in the form of closed timelike curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 02:29:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 02:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Finally, a simple\nanion-metathesis reaction was conducted to replace the acetate anion with\ndicyanamide, and the thermal properties of the main-chain polyimidazoliums\nbefore and after anion exchange were studied in detail, which demonstrated\nchain cross-linking by the counterion and a coupled unusually high\ncarbonization yield of up to 66 wt% at 900 oC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 01:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

This paper describes progress\nin constructing anatomically and physiologically realistic immersed boundary\n(IB) models of the dynamics of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This work\nbuilds on earlier IB models of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in the aortic\nroot, which previously achieved realistic hemodynamics over multiple cardiac\ncycles, but which also were limited to simplified aortic geometries and\nidealized descriptions of the biomechanics of the aortic valve cusps. By\ncontrast, the model described herein uses an anatomical geometry reconstructed\nfrom patient-specific computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, and employs a\ndescription of the elasticity of the aortic valve leaflets based on a\nfiber-reinforced constitutive model fit to experimental tensile test data.\nNumerical tests show that the model is able to resolve the leaflet biomechanics\nin diastole and early systole at practical grid spacings. The model is also\nused to examine differences in the mechanics and fluid dynamics yielded by\nfresh valve leaflets and glutaraldehyde-fixed leaflets similar to those used in\nbioprosthetic heart valves. Although there are large differences in the leaflet\ndeformations during diastole, the differences in the open configurations of the\nvalve models are relatively small, and nearly identical hemodynamics are\nobtained in all cases considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 06:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}

At this point of the development, this paper systemically\nreviews the existing (within last one decade) amount of literature\ninvestigating the impact of DFS on firm performance, analyzes and identifies\nthe research gaps. We identify 39 works that have appeared in a wide range of\npeer-reviewed scientific journals. We classify the methodologies and approaches\nthat researchers have used to predict the effect of such services on the\nfinancial growth and profitability. We observe that despite rapid technological\nadvancement in DFS during the last ten years, Digital Financial Services being\nthe factor affecting firm performance did not get the reasonable attention in\nacademic literature. One of the reason is that almost all the authors limit\ntheir research to banking sector while ignoring others particularly mobile\nnetwork operators (providing branchless banking) and new non-banking entrants.\nWe also notice that newer researchers often ignore past research and\ninvestigate the same issues. This study also makes several recommendations and\nsuggest directions for future research in this still emerging field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 20:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}
