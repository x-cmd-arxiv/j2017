The protocol solves the underlying\ndistributed queueing problem by using path reversal on a pre-computed spanning\ntree (or any other tree topology simulated on top of the given network).\n  It is known that the Arrow protocol solves the problem with a competitive\nratio of O(log D) on trees of diameter D. This implies a distributed queueing\nalgorithm with competitive ratio O(s*log D) for general networks with a\nspanning tree of diameter D and stretch s. In this work we show that when\nrunning the Arrow protocol on top of the well-known probabilistic tree\nembedding of Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC 03], we obtain a randomized\ndistributed queueing algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(log n) even on\ngeneral network topologies. The result holds even if the queueing requests\noccur in an arbitrarily dynamic and concurrent fashion and even if\ncommunication is asynchronous. From a technical point of view, the main of the\npaper shows that the competitive ratio of the Arrow protocol is constant on a\nspecial family of tree topologies, known as hierarchically well separated\ntrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 16:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Given an image frame, the goal is to predict what\nobjects will appear in the future frame (e.g., 5 seconds later) and where they\nwill be located at, even when they are not visible in the current frame. The\nkey idea is that (1) an intermediate representation of a convolutional object\nrecognition model abstracts scene information in its frame and that (2) we can\npredict (i.e., regress) such representations corresponding to the future frames\nbased on that of the current frame. We design a new two-stream convolutional\nneural network (CNN) architecture for videos by extending the state-of-the-art\nconvolutional object detection network, and present a new fully convolutional\nregression network for predicting future scene representations. Our experiments\nconfirm that combining the regressed future representation with our detection\nnetwork allows reliable estimation of future hands and objects in videos.

Differences across individuals are minimal near certain\nconfigurations such as ridges and boundaries, and it is these configurations\nthat are often represented in line drawings. In particular, we introduce a\nmethod for inferring a qualitative three-dimensional shape from shading\npatterns that link the shape-from-shading inference with shape-from-contour\ninference. For a given shape, certain shading patches approach \"line drawings''\nin a well-defined limit. Under this limit, and invariably with respect to\nrendering choices, these shading patterns provide a qualitative description of\nthe surface. We further show that, under this model, the contours partition the\nsurface into meaningful parts using the Morse--Smale complex. These critical\ncontours are the (perceptually) stable parts of this complex and are invariant\nover a wide class of rendering models.

The $\\left(\n\\beta, \\varpi \\right)$-stability mathematically connects the generalization\nability and the stability of the cross-validated model via the Rademacher\ncomplexity. Our result reveals mathematically the effect of cross-validation\nfrom two sides: on one hand, cross-validation picks the model with the best\nempirical generalization ability by validating all the alternatives on test\nsets; on the other hand, cross-validation may compromise the stability of the\nmodel selection by causing subsampling error. Moreover, the difference between\ntraining and test errors in q\\textsuperscript{th} round, sometimes referred to\nas the generalization error, might be autocorrelated on q. Guided by the ideas\nabove, the $\\left( \\beta, \\varpi \\right)$-stability help us derivd a new class\nof Rademacher bounds, referred to as the one-round/convoluted Rademacher\nbounds, for the stability of cross-validation in both the i.i.d.\\ and\nnon-i.i.d.\\ cases.

We extend the existing results for\nthe single input multiple output (SIMO) channel with i.i.d. links to the\nasymmetric case, proving that selecting the statistically best antenna is\ngDoF-optimal. Using the gDoF result for the SIMO channel, we prove that for\nT=1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary link strengths.,\nextending the result for MIMO with i.i.d. links We show that selecting the\nstatistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for the multiple input single output\n(MISO) channel.

SRAM\nPUF is among one of the popular silicon PUF constructions that exploits random\ninitial power-up states from SRAM cells to extract hardware intrinsic secrets\nfor identification and key generation applications. The advantage of SRAM PUFs\nis that they are widely embedded into commodity devices, thus such a PUF is\nobtained without a custom design and virtually free of implementation costs. A\nphenomenon known as `aging' alters the consistent\nreproducibility---reliability---of responses that can be extracted from a\nreadout of a set of SRAM PUF cells. Similar to how a PUF exploits undesirable\nmanufacturing randomness for generating a hardware intrinsic fingerprint, SRAM\nPUF unreliability induced by aging can be exploited to detect recycled\ncommodity devices requiring no additional cost to the device. In this context,\nthe SRAM PUF itself acts as an aging sensor by exploiting responses sensitive\nto aging.

But this relies on a plug-in approach\nthat rejects data points with a decision that disagrees with the new policy,\nleading to high variance estimates and ineffective learning. We propose a new,\nbalance-based approach that too makes the data look like the new policy but\ndoes so directly by finding weights that optimize for balance between the\nweighted data and the target policy in the given, finite sample, which is\nequivalent to minimizing worst-case or posterior conditional mean square error.\nOur policy learner proceeds as a two-level optimization problem over policies\nand weights.

We further show that MITHRIL can supplement any\ncache replacement algorithm and be readily integrated into existing systems.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the improvement comes from MITHRIL being able to\ncapture mid-frequency blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2017 05:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

The GPN is favorably featured by low complexity and high\naccuracy of joint detection and re-organization. In particular, GPN designs a\ngenerative model that performs one feed-forward pass to efficiently generate\nrobust person detections with joint partitions, relying on dense regressions\nfrom global joint candidates in an embedding space parameterized by centroids\nof persons. In addition, GPN formulates the inference procedure for joint\nconfigurations of human poses as a graph partition problem, and conducts local\noptimization for each person detection with reliable global affinity cues,\nleading to complexity reduction and performance improvement.

Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian\ninference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically\ndistributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability\ndistributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter\nis a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while\nrespecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and\nrequires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself.\nImproving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient,\nparallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary\ndistributions.

Considering the recent progress in\nphotonic circuitry, and in particular silicon photonics circuitry, there is now\nan opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications.

As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building\nblocks in modern silicon photonic platform.

Phys. Rev. E 92, 013015\n(2015). The particle's passing through one channel is modelled as one step of\nthe walk. The step's (channel) length is random and the walker's velocity at\nconsecutive steps of the walk is conserved with finite probability mimicking\nthat at the turning point there could be no abrupt change of velocity. We\nprovide the Laplace transform of the characteristic function of the walker's\nposition and reductions for different cases of independence of the CTRW's\nstep's duration \\tau, length l and velocity v. We solve our model with\nindependent l and v. The model incorporates different forms of the tail of the\nprobability density of small velocities that vary with the model parameter\n\\alpha. Depending on that parameter all types of anomalous diffusion can hold,\nfrom super- to subdiffusion. In a finite interval of \\alpha, ballistic behavior\nwith logarithmic corrections holds that was observed in a previously introduced\nCTRW model with independent l and \\tau. Universality of tracer's diffusion in\nthe porous medium is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 19:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}
