It is named $^{4}$PrOB$\\varepsilon$aM (4-Profiler Online Beam\nEmittance Measurement) and was conceived to measure the emittance in a fast and\nefficient way using the multiple beam profiler method. The core of the system\nis constituted by four consecutive UniBEaM profilers, which are based on silica\nfibers passing across the beam. The $^{4}$PrOB$\\varepsilon$aM system was\ndeployed for characterization studies of the 18~MeV proton beam produced by the\nIBA Cyclone 18 MeV cyclotron at Bern University Hospital (Inselspital). The\nmachine serves daily radioisotope production and multi-disciplinary research,\nwhich is carried out with a specifically conceived Beam Transport Line (BTL).\nThe transverse RMS beam emittance of the cyclotron was measured as a function\nof several machine parameters, such as the magnetic field, RF peak voltage, and\nazimuthal angle of the stripper. The beam emittance was also measured using the\nmethod based on the quadrupole strength variation. The results obtained with\nboth techniques were compared and a good agreement was found. In order to\ncharacterize the longitudinal dynamics, the proton energy distribution was\nmeasured. For this purpose, a method was developed based on aluminum absorbers\nof different thicknesses, a UniBEaM detector, and a Faraday cup. The results\nwere an input for a simulation of the BTL developed in the MAD-X software. This\ntool allows machine parameters to be tuned online and the beam characteristics\nto be optimized for specific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2017 18:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 01:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

The approach, can also be interpreted as generalized\nrenormalization procedure for massless QCD. The free propagator, given by the\nsubstraction between a massive and a massless Dirac ones, in the Lee-Wick form,\nsuggests that the theory also retains unitarity. The appearance of finite quark\nmasses already in the tree approximation in the scheme is determined by the\nfact that the new action terms explicitly break chiral invariance.

The x-space reconstruction in\nMPI results in highly blurry images, where the resolution depends on both\nsystem parameters and nanoparticle type. Previous techniques to counteract this\nblurring rely on the knowledge of the imaging point spread function (PSF),\nwhich may not be available or may require additional measurements. This work\nproposes a blind deconvolution algorithm for MPI to recover the precise spatial\ndistribution of nanoparticles. The proposed algorithm exploits the observation\nthat the imaging PSF in MPI has zero phase in Fourier domain. Thus, even though\nthe reconstructed images are highly blurred, phase remains unaltered. We\nleverage this powerful property to iteratively enforce consistency of phase and\nbounded l1 energy information, using an orthogonal Projections Onto Convex Sets\n(POCS) algorithm. To demonstrate the method, comprehensive simulations were\nperformed without and with nanoparticle relaxation effects, and at various\nnoise levels. In addition, imaging experiments were performed on an in-house\nMPI scanner using a three-vial phantom that contained different nanoparticle\ntypes. Image quality was compared with conventional deconvolution methods,\nWiener deconvolution and Lucy-Richardson method, which explicitly rely on the\nknowledge of PSF. Both the simulation results and experimental imaging results\nshow that the proposed blind deconvolution algorithm outperforms the\nconventional deconvolution methods. Without utilizing the imaging PSF, the\nproposed algorithm improves image quality and resolution even in the case of\ndifferent nanoparticle types, while displaying reliable performance against\nloss of the fundamental harmonic, nanoparticle relaxation effects, and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2017 20:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:39:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 21:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

However,\nunlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational\nproofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally\nestablish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal\nstructure.\n  Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone\nprocess, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using\nsoftware proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.\n  However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some\nscenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete\nstring diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not\nprecise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams.\n  The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for\nequational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is\namenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families\nof string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph\ngrammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using\nrewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents\nequational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families\nof string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free\ngraph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by\nshowing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic\nreasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software\nimplementation by proving important decidability properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2017 22:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal\nstability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.\nFurther investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive\nto the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one\ndimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even\nfurther to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,\nespecially for lower mass planets.

During the\nbouncing phase, the evolution is independent of not only the initial\nconditions, but also the inflationary potentials. In particular, the expansion\nfactor can be well described by the same exact solution in all the cases\nconsidered. In contrast, in the potential dominated case such a universality is\nlost. It is because of this universality that the linear perturbations are also\nindependent of the inflationary models and obtained exactly. During the\ntransition phase, the evolutions of the background and its linear perturbations\nare found explicitly, and then matched to the ones given in the other two\nphases. Hence, once the initial conditions are imposed, the linear scalar and\ntensor perturbations will be uniquely determined. Considering two different\nsets of initial conditions, one imposed during the contracting phase and the\nother at the bounce, we calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients and find that the\ntwo sets yield the same results and all lead to particle creations at the onset\nof the inflation. Due to the pre-inflationary dynamics, the scalar and tensor\npower spectra become scale-dependent.

It was suggested that a proto-Rhea and a proto-Dione might\nhave collided recently, giving birth to the modern system of mid-sized moons.\nIt is also suggested that the rapid viscous spreading of the debris may have\nimplanted mass inside Saturn's Roche limit, giving birth to the modern Saturn's\nring system. However, this scenario has been only investigated in very\nsimplified way for the moment. This paper investigates it in detail to assess\nits plausibility by using $N$-body simulations and analytical arguments. When\nthe debris disk is dominated by its largest remnant, $N$-body simulations show\nthat the system quickly re-accrete into a single satellite without significant\nspreading. On the other hand, if the disk is composed of small particles,\nanalytical arguments suggest that the disk experiences dynamical evolutions in\nthree steps.

After the system\nflattens, the system can become gravitationally unstable when particles are\nsmaller than $\\sim$ 100 m. However, the particles grow faster than spreading.\nThen, the system becomes gravitationally stable again and accretion continues\nat a slower pace, but spreading is inhibited. Therefore, the debris is expected\nto re-accrete into several large bodies. In conclusion, our results show that\nsuch a scenario may not form the today's ring system.

This paper builds on\nthe overview of current biosignature research discussed in Schwieterman et al.\n(2017), and provides an in-depth, interdisciplinary example of biosignature\nidentification and observation that serves as a basis for the development of\nthe general framework for biosignature assessment described in Catling et al.,\n(2017). O2 is a potentially strong biosignature that was originally thought to\nbe an unambiguous indicator for life at high-abundance. We describe the\ncoevolution of life with the early Earth's environment, and how the interplay\nof sources and sinks in the planetary environment may have resulted in\nsuppression of O2 release into the atmosphere for several billion years, a\nfalse negative for biologically generated O2. False positives may also be\npossible, with recent research showing potential mechanisms in exoplanet\nenvironments that may generate relatively high abundances of atmospheric O2\nwithout a biosphere being present. These studies suggest that planetary\ncharacteristics that may enhance false negatives should be considered when\nselecting targets for biosignature searches. Similarly our ability to interpret\nO2 observed in an exoplanetary atmosphere is also crucially dependent on\nenvironmental context to rule out false positive mechanisms. We describe future\nphotometric, spectroscopic and time-dependent observations of O2 and the\nplanetary environment that could increase our confidence that any observed O2\nis a biosignature, and help discriminate it from potential false positives. By\nobserving and understanding O2 in its planetary context we can increase our\nconfidence in the remote detection of life, and provide a model for\nbiosignature development for other proposed biosignatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 05:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

The principles of sparse signal recovery (SSR) are used\nfor the single snapshot detection and estimation of multiple targets. In the\nSSR framework, the DoA estimation problem is grid based and can be posed as the\nlasso optimization problem. However, the SSR framework for DoA estimation gives\nrise to the grid mismatch problem, when the unknown targets (sources) are not\nmatched with the estimation grid chosen for the construction of the array\nsteering matrix at the receiver. The block sparse recovery framework is known\nto mitigate the grid mismatch problem by jointly estimating the targets and\ntheir corresponding offsets from the estimation grid using the group lasso\nestimator. The corresponding detection problem reduces to estimating the\noptimal regularization parameter ($\\tau$) of the lasso (in case of perfect\ngrid-matching) or group-lasso estimation problem for achieving the required\nprobability of correct detection ($P_c$). We propose asymptotic and finite\nsample test statistics for detecting the number of sources with the required\n$P_c$ at moderate to high signal to noise ratios.

However, existing algorithms\ndo not consider local structures in query-document feature space, and are\nfragile to irrelevant noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel\nRiemannian metric learning algorithm to capture the local structures and\ndevelop a robust LtR algorithm. First, we design a concept called \\textit{ideal\ncandidate document} to introduce metric learning algorithm to query-independent\nmodel. Previous metric learning algorithms aiming to find an optimal metric\nspace are only suitable for query-dependent model, in which query instance and\ndocuments belong to the same feature space and the similarity is directly\ncomputed from the metric space. Then we extend the new and extremely fast\nglobal Geometric Mean Metric Learning (GMML) algorithm to develop a localized\nGMML, namely L-GMML. Based on the combination of local learned metrics, we\nemploy the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain~(NDCG) scorer and\nWeighted Approximate Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss to optimize the \\textit{ideal\ncandidate document} for each query candidate set. Finally, we can quickly\nevaluate all candidates via the similarity between the \\textit{ideal candidate\ndocument} and other candidates. By leveraging the ability of metric learning\nalgorithms to describe the complex structural information, our approach gives\nus a principled and efficient way to perform LtR tasks.

This\nframework is here applied to study a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in view of\ncharacterizing the statistical properties of nonlinear oscillators perturbed by\nnoise, depending on their stability. In light of the H\\\"ormander theorem, it is\nfirst shown that the geometry of the unperturbed limit cycle, in particular its\nisochrons, is essential to understand the effect of noise and the phenomenon of\nphase diffusion. In addition, it is shown that the spectrum has a spectral gap,\neven at the bifurcation point, and that correlations decay exponentially fast.\nExplicit small-noise expansions of the RP eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are\nthen obtained, away from the bifurcation point, based on the knowledge of the\nlinearized deterministic dynamics and the characteristics of the noise.

However, the Robins et al.\n(2008, 2016) estimator depends on a non-parametric estimate of the density of\nX. In this paper, we introduce a new HOIF estimator that has the same\nasymptotic properties as their estimator but does not require nonparametric\nestimation of a multivariate density, which is important because accurate\nestimation of a high dimensional density is not feasible at the moderate sample\nsizes often encountered in applications. We also show that our estimator can be\ngeneralized to the entire class of functionals considered by Robins et al.\n(2008) which include the average effect of a treatment on a response Y when a\nvector X suffices to control confounding and the expected conditional variance\nof a response Y given a vector X.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 06:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 22:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 02:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

With the scale dependent correlation\ncoefficients the amplitude and the spatial range of conformity are determined\nfrom galaxy and halo samples.

The correlations of\nmass, spin, and ellipticity are explored in the halo samples. Both for galaxies\nand halos a scale dependent conformity is confirmed.

In this work, we used the density gradient\ntheory (DGT) and considered the influence of capillary waves (CW) on the\npredicted size-dependent surface tensions and nucleation rates for selected\n$n$-alkanes. The DGT model was completed by an equation of state (EoS) based on\nthe perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and compared\nto the classical nucleation theory and the Peng--Robinson EoS. It was found\nthat the critical clusters are practically free of CW because they are so small\nthat even the smallest CW wavelengths do not fit into their finite dimensions.\nThe CW contribute to the entropy of the system and thus decrease the surface\ntension. A correction for the effect of CW on the surface tension is presented.\nThe effect of the different EoSs is relatively small because by a fortuitous\ncoincidence their predictions are similar in the relevant range of critical\ncluster sizes. The difference of the DGT predictions to the classical\nnucleation theory computations is important but not decisive. Of the effects\ninvestigated, the most pronounced is the suppression of the CW which causes a\nsizable decrease of the predicted nucleation rates. The major difference\nbetween experimental nucleation rate data and theoretical predictions remains\nin the temperature dependence. For normal alkanes, this discrepancy is much\nstronger than observed, e.g., for water. The theoretical corrections developed\nhere have a minor influence on the temperature dependency.

We present a new method to evaluate the accuracy of an eye tracker\nbased eye localization system.

However, verifying the\naccuracy of the location estimate of a volunteer's eye center in 3D space is\nnot easily possible. This is because the eye center is an intangible point\nhidden by the iris.

Among these, recently\ndiscovered Weyl semimetals have a dispersion described by a three-dimensional\nDirac cone, which is at the root of exotic physics such as the chiral anomaly\nin magnetotransport. In a time reversal symmetric (TRS) Weyl semimetal film,\nthe confinement gap gives the quasiparticles a mass, while TRS is preserved by\nhaving an even number of valleys with opposite masses. The film can be tuned\nthrough a topological phase transition by a gate electric field. In this work,\nwe present a theoretical study of the quantum corrections to the conductivity\nof a topological semimetal thin film, which is governed by the complex\ninterplay of the chiral band structure, mass term, and scalar and spin-orbit\nscattering. We study scalar and spin-orbit scattering mechanisms on the same\nfooting, demonstrating that they have a strong qualitative and quantitative\nimpact on the conductivity correction. We show that, due to the spin structure\nof the matrix Green's functions, terms linear in the extrinsic spin-orbit\nscattering are present in the Bloch and momentum relaxation times, whereas\nprevious works had identified corrections starting from the second order. In\nthe limit of small quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity\nspin-orbit coupling lead to a potentially observable density dependence in the\nweak antilocalization correction.

Recent advances in deep learning\nhave enabled RL algorithms to achieve impressive performance in restricted\ndomains such as playing Atari video games (Mnih et al., 2015) and, recently,\nthe board game Go (Silver et al., 2016). However, we are still far from\nconstructing a generally intelligent agent. Many of the obstacles and open\nquestions are conceptual: What does it mean to be intelligent? How does one\nexplore and learn optimally in general, unknown environments? What, in fact,\ndoes it mean to be optimal in the general sense? The universal Bayesian agent\nAIXI (Hutter, 2005) is a model of a maximally intelligent agent, and plays a\ncentral role in the sub-field of general reinforcement learning (GRL).\nRecently, AIXI has been shown to be flawed in important ways; it doesn't\nexplore enough to be asymptotically optimal (Orseau, 2010), and it can perform\npoorly with certain priors (Leike and Hutter, 2015). Several variants of AIXI\nhave been proposed to attempt to address these shortfalls: among them are\nentropy-seeking agents (Orseau, 2011), knowledge-seeking agents (Orseau et al.,\n2013), Bayes with bursts of exploration (Lattimore, 2013), MDL agents (Leike,\n2016a), Thompson sampling (Leike et al., 2016), and optimism (Sunehag and\nHutter, 2015).

We find evidence for kinematically disrupted gas (FWHM>250\nkm/s) at up to 5.6 kpc from the AGN, which can be naturally explained by the\naction of the outflow. The narrow component of [Si VI] is redshifted with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, unlike any other emission line in the K-band\nspectrum.

This research explores a new\napproach to tracking hands, or any articulated model, by using an augmented\nrigid body simulation. This allows us to phrase 3D object tracking as a linear\ncomplementarity problem with a well-defined solution. Based on a depth sensor's\nsamples, the system generates constraints that limit motion orthogonal to the\nrigid body model's surface. These constraints, along with prior motion,\ncollision/contact constraints, and joint mechanics, are resolved with a\nprojected Gauss-Seidel solver. Due to camera noise properties and attachment\nerrors, the numerous surface constraints are impulse capped to avoid\noverpowering mechanical constraints. To improve tracking accuracy, multiple\nsimulations are spawned at each frame and fed a variety of heuristics,\nconstraints and poses. A 3D error metric selects the best-fit simulation,\nhelping the system handle challenging hand motions.

Our\nstudy focuses on the Arctic region, where two O$_{3}$ destruction mechanisms\nplay an important role, involving halogen and nitrogen chemical families (i.e.\nNOx = NO and NO$_{2}$), respectively. The temporal evolution and geographical\ndistribution of (O$_{3}$) loss in the low and middle stratosphere have been\ninvestigated between 2002 and 2013.

Mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow leads to the formation of\nan accretion disk around a weakly magnetized white dwarf (WD) in cataclysmic\nvariables. At the inner edge of the disk, the gas comes upon the surface of the\nWD and has to get rid of its excess kinetic energy in order to settle down on\nthe more slowly rotating outer stellar layers. This region is known as the\nboundary layer (BL). Aims. In this work we investigate the vertical structure\nof the BL, which is still poorly understood. We shall provide details of the\nbasic structure of the two-dimensional (2D) BL and how it depends on parameters\nsuch as stellar mass and rotation rate, as well as the mass-accretion rate. We\nfurther investigate the destination of the disk material and compare our\nresults with previous one-dimensional (1D) simulations. Methods. We solve the\n2D equations of radiation hydrodynamics in a spherical geometry using a\nparallel grid-based code that employs a Riemann solver. The radiation energy is\nconsidered in the two-temperature approach with a radiative flux given by the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Results. The BL around a non-rotating WD\nis characterized by a steep drop in angular velocity over a width of only 1% of\nthe stellar radius, a heavy depletion of mass, and a high temperature (500 000\nK) as a consequence of the strong shear. Variations in Om_star, M_star, and\nM_dot influence the extent of the changes of the variables in the BL but not\nthe general structure. Depending on Om_star, the disk material travels up to\nthe poles or is halted at a certain latitude. The extent of mixing with the\nstellar material also depends on Om_star.

We also discuss the sensitivity of the attacks to\ndifferent training parameters, and their robustness against mitigation\nstrategies, finding that defenses are either ineffective or lead to\nsignificantly worse performances of the generative models in terms of training\nstability and/or sample quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 10:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 12:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 13:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no\nprior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD\n1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass\ndisks (M$_{\\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$). For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$.

These results\nshow that HD can be used as an independent gas mass tracer with a relatively\nlow uncertainty and should be considered as an important science goal for\nfuture FIR missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

So far, such\nstudies have been largely performed for single processes. Here, we present the\nfirst work that quantitatively investigates both the relative importance and\nthe cumulative effect of (non-)energetic processing. We focus on astronomically\nrelevant CO:CH3OH = 4:1 ice analogues exposed to doses relevant for the\ncollapse stage of dense clouds.

The absolute abundances and the\nabundance fractions are found to be dependent on the H-atom/CO-CH3OH molecule\nratios and on the overall deposition rate. In the case that ices are exposed to\nUV photons only, several different COMs are found. Typically, the abundance\nfractions are 0.2 for MF, 0.3 for GA and 0.5 for EG as opposed to the values\nfound in pure hydrogenation experiments without UV in which MF is largely\nabsent: 0.0, 0.2-0.6 and 0.8-0.4, respectively. In experiments where both are\napplied, overall COM abundances drop to about half of those found in the pure\nUV irradiation experiments, but the composition fractions are very similar.\nThis implies COM ratios can be used as a diagnostic tool to derive the\nprocessing history of an ice.

First, we extend the known\nclassification for the $|{\\cal H}|=1$ case by classifying the boundedness of\nclique-width for every set ${\\cal H}$ of self-complementary graphs. We then\ncompletely settle the $|{\\cal H}|=2$ case. In particular, we determine one new\nclass of $(H,\\overline{H})$-free graphs of bounded clique-width (as a side\neffect, this leaves only six classes of $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs, for which it\nis not known whether their clique-width is bounded). Once we have obtained the\nclassification of the $|{\\cal H}|=2$ case, we research the effect of forbidding\nself-complementary graphs on the boundedness of clique-width. Surprisingly, we\nshow that for a set ${\\cal F}$ of self-complementary graphs on at least five\nvertices, the classification of the boundedness of clique-width for\n$(\\{H,\\overline{H}\\}\\cup {\\cal F})$-free graphs coincides with the one for the\n$|{\\cal H}|=2$ case if and only if ${\\cal F}$ does not include the bull (the\nonly non-empty self-complementary graphs on fewer than five vertices are $P_1$\nand $P_4$, and $P_4$-free graphs have clique-width at most $2$). Finally, we\ndiscuss the consequences of our results for the Colouring problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 10:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

The field of program slicing is concerned with computing a quotient\nof a program which preserves part of the behaviour of the original program. All\nprogram slicing algorithms take account of the structural properties of a\nprogram such as control dependence and data dependence rather than the\nsemantics of its functions and predicates, and thus work, in effect, with\nprogram schemas. The dynamic slicing criterion of Korel and Laski requires only\nthat program behaviour is preserved in cases where the original program follows\na particular path, and that the slice/quotient follows this path. In this paper\nwe formalise Korel and Laski's definition of a dynamic slice as applied to\nlinear schemas, and also formulate a less restrictive definition in which the\npath through the original program need not be preserved by the slice. The less\nrestrictive definition has the benefit of leading to smaller slices. For both\ndefinitions, we compute complexity bounds for the problems of establishing\nwhether a given slice of a linear schema is a dynamic slice and whether a\nlinear schema has a non-trivial dynamic slice and prove that the latter problem\nis NP-hard in both cases. We also give an example to prove that minimal dynamic\nslices (whether or not they preserve the original path) need not be unique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

A common method\nfor approximately solving the NP-hard graph matching problem is relaxing it to\na convex optimization problem over the set of doubly stochastic (DS) matrices.\nRecent analysis has shown that for almost all pairs of isomorphic and\nasymmetric graphs, the DS relaxation succeeds in correctly retrieving the\nisomorphism between the graphs. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the case\nof symmetric isomorphic graphs. This goal is motivated by shape matching\napplications where the graphs of interest usually have reflective symmetry.\n  For symmetric problems the graph matching problem has multiple isomorphisms\nand so convex relaxations admit all convex combinations of these isomorphisms\nas viable solutions. If the convex relaxation does not admit any additional\nsuperfluous solution we say that it is convex exact. In this case there are\ntractable algorithms to retrieve an isomorphism from the convex relaxation.\n  We show that convex exactness depends strongly on the symmetry group of the\ngraphs; For a fixed symmetry group $G$, either the DS relaxation will be convex\nexact for almost all pairs of isomorphic graphs with symmetry group $G$, or the\nDS relaxation will fail for all such pairs. We show that for reflective groups\nwith at least one full orbit convex exactness holds almost everywhere, and\nprovide some simple examples of non-reflective symmetry groups for which convex\nexactness always fails.\n  When convex exactness holds, the isomorphisms of the graphs are the extreme\npoints of the convex solution set. We suggest an efficient algorithm for\nretrieving an isomorphism in this case. We also show that the \"convex to\nconcave\" projection method will also retrieve an isomorphism in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

In this particular\nproblem, a user is presented with a deformed picture of a Chinese phrase and\neight low-resolution images. They must quickly select the relevant images in\norder to purchase their train tickets. This problem presents several\nchallenges: (1) the teaching labels for both the Chinese phrases and the images\nwere not available for supervised learning, (2) no pre-trained deep\nconvolutional neural networks are available for recognizing these Chinese\nphrases or the presented images, and (3) each captcha must be solved within a\nfew seconds. We collected 2.6 million captchas, with 2.6 million deformed\nChinese phrases and over 21 million images. From these data, we constructed an\nassociation graph, composed of over 6 million vertices, and linked these\nvertices based on co-occurrence information and feature similarity between\npairs of images. We then trained a deep convolutional neural network to learn a\nprojection of the Chinese phrases onto a 230-dimensional latent space. Using\nlabel propagation, we computed the likelihood of each of the eight images\nconditioned on the latent space projection of the deformed phrase for each\ncaptcha. The resulting system solved captchas with 77% accuracy in 2 seconds on\naverage. Our work, in answering this practical challenge, illustrates the power\nof this class of unsupervised association learning techniques, which may be\nrelated to the brain's general strategy for associating language stimuli with\nvisual objects on the principle of suspicious coincidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 14:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Our goal in this paper is to\nexplore the possibility of having an equivalent relationship in the context of\nlattice models. We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use\nthe concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin\nchain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding\nto bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This\nstatement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map\nbetween irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine\nTL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose\ncontinuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)\nspin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any\nlonger: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the\nmodules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the\ncontent in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but\nthe detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.\nThis carries over to the continuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 14:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 11:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The\nlong-term variations in the optical continuum exhibit a wave-like pattern and\nthe Hbeta integrated flux series varies with a similar behavior. The broad\nHbeta profiles have asymmetric double peaks, which change strongly with time\nand tend to merge into a single peak during some epochs.

Motivated by this connection we performed two-dimensional numerical\nsimulations showing that X-shaped radio sources may naturally form as a jet\npropagates along the major axis a highly elliptical density distribution,\nbecause of the fast expansion of the cocoon along the minor axis of the\ndistribution.\n  We intend to extend our analysis by performing three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations and investigating the role of different parameters is determining\nthe formation of the X-shaped morphology.\n  The problem is addressed by numerical means, carrying out three-dimensional\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of bidirectional jets propagating\nin a triaxial density distribution.\n  We show that only jets with power $\\lesssim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can give\norigin to an X-shaped morphology and that a misalignment of $30^o$ between the\njet axis and the major axis of the density distribution is still favourable to\nthe formation of this kind of morphology. In addition we compute synthetic\nradio emission maps and polarization maps.\n  In our scenario for the formation of X-shaped radio sources only low power\nFRII can give origin to such kind of morphology. Our synthetic emission maps\nshow that the different observed morphologies of X-shaped sources can be the\nresult of similar structures viewed under different perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 15:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 17:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We exploit this observation by numerically precomputing the logarithms\nof carefully chosen Bessel functions and representing them with piecewise\nbivariate Chebyshev expansions. Our scheme is able to evaluate Bessel functions\nof orders between $0$ and $1\\sep,000\\sep,000\\sep,000$ at essentially any\npositive real argument. In that regime, it is competitive with existing methods\nfor the rapid evaluation of Bessel functions and has several advantages over\nthem.

Second, by calculating the logarithms of the Bessel functions rather\nthan the Bessel functions themselves, we avoid many issues which arise from\nnumerical overflow and underflow.

However, in most\nrecent and promising techniques such as CNN based segmentation it is not\nobvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge. State-of-the-art methods\noperate as pixel-wise classifiers where the training objectives do not\nincorporate the structure and inter-dependencies of the output. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a generic training strategy that incorporates\nanatomical prior knowledge into CNNs through a new regularisation model, which\nis trained end-to-end. The new framework encourages models to follow the global\nanatomical properties of the underlying anatomy (e.g. shape, label structure)\nvia learned non-linear representations of the shape.

While\nthe collection of telemetry data for individual animals has improved\ndramatically, the methods to properly account for inherent uncertainties (e.g.,\nmeasurement error, dependence, barriers to movement) have lagged behind. Still,\nmany new statistical approaches have been developed to infer unknown quantities\naffecting animal movement or predict movement based on telemetry data.\nHierarchical statistical models are useful to account for some of the\naforementioned uncertainties, as well as provide population-level inference,\nbut they often come with an increased computational burden. For certain types\nof statistical models, it is straightforward to provide inference if the latent\ntrue animal trajectory is known, but challenging otherwise. In these cases,\napproaches related to multiple imputation have been employed to account for the\nuncertainty associated with our knowledge of the latent trajectory. Despite the\nincreasing use of imputation approaches for modeling animal movement, the\ngeneral sensitivity and accuracy of these methods have not been explored in\ndetail. We provide an introduction to animal movement modeling and describe how\nimputation approaches may be helpful for certain types of models. We also\nassess the performance of imputation approaches in a simulation study. Our\nsimulation study suggests that inference for model parameters directly related\nto the location of an individual may be more accurate than inference for\nparameters associated with higher-order processes such as velocity or\nacceleration.

The impulse response of this channel exhibits a transition from early\nseparate components followed by a diffuse reverberation tail. Under the\nassumption that the transmitter's (or receiver's) position and orientation are\npicked uniformly at random we derive an exact expression of the mean arrival\nrate for a rectangular room predicted by the mirror source theory. The rate is\nquadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional\nto the product of beam coverage fractions of the transmitter and receiver\nantennas. Making use of the exact formula, we characterize the onset of the\ndiffuse tail by defining a \"mixing time\" as the point in time where the arrival\nrate exceeds one component per transmit pulse duration. We also give an\napproximation for the power-delay spectrum. It turns out that the power-delay\nspectrum is unaffected by the antenna directivity. However, Monte Carlo\nsimulations show that antenna directivity does indeed play an important role\nfor the distribution of instantaneous mean delay and rms delay spread\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 12:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Security and privacy become major concerns in the cloud scenario, for\nwhich Searchable Encryption (SE) technology is proposed to support efficient\nretrieval of encrypted data. However, the absence of lightweight ranked search\nis still a typical shortage in existing SE schemes. In this paper, we propose a\nLightweight Efficient Multi-keyword Ranked Search over Encrypted Cloud Data\nusing Dual Word Embeddings (LRSE) scheme that supports top-k retrieval in the\nknown background model. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue and\ndesign goals for lightweight ranked search in SE. We employ word embedding\ntrained on the whole English Wikipedia using word2vec to replace the general\ndictionary, afterwards we make use of Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) to\nsubstitute traditional Vector Space Model (VSM), based on which we achieve the\ngoal of lightweight ranked search with higher precision and solve the\nchallenging prob-lems caused by updating the traditional dictionary in existing\nSE schemes. In LRSE, we employ an improved secure kNN scheme to guarantee\nsufficient pri-vacy protection. Our security analysis shows that LRSE satisfies\nour formulated privacy requirements and extensive experiments performed on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that LRSE indeed accords with our proposed\ndesign goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 04:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}
