When the frequencies of light waves, Langmuir waves, and\nsingle-particle cyclotron motion are scaled to be asymptotically large, the\ntwo-fluid Maxwell system becomes a fast-slow dynamical system. This fast-slow\nsystem admits a formally-exact single-fluid closure that may be computed\nsystematically with any desired order of accuracy through the use of a\nfunctional partial differential equation. In the leading order approximation,\nthe closure reproduces magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Higher order truncations of\nthe closure give an infinite hierarchy of extended MHD models that allow for\narbitrary mass ratio, as well as perturbative deviations from charge\nneutrality. The closure is interpreted geometrically as an invariant slow\nmanifold in the infinite-dimensional two-fluid phase space, on which two-fluid\nmotions are free of high-frequency oscillations. This perspective shows that\nthe full closure inherits a Hamiltonian structure from two-fluid theory. By\nemploying infinite-dimensional Lie transforms, the Poisson bracket for the\nall-orders closure may be obtained in closed form. Thus, conservative\ntruncations of the single-fluid closure may be obtained by simply truncating\nthe single-fluid Hamiltonian. Moreover, the closed-form expression for the\nall-orders bracket gives explicit expressions for a number of the full\nclosure's conservation laws.

OpenCL allows programs running on a host computer to launch\naccelerator kernels which can be compiled at run-time for a specific\narchitecture, thus enabling portability. However, the prohibitive compilation\ntimes (specifically the FPGA place and route times) are a major stumbling block\nwhen using OpenCL tools from FPGA vendors. The long compilation times mean that\nthe tools cannot effectively use just-in-time (JIT) compilation or runtime\nperformance scaling. Coarse-grained overlays represent a possible solution by\nvirtue of their coarse granularity and fast compilation. In this paper, we\npresent a methodology for run-time compilation of OpenCL kernels to a DSP block\nbased coarse-grained overlay, rather than directly to the fine-grained FPGA\nfabric. The proposed methodology allows JIT compilation and on-demand\nresource-aware kernel replication to better utilize available overlay\nresources, raising the abstraction level while reducing compile times\nsignificantly. We further demonstrate that this approach can even be used for\nrun-time compilation of OpenCL kernels on the ARM processor of the embedded\nheterogeneous Zynq device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 02:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

We consider three\nwell-known models for representing the preferences of the agents: ordinal\npreferences on single items, the value oracle model, and additive utilities. In\neach of these models, we establish virtually tight bounds on the approximation\nratio that can be obtained by algorithms running in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 05:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 19:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Under such circumstances, estimating the location of a tweet is an\nimportant goal of the study.

To realize this modeling, we propose the\nconvolutional mixture density network (CMDN), which uses text data to estimate\nthe mixture model parameters. Experimentally obtained results reveal that CMDN\nachieved the highest prediction performance among the method for predicting the\nexact coordinates.

Such magnetic tubes model, in particular, a segment of\na coronal loop or a polar plume. The wavelength is taken comparable to the tube\nradius. We perform numerical simulation of the wave propagation using ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics. We find that a torsional wave nonlinearly induces three\nkinds of compressive flows: the parallel flow at the Alfv\\'en speed, that\nconstitutes a bulk plasma motion along the magnetic field, the tube wave, and\nalso transverse flows in the radial direction, associated with sausage fast\nmagnetoacoustic modes. In addition, nonlinear torsional wave steepens and its\npropagation speed increases. The latter effect leads to the progressive\ndistortion of torsional wave front, i.e. nonlinear phase mixing. Because of the\nintrinsic non-uniformity of the torsional wave amplitude across the tube\nradius, the nonlinear effects are more pronounced in regions with higher wave\namplitude. They are always absent at the axes of the flux tube. In the case of\na linear radial profile of the wave amplitude, the nonlinear effects are\nlocalised in an annulus region near the tube boundary. Thus, the parallel\ncompressive flows driven by torsional Alfv\\'en waves in the solar and stellar\ncoronae, are essentially non-uniform in the perpendicular direction. The\npresence of additional sinks for the wave energy reduces the efficiency of the\nnonlinear parallel cascade in torsional Alfv\\'en waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 09:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

The nucleon-pion-state contribution results in an\noverestimation of all charges and moments obtained with the plateau method. The\noverestimation is at the 5-10% level for source-sink separations of about 2 fm.\nThe source-sink separations accessible in contemporary lattice simulations are\nfound to be too small for chiral perturbation theory to be directly applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 10:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 08:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

However,\nthis is the status quo, and in turn, most efficient concurrent data-structures\nheavily rely on compare-and-swap (e.g. for swinging pointers and in general,\nconflict resolution).\n  We show that this need not be the case, by designing and implementing a\nconcurrent linearizable Log data-structure (also known as a History object),\nsupporting two operations: append(item), which appends the item to the log, and\nget-log(), which returns the appended items so far, in order. Readers are\nwait-free and writers are lock-free, and this data-structure can be used in a\nlock-free universal construction to implement any concurrent object with a\ngiven sequential specification. Our implementation uses atomic read, xor,\ndecrement, and fetch-and-increment instructions supported on X86 architectures,\nand provides similar performance to a compare-and-swap-based solution on\ntoday's hardware.

In addition, an algorithm is presented that\ndistributes aggregate-level control decisions among the individual systems of\nthe pool in an economically fair and computationally efficient way.

There are no exponentially growing\nmodes in such flows and the turbulence is energetically supported only by the\nlinear growth of perturbation harmonics due to the shear flow non-normality.\nThis non-normality-induced, or nonmodal growth is anisotropic in spectral\nspace, which, in turn, leads to anisotropy of nonlinear processes in this\nspace. As a result, a transverse (angular) redistribution of harmonics in\nFourier space appears to be the main nonlinear process in these flows, rather\nthan direct or inverse cascades. We refer to this type of nonlinear\nredistribution as the nonlinear transverse cascade. It is demonstrated that the\nturbulence is sustained by a subtle interplay between the linear nonmodal\ngrowth and the nonlinear transverse cascade that exemplifies a well-known\nbypass scenario of subcritical turbulence. These two basic processes mainly\noperate at large length scales, comparable to the domain size. Therefore, this\ncentral, small wave number area of Fourier space is crucial in the\nself-sustenance; we defined its size and labeled it as the vital area of\nturbulence. Outside the vital area, the nonmodal growth and the transverse\ncascade are of secondary importance. Although the cascades and the\nself-sustaining process of turbulence are qualitatively the same at different\naspect ratios, the number of harmonics actively participating in this process\nvaries, but always remains quite large.

It has been observed that for a large class of\n\"concurrency-unfriendly\" data structures, fine-grained parallelization does not\npay off: an implementation based on a single global lock outperforms\nfine-grained solutions. The flat combining paradigm exploits this by ensuring\nthat a thread holding the global lock sequentially combines requests and then\nexecutes the combined requests on behalf of concurrent threads.\n  In this paper, we propose a synchronization technique that unites flat\ncombining and parallel bulk updates borrowed from parallel algorithms designed\nfor the PRAM model. The idea is that the combiner thread assigns waiting\nthreads to perform concurrent requests in parallel.\n  We foresee the technique to help in implementing efficient\n\"concurrency-ambivalent\" data structures, which can benefit from both\nparallelism and serialization, depending on the operational context. To\nvalidate the idea, we considered heap-based implementations of a priority\nqueue.

Using a Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the problem to that\nof spins coupled to quantum rotors and subsequently, propose a Landau field\ntheory for this model that matches the known results in the respective limits.\nWe calculate the effective field theories and provide the relevant critical\nexponents for the different phase transitions. Our results are relevant for\npredicting the stability of the topological phase in realistic experimental\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 13:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Specifically, collecting large amounts of\ntraining data containing unconstrained images annotated with accurate 3D poses\nis infeasible. We therefore propose to use two independent training sources.\nThe first source consists of accurate 3D motion capture data, and the second\nsource consists of unconstrained images with annotated 2D poses. To integrate\nboth sources, we propose a dual-source approach that combines 2D pose\nestimation with efficient 3D pose retrieval. To this end, we first convert the\nmotion capture data into a normalized 2D pose space, and separately learn a 2D\npose estimation model from the image data. During inference, we estimate the 2D\npose and efficiently retrieve the nearest 3D poses. We then jointly estimate a\nmapping from the 3D pose space to the image and reconstruct the 3D pose.

But one of the greatest challenges with CDSs has been\ndeveloping correct structures and then proving the correctness of these\nstructures. We believe that techniques that help prove the correctness of these\nCDSs can also guide in developing new CDSs. An intuitive technique to prove the\ncorrectness of CDSs is using Linearization Points or LPs. An LP is an atomic\nevent in the execution interval of each method such that the execution of the\nentire method seems to have taken place in the instant of that event. One of\nthe main challenges with the LP based approach is to identify the correct LPs\nof a CDS. Identifying the correct LPs can be deceptively wrong in many cases.\nIn fact, in many cases, the LP identified or even worse the CDS itself could be\nwrong. To address these issues, several automatic tools for verifying\nlinearizability have been developed. But we believe that these tools don't\nprovide insight to a programmer to develop the correct concurrent programs or\nidentify the LPs. Considering the complexity of developing a CDS and verifying\nits correctness, we address the most basic problem of this domain in this\npaper: given the set of LPs of a CDS, how to show its correctness? We assume\nthat we are given a CDS and its LPs. We have developed a hand-crafted technique\nof proving the correctness of the CDS by validating its LPs. As observed\nearlier, identifying the correct LPs is very tricky and erroneous. But since\nour technique is hand-crafted, we believe that the process of proving\ncorrectness might provide insight to identify the correct LPs, if the currently\nchosen LP is incorrect. We also believe that this technique might also offer\nthe programmer some insight to develop more efficient variants of the CDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 14:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 04:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 08:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 14:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 11:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

WISEA\nJ110125.95+540052.8 has a WISE $W2$ magnitude of $W2=15.37 \\pm 0.09$, this\ndiscovery demonstrates the ability of citizen scientists to identify moving\nobjects via visual inspection that are 0.9 magnitudes fainter than the $W2$\nsingle-exposure sensitivity, a threshold that has limited prior motion-based\nbrown dwarf searches with WISE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 15:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

That published analysis\ndoes not constrain the magnitude of the effect; it only tests models with and\nwithout the effect against the data. Other MINERvA analyses need an expression\nof the model uncertainty in the RPA effect. A well-described uncertainty can be\nused for systematics for unfolding, for model errors in the analysis of non-QE\nsamples, and as input for fitting exercises for model testing or constraining\nbackgrounds. This prescription takes uncertainties on the parameters in the\nValencia RPA model and adds a (not-as-tight) constraint from muon capture data.\nFor MINERvA we apply it as a 2D ($q_0$,$q_3$) weight to GENIE events, in lieu\nof generating a full beyond-Fermi-gas quasielastic events.

Reduction of friction is observed with vibration\napplied in any of the three possible directions (normal to the contact plane,\nin the direction of motion and in-plane transverse). In this work, we consider\nthe multi-mode active control of sliding friction, where phase-shifted\noscillations in two or more directions act at the same time. Our analysis is\nbased on a macroscopic contact-mechanical model that was recently shown to be\nwell-suited for describing dynamic frictional processes. For simplicity, we\nlimit our analysis to a constant, load-independent normal and tangential\nstiffness and two superimposed phase-shifted harmonic oscillations, one of them\nbeing normal to the plane and the other in the direction of motion. As in\nprevious works utilizing the present model, we assume a constant local\ncoefficient of friction, with reduction of the observed force of friction\narising entirely from the macroscopic dynamics of the system. Our numerical\nsimulations show that the resulting law of friction is determined by just three\ndimensionless parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, three\nqualitatively different types of behavior are observed: (a) symmetric\nvelocity-dependence of the coefficient of friction (same for positive and\nnegative velocities), (b) asymmetric dependence with respect to the sign of the\nvelocity, but with zero force at zero velocity, and (c) asymmetric dependence\nwith non-zero force at zero velocity.

This learning process appears in settings in which each\nindividual in a group is trying to decide over time, in a distributed manner,\nwhich option to select among a shared set of options. Specifically, we consider\na stochastic dynamics in a group in which every individual selects an option in\nthe following two-step process: (1) select a random individual and observe the\noption that individual chose in the previous time step, and (2) adopt that\noption if its stochastic quality was good at that time step. Various\ninstantiations of such distributed learning appear in nature, and have also\nbeen studied in the social science literature. From the perspective of an\nindividual, an attractive feature of this learning process is that it is a\nsimple heuristic that requires extremely limited computational capacities. But\nwhat does it mean for the group -- could such a simple, distributed and\nessentially memoryless process lead the group as a whole to perform optimally?\nWe show that the answer to this question is yes -- this distributed learning is\nhighly effective at identifying the best option and is close to optimal for the\ngroup overall. Our analysis also gives quantitative bounds that show fast\nconvergence of these stochastic dynamics. Prior to our work the only\ntheoretical work related to such learning dynamics has been either in\ndeterministic special cases or in the asymptotic setting. Finally, we observe\nthat our infinite population dynamics is a stochastic variant of the classic\nmultiplicative weights update (MWU) method. Consequently, we arrive at the\nfollowing interesting converse: the learning dynamics on a finite population\nconsidered here can be viewed as a novel distributed and low-memory\nimplementation of the classic MWU method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 15:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}
