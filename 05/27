This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases\nwith constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case. We\nuse the simulation results to construct an analytic model that gives an\neffective equation of state for a coarse-grained parcel of the gas, in the form\nof an ideal equation of state with a polytropic index that depends on the\ndissipation and energy transfer rates between the magnetic and turbulent\ncomponents. We argue that the reduced dissipation rate and larger equilibrium\nvelocity dispersion produced by compressing, magnetized turbulence has\nimportant implications for the driving and maintenance of turbulence in\nmolecular clouds, and for the rates of chemical and radiative processes that\nare sensitive to shocks and dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 08:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

This is achieved through the\nscanning of sources of explicit global symmetry breaking by a relaxion field\nduring an exponentially long period of inflation in the early universe. We\nexplore this mechanism in detail in a specific composite Higgs scenario with\nQCD-like dynamics, based on an ultraviolet $SU(N)_{\\textrm{TC}}$ 'technicolor'\nconfining gauge theory with three Dirac technifermion flavors. We find that we\ncan successfully generate a hierarchy of scales $\\xi \\equiv \\langle h \\rangle^2\n/ F_\\pi^2 \\gtrsim 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ (i.e., compositeness scales $F_\\pi \\sim\n20$ TeV) without tuning. This evades all current electroweak precision bounds\non our (custodial violating) model. While directly observing the heavy\ncomposite states in this model will be challenging, a future electroweak\nprecision measurement program can probe most of the natural parameter space for\nthe model. We also highlight signatures of more general composite Higgs models\nin the cosmological relaxation framework, including some implications for\nflavor and dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 18:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

They are thought to be the seeds from which SMBHs grow, which would\nexplain the existence of quasars with BH masses of up to 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nwhen the Universe was only 0.8 Gyr old. The detection and study of IMBHs has\nthus strong implications for understanding how SMBHs form and grow, which is\nultimately linked to galaxy formation and growth, as well as for studies of the\nuniversality of BH accretion or the epoch of reionisation. Proving the\nexistence of seed BHs in the early Universe is not yet feasible with the\ncurrent instrumentation; however, those seeds that did not grow into SMBHs can\nbe found as IMBHs in the nearby Universe. In this review I summarize the\ndifferent scenarios proposed for the formation of IMBHs and gather all the\nobservational evidence for the few hundreds of nearby IMBH candidates found in\ndwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, as well as\nthe possible discovery of a few seed BHs at high redshift. I discuss some of\ntheir properties, such as X-ray weakness and location in the BH mass scaling\nrelations, and the possibility to discover IMBHs through high velocity clouds,\ntidal disruption events, gravitational waves, or accretion disks in active\ngalactic nuclei.

Neither of these relationships correctly\ndescribe the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation.\nRecent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that\nthe Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional\nphase that occurs in all middle-aged stars.

An upper limit on the 1.296 THz line flux was obtained\ntoward R Aql. Near-simultaneous observations of the 22.23508 GHz 6(16)-5(23)\nwater maser transition were carried out towards all four sources using the\nEffelsberg 100m telescope. The measured line fluxes imply 22 GHz / 1.296 THz\nphoton luminosity ratios of 0.012, 0.12, and 0.83 respectively for W Hya, U\nHer, and VY CMa, values that confirm the 22 GHz maser transition to be\nunsaturated in W Hya and U Her.

Like the 22 GHz maser transition, all three of the THz emission\nlines detected here originate from the ortho-H2O spin isomer. Based upon a\nmodel for the circumstellar envelope of W Hya, we estimate that stimulated\nemission is responsible for ~ 85% of the observed 1.296 THz line emission, and\nthus that this transition may be properly described as a terahertz-frequency\nmaser.

Compared with existing bounds, the new bound\ndoes not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor the\noptimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theory\nalso leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks:\nwe show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that are\ninvariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for\nthe learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we call\nmultisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes\ndirectly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the\nfirst one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The\noptimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be\noptimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs,\nwe conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance on\nthree real-world datasets: sentiment analysis, digit classification, and\nvehicle counting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 19:10:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 22:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very\nsensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at\nearly times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical\nplanetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both\nhave Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 19:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 21:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

To explore this possibility, we have developed\nSMORE, an object storage system designed to reliably and efficiently store\nlarge, seldom-changing data objects on an array of host-managed or host-aware\nSMR disks.\n  SMORE uses a log-structured approach to accommodate the constraint that all\nwrites to an SMR drive must be sequential within large shingled zones. It\nstripes data across zones on separate disks, using erasure coding to protect\nagainst drive failure. A separate garbage collection thread reclaims space by\nmigrating live data out of the emptiest zones so that they can be trimmed and\nreused. An index stored on flash and backed up to the SMR drives maps object\nidentifiers to on-disk locations. SMORE interleaves log records with object\ndata within SMR zones to enable index recovery after a system crash (or failure\nof the flash device) without any additional logging mechanism.\n  SMORE achieves full disk bandwidth when ingesting data---with a variety of\nobject sizes---and when reading large objects. Read performance declines for\nsmaller object sizes where inter- object seek time dominates.

We developed two pipelines\ncorresponding to the two modes of observing. The assessment of the performance\nof both pipelines is presented.

In well-mixed scenarios at the\nsub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between\nsuccessive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be\nappropriately modelled as a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie\nalgorithm. However, Gillespie's algorithm is routinely applied to model\nbiological systems for which it was never intended. In particular, processes in\nwhich cell proliferation is important should not be simulated naively using the\nGillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature of the cell cycle breaks\nthe Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle times is\nfar less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same\nmean.\n  Here we suggest a method of modelling the cell cycle that restores the\nmemoryless property to the system and is therefore consistent with simulation\nvia the Gillespie algorithm. By breaking the cell cycle into a number of\nindependent exponentially distributed stages we can restore the Markov property\nat the same time as more accurately approximating the appropriate cell cycle\ntime distributions.

This last result is\nrelevant for the behavior of observables at low energies, because the\nlow-energy part of the $Q^2$ term is expected to flow when the effective mass\ndiverges near QCP. If this term is the dominant one, its flow has to be\ncomputed self-consistently, which gives rise to a novel quantum-critical\nbehavior.

Depending on the compactness of the central object, the\nneutrino self-interaction potential is up to three times as large as that\nwithout GR principally due to trajectory bending which increases the\nintersection angles between different neutrino trajectories, and time dilation\nwhich changes the fluxes. We determine whether GR effects are important for\nflavor transformation during the different epochs of a supernova by using\nmulti-angle flavor transformation calculations and consider a density profile\nand neutrino spectra representative of both the accretion and cooling phases.\nWe find the GR effects are smaller during the accretion phase due to low\ncompactness of the proto-neutron star and merely delay the decoherence; the\nneutrino bipolar oscillations during the cooling phase are also delayed due to\nthe GR effects but the delay may be more important because the delay occurs at\nradii where it might alter the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 21:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 19:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Jul 2017 15:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

No work has been devoted into direct\nestimation of RWT from cardiac MR images due to the diverse shapes and\nstructures for various subjects and cardiac diseases, as well as the complex\nregional deformation of LV myocardium during the systole and diastole phases of\nthe cardiac cycle. In this paper, we present a newly proposed Residual\nRecurrent Neural Network (ResRNN) that fully leverages the spatial and temporal\ndynamics of LV myocardium to achieve accurate frame-wise RWT estimation. Our\nResRNN comprises two paths: 1) a feed forward convolution neural network (CNN)\nfor effective and robust CNN embedding learning of various cardiac images and\npreliminary estimation of RWT from each frame itself independently, and 2) a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) for further improving the estimation by modeling\nspatial and temporal dynamics of LV myocardium.

Using the Lomb-Scargle and epoch\nfolding techniques, we have detected periodic modulations from 20 pulsars and a\nnew candidate pulsar. The survey also covers 11 other pulsars with no clear\nsign of periodic modulation. The 0.5-8 keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of the\npulsars ranges from $10^{34}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 60 kpc.

This survey provides a rich data set\nfor energy-dependent pulse profile modeling. Six pulsars show an almost\neclipse-like dip in the pulse profile. Phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals\ndiverse spectral variation during pulsation cycle: e.g., for an absorbed\npower-law model, some exhibit an (anti)-correlation between absorption and\nX-ray flux, while others show more intrinsic spectral variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 22:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The dielectric permeability tensor is derived from quantum\nkinetic equations with non-trivial equilibrium spin-distribution functions\n(NTESDF) in the linear approximation on amplitude of wave perturbations. In\ngeneral case, x- and y-projections of the SDF are nonzero which is called the\nnon-trivial regime. Corresponding equilibrium solution is found. Contribution\nof the NTESDF appears in the dielectric permeability tensor in the additive\nform. It is explicitly found here. Corresponding modification in the dispersion\nequation for the transverse waves is derived. Contribution of NTESDF in the\nspectrum of transverse waves is calculated numerically. It is found that the\nterm caused by the NTESDF can be comparable with the classic terms for the\nrelatively small wave vectors and frequencies above the cyclotron frequency. In\nmajority of regimes, the extra spin caused term dominates over the spin term\nfound earlier, except the small frequency regime, where their contributions in\nthe whistler spectrum are comparable. A decrease of the left-hand circularly\npolarized wave frequency, an increase of the high-frequency right-hand\ncircularly polarized wave frequency, and a decrease of frequency changing by an\nincrease of frequency at the growth of the wave vector for the whistler are\nfound. A dramatic decrease of the spin wave frequency resulting in several\ntimes larger group velocity of the spin wave is found either. Found dispersion\nequations are used for obtaining of an effective quantum hydrodynamics\nreproducing these results.

In this paper, we overcome this analytical\ndifficulty and find a convenient formula for three-wave coupling coefficients\nin cold, uniform, magnetized plasmas in the most general geometry. This is\nachieved by systematically solving the fluid-Maxwell model to second order\nusing a multiscale perturbative expansion.

Our method is\nbased on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic\nsolid-state crystals . When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear\nrecoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm,\nwith an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with the direction\nof the recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain\nin the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These\nlevel shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance)\nmaking it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a\nsolid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in\ndiamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of\nindividual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale\nregion of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter\nevent, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection\nof ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects\nin the vicinity of the event can be interrogated to map the strain environment,\nthus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach\nshould be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than\n70% at a false positive rate less than 5% for 10 keV recoil energies. If\nsuccessful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced\nnuclear recoils at solid state densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter\nspace below the solar neutrino floor. This technique could also potentially be\napplied to identify the direction of particles such as neutrons whose low\nscattering cross-section requires detectors with a large target mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 2017 03:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

A splicing detec- tion and localization\nalgorithm usually takes an input image and produces a binary decision\nindicating whether the input image has been manipulated, and also a\nsegmentation mask that corre- sponds to the spliced region. Most existing\nsplicing detection and localization pipelines suffer from two main\nshortcomings: 1) they use handcrafted features that are not robust against\nsubsequent processing (e.g., compression), and 2) each stage of the pipeline is\nusually optimized independently. In this paper we extend the formulation of the\nunderlying splicing problem to consider two input images, a query image and a\npotential donor image. Here the task is to estimate the probability that the\ndonor image has been used to splice the query image, and obtain the splicing\nmasks for both the query and donor images. We introduce a novel deep\nconvolutional neural network architecture, called Deep Matching and Validation\nNetwork (DMVN), which simultaneously localizes and detects image splicing. The\nproposed approach does not depend on handcrafted features and uses raw input\nimages to create deep learned representations. Furthermore, the DMVN is\nend-to-end op- timized to produce the probability estimates and the\nsegmentation masks.

For standard Lasso theory to hold, the regularization\nparameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is\ngenerally unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to consider estimators,\nsuch as the Concomitant/Scaled Lasso, which jointly optimize over the\nregression coefficients as well as over the noise level, making the choice of\nthe regularization independent of the noise level. However, when data from\ndifferent sources are pooled to increase sample size, or when dealing with\nmultimodal datasets, noise levels typically differ and new dedicated estimators\nare needed.

The transport Jc measured at 4.2 K under\nhigh magnetic fields of 27 T is still on the level of 5.5x10^4 A/cm^2, which is\nmuch higher than those of low-temperature superconductors.

One or more agents\nin the population may act as authoritative sources of information, and the\nobjective of the remaining agents is to obtain information from or about these\nsource agents. We study two basic tasks: broadcasting, in which the agents are\nto learn the bit-state of an authoritative source which is present in the\npopulation, and source detection, in which the agents are required to decide if\nat least one source agent is present in the population or not.We focus on\ndesigning protocols which meet two natural conditions: (1) universality, i.e.,\nindependence of population size, and (2) rapid convergence to a correct global\nstate after a reconfiguration, such as a change in the state of a source agent.\nOur main positive result is to show that both of these constraints can be met.\nFor both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain\nsolutions with a convergence time of $O(\\log^2 n)$ rounds, w.h.p., from any\nstarting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that\nall agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to\nsource detection admits one-sided error on a $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the\npopulation (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to\nimplement in practice and have a compact formulation.Our protocols exploit the\nproperties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the hardness side, our\nmain structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the\nconstraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must\ndisplay a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an\nexample). We also observe that the periodicity of the oscillatory behavior of\nthe protocol, when present, must necessarily depend on the number $^\\\\# X$ of\nsource agents present in the population. For instance, our protocols inherently\nrely on the emergence of a signal passing through the population, whose period\nis $\\Theta(\\log \\frac{n}{^\\\\# X})$ rounds for most starting configurations.

Our calculation\nreveals that the drift relaxes the stringent condition on the temperature ratio\nfor wave destabilization. Growth rate becomes positive above a certain drift\nvelocity even if the temperature ratio is moderate. The observed phase velocity\nagrees well with the theoretical estimate. Experimental realization of the mode\nmay open up a new avenue in EAW research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 2017 11:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

In doing so, they remain operative\nand accommodate changes in a seamless way. For instance, such processes allow\nfor advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or\ninteraction with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to\nthem is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process,\neither because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. This\nevolutionary aspect adds another dimension to ASP since it brings about state\nchanging operations. We address this issue by providing an operational\nsemantics that characterizes grounding and solving processes in multi-shot ASP\nsolving. This characterization provides a semantic account of grounder and\nsolver states along with the operations manipulating them.\n  The operative nature of multi-shot solving avoids redundancies in relaunching\ngrounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning\ncapacities. clingo accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input\nlanguage with control capacities. On the declarative side, a new directive\nallows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable\nsubprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the\nsolving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the\nprocedural side.
