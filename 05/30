We aim to shed light on\nthe excitation and origin of the CO ladder observed toward protostars, and on\nthe water abundance in different physical components using spectrally resolved\nHerschel-HIFI data. Observations are presented of the highly excited CO line\nJ=16-15 with Herschel-HIFI toward 24 low-mass protostellar objects. The\nspectrally resolved profiles show two distinct velocity components: a broad\ncomponent with an average FWHM of 20 km/s, and a narrower component with a FWHM\nof 5 km/s that is often offset from the source velocity. The average rotational\ntemperature over the entire profile, as measured from comparison between CO\nJ=16-15 and 10-9 emission, is ~300 K. A radiative-transfer analysis shows that\nthe average H2O/CO column-density ratio is ~0.02, suggesting a total H2O\nabundance of ~2x10^-6. Two distinct velocity profiles observed in the HIFI line\nprofiles suggest that the CO ladder observed with PACS consists of two\nexcitation components. The warm component (300 K) is associated with the broad\nHIFI component, and the hot component (700 K) is associated with the offset\nHIFI component. The former originates in either outflow cavity shocks or the\ndisk wind, and the latter in irradiated shocks. The ubiquity of the warm and\nhot CO components suggests that fundamental mechanisms govern the excitation of\nthese components; we hypothesize that the warm component arises when H2 stops\nbeing the dominant coolant. In this scenario, the hot component arises in\ncooling molecular H2-poor gas just prior to the onset of H2 formation. High\nspectral resolution observations of highly excited CO transitions uniquely shed\nlight on the origin of warm and hot gas in low-mass protostellar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 16:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Improvements in manufacturing process technology have allowed DRAM\nvendors to lower the DRAM supply voltage conservatively, which reduces some of\nthe DRAM energy consumption. We would like to reduce the DRAM supply voltage\nmore aggressively, to further reduce energy. Aggressive supply voltage\nreduction requires a thorough understanding of the effect voltage scaling has\non DRAM access latency and DRAM reliability.\n  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to understanding and\nexploiting the latency and reliability characteristics of modern DRAM when the\nsupply voltage is lowered below the nominal voltage level specified by DRAM\nstandards. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, we perform an experimental\nstudy of 124 real DDR3L (low-voltage) DRAM chips manufactured recently by three\nmajor DRAM vendors. We find that reducing the supply voltage below a certain\npoint introduces bit errors in the data, and we comprehensively characterize\nthe behavior of these errors. We discover that these errors can be avoided by\nincreasing the latency of three major DRAM operations (activation, restoration,\nand precharge). We perform detailed DRAM circuit simulations to validate and\nexplain our experimental findings. We also characterize the various\nrelationships between reduced supply voltage and error locations, stored data\npatterns, DRAM temperature, and data retention.\n  Based on our observations, we propose a new DRAM energy reduction mechanism,\ncalled Voltron. The key idea of Voltron is to use a performance model to\ndetermine by how much we can reduce the supply voltage without introducing\nerrors and without exceeding a user-specified threshold for performance loss.\nVoltron reduces the average system energy by 7.3% while limiting the average\nsystem performance loss to only 1.8%, for a variety of workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 17:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

Asymmetries have\nbeen detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is\nunexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far\nare found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces\nsymmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a\nway of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show\nthat in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy\neffects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and\nmode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using\nboth perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy\neffects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the\nobservations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative\napproach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet\nasymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical $l=2$\nmultiplets of the Kepler young red giant KIC7341231 and obtain precise\nestimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed\nasymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms\nthat near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected\nmultiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for\n$l=2$ mixed modes all along the red giant branch (RGB). For $l=1$ modes, these\neffects can be neglected only at the base of the RGB.

The main decay mechanism\nis that of a string splitting into two strings. The corresponding total decay\nwidth behaves as $\\Gamma=\\frac\\pi2 ATL$ where $T$ and $L$ are the tension and\nlength of the string and $A$ is a dimensionless universal constant. We show\nthat this result holds for a bosonic string not only in the critical dimension.\nThe partial width of a given decay mode is given by\n$\\Gamma_i/\\Gamma=\\Phi_i\\exp(-2\\pi Cm_{sep}^2/T)$ where $\\Phi_i$ is a phase\nspace factor, $m_{sep}$ is the mass of the \"quark\" and \"antiquark\" created at\nthe splitting point, and $C$ is a dimensionless coefficient close to unity.\nBased on the spectra of hadrons we observe that their (modified) Regge\ntrajectories are characterized by a negative intercept. This implies a\nrepulsive Casimir force that gives the string a \"zero point length\". We fit the\ntheoretical decay width to experimental data for mesons on the trajectories of\n$\\rho$, $\\omega$, $\\pi$, $\\eta$, $K^*$, $\\phi$, $D$, and $D^*_s$, and of the\nbaryons $N$, $\\Delta$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Sigma$. We examine both the linearity\nin $L$ and the exponential suppression factor. The linearity was found to agree\nwith the data well for mesons but less for baryons. The extracted coefficient\nfor mesons $A=0.095\\pm0.015$ is indeed quite universal. The exponential\nsuppression was applied to both strong and radiative decays. We discuss the\nrelation with string fragmentation and jet formation. We extract the\nquark-diquark structure of baryons from their decays. A stringy mechanism for\nZweig suppressed decays of quarkonia is proposed and is shown to reproduce the\ndecay width of $\\Upsilon$ states. The dependence of the width on spin and\nflavor symmetry is discussed.

To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet.

This is dual to the gapped nature of\nthe thermal state in the IR. So one can say that by taking one kind of low\nenergy limit in the thermal CFT we are probing the near-singularity region. But\nthere is another more conventional low energy limit which corresponds to\nprobing the near-horizon region. Now, instead of one, if we think in terms of\nthese two low-energy limits and take into account the fact that in AdS-CFT the\nonly observables are CFT correlators then we can get a completely different\ninterpretation of the curvature singularity. In a nutshell, the very long\nwavelength degrees of freedom in the thermal CFT carry information of both the\nnear-horizon and the near-singularity regions, but, the field theory observer\ncannot, in principle, disentangle the information of the near-horizon region\nfrom the information of the near-singularity region using the the thermal CFT\ncorrelators. This can be interpreted as a very specific form of holographic\n\"non-locality\" in a black hole background which relates the \"inside and the\noutside\". We argue in the paper that owing to this \"non-locality\", the\nspace-like curvature singularity along with its problems, which are all local\nin nature, completely disappear from the theory or get dissolved. But, the same\n\"non-locality\" now tells us that some of the \"$e^{-S}$-effects\" that one finds,\nfor example, in the late time thermal two-point function, can be thought of as\ncarrying complete information about \"Planck-scale effects near the\nsingularity\". From the local EFT point of view this may be called\n\"UV-IR-mixing\" which is caused by the \"non-locality\". We also comment on its\nclose relation to black hole complementarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 18:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

As these planets are likely tidal-locked,\nimproved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to\nguide target selection. Here we use a 3-D climate system model, updated with\nnew water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database,\nto study ocean covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late-M to\nmid-K stars ($2600$ K <= Teff <= 4500K). Our results indicate that these\nupdated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to\nprevious studies, so the inner HZ around M-dwarfs is not as close as suggested\nby earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating planets with background 1 bar\nN2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with Teff > 3000K\nundergo the classical \"moist-greenhouse\" (H2O mixing ratio > 10-3 in the\nstratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (~ 280K) in our 3-D\nmodel compared with 1-D climate models (~ 340K). This implies that some planets\naround low mass stars can simultaneously undergo water-loss and remain\nhabitable. However, for star with Teff <= 3000K, planets at the inner HZ may\ndirectly transition to a runaway state, while bypassing the moist greenhouse\nwater-loss entirely. We analyze transmission spectra of planets in a moist\ngreen-house regime, and find that there are several prominent H2O features\nwithin JWST instruments range. Thus, relying only upon standard Earth-analog\nspectra with 24-hour rotation period around M-dwarfs for habitability studies\nwill miss the strong H2O features that one would expect to see on synchronously\nrotating planets around M-dwarf stars, with JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 18:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 16:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The stiff and propulsive human foot has\ntwo distinct arches, the longitudinal and transverse. By contrast, the feet of\nnon-human primates are flat and softer. Current understanding of foot stiffness\nis based on studies that focus solely on the longitudinal arch, and little is\nknown about the mechanical function of the transverse arch. However, common\nexperience suggests that transverse curvature dominates the stiffness; a\ndrooping dollar bill stiffens significantly upon curling it along the\ntransverse direction, not the longitudinal. We derive a normalized curvature\nparameter that encapsulates the geometric principle underlying the transverse\ncurvature-induced stiffness. We show that the transverse arch accounts for\nalmost all the difference in stiffness between human and monkey feet (vervet\nmonkeys and pig-tailed macaques) by comparing transverse curvature-based\npredictions against published data on foot stiffness. Using this functional\ninterpretation of the transverse arch, we trace the evolution of hominin feet\nand show that a human-like stiff foot likely predates Homo by $\\sim 1.5$\nmillion years, and appears in the $\\sim 3.4$ million year old fossil from\nBurtele.

A relevant compressibility measure for\nrepetitive texts is $r$, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform\n(BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length\nFM-index, used $O(r)$ space and was able to efficiently count the number of\noccurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in the text (in loglogarithmic time per\npattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the\npositions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of\n$r$. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures\nof repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size\nof the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton\nrecognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating,\nbut not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close\nthis long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so\nthat it can locate the $occ$ occurrences efficiently within $O(r)$ space (in\nloglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time $O(m+occ)$ within\n$O(r\\log(n/r))$ space, on a RAM machine of $w=\\Omega(\\log n)$ bits.

Methods: We used photospheric and\nX-ray data from the SoHO and Hinode spacecraft combined with tracking\nalgorithms to analyse the evolution of five network flares. The energy of the\nX-ray emitting thermal plasma is compared with an estimate of the energy built\nup due to converging and sheared flux. Results: Quiet-Sun network flares occur\nabove sites of converging opposite-polarity magnetic flux that are often found\non the outskirts of network cell junctions, sometimes with observable\nvortex-like motion. In all studied flares the thermal energy was more than an\norder of magnitude higher than the magnetic free energy of the converging flux\nmodel. The energy in the sheared field was always higher than in the converging\nflux but still lower than the thermal energy. Conclusions: X-ray network flares\noccur at sites of magnetic energy dissipation. The energy is probably built up\nby supergranular flows causing systematic shearing of the magnetic field. This\nprocess appears more efficient near the junction of the network lanes.

This improves over the previous $(1,4)$-approximation in the\nspecial case that $\\mathcal M$ is the graphic matroid over the given graph\n[Fukanaga and Nagamochi, 2009].\n  Second, we show Demand Matching admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme\nin graphs that exclude a fixed minor. If all demands are polynomially-bounded\nintegers, this is somewhat easy using dynamic programming in bounded-treewidth\ngraphs. Our main technical contribution is a sparsification lemma allowing us\nto scale the demands to be used in a more intricate dynamic programming\nalgorithm, followed by randomized rounding to filter our scaled-demand solution\nto a feasible solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 20:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

This\nhas been achieved due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into\naccount relationships between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the\ntext, which is able to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed\napproach has been illustrated through principal component analysis, a\ncomparison with the chance baseline method, and network visualization. Such\nvisualizations reveal individual characteristics of the authors, which can be\nunderstood as a kind of calligraphy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 23:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

First, we present \"discriminative rank pooling\" in\nwhich the shared weights of our video representation and the parameters of the\naction classifiers are estimated jointly for a given training dataset of\nlabelled vector sequences using a bilevel optimization formulation of the\nlearning problem. When the frame level features vectors are obtained from a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), we rank pool the network activations and\njointly estimate all parameters of the model, including CNN filters and\nfully-connected weights, in an end-to-end manner which we coined as \"end-to-end\ntrainable rank pooled CNN\". Importantly, this model can make use of any\nexisting convolutional neural network architecture (e.g., AlexNet or VGG)\nwithout modification or introduction of additional parameters. Then, we extend\nrank pooling to a high capacity video representation, called \"hierarchical rank\npooling\". Hierarchical rank pooling consists of a network of rank pooling\nfunctions, which encode temporal semantics over arbitrary long video clips\nbased on rich frame level features. By stacking non-linear feature functions\nand temporal sub-sequence encoders one on top of the other, we build a high\ncapacity encoding network of the dynamic behaviour of the video. The resulting\nvideo representation is a fixed-length feature vector describing the entire\nvideo clip that can be used as input to standard machine learning classifiers.\nWe demonstrate our approach on the task of action and activity recognition.\nObtained results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods on three important\nactivity recognition benchmarks with classification performance of 76.7% mAP on\nHollywood2, 69.4% on HMDB51, and 93.6% on UCF101.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 00:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

A versatile set of techniques for studying\nnon-Gaussian signals relies on the spectral representations of higher moments,\nknown as polyspectra, which describe forms of cross-frequency dependence that\ndo not arise in time-invariant Gaussian signals. The most commonly used of\nthese employ the bispectrum. Recently, other measures of cross-frequency\ndependence have drawn interest in EEG literature, in particular those which\naddress phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Here we demonstrate a close\nrelationship between the bispectrum and popular measures of PAC, which we\nrelate to smoothings of the signal bispectrum, making them fundamentally\nbispectral estimators. Viewed this way, however, conventional PAC measures\nexhibit some unfavorable qualities, including poor bias properties, lack of\ncorrect symmetry and artificial constraints on the spectral range and\nresolution of the estimate. Moreover, information obscured by smoothing in\nmeasures of PAC, but preserved in standard bispectral estimators, may be\ncritical for distinguishing nested oscillations from transient signal features\nand other non-oscillatory causes of \"spurious\" PAC. We propose guidelines for\ngauging the nature and origin of cross-frequency coupling with bispectral\nstatistics. Beyond clarifying the relationship between PAC and the bispectrum,\nthe present work lays out a general framework for the interpretation of the\nbispectrum, which extends to other higher-order spectra. In particular, this\nframework holds promise for the detailed identification of signal features\nrelated to both nested oscillations and transient phenomena. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of some broader theoretical implications of this framework and\nhighlight promising directions for future development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 02:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 19:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Design engineers currently choose the refrigerant circuitry\naccording to their experience and heat exchanger simulations. However, the\ndesign of an optimized refrigerant circuitry is difficult. The number of\nrefrigerant circuitry candidates is enormous. Therefore, exhaustive search\nalgorithms cannot be used and intelligent techniques must be developed to\nexplore the solution space efficiently. In this paper, we formulate refrigerant\ncircuitry design as a binary constrained optimization problem. We use\nCoilDesigner, a simulation and design tool of air to refrigerant heat\nexchangers, in order to simulate the performance of different refrigerant\ncircuitry designs. We treat CoilDesigner as a black-box system since the exact\nrelationship of the objective function with the decision variables is not\nexplicit. Derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms are suitable for\nsolving this black-box model since they do not require explicit functional\nrepresentations of the objective function and the constraints. The aim of this\npaper is twofold. First, we compare four mixed-integer constrained DFO solvers\nand one box-bounded DFO solver and evaluate their ability to solve a difficult\nindustrially relevant problem. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed\nformulation is suitable for optimizing the circuitry configuration of heat\nexchangers. We apply the DFO solvers to 17 heat exchanger design problems.\nResults show that TOMLAB/glcDirect and TOMLAB/glcSolve can find optimal or\nnear-optimal refrigerant circuitry designs after a relatively small number of\ncircuit simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 02:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Objective: We employ a novel mathematical model of norovirus\ntransmission, and fit the model to daily incidence data from a major norovirus\noutbreak on a cruise ship, and examine the relative efficacy of potential\ncontrol strategies aimed at reducing environmental and/or direct transmission.\nResults: The reproduction number for environmental and direct transmission\ncombined is Rtot = 11.0 [9.4,15.6], and of environmental transmission alone is\nRenviron = 0.85 [0.18,2.04].

The crosstalk cancellation algorithm uses an adaptive\nnon-diagonal preprocessing matrix prior to a conventional LMS crosstalk\ncanceler.

The Deep-LMS is important for crosstalk cancellation in the novel\nG.fast standard, where traditional LMS converges very slowly due to the\nill-conditioned covariance matrix of the received signal at the extended\nbandwidth.

Ab initio theoretical\ncalculations aimed at resolving this issue face unique challenges in the\nrelevant high-density domain, which reaches beyond the saturation density of\nsymmetrical nuclear matter. These issues include uncertainties in the\nthree-nucleon (3N) interaction and in the effects of strong short-range\ncorrelations -- and more generally of in-medium modification of nucleonic\nself-energies and interactions. A survey of existing solutions to the gap\nequations in the triplet channel shows that the separate or combined impacts of\n3N forces, coupled channels, and mass renormalization range from moderate to\nstrong to devastating, thus motivating a detailed analysis of the competing\neffects. In the present work we track the effects of the 3N force and in-medium\nmodifications in the representative case of the $^3P_2$ channel, based on the\nArgonne V18 two-nucleon (2N) interaction supplemented by 3N interactions of the\nUrbana IX family. Sensitivity of the results to the input interaction is\nclearly demonstrated, while consistency issues arise with respect to the\nsimultaneous treatment of 3N forces and in-medium effects.

This\nhas been shown to provide optimal throughput from an information theoretic\npoint of view.We consider a realistic system model and characterise the system\nperformance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency in a NOMA scenario\nwith a random packet arrival model, where we also derive the stability\ncondition for the system to guarantee the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 06:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

The approach is based on the idea that classification can be\nunderstood as supervised clustering, where a quantum entropy in the context of\nthe quantum probabilistic model, will be used as a \"capturer\" (measure, or\nexternal index), of the \"natural structure\" of the data. By using quantum\nentropy we do not make any assumption about linear separability of the data\nthat are going to be classified. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a\nquery sample and then use relative change in the quantum entropy as a measure\nof similarity of the newly arrived sample with the representatives of interest.\nIn other words, method is based on calculation of quantum entropy of the\nreferent system and its relative change with the addition of the newly arrived\nsample. Referent system consists of vectors that represent individual classes\nand that are the most similar, in Euclidean distance sense, to the vector that\nis analyzed. Here, we analyze the classification problem in the context of\nmeasuring similarities to prototype examples of categories. While nearest\nneighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem\nof high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited\nsampling. Alternatively, one could use machine learning techniques (like\nsupport vector machines) but they involve time-consuming optimization.

The high-angular-resolution capability of the new-generation\nground-based adaptive-optics camera SPHERE at ESO VLT allows us to assess, for\nthe very first time, the cratering record of medium-sized (D~100-200 km)\nasteroids from the ground, opening the prospect of a new era of investigation\nof the asteroid belt's collisional history. Aims. We investigate here the\ncollisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may\nbe the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites\nfound on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as\npart of the science verification of the instrument. Combined with earlier\nadaptive-optics images and optical light curves, we model the spin and\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape of Hebe and check the consistency of the derived\nmodel against available stellar occultations and thermal measurements. Results.\nOur 3D shape model fits the images with sub-pixel residuals and the light\ncurves to 0.02 mag. The rotation period (7.274 47 h), spin (343 deg,+47 deg),\nand volume-equivalent diameter (193 +/- 6km) are consistent with previous\ndeterminations and thermophysical modeling. Hebe's inferred density is 3.48 +/-\n0.64 g.cm-3 , in agreement with an intact interior based on its H-chondrite\ncomposition. Using the 3D shape model to derive the volume of the largest\ndepression (likely impact crater), it appears that the latter is significantly\nsmaller than the total volume of close-by S-type H-chondrite-like asteroid\nfamilies. Conclusions. Our results imply that (6) Hebe is not the most likely\nsource of H chondrites. Over the coming years, our team will collect similar\nhigh-precision shape measurements with VLT/SPHERE for ~40 asteroids covering\nthe main compositional classes, thus providing an unprecedented dataset to\ninvestigate the origin and collisional evolution of the asteroid belt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 09:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Thanks to helioseismology, rotation in the Sun is\ncharacterized well, but the interior rotation profiles of other Sun-like stars\nare not so well constrained. Until recently, measurements of rotation in\nSun-like stars have focused on the mean rotation, but little progress has been\nmade on measuring or even placing limits on differential rotation. Using\nasteroseismic measurements of rotation we aim to constrain the radial shear in\nfive Sun-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission: KIC004914923,\nKIC005184732, KIC006116048, KIC006933899, and KIC010963065. We used stellar\nstructure models for these five stars from previous works. These models provide\nthe mass density, mode eigenfunctions, and the convection zone depth, which we\nused to compute the sensitivity kernels for the rotational frequency splitting\nof the modes. We used these kernels as weights in a parametric model of the\nstellar rotation profile of each star, where we allowed different rotation\nrates for the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This parametric\nmodel was incorporated into a fit to the oscillation power spectrum of each of\nthe five Kepler stars. This fit included a prior on the rotation of the\nenvelope, estimated from the rotation of surface magnetic activity measured\nfrom the photometric variability. The asteroseismic measurements without the\napplication of priors are unable to place meaningful limits on the radial\nshear. Using a prior on the envelope rotation enables us to constrain the\ninterior rotation rate and thus the radial shear. In the five cases that we\nstudied, the interior rotation rate does not differ from the envelope by more\nthan approximately +/-30%. Uncertainties in the rotational splittings are too\nlarge to unambiguously determine the sign of the radial shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 09:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

For a neutral vector variable, which is not\nmultivariate Gaussian distributed, the conventional principal component\nanalysis (PCA) cannot yield mutually independent scalar variables. With the two\nproposed transformations, a highly negatively correlated neutral vector can be\ntransformed to a set of mutually independent scalar variables with the same\ndegrees of freedom. We also evaluate the decorrelation performances for the\nvectors generated from a single Dirichlet distribution and a mixture of\nDirichlet distributions. The mutual independence is verified with the distance\ncorrelation measurement. The advantages of the proposed decorrelation\nstrategies are intensively studied and demonstrated with synthesized data and\npractical application evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 09:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

We estimate the size\ndistribution index from available information on family members; model the\norbital dispersion of collisional fragments; and carry out a formal calculation\nof the collisional lifetime as a function of size. We find that, as initially\nconjectured by Rivkin et al (2003), the collisional lifetime of objects the\nsize of (5261) Eureka is at least a few Gyr, significantly longer than for\nsimilar-sized Main Belt asteroids. In contrast, the observed degree of orbital\ncompactness is inconsistent with all but the least energetic family-forming\ncollisions. Therefore, the family asteroids may be ejecta from a cratering\nevent sometime in the past ~1 Gyr if the orbits are gradually dispersed by\ngravitational diffusion and the Yarkovsky effect (Cuk et al, 2015). The\ncomparable sizes of the largest family members require either negligible target\nstrength or a particular impact geometry under this scenario (Durda et al,\n2007; Benavidez et al, 2012). Alternatively, the family may have formed by a\nseries of YORP-induced fission events (Pravec.et.al, 2010). The shallow size\ndistribution of the family is similar to that of small MBAs (Gladman et al,\n2009) interpreted as due to the dominance of this mechanism for\nEureka-family-sized asteroids (Jacobson et al, 2014). However, our population\nindex estimate is likely a lower limit due to the small available number of\nfamily asteroids and observational incompleteness. Future searches for fainter\nfamily members, further observational characterisation of the known Trojans'\nphysical properties as well as orbital and rotational evolution modelling will\nhelp distinguish between different formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 10:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

On the other hand, the one-component jet approaches are\nheavily challenged by the various observed properties of plasmoids in radio\njets (knots), often associated with internal shocks. Given that such a\ntransverse stratification plays an important role on the jets acceleration,\nstability, and interaction with the external medium, it should also induce\ninternal shocks with various strengths and configurations, able to describe the\nobserved knots behaviours. By establishing a relation between the transverse\nstratification of the jets, the internal shock properties, and the multiple\nobserved AGN jet morphologies and behaviours, our aim is to provide a\nconsistent global scheme of the various AGN jet structures. Working on a large\nsample of AGN radio jets monitored in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)\nby the MOJAVE collaboration, we determined the consistency of a systematic\nassociation of the multiple knots with successive re-collimation shocks. We\nthen investigated the re-collimation shock formation and the influence of\ndifferent transverse stratified structures by parametrically exploring the two\nrelativistic outflow components with the specific relativistic hydrodynamic\n(SRHD) code AMRVAC. We were able to link the different spectral classes of AGN\nwith specific stratified jet characteristics, in good accordance with their\nVLBI radio properties and their accretion regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 11:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

As\nthe current-voltage pairs depend nonlinearly on the conductivity, impedance\ntomography leads to a nonlinear inverse problem. Often, the forward problem is\nlinearized with respect to the conductivity and the resulting linear inverse\nproblem is regarded as a subproblem in an iterative algorithm or as a simple\nreconstruction method as such. In this paper, we compare this basic\nlinearization approach to linearizations with respect to the resistivity or the\nlogarithm of the conductivity. It is numerically demonstrated that the\nconductivity linearization often results in compromised accuracy in both\nforward and inverse computations. Inspired by these observations, we present\nand analyze a new linearization technique which is based on the logarithm of\nthe Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. The method is directly applicable to\ndiscrete settings, including the complete electrode model. We also consider\nFr\\'echet derivatives of the logarithmic operators.

Algorithms for this problem necessarily admit the\nsource image characteristics along with focused and blurred features. However,\nmost sparsity-based approaches use a single dictionary in focused feature space\nto describe multi-focus images, and ignore the representations in blurred\nfeature space. We propose a multi-focus image fusion approach based on sparse\nrepresentation using a coupled dictionary. It exploits the observations that\nthe patches from a given training set can be sparsely represented by a couple\nof overcomplete dictionaries related to the focused and blurred categories of\nimages and that a sparse approximation based on such coupled dictionary leads\nto a more flexible and therefore better fusion strategy than the one based on\njust selecting the sparsest representation in the original image estimate.

The first one exploits that the BTZ\nblack hole belongs to the spectrum of Brown-Henneaux as well as soft hairy\nboundary conditions, so that the respective log corrections are related through\na suitable change of the thermodynamic ensemble. In the second approach the\nanalogue of modular invariance is considered for dual theories with anisotropic\nscaling of Lifshitz type with dynamical exponent z at the boundary. On the\ngravity side such scalings arise for KdV-type boundary conditions, which\nprovide a specific 1-parameter family of multi-trace deformations of the usual\nAdS3/CFT2 setup, with Brown-Henneaux corresponding to z=1 and soft hairy\nboundary conditions to the limiting case z=0.

Finally, for soft hairy boundary\nconditions we show that not only the leading term, but also the log corrections\nto the entropy of black flowers endowed with affine u(1) soft hair charges\nexclusively depend on the zero modes and hence coincide with the ones for BTZ\nblack holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 13:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 16:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

Monte Carlo methods have enabled nuclear reaction rates from\nuncertain inputs to be presented in a statistically meaningful manner. However,\nthese uncertainties are currently computed assuming no correlations between the\nphysical quantities that enter those calculations. This is not always an\nappropriate assumption. Astrophysically important reactions are often dominated\nby resonances, whose properties are usually normalized to a well-known\nreference resonance. This insight provides a basis from which to develop a\nflexible framework for including correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate\ncalculations. Aims. The aim of this work is to develop and test a method for\nincluding correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate calculations when the input\nhas been normalized to a common reference. Methods. A mathematical framework is\ndeveloped for including correlations between input parameters in Monte Carlo\nreaction rate calculations. The magnitude of those correlations is calculated\nfrom the uncertainties typically reported in experimental papers, where full\ncorrelation information is not available. The method is applied to four\nillustrative examples: a fictional 3-resonance reaction,\n$^{27}$Al(p,$\\gamma$)$^{28}$Si, $^{23}$Na(p,$\\alpha$)$^{20}$Ne, and\n$^{23}$Na($\\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al. Results. Reaction rates at low temperatures\nthat are dominated by a few isolated resonances are found to minimally impacted\nby correlation effects. However, reaction rates determined from many\noverlapping resonances can be significantly affected. Uncertainties in the\n$^{23}$Na($\\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al reaction, for example, increase by up to a\nfactor of 5. This highlights the need to take correlation effects into account\nin reaction rate calculations, and provide insight into which cases are\nexpected to be most affected by them. The impact of correlation effects on\nnucleosynthesis is also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 13:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 17:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

This is also called \\emph{real-time\nbidding} (RTB) and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher's\nbenefit is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However, the\nbenefits of the other two stakeholders -- the advertiser and the user -- have\nbeen rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational\nframework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all\nstakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage\nre-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric\nvariables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad\nmemorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and\nthe visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\noptimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia\nmetrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the\nmetric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to\nvalidate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the\npublisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by\nslightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers\nand users will be more engaged, the increased demand of advertising and the\nincreased supply of page views can then boost the publisher's revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 13:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 10:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 11:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

However, this is non-trivial due\nto the need for jointly learning underlying correlations between heterogeneous\nvisual and tag data. The task is made more challenging by inherently sparse and\nincomplete tags. In this work, we develop a method for modelling the inherent\nvisual data concept structures based on a novel Hierarchical-Multi-Label Random\nForest model capable of correlating structured visual and tag information so as\nto more accurately interpret the visual semantics, e.g. disclosing meaningful\nvisual groups with similar high-level concepts, and recovering missing tags for\nindividual visual data samples. Specifically, our model exploits hierarchically\nstructured tags of different semantic abstractness and multiple tag statistical\ncorrelations in addition to modelling visual and tag interactions. As a result,\nour model is able to discover more accurate semantic correlation between\ntextual tags and visual features, and finally providing favourable visual\nsemantics interpretation even with highly sparse and incomplete tags.

A spectrum representing the\ndifference between the opaque core of the cloud and several unobscured\npositions around the cloud was presented in Paper I (Mattila et al. 2017a). The\ntopic of the present paper is the separation of the scattered starlight from\nthe dark cloud itself which is the only remaining foreground component in this\ndifference. While the scattered starlight spectrum has the characteristic\nFraunhofer lines and the discontinuity at 400 nm, typical of integrated light\nof galaxies, the EBL spectrum is a smooth one without these features. As\ntemplate for the scattered starlight we make use of the spectra at two\nsemi-transparent positions. The resulting EBL intensity at 400 nm is $I_{\\rm\nEBL} = 2.9\\pm1.1$ $10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$, or\n$11.6\\pm4.4$ nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$, which represents a 2.6$\\sigma$ detection;\nthe scaling uncertainty is +20%/-16%.

If strong nodes cannot fail, this leads to power law\ndistributions of failure sizes with so-called \"Black Swan\" rare events. In\ncontrast, if strong nodes fail once a sufficient fraction of their neighbors\nfail, this leads to \"Dragon Kings\", which are massive failures caused by\nmechanisms distinct from smaller failures. In our model, we find that once an\ninitial failure size is above a critical value, the Dragon King mechanism kicks\nin, leading to piggybacking system-wide failures. We demonstrate that the size\nof the initial failed weak cluster predicts the likelihood of a Dragon King\nevent with high accuracy and we develop a simple control strategy which also\nreveals that a random upgrade can inadvertently make the system more\nvulnerable.

Due to the longer range coulomb repulsion between protons,\nthe system has structural inhomogeneities. Several interactions tailored to\nreproduce nuclear matter plus screened Coulomb term reproduce these\ninhomogeneities known as nuclear pasta. These structural inhomogeneities,\nlocated in the crust of neutron stars, can also arise in expanding systems\ndepending on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...)\nand the expansion velocity. Purpose: We aim to find the dynamics of the\nfragments formation for expanding systems simulated according to the little big\nbang model. This expansion resembles the evolution of neutron stars merger.\nMethod: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with semiclassical molecular\ndynamics models. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the\nsystem homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very\nlow final densities). We study, with four different cluster recognition\nalgorithms, the fragment distribution throughout this expansion and the\ndynamics of the cluster formation. Results: Studying the topology of the\nequilibrium states, before the expansion, we reproduced the known pasta phases\nplus a novel phase we called pregnocchi, consisting of proton aggregates\nembedded in a neutron sea. We have identified different fragmentation regimes,\ndepending on the initial temperature and fragment velocity.

Even if\none robot were to slip and fall, the system would be held up with multiple\nattachment points much like a professional alpine climber. We analyzed and\nperformed detailed simulations of the design configuration space to identify an\noptimal system design that trades off climbing performance with risk of\nfalling. Our results identify a system of 4 robots is best suited when enabling\nsingle-robot climbs, while a system of 6 robots are suited when two robots\nclimb simultaneously. The results show a pathway towards demonstration of the\nsystem on real robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 23:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 01:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

We present a novel algorithm,\ncalled 2-DifViz, that converts the hand movements in air (captured by a\nMyo-armband worn by a user) into a sequence of x, y coordinates on a 2D\nCartesian plane, and visualizes them on a canvas. Existing sensor-based\napproaches either do not provide visual feedback or represent the recognized\ncharacters using prefixed templates. In contrast, AirScript stands out by\ngiving freedom of movement to the user, as well as by providing a real-time\nvisual feedback of the written characters, making the interaction natural.\nAirScript provides a recognition module to predict the content of the document\ncreated in air. To do so, we present a novel approach based on deep learning,\nwhich uses the sensor data and the visualizations created by 2-DifViz. The\nrecognition module consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks. The output from these three networks is\nfused to get the final prediction about the characters written in air.\nAirScript can be used in highly sophisticated environments like a smart\nclassroom, a smart factory or a smart laboratory, where it would enable people\nto annotate pieces of texts wherever they want without any reference surface.\nWe have evaluated AirScript against various well-known learning models (HMM,\nKNN, SVM, etc.) on the data of 12 participants. Evaluation results show that\nthe recognition module of AirScript largely outperforms all of these models by\nachieving an accuracy of 91.7% in a person independent evaluation and a 96.7%\naccuracy in a person dependent evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 12:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

AM is extremely useful for making prototypes and has\ndemonstrated the ability to manufacture complex parts not possible (or\nprohibitively expensive) with conventional machining. Scientists and\nmanufactures are finding increased uses for AM in creation of all types of\nfinished products including those built from polymers, biological material, and\nmetals. Although companies such as GE have been using 3D printing for Additive\nManufacturing for over thirty years to make mandrels for light bulb\nmanufacturing, application areas of Additive Manufacturing have increased\nsubstantially in recent years, particularly due to the reduction in cost of 3D\nprinters. Like most emergent technologies, there are bound to be growing pains\nwith AM. This paper looks at the software that supports AM and 3D printing and\ntheir vulnerability to cyber-attacks, intellectual property theft, defect rates\nof AM software (which can cause undesired consequences themselves and also\ncreate vulnerabilities that a hacker may exploit), part reliability and safety\nof devices incorporating 3D printed parts (when making mission critical parts),\nand security/throughput issues of computer networks. Literature searches,\nconsulting with technical experts and a relatively new hazard analysis\ntechnique will be used, one especially developed for software intensive systems\ncalled Systemic Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). The purpose of this white\npaper is to identify risks (or hazards for mission critical parts) for AM in\nthis emergent stage so that mitigations can be applied before accidents occur.\nA second purpose of this white paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of STPA\nas a hazard analysis technique in a field that is still relatively new.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}
