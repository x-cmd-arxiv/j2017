The quantum\nmemory uses the eigenmodes of a linear array of coupled superconducting\nresonators.

Given infrastructure costs and the stochastic nature of\nmobile services' spatial loads, it is highly desirable to achieve efficient\nstatistical multiplexing amongst such slices. We study a simple dynamic\nresource sharing policy which allocates a 'share' of a pool of (distributed)\nresources to each slice-Share Constrained Proportionally Fair (SCPF). We give a\ncharacterization of SCPF's performance gains over static slicing and general\nprocessor sharing. We show that higher gains are obtained when a slice's\nspatial load is more 'imbalanced' than, and/or 'orthogonal' to, the aggregate\nnetwork load, and that the overall gain across slices is positive. We then\naddress the associated dimensioning problem. Under SCPF, traditional network\ndimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem, which\ncharacterizes the existence of a feasible share allocation given slices'\nexpected loads and performance requirements. We provide a solution to robust\nshare dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing. Slices may wish to\nunilaterally manage their users' performance via admission control which\nmaximizes their carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this\ncan be modeled as a 'traffic shaping' game with an achievable Nash equilibrium.\nUnder high loads, the equilibrium is explicitly characterized, as are the gains\nin the carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing.

The system shows emission from radio to X-rays, likely dominated\nby synchrotron radiation. The mechanism that produces most of this emission\nremains unclear. Two competing scenarios have been proposed: Collimated\noutflows, and direct interaction between the magnetospheres of the white dwarf\nand the M star. The two proposed scenarios can be tested via very long baseline\ninterferometric radio observations. We conducted a radio observation with the\nAustralian Long Baseline Array (LBA) on 20 Oct 2016 at 8.5 GHz to study the\ncompactness of the radio emission. Simultaneous data with the Australian\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA) were also recorded for a direct comparison of\nthe obtained flux densities. AR Sco shows radio emission compact on\nmilliarcsecond angular scales ($\\lesssim 0.02\\ \\mathrm{AU}$, or $4\\\n\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$). The emission is orbitally modulated, with an average flux\ndensity of $\\approx 6.5\\ \\mathrm{mJy}$. A comparison with the simultaneous ATCA\ndata shows that no flux is resolved out on mas scales, implying that the radio\nemission is produced in this compact region. Additionally, the obtained radio\nlight curves on hour timescales are consistent with the optical light curve.\nThe radio emission in AR Sco is likely produced in the magnetosphere of the M\nstar or the white dwarf, and we see no evidence for a radio outflow or\ncollimated jets significantly contributing to the radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 17:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The gas clumping-corrected\ngas fraction is significantly lower than the cosmological baryon budget. These\nresults may indicate a larger impact of the gas inhomogeneities with respect to\nthe prediction from hydrodynamic numerical simulations, and we discuss possible\nexplanations for our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Virtually all current models of exoplanetary\ntransmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the\nspectrum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as\nmolecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model\nthe observations using a coupled stellar-planetary radiative transfer model\ncalculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the\nobserved resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf\nand planetary lines at high spectral resolution can bias the modeled amplitude\nof the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is\ntoo strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1b, as\nobserved using HST/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 parts-per-million,\n12% of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will\nhave access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically\nstronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently\npossible.

For instance, the\npresence of a classical bulge suggests a relatively violent history, in\ncontrast, the presence of simply an inner disc (also referred to as a\n\"pseudobulge\") indicates the occurrence of secular evolution processes in the\nmain disc. However, we still lack criteria to effectively categorise bulges,\nlimiting our ability to study their impact on the evolution of the host\ngalaxies. Here we present a recipe to separate inner discs from classical\nbulges by combining four different parameters from photometric and kinematic\nanalyses: The bulge S\\'ersic index $n_\\mathrm{b}$, the concentration index\n$C_{20,50}$, the Kormendy (1977) relation and the inner slope of the radial\nvelocity dispersion profile $\\nabla\\sigma$. With that recipe we provide a\ndetailed bulge classification for a sample of 45 galaxies from the\nintegral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. To aid in categorising bulges\nwithin these galaxies, we perform 2D image decomposition to determine bulge\nS\\'ersic index, bulge-to-total light ratio, surface brightness and effective\nradius of the bulge and use growth curve analysis to derive a new concentration\nindex, $C_{20,50}$. We further extract the stellar kinematics from CALIFA data\ncubes and analyse the radial velocity dispersion profile. The results of the\ndifferent approaches are in good agreement and allow a safe classification for\napproximately $95\\%$ of the galaxies. In particular, we show that our new\n\"inner\" concentration index performs considerably better than the traditionally\nused $C_{50,90}$ when yielding the nature of bulges.

In\ncontrast, we consider a method based on estimating the signal directly, using\nfeatures of the signal that are invariant under translations. Specifically, we\nestimate the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the signal from the\nobservations. Under mild assumptions, these invariant features contain enough\ninformation to infer the signal. In particular, the bispectrum can be used to\nestimate the Fourier phases.

Because the time\ninterval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer\ntimescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will\ncross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are\ninevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical\ncollisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,\nprimarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial\nseparation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries\n(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation.

The [NII] 122/[CII] ratio is correlated with UV colors and\nthere is a strong anti-correlation of [CII]/FIR with NUV-K seen in both spirals\nand ETGs, likely due to a softer radiation field with fewer photons available\nto ionize carbon and heat the gas.

However,\nsimilarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many\nfactors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of\ndata, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not\nsuitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition,\nnonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has\nnot been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two\nchallenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix\nand similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show\ntheoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering\nmethods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most\nsuitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model\nwith a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can\nautomatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator\nmatrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of\nmultiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks\nin a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the\nresults of the others towards an overall optimal solution.

However, large-scale universal quantum computers are\nyet to be built. Boson sampling is a rudimentary quantum algorithm tailored to\nthe platform of photons in linear optics, which has sparked interest as a rapid\nway to demonstrate this quantum supremacy. Photon statistics are governed by\nintractable matrix functions known as permanents, which suggests that sampling\nfrom the distribution obtained by injecting photons into a linear-optical\nnetwork could be solved more quickly by a photonic experiment than by a\nclassical computer. The contrast between the apparently awesome challenge faced\nby any classical sampling algorithm and the apparently near-term experimental\nresources required for a large boson sampling experiment has raised\nexpectations that quantum supremacy by boson sampling is on the horizon. Here\nwe present classical boson sampling algorithms and theoretical analyses of\nprospects for scaling boson sampling experiments, showing that near-term\nquantum supremacy via boson sampling is unlikely. While the largest boson\nsampling experiments reported so far are with 5 photons, our classical\nalgorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling (MIS), allowed the boson\nsampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware.\nWe argue that the impact of experimental photon losses means that demonstrating\nquantum supremacy by boson sampling would require a step change in technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 19:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

In this article, a MEC enabled multi-cell wireless network is considered\nwhere each Base Station (BS) is equipped with a MEC server that can assist\nmobile users in executing computation-intensive tasks via task offloading. The\nproblem of Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation (JTORA) is studied in\norder to maximize the users' task offloading gains, which is measured by the\nreduction in task completion time and energy consumption. The considered\nproblem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP) that\ninvolves jointly optimizing the task offloading decision, uplink transmission\npower of mobile users, and computing resource allocation at the MEC servers.\nDue to the NP-hardness of this problem, solving for optimal solution is\ndifficult and impractical for a large-scale network. To overcome this drawback,\nour approach is to decompose the original problem into (i) a Resource\nAllocation (RA) problem with fixed task offloading decision and (ii) a Task\nOffloading (TO) problem that optimizes the optimal-value function corresponding\nto the RA problem. We address the RA problem using convex and quasi-convex\noptimization techniques, and propose a novel heuristic algorithm to the TO\nproblem that achieves a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical\nsimulation results show that our algorithm performs closely to the optimal\nsolution and that it significantly improves the users' offloading utility over\ntraditional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 20:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The low mass of\nthe black hole despite the high stellar density suggests that the gas liberated\nby stellar interactions was primarily at early cosmic times when the low-mass\nblack hole had a small Eddington luminosity. This is at least partly driven by\na top-heavy stellar initial mass function at early cosmic times which is an\nefficient producer of stellar mass black holes.

To study the dependence\nof observed spectral lines on total infrared luminosity, the sources in a\nsubset of the redshift bins are stacked in luminosity bins. These stacked\nspectra are used to determine the average properties of the interstellar medium\nand dense molecular gas properties of DSFGs, in particular, the fine-structure\nline ([CII] 158 $\\mu$m and [OI] 63 $\\mu$m) luminosity ratios, and the line to\nfar-IR luminosity ratios are used to model the gas density and radiation field\nstrength in the photodissociation regions (PDRs).

The other long-proposed compass protein is cryptochrome\n(Cry) with a mechanism of forming singlet-triplet radical pairs.

This task is challenging\ndue to high dimensional features and correlated labels. Multi-label text\nclassifiers need to be carefully regularized to prevent the severe over-fitting\nin the high dimensional space, and also need to take into account label\ndependencies in order to make accurate predictions under uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate significant and practical improvement by carefully regularizing the\nmodel complexity during training phase, and also regularizing the label search\nspace during prediction phase. Specifically, we regularize the classifier\ntraining using Elastic-net (L1+L2) penalty for reducing model complexity/size,\nand employ early stopping to prevent overfitting. At prediction time, we apply\nsupport inference to restrict the search space to label sets encountered in the\ntraining set, and F-optimizer GFM to make optimal predictions for the F1\nmetric. We show that although support inference only provides density\nestimations on existing label combinations, when combined with GFM predictor,\nthe algorithm can output unseen label combinations. Taken collectively, our\nexperiments show state of the art results on many benchmark datasets. Beyond\nperformance and practical contributions, we make some interesting observations.\nContrary to the prior belief, which deems support inference as purely an\napproximate inference procedure, we show that support inference acts as a\nstrong regularizer on the label prediction structure. It allows the classifier\nto take into account label dependencies during prediction even if the\nclassifiers had not modeled any label dependencies during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 23:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network\nand exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication\nprocess multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT)\nbrings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security\nrequirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish\nmultiple concurrent secure data sessions.

Each sensor makes a scalar noisy observation of the\nunknown vector, quantizes its observation, maps it to a digitally modulated\nsymbol, and transmits the symbol over orthogonal power-constrained fading\nchannels to a fusion center (FC). The FC is tasked with fusing the received\nsignals from sensors and estimating the unknown vector.

We formulate two constrained optimization\nproblems, namely maximizing trace and log-determinant of Bayesian FIM under\nnetwork transmit power constraint, with sensors transmit powers being the\noptimization variables. We show that for coherent receiver, these problems are\nconcave. However, for noncoherent receivers, they are not necessarily concave.\nThe solution to the trace of Bayesian FIM maximization problem can be\nimplemented in a distributed fashion. We numerically investigate how the\nFIM-max power allocation across sensors depends on the sensors observation\nqualities and physical layer parameters as well as the network transmit power\nconstraint.

These comparisons illustrate that, although the WWB\nis tighter than the inverse of Bayesian FIM, it is still suitable to use\nFIM-max schemes, since the performance loss in terms of the MSE of the LMMSE\nestimator is not significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 05:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 21:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 20:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 17:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 05:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

However, the process of\na complete characterization of quantum states, known as quantum state\ntomography, is a resource-consuming operation in general.

Larson and Loschky (2009) showed that peripheral vision\ncontributes more than central vision in obtaining maximum scene recognition\naccuracy. However, central vision is more efficient for scene recognition than\nperipheral, based on the amount of visual area needed for accurate recognition.\nIn this study, we model and explain the results of Larson and Loschky (2009)\nusing a neurocomputational modeling approach. We show that the advantage of\nperipheral vision in scene recognition, as well as the efficiency advantage for\ncentral vision, can be replicated using state-of-the-art deep neural network\nmodels. In addition, we propose and provide support for the hypothesis that the\nperipheral advantage comes from the inherent usefulness of peripheral features.\nThis result is consistent with data presented by Thibaut, Tran, Szaffarczyk,\nand Boucart (2014), who showed that patients with central vision loss can still\ncategorize natural scenes efficiently. Furthermore, by using a deep\nmixture-of-experts model (\"The Deep Model,\" or TDM) that receives central and\nperipheral visual information on separate channels simultaneously, we show that\nthe peripheral advantage emerges naturally in the learning process: When\ntrained to categorize scenes, the model weights the peripheral pathway more\nthan the central pathway. As we have seen in our previous modeling work,\nlearning creates a transform that spreads different scene categories into\ndifferent regions in representational space. Finally, we visualize the features\nfor the two pathways, and find that different preferences for scene categories\nemerge for the two pathways during the training process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 06:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The\npurpose of this paper is to consider two open problems under some conjectures.\nOne is that whether all zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are simple or not.\nThe other problem is that whether $M(x) \\ll x^{1/2}$ holds or not. First, we\nconsider the former problem. It is known that the assertion $M(x) =\no(x^{1/2}\\log{x})$ is a sufficient condition for the proof of the simplicity of\nzeros. However, proving this assertion is presently difficult.%at present.\nTherefore, we consider another sufficient condition for the simplicity of zeros\nthat is weaker than the above assertion in terms of the Riesz mean $M_{\\tau}(x)\n= {\\Gamma(1+\\tau)}^{-1}\\sum_{n \\leq x}\\mu(n)(1 - \\frac{n}{x})^{\\tau}$.

This conjecture also gives a sufficient condition, which seems easier to\napproach, for the simplicity of zeros. Next, we consider the latter problem.\nMany mathematicians believe that the estimate $ M(x) \\ll x^{1/2}$ fails, but\nthis is not yet disproved.

However NMT systems with\ndeep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe\ngradient diffusion due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often\nmake the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose\nnovel linear associative units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length\ninside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit\nand GRU), LAUs utilizes linear associative connections between input and output\nof the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both\nspace and time direction.

This is a\nchallenging problem because each image can contain many candidate object\nlocations which partially overlaps the object of interest.

In this paper, we present new sufficient\nconditions for packing circles into square and triangular containers, using\nonly the sum of the circles' areas: For square containers, it is possible to\npack any set of circles with a combined area of up to approximately 53.90% of\nthe square's area. And when the container is a right or obtuse triangle, any\nset of circles whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle can\nbe packed.\n  These area conditions are tight, in the sense that for any larger areas,\nthere are sets of circles which cannot be packed.

Mating preference for\ndifferent phenotypes can lead to the emergence and persistence of\ndifferentiated populations. Dominance between alleles encoding for divergent\nphenotypes can interfere in such processes. Using a diploid model of trait\ndetermining both mating success and migration rate, we explored differentiation\nbetween two connected populations, assuming either co-dominance or strict\ndominance between alleles. The model assumes that individuals prefer mating\nwith partners displaying the same phenotype and therefore tend to move to the\nother population when their own phenotype is rare. We show that the emergence\nof differentiated populations in this diploid model is limited as compared to\nresults obtained with the same model assuming haploidy. When assuming\nco-dominance, differentiation arises only when migration is limited as compared\nto preference. Such differentiation is less dependent on migration when\nassuming strict dominance between haplotypes. Dominant alleles frequently\ninvade populations because their phenotype is more frequently expressed,\nresulting in higher mating success and rapid decrease in migration. However,\ndepending on the initial distribution of alleles, this advantage associated\nwith dominance (i.e. Haldane's sieve) may lead to fixation of the dominant\nallele throughout both populations. Depending on the initial distribution of\nheterozygotes, persistence of polymorphisms within populations can also occur\nbecause heterozygotes displaying the predominant phenotype benefit from mating\npreferences. Altogether, our results highlight that heterozygotes' behaviour\nhas a strong impact on population differentiation and stress out the need of\ndiploid models of differentiation and speciation driven by natural and sexual\nselection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 12:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 20:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

The Navier-Stokes equation in its known form rests upon the\ntacit assumption that the particles are points without volume and without\ncollective forces between them, whereby dense gases and liquids are excluded,\nand the applicability limited to ideal gases. In the final section of this\npaper, an attempt is made to generalize the equations for applicability to real\nfluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 13:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 11:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

In this paper, we study a\nclass of recently proposed weighting methods which find the weights of minimum\ndispersion that approximately balance the covariates. We call these weights\n\"minimal weights\" and study them under a common optimization framework. The key\nobservation is the connection between approximate covariate balance and\nshrinkage estimation of the propensity score. This connection leads to both\ntheoretical and practical developments. From a theoretical standpoint, we\ncharacterize the asymptotic properties of minimal weights and show that, under\nstandard smoothness conditions on the propensity score function, minimal\nweights are consistent estimates of the true inverse probability weights. Also,\nwe show that the resulting weighting estimator is consistent, asymptotically\nnormal, and semiparametrically efficient. From a practical standpoint, we\npresent a finite sample oracle inequality that bounds the loss incurred by\nbalancing more functions of the covariates than strictly needed. This\ninequality shows that minimal weights implicitly bound the number of active\ncovariate balance constraints. We finally provide a tuning algorithm for\nchoosing the degree of approximate balance in minimal weights. We conclude the\npaper with four empirical studies that suggest approximate balance is\npreferable to exact balance, especially when there is limited overlap in\ncovariate distributions.

MMC is a converter system with a typical multi-frequency response due\nto its significant steady-state harmonic components in the arm currents,\ncapacitor voltages, and control signals. Therefore, traditional small-signal\nmodeling methods for 2-level voltage-source converters (VSCs) cannot be\ndirectly applied to the MMC. In this paper, the harmonic state-space (HSS)\nmodeling approach is introduced to characterize the harmonic coupling behavior\nof the MMC. On this basis, the small-signal impedance models of the MMC are\ndeveloped according to the harmonic linearization principle, which can include\nall the steady-state harmonic effects of the state variables, leading to the\naccurate impedance models. Furthermore, in order to reveal the impact of the\ninternal dynamics and closed-loop control on the small-signal impedance of the\nMMC, three cases are considered in this paper, i.e., open-loop control, ac\nvoltage closed-loop control, and circulating current closed-loop control.\nFinally, the analytical impedance models are verified by both simulation and\nexperimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 15:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

One method to\nestimate brain connectivity is with electroencephalography (EEG) from which the\ncross-spectrum between different sensor locations is derived. We wish to test\nthe efficacy of tensor factorisation in the estimation of brain connectivity.\nMethods: Complex tensor factorisation based on PARAFAC2 is used to decompose\nthe EEG into scalp components described by the spatial, spectral, and complex\ntrial profiles. An EEG model in the complex domain was derived that shows the\nsuitability of PARAFAC2. A connectivity metric was also derived on the complex\ntrial profiles of the extracted components. Results: Results on a benchmark EEG\ndataset confirmed that PARAFAC2 can estimate connectivity better than\ntraditional tensor analysis such as PARAFAC within a range of signal-to-noise\nratios. The analysis of EEG from patients with mild cognitive impairment or\nAlzheimer's disease showed that PARAFAC2 identifies loss of brain connectivity\nbetter than traditional approaches and agreeing with prior pathological\nknowledge. Conclusion: The complex PARAFAC2 algorithm is suitable for EEG\nconnectivity estimation since it allows to extract meaningful coupled sources\nand provides better estimates than complex PARAFAC. Significance: A new\nparadigm that employs complex tensor factorisation has demonstrated to be\nsuccessful in identifying brain connectivity and the location of couples\nsources for both a benchmark and a real-world EEG dataset. This can enable\nfuture applications and has the potential to solve some the issues that\ndeteriorate the performance of traditional connectivity metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 10:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

Many of these\ninfections arise as a consequence of medical personnel that come into contact\nwith contaminated persons, surfaces or equipment and then with patients,\nwithout following proper hygiene procedures. In this paper we present our\nongoing efforts in the development of a wireless sensor network based\ncyber-physical system which aims to prevent hospital infections by increasing\ncompliance to established hygiene guidelines. The solution, currently developed\nunder European Union funding integrates a network of sensors for monitoring\nclinical workflows and ambient conditions, a workflow engine that executes\nencoded workflow instances and monitoring software that provides real-time\ninformation in case of infection risk detection. As a motivating example, we\nemploy the workflow in the general practitioner's office in order to\ncomprehensively present types of sensors and their positioning in the monitored\nlocation. Using the information collected by deployed sensors, the system is\ncapable of immediately detecting infection risks and taking action to prevent\nthe spread of infections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 08:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

Much work was done in the search for\na proof of these conjectures, including the development in algebraic geometry\nof a Weil cohomology theory for these varieties, which uses the Frobenius\noperator on a finite field. The zeta function is then expressed as a\ndeterminant, allowing the properties of the function to relate to those of the\noperator. The search for a suitable cohomology theory and associated operator\nto prove the Riemann hypothesis is still on. In this paper, we study the\nproperties of the derivative operator $D = \\frac{d}{dz}$ on a particular\nweighted Bergman space of entire functions. The operator $D$ can be naturally\nviewed as the `infinitesimal shift of the complex plane'. Furthermore, this\noperator is meant to be the replacement for the Frobenius operator in the\ngeneral case and is used to construct an operator associated to any suitable\nmeromorphic function. We then show that the meromorphic function can be\nrecovered by using a regularized determinant involving the above operator. This\nis illustrated in some important special cases: rational functions, zeta\nfunctions of curves over finite fields, the Riemann zeta function, and\nculminating in a quantized version of the Hadamard factorization theorem that\napplies to any entire function of finite order. Our construction is motivated\nin part by [23] on the infinitesimal shift of the real line, as well as by\nearlier work of Deninger [10] on cohomology in number theory and a conjectural\n`fractal cohomology theory' envisioned in [25] and [28].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 00:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 21:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 02:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 23:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}
