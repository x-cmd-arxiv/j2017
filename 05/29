It is well-known that corresponding minimax\nrisk has the order $N^{1/2}$ with $N$ being the number of processed data. We\nimprove significantly the theoretical estimate of the factor using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. Then we propose a parallel version of the MDA which allows\nprocessing of data by packets in a number of stages. The usage of parallel\nversion of the MDA ensures that total time of data processing depends mostly on\nthe number of packets but not on the total number of data. It is quite\nunexpectedly that the parallel version behaves unlike the ordinary one even if\nthe number of packets is large. Moreover, the parallel version considerably\nimproves control performance because it provides significantly smaller value of\nthe minimax risk. We explain this result by considering another parallel\nmodification of the MDA which behavior is close to behavior of the ordinary\nversion. Our estimates are based on invariant descriptions of the algorithms.\nAll estimates are obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. It's worth noting that\nparallel version performs well only for methods with close efficiencies.

We show that when\na human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act\naccording to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than\na robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a\ntradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its\nowner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers\nthe human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of\nobedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot\nhas a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the\nlevel of rationality of the human. Finally, we study how robots can start\ndetecting such model misspecification. Overall, our work suggests that there\nmight be a middle ground in which robots intelligently decide when to obey\nhuman orders, but err on the side of obedience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 20:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

For\nexample, image super-resolution requires joint estimation of the image and\nmotion parameters from noisy measurements. Exploiting this structure is key for\nefficiently solving these large-scale optimization problems, which are often\nill-conditioned.\n  In this paper, we present a new method called Linearize And Project (LAP)\nthat offers a flexible framework for solving inverse problems with coupled\nvariables. LAP is most promising for cases when the subproblem corresponding to\none of the variables is considerably easier to solve than the other. LAP is\nbased on a Gauss-Newton method, and thus after linearizing the residual, it\neliminates one block of variables through projection. Due to the linearization,\nthis block can be chosen freely. Further, LAP supports direct, iterative, and\nhybrid regularization as well as constraints. Therefore LAP is attractive,\ne.g., for ill-posed imaging problems. These traits differentiate LAP from\ncommon alternatives for this type of problem such as variable projection\n(VarPro) and block coordinate descent (BCD). Our numerical experiments compare\nthe performance of LAP to BCD and VarPro using three coupled problems whose\nforward operators are linear with respect to one block and nonlinear for the\nother set of variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 21:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 20:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 14:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within\nthe central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta\nis rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by\nSNe of the stars themselves.

One possible origin of cosmic magnetic fields is the\nmagnetogenesis in the primordial universe. Such magnetic fields are called\nprimordial magnetic fields (PMFs), and are considered to affect the evolution\nof matter density fluctuations and the thermal history of the IGM gas. Hence\nthe information of PMFs is expected to be imprinted on the anisotropies of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)\neffect in the IGM. In this study, given an initial power spectrum of PMFs as\n$P(k)\\propto B_{\\rm 1Mpc}^2 k^{n_{B}}$, we calculate dynamical and thermal\nevolutions of the IGM under the influence of PMFs, and compute the resultant\nangular power spectrum of the Compton $y$-parameter on the sky. As a result, we\nfind that two physical processes driven by PMFs dominantly determine the power\nspectrum of the Compton $y$-parameter; (i) the heating due to the ambipolar\ndiffusion effectively works to increase the temperature and the ionization\nfraction, and (ii) the Lorentz force drastically enhances the density contrast\njust after the recombination epoch. These facts result in making the tSZ\nangular power spectrum induced by the PMFs more remarkable at $\\ell >10^4$ than\nthat by galaxy clusters even with $B_{\\rm 1Mpc}=0.1$ nG and $n_{B}=-1.0$\nbecause the contribution from galaxy clusters decreases with increasing $\\ell$.\nThe measurement of the tSZ angular power spectrum on high $\\ell$ modes can\nprovide the stringent constraint on PMFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 07:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 03:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The Square Kilometer Array\nlow frequency instrument (SKA1-LOW) will consist of a collection of non-regular\nphased array systems. The prediction of the main beam of these arrays using a\nfew coefficients is crucial for the calibration of the telescope.

These\nresults indicate that an additional angular momentum transport process is\nnecessary to counteract the spin up due to the core contraction during the\npost-main sequence evolution. For several candidates, the transport induced by\ninternal gravity waves (IGW) could play a non-negligible role. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effect of IGW generated by penetrative convection on the\ninternal rotation of low-mass stars from the subgiant branch to the beginning\nof the red giant branch. We show that IGW can efficiently counteract the\ncontraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of\nthe radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of\nthe radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on\nthe evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates\ninferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such\nan agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation\nmechanism driven by IGW. This result is obtained under the assumption of a\nsmooth rotation profile and holds true even if a wide range of values is\nconsidered for the parameters of the generation model.

Among regression-based methods,\ndensity map estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the\nintegral of the density map over that subregion, is especially promising\nbecause it preserves spatial information, which makes it useful for both\ncounting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved\nsteadily. The goal of this paper is to evaluate density maps generated by\ndensity estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis tasks, including\ncounting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density\nmaps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the\ndownsample strides in the convolution/pooling operations. To produce an\noriginal-resolution density map, we also evaluate a classical CNN that uses a\nsliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the image.\nWe also consider a fully convolutional (FCNN) adaptation, with skip connections\nfrom lower convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information\nduring upsampling. In our experiments, we found that the lower-resolution\ndensity maps sometimes have better counting performance. In contrast, the\noriginal-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection\nand tracking, compared to bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density\nmaps. Finally, we also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a\ndensity map, and relate them to experiment results on counting and\nlocalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 11:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 14:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

The second phase comprises the unsupervised\nlearning approach, which is an ensemble of clustering classifiers using a\nmajority voting mechanism with different weight schemes. The base classifier of\nthe ensemble method is a modified k-means algorithm. The base classifier is\nmodified by extracting initial centroids from the feature set via using\nSentWordNet (SWN).

We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations. Namely, we\nneed to improve the treatment of the rotation evolution in the orbital\nevolution model and ultimately we need to consistently couple of the orbital\nmodel to the stellar evolution model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 13:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Consequently, there has been a growing interest not only in\nmulti-objective models, but also in specialized multi-objective metaheuristics\nfor solving those models. A wide variety of methods, e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA, IBEA,\nscatter search, Pareto local search, and many others, have thus been proposed\nover the years.

The series\nof theoretical analyses of deep learning has revealed its high expressive power\nand universal approximation capability. Although these analyses are highly\nnonparametric, existing generalization error analyses have been developed\nmainly in a fixed dimensional parametric model. To compensate this gap, we\ndevelop an infinite dimensional model that is based on an integral form as\nperformed in the analysis of the universal approximation capability. This\nallows us to define a reproducing kernel Hilbert space corresponding to each\nlayer. Our point of view is to deal with the ordinary finite dimensional deep\nneural network as a finite approximation of the infinite dimensional one. The\napproximation error is evaluated by the degree of freedom of the reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space in each layer. To estimate a good finite dimensional\nmodel, we consider both of empirical risk minimization and Bayesian deep\nlearning. We derive its generalization error bound and it is shown that there\nappears bias-variance trade-off in terms of the number of parameters of the\nfinite dimensional approximation.

However, rollback as part of the\nrecovery remains a dominant cost even in highly optimised MPI applications\nemploying C/R techniques.

Our work focuses on task-based runtimes, where\ntask dependencies are explicit and message passing is implicit. We see an\nopportunity for reducing rollback for such runtimes: we explore task\ndependencies in the rollback, which we call dependency-aware rollback. We also\ndesign a new C/R technique, which is influenced by recursive decomposition of\ntasks, and combine it with dependency-aware rollback. We expect the\ndependency-aware rollback to cancel and recompute less tasks in the presence of\nnode failures. We describe, implement and validate the proposed protocol in a\nsimulator, which confirms these expectations.

The\ntheoretical work since 1998 have led to the formulation of the $f$-sum version\nof the Fermi Golden rule formula as the most convenient method for the\ncalculation of the rate of cooling of hot electrons where energy is transferred\nto cold ions. The attempt to include relaxation via the ion-acoustic modes of\nthe two coupled subsystems, i.e., electrons and ions has led to a coupled-mode\nformulation which has now been established by a variety of formal methods.\nHowever, various simplified calculational models of the system with\ncoupled-modes, as well as sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations seem to\ndisagree.

SN2004aw is shown not to be ``broad-lined'', contrary to previous\nclaims, but rather a ``fast-lined'' SN Ic. The spectral resemblance to the\nnarrow-lined Type Ic SN1994I, combined with the strong nebular [O I] emission\nand the broad light curve, point to a moderately energetic explosion of a\nmassive C+O star. The ejected 56Ni mass is ~0.2 Msun. The ejecta mass as\nconstrained by the models is ~3-5 Msun, while the kinetic energy is estimated\nas KE ~3-6 e51 ergs. The ratio KE/Mej, the specific energy which influences the\nshape of the spectrum, is therefore ~1. The corresponding zero-age\nmain-sequence mass of the progenitor star may have been ~23-28 Msun. Tests show\nthat a flatter outer density structure may have caused a broad-lined spectrum\nat epochs before those observed without affecting the later epochs when data\nare available, implying that our estimate of KE is a lower limit. SN2004aw may\nhave been powered by either a collapsar or a magnetar, both of which have been\nproposed for gamma-ray burst-supernovae. Evidence for this is seen in the\ninnermost layers, which appear to be highly aspherical as suggested by the\nnebular line profiles.

We investigate the best-possible competitive\nratio of such an incremental solution, i.e., the worst ratio over all $k$\nbetween the incremental solution after $k$ steps and an optimum solution of\ncardinality $k$. We define a large class of problems that contains many\nimportant cardinality constrained maximization problems like maximum matching,\nknapsack, and packing/covering problems.

Is it prone to\nmisidentifying the optimal actions or spending too much time exploring the\nsuboptimal ones? What is the right tuning for the learning rate? In this paper,\nwe address several of these questions in the classic setup of stochastic\nmulti-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing that the Boltzmann\nexploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence will induce\nsuboptimal behavior. As a remedy, we offer a simple non-monotone schedule that\nguarantees near-optimal performance, albeit only when given prior access to key\nproblem parameters that are typically not available in practical situations\n(like the time horizon $T$ and the suboptimality gap $\\Delta$).

Our aim is to provide diameters and albedos of MCs\nwith available WISE/NEOWISE data. Methods. We used the near-Earth asteroid\nthermal model to find the best-fitting values of equivalent diameter and,\nwhenever possible, the infrared beaming parameter. With the diameter and\ntabulated asteroid absolute magnitudes we also computed the visible geometric\nalbedos. Results. We determined the diameters and beaming parameters of 404\nobjects observed during the fully cryogenic phase of the WISE mission, most of\nwhich have not been published elsewhere. We also obtained 1572 diameters from\ndata from the 3-Band and posterior non-cryogenic phases using a default value\nof beaming parameter. The average beaming parameter is 1.2 +/- 0.2 for objects\nsmaller than 10 km, which constitute most of our sample. This is higher than\nthe typical value of 1.0 found for the whole main belt and is possibly related\nto the fact that WISE is able to observe many more small objects at shorter\nheliocentric distances, i.e. at higher phase angles. We argue that this is a\nbetter default value for modelling Mars-crossing asteroids from the\nWISE/NEOWISE catalogue and discuss the effects of this choice on the diameter\nand albedo distributions. We find a double-peaked distribution for the visible\ngeometric albedos, which is expected since this population is compositionally\ndiverse and includes objects in the major spectral complexes.

FGM requires that\nthe objective be finite and differentiable with known gradient Lipschitz\nconstant. FISTA is applicable to the more broad class of composite objectives\nand is equipped with a line-search procedure for estimating the Lipschitz\nconstant. Nonetheless, FISTA cannot increase the step size and is unable to\ntake advantage of strong convexity.

We use this approach to investigate the role of different auto-\nand cross-correlations in the HSR noise tensor, confirming that site-energy\nautocorrelations (pure dephasing) terms dominate the noise-induced exciton\nmobility enhancement, followed by site energy-coupling cross-correlations for\nspecific triplets of pigments.
