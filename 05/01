However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and\ncharacterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming\nand expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence\nof mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches\nto supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived\nfrom social media content provides a potential means for near real-time\nestimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,\nevaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and\ninterventions.\n  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification\nthat incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring\nrepresentation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social\nmedia post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of\nindividuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post\nhistories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To\nthis end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected\nby depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of\ndemographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings\nwith respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect\nto mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health\nprediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to\nmental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 16:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

We consider how this degeneracy is disrupted when the\ntube wall is rough, and determine threshold conditions under which collars or\nplugs resist displacement under forcing. Wall roughness is modelled as a\nnon-axisymmetric Gaussian random field of prescribed correlation length and\nsmall variance, mimicking some of the geometric irregularities inherent in\napplications such as lung airways.

Classical approaches to matrix\ncompletion assume that the input partially-observed matrix is low rank. The\nsuccess of these methods depends on the number of observed entries and the rank\nof the matrix; the larger the rank, the more entries need to be observed in\norder to accurately complete the matrix. In this paper, we deal with matrices\nthat are not necessarily low rank themselves, but rather they contain low-rank\nsubmatrices. We propose Targeted, which is a general framework for completing\nsuch matrices. In this framework, we first extract the low-rank submatrices and\nthen apply a matrix-completion algorithm to these low-rank submatrices as well\nas the remainder matrix separately. Although for the completion itself we use\nstate-of-the-art completion methods, our results demonstrate that Targeted\nachieves significantly smaller reconstruction errors than other classical\nmatrix-completion methods.

The\ntwo-dimensional problem where the points are at the vertices of a convex\npolygon is essentially solved: each multiplet of forces must be such that the\nnet anticlockwise torque around any vertex of the forces summed over any number\nof consecutive points clockwise past the vertex must be non-negative; and one\ncan find a truss structure that supports under tension, and only supports,\nthose force multiplets in a convex polyhedron of force multiplets that is\ngenerated by a finite number of force multiplets each satisfying the torque\ncondition.

In\nview of these new emerging needs for applications of wavelet encoded imaging,\nwe propose a sub-pixel registration method that can achieve direct wavelet\ndomain registration from a sparse set of coefficients.

We provide asymptotic theory for\nthe maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) based on the BM method. Our main result\nis the asymptotic normality of the MLE with a non-trivial bias depending on the\nextreme value index and on the so-called second order parameter. Our approach\ncombines asymptotic expansions of the likelihood process and of the empirical\nquantile process of block maxima. The results permit to complete the comparison\nof most common semi-parametric estimators in EVT (MLE and probability weighted\nmoment estimators based on the POT or BM methods) through their asymptotic\nvariances, biases and optimal mean square errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 10:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

As per the C-RAN architecture, the encoded baseband signals are quantized\nand compressed prior to the transfer to distributed radio units (RUs) that are\nconnected to the CU via finite-capacity fronthaul links. This work argues that\nthe quantization noise introduced by fronthaul quantization can be leveraged to\nact as \"artificial\" noise in order to enhance the rates achievable under\nsecrecy constraints. To this end, it is proposed to control the statistics of\nthe quantization noise by applying multivariate, or joint, fronthaul\nquantization/compression at the CU across all outgoing fronthaul links.\nAssuming wiretap coding, the problem of jointly optimizing the precoding and\nmultivariate compression strategies, along with the covariance matrices of\nartificial noise signals generated by RUs, is formulated with the goal of\nmaximizing the weighted sum of achievable secrecy rates while satisfying per-RU\nfronthaul capacity and power constraints.

However,\nreliability of such communication systems becomes an important design challenge\nwhen such relays scavenge energy from the information bearing RF signals\nreceived from the source, using the technique of simultaneous wireless\ninformation and power transfer (SWIPT). To this aim, this work studies\nbidirectional communication in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted\ncooperative wireless network in presence of co-channel interference (CCI). In\norder to quantify the reliability of the bidirectional communication systems, a\nclosed form expression for the outage probability of the system is derived for\nboth power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) mode of operation of the\nrelay. Simulation results are used to validate the accuracy of our analytical\nresults and illustrate the dependence of the outage probability on various\nsystem parameters, like PS factor, TS factor, and distance of the relay from\nboth the users. Results of performance comparison between PS relaying (PSR) and\nTS relaying (TSR) schemes are also presented. Besides, simulation results are\nalso used to illustrate the spectral-efficiency and the energy-efficiency of\nthe proposed system. The results show that, both in terms of spectral\nefficiency and the energy-efficiency, the two-way communication system in\npresence of moderate CCI power, performs better than the similar system without\nCCI. Additionally, it is also found that PSR is superior to TSR protocol in\nterms of peak energy-efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 12:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

The characterization of this flux will shed light on Galactic\naccelerator features, gas distribution morphology and Galactic cosmic ray\ntransport. The central Galactic plane can be the site of an enhanced neutrino\nproduction, thus leading to anisotropies in the extraterrestrial neutrino\nsignal as measured by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, offers a favourable view on this\npart of the sky, thereby allowing for a contribution to the determination of\nthis flux. The expected diffuse Galactic neutrino emission can be obtained\nlinking a model of generation and propagation of cosmic rays with the\nmorphology of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. In this paper, the\nso-called \"Gamma model\" introduced recently to explain the high-energy gamma\nray diffuse Galactic emission, is assumed as reference. The neutrino flux\npredicted by the \"Gamma model\" depends of the assumed primary cosmic ray\nspectrum cut-off. Considering a radially-dependent diffusion coefficient, this\nproposed scenario is able to account for the local cosmic ray measurements, as\nwell as for the Galactic gamma ray observations. Nine years of ANTARES data are\nused in this work to search for a possible Galactic contribution according to\nthis scenario. All flavour neutrino interactions are considered. No excess of\nevents is observed and an upper limit is set on the neutrino flux of $1.1$\n($1.2$) times the prediction of the \"Gamma model\" assuming the primary cosmic\nray spectrum cut-off at 5 (50) PeV. This limit excludes the diffuse Galactic\nneutrino emission as the major cause of the \"spectral anomaly\" between the two\nhemispheres measured by IceCube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 12:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 10:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In early conceptual models of the\nCulebra, groundwater levels were not expected to fluctuate markedly, except in\nresponse to long-term climatic changes, with response times on the order of\nhundreds to thousands of years. Recent groundwater pressures measured in\nmonitoring wells record more than 25 m of drawdown.

However, such solution faces several challenges\nas inverters do not intrinsically possess the natural response to power\nfluctuations that synchronous generators have. Thus, to synthetically generate\nthis response, inverters need to take frequency measurements, which are usually\nnoisy, and subsequently make changes in the output power, which are therefore\ndelayed. This paper explores the system-wide performance tradeoffs that arise\nwhen measurement noise, power disturbances, and delayed actions are considered\nin the design of dynamic controllers for grid-connected inverters. Using a\nrecently proposed dynamic droop (iDroop) control for grid-connected inverters,\nwhich is inspired by classical first order lead-lag compensation, we show that\nthe sets of parameters that result in highest noise attenuation, power\ndisturbance mitigation, and delay robustness do not necessarily have a common\nintersection. In particular, lead compensation is desired in systems where\npower disturbances are the predominant source of degradation, while lag\ncompensation is a better alternative when the system is dominated by delays or\nfrequency noise. Our analysis further shows that iDroop can outperform the\nstandard droop alternative in both joint noise and disturbance mitigation, and\ndelay robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 14:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

In high dimensions, nonlinear partial differential\nequation methods for solving the problem become prohibitively costly due to the\ncurse of dimensionality. Instead, this work proposes to use a stopping rule\nthat depends on the dynamics of a low-dimensional Markovian projection of the\ngiven basket of assets. It is shown that the ability to approximate the\noriginal value function by a lower-dimensional approximation is a feature of\nthe dynamics of the system and is unaffected by the path-dependent nature of\nthe American basket option. Assuming that we know the density of the forward\nprocess and using the Laplace approximation, we first efficiently evaluate the\ndiffusion coefficient corresponding to the low-dimensional Markovian projection\nof the basket. Then, we approximate the optimal early-exercise boundary of the\noption by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation in\nthe projected, low-dimensional space. The resulting near-optimal early-exercise\nboundary is used to produce an exercise strategy for the high-dimensional\noption, thereby providing a lower bound for the price of the American basket\noption. A corresponding upper bound is also provided. These bounds allow to\nassess the accuracy of the proposed pricing method. Indeed, our approximate\nearly-exercise strategy provides a straightforward lower bound for the American\nbasket option price. Following a duality argument due to Rogers, we derive a\ncorresponding upper bound solving only the low-dimensional optimal control\nproblem. Numerically, we show the feasibility of the method using baskets with\ndimensions up to fifty. In these examples, the resulting option price relative\nerrors are only of the order of few percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 15:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 07:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 20:56:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 09:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

Specifically the problem of sound\ngenerated by a gust convecting in uniform mean steady flow scattering off the\ntrailing edge and permeable-impermeable junction is considered. This setup\nsupposes that any realistic trailing-edge adaptation to a blade would be\nsufficiently small so that the turbulent boundary layer encapsulates both the\nporous edge and the permeable-impermeable junction, and therefore the\ninteraction of acoustics generated at these two discontinuous boundaries is\nimportant. The acoustic problem is tackled analytically through use of the\nWiener-Hopf method. A two-dimensional matrix Wiener-Hopf problem arises due to\nthe two interaction points (the trailing edge and the permeable-impermeable\njunction). This paper discusses a new iterative method for solving this matrix\nWiener-Hopf equation which extends to further two-dimensional problems in\nparticular those involving analytic terms that exponentially grow in the upper\nor lower half planes. This method is an extension of the commonly used \"pole\nremoval\" technique and avoids the needs for full matrix factorisation.\nConvergence of this iterative method to an exact solution is shown to be\nparticularly fast when terms neglected in the second step are formally smaller\nthan all other terms retained. The final acoustic solution highlights the\neffects of the permeable-impermeable junction on the generated noise, in\nparticular how this junction affects the far-field noise generated by\nhigh-frequency gusts by creating an interference to typical trailing-edge\nscattering. This effect results in partially porous plates predicting a lower\nnoise reduction than fully porous plates when compared to fully impermeable\nplates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 12:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 14:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

If humanity could\nbuild high-speed interstellar lightsails and reach the alpha Centauri system 20\nyr after launch, would it be better to wait a few years, then take advantage of\nfurther technology improvements to increase the speed, and arrive earlier\ndespite waiting? The risk of being overtaken by a future, faster probe has been\ndescribed earlier as the incentive trap. Based on 211 yr of historical data, we\nfind that the speed growth of human-made vehicles, from steam-driven\nlocomotives to Voyager 1, is much faster than previously believed, about 4.72 %\nannually or a doubling every 15 yr. We derive the mathematical framework to\ncalculate the minimum of the wait time (t) plus travel time (tau(t)) and extend\ntwo exponential growth law models into the relativistic regime. We show that\nthe minimum of t+tau(t) disappears for nearby targets. There is no use of\nwaiting for speed improvements once we can reach an object within about 20 yr\nof travel, irrespective of the actual speed. In terms of speed, the t+tau(t)\nminimum for a travel to alpha Centauri will occur once 19.6 % the speed of\nlight (c) become available, in agreement with the 20 % c proposed by the\nBreakthrough Starshot Initiative. If interstellar travel at 20 % c can be\nobtained within 45 yr from today and if the kinetic energy could be increased\nat a rate consistent with the historical record, then humans can reach the ten\nmost nearby stars within 100 yr from today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 04:15:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 10:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

Those models have since progressed, in particular to include\nAGN feedback to match the galaxy luminosity function in a universe with the\nobserved baryon fraction. AGN feedback affects the relationship between galaxy\nstellar mass and luminosity, in particular making the relationship\nnon-monotonic. For matched number density samples, galaxies in\nluminosity-threshold samples occupy a different range of halo masses from those\nin stellar-mass-threshold samples. We find that the shapes of the HODs of\nluminosity-threshold samples are slightly more complicated in semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation models that include AGN feedback than are assumed by standard\nHOD models.
