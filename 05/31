Due to limited bandwidth in distributed\nsystems, efficient coding of local visual features has in fact been an active\ntopic of research. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtain a\ncompact representation of high-dimensional visual data using sensor fusion\ntechniques. We convert the problem of visual analysis in resource-limited\nscenarios to a multi-view representation learning, and we show that the key to\nfinding properly compressed representation is to exploit the position of\ncameras with respect to each other as a norm-based regularization in the\nparticular signal representation of sparse coding. Learning the representation\nof each camera is viewed as an individual task and a multi-task learning with\njoint sparsity for all nodes is employed. The proposed representation learning\nscheme is referred to as the multi-view task-driven learning for visual sensor\nnetwork (MT-VSN).

We show that not all\noblivious subspace embeddings $S$ satisfy these properties. In particular, we\ngive counterexamples showing that matrices based on Count-Sketch or leverage\nscore sampling do not satisfy these properties.\n  We also provide lower bounds, both on how small $\\|x'-x^*\\|_2$ can be, and\nfor our new guarantee (1), showing that the subsampled randomized\nFourier/Hadamard transform is nearly optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 16:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Generally, popularity-based\ncaching is not a system-wide optimal strategy, especially for user mobility\nscenarios. Motivated by this observation, we consider optimal caching with\npresence of mobility. A cost-optimal caching problem (COCP) for\ndevice-to-device (D2D) networks is modelled, in which the impact of user\nmobility, cache size, and total number of encoded segments are all accounted\nfor. Compared with the related studies, our investigation guarantees that the\ncollected segments are non-overlapping, takes into account the cost of\ndownloading from the network, and provides a rigorous problem complexity\nanalysis. The hardness of the problem is proved via a reduction from the\nsatisfiability problem. Next, a lower-bounding function of the objective\nfunction is derived. By the function, an approximation of COCP (ACOCP)\nachieving linearization is obtained, which features two advantages. First, the\nACOCP approach can use an off-the-shelf integer linear programming algorithm to\nobtain the global optimal solution, and it can effectively deliver solutions\nfor small-scale and mediumscale system scenarios. Second, and more importantly,\nbased on the ACOCP approach, one can derive the lower bound of global optimum\nof COCP, thus enabling performance benchmarking of any suboptimal algorithm. To\ntackle large scenarios with low complexity, we first prove that the optimal\ncaching placement of one user, giving other users' caching placements, can be\nderived in polynomial time. Then, based on this proof, a mobility aware\nuser-by-user (MAUU) algorithm is developed. Simulation results verify the\neffectivenesses of the two approaches by comparing them to the lower bound of\nglobal optimum and conventional caching algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 16:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

A remarkable feature of this kind of grids is that there\nare two qualitatively different types of drops.

Once the\npassword file is compromised, an adversary obtains both the login credentials.\nWith the advancement of technology, even if a password is maintained in hashed\nformat, then also the adversary can invert the hashed password to get the\noriginal one. To mitigate this threat, most of the systems nowadays store some\nsystem generated fake passwords (also known as honeywords) along with the\noriginal password of a user. This type of setup confuses an adversary while\nselecting the original password. If the adversary chooses any of these\nhoneywords and submits that as a login credential, then system detects the\nattack. A large number of significant work have been done on designing\nmethodologies (identified as $\\text{M}^{\\text{DS}}_{\\text{OA}}$) that can\nprotect password against observation or, shoulder surfing attack. Under this\nattack scenario, an adversary observes (or records) the login information\nentered by a user and later uses those credentials to impersonate the genuine\nuser.

The nodal line structure gives rise to\nkinematical constraints similar to that for a two-dimensional Fermi surface,\nwhich plays a crucial role in the one-loop renor- malization of the disorder\ncouplings.

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 18:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 18:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

As differential privacy\nis increasingly deployed in practical settings, it may often be that there is\ninstead a fixed accuracy requirement for a given computation and the data\nanalyst would like to maximize the privacy of the computation subject to the\naccuracy constraint. This raises the question of how to find and run a\nmaximally private empirical risk minimizer subject to a given accuracy\nrequirement. We propose a general \"noise reduction\" framework that can apply to\na variety of private empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithms, using them\nto \"search\" the space of privacy levels to find the empirically strongest one\nthat meets the accuracy constraint, incurring only logarithmic overhead in the\nnumber of privacy levels searched. The privacy analysis of our algorithm leads\nnaturally to a version of differential privacy where the privacy parameters are\ndependent on the data, which we term ex-post privacy, and which is related to\nthe recently introduced notion of privacy odometers. We also give an ex-post\nprivacy analysis of the classical AboveThreshold privacy tool, modifying it to\nallow for queries chosen depending on the database.

The survival\nof cancer cells from the primary tumour site to the secondary seeding sites\ndepends on the occurrence of very few driver mutations promoting oncogenic cell\nbehaviours and on the order with which these mutations occur. We introduce a\nmodel in the framework of Cellular Automata to investigate the effects of\nmetabolic mutations and mutation order on cancer stemness and tumour cell\nmigration in bone metastasised breast cancers. The metabolism of the cancer\ncell is a key factor in its proliferation rate. Bioinformatics analysis on a\ncancer mutation database shows that metabolism-modifying alterations constitute\nan important class of key cancer mutations. Our approach models three types of\nmutations: drivers, the order of which is relevant for the dynamics, metabolic\nwhich support cancer growth and are estimated from existing databases, and\nnon--driver mutations. Our results provide a quantitative basis of how the\norder of driver mutations and the metabolic mutations in different cancer\nclones could impact proliferation of therapy-resistant clonal populations and\npatient survival. Further mathematical modelling of the order of mutations is\npresented in terms of operators.

TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD\nalgorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary\nconcern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents\nand tasks.

We take special care of establishing the precedence among all\ncontributions to mechanics, something that can be better appreciated by\nconsidering the consequences of removing them: (a) the consequence of\nrenouncing logic and the laws of understanding is not being able to understand\nthe world, (b) renouncing the early elaborations of primary concepts such as\ntime and space leads to a dissociation between everyday life and physics, the\nlatter becoming entirely pragmatic and justified \\emph{a-posteriori} (because\nit is convenient), (c) changing our temporary beliefs has no real cost other\nthan effort.

A major\ndevelopment since the previous release has been exporting the atomic data into\nexternal data files. This greatly simplifies updates and maintenance of the\ndata. Many large datasets have been incorporated with the result that we can\nnow predict well over an order of magnitude more emission lines when all\ndatabases are fully used. The use of such large datasets is not realistic for\nmost calculations due to the time and memory needs, and we describe the limited\nsubset of data we use by default. Despite the fact that we now predict\nsignificantly more lines than the previous Cloudy release, this version is\nfaster because of optimization of memory access patterns and other tuning. The\nsize and use of the databases can easily be adjusted in the command-line\ninterface. We give examples of the accuracy limits using small models, and the\nperformance requirements of large complete models. We summarize several\nadvances in the H- and He-like iso-electronic sequences. We use our complete\ncollisional-radiative models of the ionization of these one and two-electron\nions to establish the highest density for which the coronal or interstellar\nmedium (ISM) approximation works, and the lowest density where Saha or local\nthermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed. The coronal approximation fails at\nsurprisingly low densities for collisional ionization equilibrium but is valid\nto higher densities for photoionized gas clouds. Many other improvements to the\nphysics have been made and are described. These include the treatment of\nisotropic continuum sources such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in\nthe reported output, and the ability to follow the evolution of cooling\nnon-equilibrium clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 21:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 19:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

For typhoid fever, polio, measles,\nleukemia and many other diseases, the incubation period is highly variable.\nSome affected people take much longer than average to show symptoms, leading to\na distribution of incubation periods that is right skewed and often\napproximately lognormal. Although this statistical pattern was discovered more\nthan sixty years ago, it remains an open question to explain its ubiquity. Here\nwe propose an explanation based on evolutionary dynamics on graphs. For simple\nmodels of a mutant or pathogen invading a network-structured population of\nhealthy cells, we show that skewed distributions of incubation periods emerge\nfor a wide range of assumptions about invader fitness, competition dynamics,\nand network structure. The skewness stems from stochastic mechanisms associated\nwith two classic problems in probability theory: the coupon collector and the\nrandom walk. Unlike previous explanations that rely crucially on heterogeneity,\nour results hold even for homogeneous populations. Thus, we predict that two\nequally healthy individuals subjected to equal doses of equally pathogenic\nagents may, by chance alone, show remarkably different time courses of disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 22:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

The combination of the latter two effects is the\nprimary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the\nonly known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a\nmini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two\nauroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to\nthe one from Jupiter.

A grazing chord\nobserved during the 2014 occultation reveals a topographic feature along\n2003~AZ$_{84}$'s limb, that can be interpreted as an abrupt chasm of width\n$\\sim 23$~km and depth $> 8$~km or a smooth depression of width $\\sim 80$~km\nand depth $\\sim 13$~km (or an intermediate feature between those two extremes).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 23:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Serial correlations in fMRI data\nare commonly characterized in terms of a first-order autoregressive (AR)\nprocess and then removed via pre-whitening. The required noise model for the\npre-whitening depends on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition\ntime (TR).

As reported in the literature, several learned\nclauses deletion strategies have been proposed. However the diversity in both\nthe number of clauses to be removed at each step of reduction and the results\nobtained with each strategy creates confusion to determine which criterion is\nbetter.

In\nprevious work, there exist a number of approaches that map logical inference\nrules with feed-forward propagation of artificial neural networks (ANN).\nHowever, the discriminative structure of an ANN requires the separation of\ninput/output variables which makes it difficult for general reasoning where any\nvariables should be inferable.

Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing\noutflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later\ntimes, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central\ncooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback. We thus\nenvisage a picture of cool cluster cores going through cycles of\ncooling-induced contraction and AGN-induced expansion.

While such\nproblems are convex, existing methods cannot guarantee that solutions will have\nspecific graph topology properties (e.g., being $k$-partite), which are\ndesirable for some applications. In fact, the problem of learning a graph with\ngiven topology properties, e.g., finding the $k$-partite graph that best\nmatches the data, is in general non-convex. In this paper, we develop novel\ntheoretical results that provide performance guarantees for an approach to\nsolve these problems. Our solution decomposes this problem into two\nsub-problems, for which efficient solutions are known. Specifically, a graph\ntopology inference (GTI) step is employed to select a feasible graph topology,\ni.e., one having the desired property. Then, a graph weight estimation (GWE)\nstep is performed by solving a generalized graph Laplacian estimation problem,\nwhere edges are constrained by the topology found in the GTI step. Our main\nresult is a bound on the error of the GWE step as a function of the error in\nthe GTI step. This error bound indicates that the GTI step should be solved\nusing an algorithm that approximates the similarity matrix by another matrix\nwhose entries have been thresholded to zero to have the desired type of graph\ntopology. The GTI stage can leverage existing methods (e.g., state of the art\napproaches for graph coloring) which are typically based on minimizing the\ntotal weight of removed edges. Since the GWE stage is formulated as an inverse\ncovariance estimation problem with linear constraints, it can be solved using\nexisting convex optimization methods.

A perturbative\nexpansion is developed which allows one to systematically determine the\nconstraint-induced finite-volume corrections to the free energy and to\ncorrelation functions. In particular, we focus on the Landau-Ginzburg model in\na film geometry (i.e., a rectangular parallelepiped with a small aspect ratio)\nwith periodic, Dirichlet, or Neumann boundary conditions in the transverse\ndirection and periodic boundary conditions in the remaining, lateral\ndirections.

The experimentally observed momentum dependence of the electron\nquasiparticle scattering rate is qualitatively reproduced, where the scattering\nrate is highly anisotropic in momentum space, and is intriguingly related to\nthe charge-order gap. Although the scattering strength appears to be weakest at\nthe hot spots, the scattering in the antinodal region is stronger than that in\nthe nodal region, which leads to the original electron Fermi surface is broken\nup into the Fermi pockets and their coexistence with the Fermi arcs located\naround the nodal region. In particular, this electron Fermi surface instability\ndrives the charge-order correlation, with the charge-order wave vector that\nmatches well with the wave vector connecting the hot spots, as the charge-order\ncorrelation in the hole-doped counterparts. However, in a striking contrast to\nthe hole-doped case, the charge-order wave vector in the electron-doped side\nincreases in magnitude with the electron doping. The theory also shows the\nexistence of a quantitative link between the single-electron fermiology and the\ncollective response of the electron density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 13:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 12:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

In echoing Varshney's seminal\nconcept of jointly transmitting both information and energy, we propose the\nso-called Generalised Precoded Spatial Modulation (GPSM) aided Integrated\nWireless Information and Power Transfer (IWIPT) concept employing a power-split\nreceiver. The principle of GPSM is that a particular subset of Receive Antennas\n(RA) is activated and the activation pattern itself conveys useful information.\nHence, the novelty of our GPSM aided IWIPT concept is that RA pattern-based\ninformation transfer is used in addition to the conventional waveform-based\ninformation carried by the classic M-ary modulation. Following the Radio\nFrequency (RF) to Direct Current (DC) power conversion invoked for WPT at the\npower-split receiver, the non-coherent detector simply compares the remaining\nreceived power accumulated by each legitimate RA pattern for the sake of\nidentifying the most likely RA. This operation is then followed by\ndown-conversion and conventional Base Band (BB) M-ary detection. Both our\nanalysis and simulations show that the RA pattern based information transfer\nrepresented in the Spatial Domain (SD) exhibits a beneficial immunity to any\npotential power conversion induced performance degradation and hence improves\nthe overall RE trade-off when additionally the waveform-based information\ntransfer is also taken into account. Moreover, we investigate the impact of\nrealistic imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) as well\nas that of the antenna correlations encountered.

Pendant capsule elastometry provides a new in-situ and\nnon-contact method for interfacial rheology of elastic capsules. Given an\nelastic model of the capsule membrane, pendant capsule elastometry determines\noptimal elastic moduli by fitting numerically generated axisymmetric shapes\noptimally to an experimental image.

VSMC melds variational inference\n(VI) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), providing practitioners with flexible,\naccurate, and powerful Bayesian inference. The VSMC family is a variational\nfamily that can approximate the posterior arbitrarily well, while still\nallowing for efficient optimization of its parameters. We demonstrate its\nutility on state space models, stochastic volatility models for financial data,\nand deep Markov models of brain neural circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 15:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 08:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

First,\nNS-imploding dark matter forms $\\sim 10^{-10}$ solar mass or smaller black\nholes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into\n$\\sim$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers\nseen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae seen by telescopes like\nDES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of \"black mergers\"\ncontaining $\\sim$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced\nneutron star implosions may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a\ndetectable, accompanying gravitational signal, which we call \"quiet kilonovae.\"\nUsing DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain quiet\nkilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and\nquiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding\ndark matter destroys most neutron stars at the centers of disc galaxies, so\nthat neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut at large\nradii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located\nto $\\sim$1 kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron\nstar implosions at $2 \\sigma$ confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon\ncross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current direct detection\nexperimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast\nradio bursts can be tested at $2 \\sigma$ confidence once 20 bursts are located\nin host galaxies by radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 18:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The scale factor oscillations were discovered in\nprevious work by analyzing the Hubble diagram for type 1a SNe data. In the\npresent work we analyze galaxy number count data from SDSSIII-BOSS, DR9 using a\nsimple oscillating expanding space model and also perform a Fourier analysis of\nthe same SDSSIII data set . The number distribution of galaxies on these scales\nshould be relatively smooth. However, a DR9 plot of galaxy number count per\n0.01 redshift bin as a function of redshift shows significant bumps to redshift\n0.5. Later releases show the same behavior. Our model fits essentially all\nbumps at 99.8% confidence once the oscillation is included. A Fourier analysis\nof the same number count vs. redshift data (processed only to convert redshift\nto equal time bins) clearly shows the dominant 7-cycle signal at 15/1\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The DR9 galaxy number count peaks near redshift 0.5 and\nthen falls off due to target magnitude limitations. In our model we assume\nideal observation to all redshifts. The oscillation model displays a matching\npeak at redshift 0.5, then falls, but continues on to rise predicting a second\npeak at redshift 0.64. Confirmation of the second peak from future SDSSIV data\nto higher redshift would further support our observation of oscillations in the\nscale factor. The oscillations may derive from a scalar field model of dark\nmatter as shown in our earlier work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 16:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

We explain the basic physics concepts behind these proposals,\nand discuss potential applications of topological antiferromagnetic\nspintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 18:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

Similarly the consequences of dam failure (flooding) can change for\nmany reasons such as growth in the population in areas below a dam.\nConsequently both the chance that a dam might fail and the likely consequences\nof that failure can change over time. It is therefore crucial that reservoir\nsafety risk analysis methods and decision-making processes are able to support\n(as a minimum) what-if testing (or sensitivity testing) to take into account\nthese changes over time to gauge their effect on the estimated risk of dam\nfailure. The consequences of a dam failure relate to the vulnerability and\nexposure of the receptors (for example, people, property and environment) to\nfloodwater. Also the probability of dam failure varies with age, design and\nconstruction of the dam. Spillway failure may be caused by the dissipation of\nenergy from water flowing down the spillway, and embankment erosion (scour) may\nbe caused by a dam overtopping. The occurrence of these events depends upon the\ndam design and the likelihood of extreme rainfall, also in the case of\novertopping wind-driven waves on the reservoir surface. In this study the\nmeteorological situations of notable recent events i.e. the Boltby, North\nYorkshire incident, 19 June 2005 in which the dam almost overtopped, and the\nspillway failure of the Ulley Dam near Rotherham at the end of June 2007, are\nstudied. The WRF numerical model will be used to indicate how these\nmeteorological situations might be maximized, and be coupled with the\noccurrence of other failure modes such as the likelihood of internal dam\nfailure assessed from previous work by government panel engineers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 09:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}
