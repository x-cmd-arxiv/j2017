We show that rotation\ndiagrams correctly estimate the gas kinetic temperature only if they are built\nfrom lines with the upper levels located in the same K-ladders, such as the\nJ_0-J_{-1}E lines at 157~GHz, the J_1-J_0E lines at 165~GHz or the J_2-J_1E\nlines at 25~GHz. The gas density should be no less than 10^7~cm^{-3}. Rotation\ndiagrams built from lines with different K values of the upper levels (2_K-1_K\nat 96~GHz, 3_K-2_K at 145~GHz, or 5_K-4_K at 241~GHz) significantly\nunderestimate the temperature but allow a density estimation. In addition, the\ndiagrams based on the 2_K-1_K lines make possible methanol column density\nestimates within a factor of about 2--5. We suggest that rotation diagrams\nshould be used in the following manner. First, one should build two rotation\ndiagrams, one from the lines at 96, 145, or 241~GHz, and another from the lines\nat 157, 165, or 25~GHz. The former diagram is used to estimate the gas density.\nIf the density is about 10^7~cm^{-3} or higher, the latter diagram reproduces\nthe temperature fairly well. If the density is around 10^6~cm^{-3}, the\ntemperature obtained from the latter diagram should be multiplied by a factor\nof 1.5--2. If the density is about 10^5~cm^{-3} or lower, then the latter\ndiagram yields a temperature that is lower than the kinetic temperature by a\nfactor of three or larger and should be used only as a lower limit on the\nkinetic temperature. Errors of methanol column density determined from the\nintegrated intensity of a single line may be larger than an order of magnitude\neven when the gas temperature is well-known. However, if the J_0-(J-1)_0E\nlines, as well as the J_1-(J-1)_1A^{+} or A^{-} lines are used, the relative\nerror of the column density proves to be no larger than several units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

However, this large gap and the fact that\n(so far) all the measured interactions look pretty much SM-like does not imply\nthat the linear Higgs representation as a complex doublet $\\phi$ in the SMEFT\nis always appropriate. Although there is a wide class of SM extensions that\naccept this linear description, this realization does not always provide a good\nperturbative expansion. The HEFT and its organization according to a chiral\nexpansion cures these issues. Path integral functional methods allow one to\ncompute the corrections to the NLO effective action: at tree level, the heavy\nresonances only contribute to the $O(p^4)$ low-energy couplings (or higher)\naccording to a pattern that depends on their quantum numbers and is suppressed\nby their masses; at the one-loop level, all the new-physics corrections go to\nthe $O(p^4)$ effective action (or higher) and are suppressed by an intrinsic\nscale of the LO HEFT Lagrangian, which has been related in recent times with\nthe curvature of the manifold of scalar fields (being the SM its flat limit and\nhaving the HEFT effective action an expansion in the curvature). This two\nsuppression scales (resonance masses and non-linearity/curvature) compete at\nNLO and may, in principle, be very different/similar depending on the\nparticular BSM scenario and the observable at hand. Likewise, experiments do\nnot tell us yet whether $O(p^4)$ loops are essentially negligible or not, as it\nis shown with a couple of examples. In summary, the HEFT extends the range of\napplicability of the SMEFT, which, although justified for a pretty wide class\nof BSM scenarios, introduces a bias in the data analyses and does not provide\nthe most general EFT framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

Consequently, it is still uncertain whether large changes in\natmospheric dust loading over the past century have slowed or accelerated\nanthropogenic climate change, or what the effects of potential future changes\nin dust loading will be. Here we present an analysis of the size and abundance\nof dust aerosols to constrain the direct radiative effect of dust.

Since coarse dust warms climate, the global dust direct\nradiative effect is likely to be less cooling than the ~-0.4 W/m2 estimated by\nmodels in a current global aerosol model ensemble. Instead, we constrain the\ndust direct radiative effect to a range between -0.48 and +0.20 W/m2, which\nincludes the possibility that dust causes a net warming of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 17:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy\nproduction: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field\namplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break\nthe electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs\nat two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an\nincrease of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven\nproton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror\nmodes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification\nexceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability.

This problem is\nparticularly important in the context of web applications, which typically\nundergo database refactoring either for performance or maintainability reasons.\nWhile web applications should have the same externally observable behavior\nbefore and after schema migration, there are no existing tools for proving\nequivalence of such programs. This paper takes a first step towards solving\nthis problem by formalizing the equivalence and refinement checking problems\nfor database-driven applications. We also propose a proof methodology based on\nthe notion of bisimulation invariants over relational algebra with updates and\ndescribe a technique for synthesizing such bisimulation invariants. We have\nimplemented the proposed technique in a tool called Mediator for verifying\nequivalence between database-driven applications written in our intermediate\nlanguage and evaluate our tool on 21 benchmarks extracted from textbooks and\nreal-world web applications. Our results show that the proposed methodology can\nsuccessfully verify 20 of these benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 18:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Nonparametric DCC has the potential of enlarging\nthe spectrum of analytical tools designed to assess the dynamic coupling and\nuncoupling of activity among brain areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Photon\nproduction is accumulated from the different processes at the various stages of\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions: from the primary hard photons of very early\nstage of parton collisions to the thermal photons from equilibrated quark-gluon\nand hadron gas stages. Along the way a hadronic medium evolution is treated in\ntwo distinct, in a sense opposite, approaches: chemically equilibrated and\nchemically frozen system expansion. Studying the centrality dependence of the\nresults obtained allows us to conclude that a relatively strong transverse\nmomentum anisotropy of thermal radiation is suppressed by prompt photon\nemission which is an isotropic. We find out that this effect is getting\nstronger as centrality increases because of the simultaneous increase in the\nrelative contribution of prompt photons in the soft part of the spectra. The\nsubstantial results obtained in iHKM with nonzero viscosity ($\\eta/s=0.08$) for\nphoton spectra and $v_2$ coefficients are mostly within the error bars of\nexperimental data, but there is some systematic underestimation of both\nobservables for the near central events.

The wavelike tidal responses\nin the fluid layer are in the form of magnetic-Coriolis waves, which are\nrestored by both the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force. Energy dissipation\noccurs through viscous damping and Ohmic damping of these waves. Our numerical\nresults show that the tidal dissipation can be dominated by Ohmic damping even\nwith a weak magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field smooths out the\ncomplicated frequency-dependence of the dissipation rate, and broadens the\nfrequency spectrum of the dissipation rate, depending on the strength of the\nbackground magnetic field. However, the frequency-averaged dissipation is\nindependent of the strength and structure of the magnetic field, and of the\ndissipative parameters, in the approximation that the wave-like response is\ndriven only by the Coriolis force acting on the non-wavelike tidal flow.\nIndeed, the frequency-averaged dissipation quantity is in good agreement with\nprevious analytical results in the absence of magnetic fields.

Recent\nexperimental and numerical investigations identify an instability of stripe\ndomains in the long direction as a means of nucleating isolated magnetic\nskyrmions. Here, the onset and nonlinear evolution of transverse instabilities\nfor a dynamic stripe domain known as the bion stripe are investigated. Both\nnon-topological and topological variants of the bion stripe are shown to\nexhibit a long-wavelength transverse instability with different characteristic\nfeatures. In the former, small transverse variations in the stripe's width lead\nto a neck instability that eventually pinches the non-topological stripe into a\nchain of two-dimensional breathers composed of droplet soliton pairs.

In our experiments on a\nserver with 32GB to 64GB of DRAM, BigSparse outperforms other in-memory and\nsemi-external graph analytics systems for algorithms such as PageRank,\nBreadthFirst Search, and Betweenness-Centrality for terabyte-size graphs with\nbillions of vertices. BigSparse is capable of highspeed analytics of much\nlarger graphs, on the same machine configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 01:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

In\nthis work, we integrate and unify two recent innovations that extend DMD to\nsystems with actuation [Proctor et al., 2016] and systems with heavily\nsubsampled measurements [Brunton et al., 2015]. When combined, these methods\nyield a novel framework for compressive system identification [code is publicly\navailable at: https://github.com/zhbai/cDMDc]. It is possible to identify a\nlow-order model from limited input-output data and reconstruct the associated\nfull-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to\nthe state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data is\navailable, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by\nfirst compressing the data. We demonstrate this unified framework on two model\nsystems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of\nmeasurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.),\ncompression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized,\nbroadband, etc.). In the first example, we explore this architecture on a test\nsystem with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state\ndimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application\ngiven by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This\nexample provides a challenging and realistic test-case for the proposed method,\nand results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well\ncharacterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 01:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

Our method uses the abstract\nsemantics of the underlying DSL to find a program $P$ whose abstract behavior\nsatisfies the examples. However, since program $P$ may be spurious with respect\nto the concrete semantics, our approach iteratively refines the abstraction\nuntil we either find a program that satisfies the examples or prove that no\nsuch DSL program exists. Because many programs have the same input-output\nbehavior in terms of their abstract semantics, this synthesis methodology\nsignificantly reduces the search space compared to existing techniques that use\npurely concrete semantics. While synthesis using abstraction refinement\n(SYNGAR) could be implemented in different settings, we propose a\nrefinement-based synthesis algorithm that uses abstract finite tree automata\n(AFTA). Our technique uses a coarse initial program abstraction to construct an\ninitial AFTA, which is iteratively refined by constructing a proof of\nincorrectness of any spurious program. In addition to ruling out the spurious\nprogram accepted by the previous AFTA, proofs of incorrectness are also useful\nfor ruling out many other spurious programs. We implement these ideas in a\nframework called \\tool. We have used the BLAZE framework to build synthesizers\nfor string and matrix transformations, and we compare BLAZE with existing\ntechniques. Our results for the string domain show that BLAZE compares\nfavorably with FlashFill, a domain-specific synthesizer that is now deployed in\nMicrosoft PowerShell.

Here, the results of the fitting using the extended\nBrinkman-Rice(BR) picture reveal the nodal constant Fermi energy with the\nmaximum carrier density, a constant Coulomb correlation strength\n$k_{BR}$=$U/U_c$>0.90, and a growing Fermi arc from the nodal Fermi point to\nthe isotropic Fermi surface with an increasing $x$. The growing of the Fermi\narc indicates that a superconducting gap develops with $x$ from the node to the\nanti-node. The large $k_{BR}$ results from the $d$-wave MIT for the pseudogap\nphase in lightly doped superconductors, which can be direct evidence for\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity. The quantum critical point is regarded as the\nnodal Fermi point satisfied with the BR picture. The experimentally-measured\nmass diverging behavior is an average effect and the true effective mass is\nconstant. As an application of the nodal constant carrier density, to find a\nsuperconducting node gap, the ARPES data and tunneling data are analyzed. The\nsuperconducting node gap is a precursor of $s$-wave symmetry in underdoped\ncuprates. The half-flux quantum, induced by the circulation of $d$-wave\nsupercurrent and observed by the phase sensitive Josephson-pi junction\nexperiments, is not shown due to anisotropic or asymmetric effect appearing in\nsuperconductors with trapped flux. The absence of $d$-wave superconducting\npairing symmetry is also revealed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 05:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 09:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Aims: To simulate and examine the dynamics and\nmulti-dimensional nature of wind structure resulting from the LDI. Methods: We\nintroduce a `pseudo-planar', `box-in-a-wind' method that allows us to\nefficiently compute the line-force in the radial and lateral directions, and\nthen use this approach to carry out 2D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of\nthe time-dependent wind. Results: Our 2D simulations show that the LDI first\nmanifests itself by mimicking the typical shell-structure seen in 1D models,\nbut how these shells then quickly break up into complex 2D density and velocity\nstructures, characterized by small-scale density `clumps' embedded in larger\nregions of fast and rarefied gas. Key results of the simulations are that\ndensity-variations in the well-developed wind statistically are quite isotropic\nand that characteristic length-scales are small; a typical clump size is ~0.01R\nat 2R, thus resulting also in rather low typical clump-masses ~10^17 g.\nOverall, our results agree well with the theoretical expectation that the\ncharacteristic scale for LDI-generated wind-structure is of order the Sobolev\nlength. We further confirm some earlier results that lateral `filling-in' of\nradially compressed gas leads to somewhat lower clumping factors in 2D\nsimulations than in comparable 1D models. We conclude by discussing an\nextension of our method toward rotating LDI wind models that exhibit an\nintriguing combination of large- and small-scale structure extending down to\nthe wind base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 10:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Particles in a low-density region are just diffusing and not\ninteracting. In this case one can avoid the costly integration of microscopic\nequations of motion, such as molecular dynamics (MD), and instead turn to an\nevent-based scheme in which the times to the next particle interaction and the\nnew particle positions at that time can be sampled. At high (local)\nconcentrations, however, e.g. when particles are interacting in a nontrivial\nway, particle positions must still be updated with small time steps of the\nmicroscopic dynamical equations.

Utilizing the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique\n(IACT) to reconstruct the energy and direction of incoming gamma-ray photons\nfrom the universe, several source-classes have been revealed by previous and\ncurrent generations of IACT telescopes (e.g. Whipple, MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS).\nThe next generation pointing IACT experiment, the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA), will provide increased sensitivity across a wider energy range and with\nbetter angular resolution. With the development of CTA, the future of IACT\npointing arrays is being directed towards having more and more telescopes (and\nhence cameras), and therefore the need to develop low-cost pixels with\nacceptable light-collection efficiency is clear. One of the primary paths to\nthe above goal is to replace Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) with Silicon-PMs\n(SiPMs) as the pixels in IACT telescope cameras. However SiPMs are not yet\nmature enough to replace PMTs for several reasons: sensitivity to unwanted\nlonger wavelengths while lacking sensitivity at short wavelengths, small\nphysical area, high cost, optical cross-talk and dark rates. Here we propose a\nnovel method to build relatively low-cost SiPM-based pixels utilising a disk of\nwavelength-shifting material, which overcomes some of these drawbacks by\ncollecting light over a larger area than standard SiPMs and improving\nsensitivity to shorter wavelengths while reducing background. We aim to\noptimise the design of such pixels, integrating them into an actual 7-pixel\ncluster which will be inserted into a MAGIC camera and tested during real\nobservations. Results of simulations, laboratory measurements and the current\nstatus of the cluster design and development will be presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 14:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

Motivated by finding an optimal boundary\nbetween the two classes, we invent a novel approach -- the principal boundary.\nFrom the perspective of classification, the principal boundary is defined as an\noptimal curve that moves in between the principal flows traced out from two\nclasses of data, and at any point on the boundary, it maximizes the margin\nbetween the two classes. We estimate the boundary in quality with its\ndirection, supervised by the two principal flows. We show that the principal\nboundary yields the usual decision boundary found by the support vector machine\nin the sense that locally, the two boundaries coincide. Some optimality and\nconvergence properties of the random principal boundary and its population\ncounterpart are also shown. We illustrate how to find, use and interpret the\nprincipal boundary with an application in real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 14:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 17:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}
