Although RGB values are sufficient to describe a\nspecific color sensation, they do not contain enough information to predict the\nRGB color that would result from a subtractive mixture of two specified RGB\ncolors. Methods do exist for accurately modeling subtractive mixture, such as\nthe Kubelka-Munk equations, but require extensive spectrophotometric\nmeasurements of the mixed components, making them unsuitable for many computer\ngraphics applications. This paper presents a strategy for modeling subtractive\ncolor mixture given only the RGB information of the colors being mixed, written\nfor a general audience. The RGB colors are first transformed to generic,\nrepresentative spectral distributions, and then this spectral information is\nused to perform the subtractive mixture, using the weighted\narithmetic-geometric mean. This strategy provides reasonable, representative\nsubtractive mixture colors with only modest computational effort and no\nexperimental measurements. As such, it provides a useful way to model\nsubtractive color mixture in computer graphics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Many algorithms, for example grid-based numerical PDE\nsolvers, have to access all neighbor cells of each grid cell during a grid\ntraversal. While the array indices of neighbors can be stored in a cell, they\nstill have to be computed for initialization or when the grid is adaptively\nrefined. A fast neighbor-finding algorithm can thus significantly improve the\nruntime of computations on multidimensional grids.\n  In this thesis, we show how neighbors on many regular grids ordered by\nspace-filling curves can be found in an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$.\nIn general, this assumes that the local orientation (i.e. a variable of a\ndescribing grammar) of the SFC inside the grid cell is known in advance, which\ncan be efficiently realized during traversals. Supported SFCs include Hilbert,\nPeano and Sierpinski curves in arbitrary dimensions. We assume that integer\narithmetic operations can be performed in $O(1)$, i.e. independent of the size\nof the integer. We do not deal with the case of adaptively refined grids here.\nHowever, it appears that a generalization of the algorithm to suitable adaptive\ngrids is possible. To formulate the neighbor-finding algorithm and prove its\ncorrectness and runtime properties, a modeling framework is introduced. This\nframework extends the idea of vertex-labeling to a description using grammars\nand matrices. With the sfcpp library, we provide a C++ implementation to render\nSFCs generated by such models and automatically compute all lookup tables\nneeded for the neighbor-finding algorithm. Furthermore, optimized\nneighbor-finding implementations for various SFCs are included for which we\nprovide runtime measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 11:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

In recent years, NiO\nattracted much attention as an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator material for\nspintronic devices [3-10]. Understanding the spin - phonon coupling in NiO is a\nkey to its functionalization, and enabling AF spintronics' promise of\nultra-high-speed and low-power dissipation [11,12]. However, despite its status\nas an exemplary AF insulator and a benchmark material for the study of\ncorrelated electron systems, little is known about the spin - phonon\ninteraction, and the associated energy dissipation channel, in NiO. In\naddition, there is a long-standing controversy over the large discrepancies\nbetween the experimental and theoretical values for the electron, phonon, and\nmagnon energies in NiO [13-23]. This gap in knowledge is explained by NiO\noptical selection rules, high Neel temperature and dominance of the magnon band\nin the visible Raman spectrum, which precludes a conventional approach for\ninvestigating such interaction. Here we show that by using ultraviolet (UV)\nRaman spectroscopy one can extract the spin - phonon coupling coefficients in\nNiO. We established that unlike in other materials, the spins of Ni atoms\ninteract more strongly with the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons than with the\ntransverse optical (TO) phonons, and produce opposite effects on the phonon\nenergies. The peculiarities of the spin - phonon coupling are consistent with\nthe trends given by density functional theory calculations. The obtained\nresults shed light on the nature of the spin - phonon coupling in AF insulators\nand may help in developing innovative spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

While lightcurve inversion is not plausible for individual targets\nwith scarce data, it is possible for large populations with thousands of\nasteroids, where the distributions of the shape and spin characteristics of the\npopulations are obtainable.\n  We aim to introduce a software implementation of a method that computes the\njoint shape elongation p and spin latitude beta distributions for a population,\nwith the brightness observations given in an asteroid database. Other main\ngoals are to include a method for performing validity checks of the algorithm,\nand a tool for a statistical comparison of populations.\n  The LEADER software package read the brightness measurement data for a\nuser-defined subpopulation from a given database. The observations were used to\ncompute estimates of the brightness variations of the population members. A\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) was constructed of these estimates. A\nsuperposition of known analytical basis functions yielded this CDF as a\nfunction of the (shape, spin) distribution. The joint distribution can be\nreconstructed by solving a linear constrained inverse problem. To test the\nvalidity of the method, the algorithm can be run with synthetic asteroid\nmodels, where the shape and spin characteristics are known, and by using the\ngeometries taken from the examined database.\n  LEADER is a fast and robust software package for solving shape and spin\ndistributions for large populations. There are major differences in the quality\nand coverage of measurements depending on the database used, so synthetic\nsimulations are always necessary before a database can be reliably used.

We measured the surface energy (through contact angle measurements) and\nelastic modulus (through Atomic Force Microscopy, AFM) of the Titan aerosol\nanalog (tholin).

In this work, we follow up on the\ninitial spectroscopic detection of C$_2$H$_3$CN on Titan by Palmer et al.\n(2017) with the detection of three new C$_2$H$_3$CN rotational emission lines\nat submillimeter frequencies. These new, high-resolution detections have\nallowed for the first spatial distribution mapping of C$_2$H$_3$CN on Titan. We\npresent simultaneous observations of C$_2$H$_5$CN, HC$_3$N, and CH$_3$CN\nemission, and obtain the first (tentative) detection of C$_3$H$_8$ (propane) at\nradio wavelengths. We present disk-averaged vertical abundance profiles,\ntwo-dimensional spatial maps, and latitudinal flux profiles for the observed\nnitriles. Similarly to HC$_3$N and C$_2$H$_5$CN, which are theorized to be\nshort-lived in Titan's atmosphere, C$_2$H$_3$CN is most abundant over the\nsouthern (winter) pole, whereas the longer-lived CH$_3$CN is more concentrated\nin the north. This abundance pattern is consistent with the combined effects of\nhigh-altitude photochemical production, poleward advection, and the subsequent\nreversal of Titan's atmospheric circulation system following the recent\ntransition from northern to southern winter. We confirm that C$_2$H$_3$CN and\nC$_2$H$_5$CN are most abundant at altitudes above 200 km. Using a 300 km step\nmodel, the average abundance of C$_2$H$_3$CN is found to be $3.03\\pm0.29$ ppb,\nwith a C$_2$H$_5$CN/C$_2$H$_3$CN abundance ratio of $2.43\\pm0.26$. Our HC$_3$N\nand CH$_3$CN spectra can be accurately modeled using abundance gradients above\nthe tropopause, with fractional scale-heights of $2.05\\pm0.16$ and\n$1.63\\pm0.02$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 17:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

The mass-richness relation of clusters offers an\nobservationally inexpensive way of estimating masses. Its calibration is\nessential for cluster and cosmological studies, especially for high-redshift\nclusters. Weak gravitational lensing magnification is a promising and\ncomplementary method to shear studies, that can be applied at higher redshifts.\nWe employed the weak lensing magnification method to calibrate the\nmass-richness relation up to a redshift of 1.4. We used the Spitzer Adaptation\nof the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS) galaxy cluster candidates\n($0.2<z<1.4$) and optical data from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)\nto test whether magnification can be effectively used to constrain the mass of\nhigh-redshift clusters. Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected using the $u$-band\ndropout technique and their colours were used as a background sample of\nsources. LBG positions were cross-correlated with the centres of the sample of\nSpARCS clusters to estimate the magnification signal measured for cluster\nsub-samples, binned in both redshift and richness. We detected a weak lensing\nmagnification signal for all bins at a detection significance of\n2.6-5.5$\\sigma$. In particular, the significance of the measurement for\nclusters with $z>1.0$ is 4.1$\\sigma$; for the entire cluster sample we obtained\nan average M$_{200}$ of $1.28^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ $\\times 10^{14} \\,\n\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Our measurements demonstrated the feasibility of using\nweak lensing magnification as a viable tool for determining the average halo\nmasses for samples of high redshift galaxy clusters. The results also\nestablished the success of using galaxy over-densities to select massive\nclusters at $z > 1$. Additional studies are necessary for further modelling of\nthe various systematic effects we discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

The instrument\ndesign uses a single, nearly contiguous volume of organic scintillator that is\ninternally subdivided only as necessary to create optically isolated pillars.\nScintillation light emitted in a given pillar is confined to that pillar by a\ncombination of total internal reflection and a specular reflector applied to\nthe four sides of the pillar transverse to its long axis. The scintillation\nlight is collected at each end of the pillar using a photodetector. In this\noptically segmented design, the (x, y) position of scintillation light emission\n(where the x and y coordinates are transverse to the long axis of the pillars)\nis estimated as the pillar's (x, y) position in the scintillator \"block\", and\nthe z-position (the position along the pillar's long axis) is estimated from\nthe amplitude and relative timing of the signals produced by the photodetectors\nat each end of the pillar. For proton recoils greater than 1 MeV, we show that\nthe (x, y, z)-position of neutron-proton scattering can be estimated with < 1\ncm root-mean-squared [RMS] error and the proton recoil energy can be estimated\nwith < 50 keV RMS error by fitting the photodetectors' response time history to\nmodels of optical photon transport within the scintillator pillars. Finally, we\nevaluate several alternative designs of this proposed single-volume scatter\ncamera made of pillars of plastic scintillator (SVSC-PiPS), studying the effect\nof pillar dimensions, scintillator material, and photodetector response vs.\ntime. Specifically, we conclude that an SVSC-PiPS constructed using EJ-204 and\nan MCP-PM will produce the most precise estimates of incident neutron direction\nand energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 19:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

We study two\nabstracted \"molecular\" models for size regulation: inhibitor dilution and\ninitiator accumulation. We apply the models to two settings: bacteria like\nEscherichia coli, that grow fully before they set a division plane and divide\ninto two equally sized cells, and cells that form a bud early in the cell\ndivision cycle, confine new growth to that bud, and divide at the connection\nbetween that bud and the mother cell, like the budding yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae. In budding cells, delaying cell division until buds reach the same\nsize as their mother leads to very weak size control, with average cell size\nand standard deviation of cell size increasing over time and saturating up to\n100-fold higher than those values for cells that divide when the bud is still\nsubstantially smaller than its mother. In budding yeast, both inhibitor\ndilution or initiator accumulation models are consistent with the observation\nthat the daughters of diploid cells add a constant volume before they divide.\nThis adder behavior has also been observed in bacteria. We find that in\nbacteria an inhibitor dilution model produces adder correlations that are not\nrobust to noise in the timing of DNA replication initiation or in the timing\nfrom initiation of DNA replication to cell division (the C + D period). In\ncontrast, in bacteria an initiator accumulation model yields robust adder\ncorrelations in the regime where noise in the timing of DNA replication\ninitiation is much greater than noise in the C + D period, as reported\npreviously [1].

Novelty of this\nalgorithm is to combine both points and lines correspondences in the camera\npose estimation which enables us to compute relative camera pose with a small\nnumber of feature correspondences. Our central idea is to exploit the\ntri-linear relationship between three views and generate a set of linear\nequations from the points and lines correspondences in the three views. The\ndesired solution to the system of equations are expressed as a linear\ncombination of the singular vectors and the coefficients are computed by\nsolving a small set of quadratic equations generated by imposing orthonormality\nconstraints for general camera motion.

On the one hand the equivalence principle in his two\nformulations is the starting point of all gravitational theories; yet there is\nno way to make it consistent with the non-relativistic formulation of QM.\nMoreover, the evaluation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a particle in an\naccelerated reference frame sheds light on a trajectory-dependent phase term\nsubject to proper time. On the other hand, the Bargmann theorem unmistakably\nproves that the Schr\\\"odinger equation does not admit any superposition of\ndifferent masses if the symmetry chosen for the system is the Galilean one.\nHowever, this is incompatible with relativity, since mass and energy are\nequivalent and one can certainly superimpose different energies.

However, the most accurate vision-based navigation\ntechniques are computationally expensive to run on low-cost mobile platforms.\nTherefore, the goal of this work was to develop a low-cost robot, controlled by\na Raspberry Pi, whose navigation system is based on vision. For this purpose,\nthe strategy used consisted in identifying obstacles via optical flow pattern\nrecognition. Through this signal, it is possible to infer the relative\ndisplacement between the robot and other elements in the environment. Its\nestimation was done using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which can be executed by\nthe Raspberry Pi without harming its performance. Finally, an SVM based\nclassifier was used to identify patterns of this signal associated with\nobstacles movement. The developed system was evaluated considering its\nexecution over an optical flow pattern dataset extracted from a real navigation\nenvironment.

We\nfind that the observed axial dipole moment becomes approximately constant\nduring the period of several years before each cycle minimum, which we call the\naxial dipole moment plateau. The cross-equatorial magnetic flux transport is\nfound to be small during the period, although the significant number of\nsunspots are still emerging. The results indicates that the newly emerged\nmagnetic flux does not contributes to the build up of the axial dipole moment\nnear the end of each cycle.

The predicted axial\ndipole moment of Cycle 24/25 minimum is 60--80 percent of Cycle 23/24 minimum,\nwhich suggests the amplitude of Cycle 25 even weaker than the current Cycle 24.\nConclusions.

The method is based on the observation that, in the\nmeasure-preserving ergodic setting, the moments of the spectral measure\nassociated to a given observable are computable from a single trajectory of\nthis observable. Having finitely many moments available, we use the classical\nChristoffel-Darboux kernel to separate the atomic and absolutely continuous\nparts of the spectrum, supported by convergence guarantees as the number of\nmoments tends to infinity. In addition, we propose a technique to detect the\nsingular continuous part of the spectrum as well as two methods to approximate\nthe spectral measure with guaranteed convergence in the weak topology,\nirrespective of whether the singular continuous part is present or not.

Our study is to answer the questions why this AR was so\nflare-productive and how the X9.3 flare, the largest one of the last decade,\ntook place. We find that there was a sunspot in the initial several days, and\nthen two bipolar regions emerged nearby it successively. Due to the standing of\nthe pre-existing sunspot, the movement of the bipoles was blocked, while the\npre-existing sunspot maintained its quasi-circular shaped umbra only with the\ndisappearance of a part of penumbra. Thus, the bipolar patches were\nsignificantly distorted, and the opposite polarities formed two semi-circular\nshaped structures. After that, two sequences of new bipolar regions emerged\nwithin the narrow semi-circular zone, and the bipolar patches separated along\nthe curved channel. The new bipoles sheared and interacted with the previous\nones, forming a complex topological system, during which numerous flares\noccurred. At the highly sheared region, a great deal of free energy was\naccumulated. On September 6, one negative patch near the polarity inversion\nline began to rapidly rotate and shear with the surrounding positive fields,\nand consequently the X9.3 flare erupted. Our results reveal that the\nblock-induced complex structures built the flare-productive AR and the X9.3\nflare was triggered by an erupting filament due to the kink instability. To\nbetter illustrate this process, a block-induced eruption model is proposed for\nthe first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 01:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

The relic abundance and the mass of the FIMP are determined by\nthe SUSY breaking scale and the feeble coupling. The gravitino, which is the\ncanonical dark matter candidate in the gauge mediation framework, contributes\nto the dark matter relic abundance along with the freeze-in of the FIMP. The\nhidden sector thus becomes two- component with both the FIMP and gravitino\nlodging in the SUSY breaking hidden sector.

With Bernal stacking structure, there are two types of lattice sites.\nOne corresponds to connected sites, where carbon atoms from each layer stack on\ntop of each other, and the other corresponds to disconnected sites. From our\ntheoretical study, a picture emerges in which the pronounced zero-energy peak\nin the local density of states does not attribute to zero-energy impurity\nstates associated to two different types of defects but to a collective\nphenomenon of the low-energy resonant states induced by the defect. To\ncorroborate this description, we numerically show that at small system size\n$N$, where $N$ is the number of unit cells, the zero-energy peak near the\ndefect scales as $1/\\ln N$ for the quasi-localized zero-energy state and as\n$1/N$ for the delocalized zero-energy state.

Pathologists are able to identify rosettes [full\ncircles] and the presence of partial rosettes [semi-circles] and interpret this\nas a sign of differentiation in a tumor. However, there is no objective method\nto quantitate the many partial rosettes that are obvious or not obvious to the\nnaked eye. This paper proposes a mathematical algorithm to computationally\ndetect the presence of obvious or non-obvious partial rosettes, henceforth\nreferred to as Nguyen-Wu Partial Rosettes. Quantifying the degree of partial\nrosettes present in a tumor may allow pathologists to stratify tumors into more\nrefined groups that may respond better to therapy or have different clinical\noutcomes. The Midline Cross Product [MCP] algorithm calculates the magnitude of\ntwo cross products and adds them together to obtain one value. Each of the two\ncross products results from [1] the line that connects the midpoints of longest\nlengths of two neighboring ovals, and [2] the line that extends from the\nmidpoint from one longest length and is perpendicular to that longest length.\nThe MCP algorithm makes nuclei that are arranged in consecutive rows and arches\nquantitatively distinct from nuclei that are arranged next to each other in a\ndisorderly manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 06:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

We show that a simple disambiguation of the input text can lead\nto consistent performance improvement on multiple topic categorization and\npolarity detection datasets, particularly when the fine granularity of the\nunderlying sense inventory is reduced and the document is sufficiently large.\nOur results also point to the need for sense representation research to focus\nmore on in vivo evaluations which target the performance in downstream NLP\napplications rather than artificial benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

Based on these stress tensor\nreconstructions, we derive an a posteriori error estimate distinguishing the\ndiscretization, linearization, and quadrature error estimates, and propose an\nadaptive algorithm balancing these different error sources. We prove the\nefficiency of the estimate, and confirm it on a numerical test with analytical\nsolution for the linear elasticity problem. We then apply the adaptive\nalgorithm to a more application-oriented test, considering the Hencky--Mises\nand an isotropic damage models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

Eynard and N. Orantin in 2007. Since its creation,\nthe range of applications of the topological recursion has been growing and\nmany results in different fields have been obtained. The first aspect that I\nwill develop deals with the historical domain of the topological recursion:\nrandom matrix integrals. I will review the formalism of the topological\nrecursion as well as how it can be used to obtain asymptotic $\\frac{1}{N}$\nseries expansion of various matrix integrals. In particular, a key feature of\nthe topological recursion is that it can recover from the leading order of the\nasymptotic all sub-leading orders with elementary computations. This method is\nparticularly well known and fruitful in the case of hermitian matrix integrals,\nbut I will also show that the general method can be used to cover integrals\nwith hard edges, integrals over unitary matrices and much more. In the end, I\nwill also briefly mention the generalization to $\\beta$-ensembles. In a second\nchapter, I will review the connection between the topological recursion and the\nstudy of integrable systems having a Lax pair representation. Most of the\nresults presented there will be illustrated by the case of the famous six\nPainlev\\'e equations. Though the formalism used in this chapter may look\ncompletely disconnected from the previous one, it is well known that the local\nstatistics of eigenvalues in random matrix theory exhibit a universality\nphenomenon and that the encountered universal systems are precisely driven by\nsome solutions of the Painlev\\'{e} equations. As I will show, the connection\ncan be made very explicit with the topological recursion formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 12:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 08:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

The jet is produced inside a wettable thin tube partially\nsubmerged in a liquid. The gas-liquid interface inside the tube, which is\ninitially concave, is kept much deeper than that outside the tube. An impulsive\nforce applied at the bottom of a liquid container leads to significant\nacceleration of the liquid inside the tube followed by flow-focusing due to the\nconcave interface. The jet generation process can be divided into two parts\nthat occur in different time scales, i.e. the Impact time (impact duration $\\le\nO(10^{-4})$ s) and Focusing time (focusing duration $\\gg O(10^{-4})$ s). In\nImpact time, the liquid accelerates suddenly due to the impact. In Focusing\ntime, the microjet emerges due to flow-focusing. In order to explain the sudden\nacceleration inside the tube in Impact time, we develop a physical model based\non a pressure impulse approach. Numerical simulations confirm the proposed\nmodel, indicating that the basic mechanism of the acceleration of the liquid\ndue to the impulsive force is elucidated. Remarkably, the viscous effect is\nnegligible in Impact time. In contrast, in Focusing time, the viscosity plays\nan important role in the microjet generation. We experimentally and numerically\ninvestigate the velocity of microjets with various viscosities. We find that\nhigher viscosities lead to reduction of the jet velocity, which can be\ndescribed by using Reynolds number (the ratio between the inertia force and the\nviscous force).

Here, we\nhave demonstrated that the presence of (Anti)-de Sitter spaces as the\nbackground solution, spontaneously breaks the local Weyl symmetry, whereas the\nradiative corrections at two-loop level breaks the symmetry in flat vacuum. The\nbreaking of Weyl symmetry fixes all the dimensionful parameters and provides\nmasses to spin-2 and spin-1 particles as in the Higgs mechanism. Secondly, we\ncalculated the tree-level scattering amplitude in the cosmological TMG plus the\nFierz-Pauli mass term in (Anti)-de Sitter spaces and accordingly found the\nrelevant weak field potential energies between two covariantly conserved\nlocalized point-like spinning sources.

Increasing the number of the chromophores\nincreases the number of dark states and the associated enhanced energy\nconversion efficiency, yet also delocalizes excitations away from the trapping\ncenter and reduces the energy conversion rate. Therefore, a competition between\ndark state protection and delocalization must be considered when designing the\noptimal size of a light harvesting system. In this study, we explore the two\ncompeting mechanisms in a chain-structured antenna and show that dark state\nprotection is the dominant mechanism, with an intriguing dependence on the\nparity of the number of chromophores.

We compare the proposed dual-channel\nmodel with a simple single model and show it improves the overall performance\nof neural networks on various types of quality degraded input datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 15:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

The Bethe-Salpeter equation with these particle propagators is\nstudied in the ladder approximation.

The continuous phase transition from the $A$-phase to the polar\nphase, i.e. in the transition from the Weyl nodes to the Dirac nodal line and\nback, allows one to follow the behavior of the fermionic and bosonic effective\nactions when the sign of the tetrad determinant changes, and the effective\nchiral space-time transforms to anti-chiral \"anti-spacetime\". This condensed\nmatter realization demonstrates that while the original fermionic action is\nanalytic across the transition, the effective action for the orbital degrees of\nfreedom (pseudo-EM) fields and gravity have non-analytic behavior. In\nparticular, the action for the pseudo-EM field in the vacuum with Weyl fermions\n(A-phase) contains the modulus of the tetrad determinant. In the vacuum with\nthe degenerate metric (polar phase) the nodal line is effectively a family of\n$2+1$d Dirac fermion patches, which leads to a non-analytic $(B^2-E^2)^{3/4}$\nQED action in the vicinity of the Dirac line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 14:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 15:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The ability to control\nand modify biasing voltages at the two terminals of memristors make them\npromising candidates to perform matrix-vector multiplications and solve systems\nof linear equations. In this article, we discuss how networks of memristors\narranged in crossbar arrays can be used for efficiently solving optimization\nand machine learning problems. We introduce a new memristor-based optimization\nframework that combines the computational merit of memristor crossbars with the\nadvantages of an operator splitting method, alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). Here, ADMM helps in splitting a complex optimization\nproblem into subproblems that involve the solution of systems of linear\nequations. The capability of this framework is shown by applying it to linear\nprogramming, quadratic programming, and sparse optimization. In addition to\nADMM, implementation of a customized power iteration (PI) method for\neigenvalue/eigenvector computation using memristor crossbars is discussed. The\nmemristor-based PI method can further be applied to principal component\nanalysis (PCA). The use of memristor crossbars yields a significant speed-up in\ncomputation, and thus, we believe, has the potential to advance optimization\nand machine learning research in artificial intelligence (AI).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 15:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

For example, rainfall data\nmeasured daily by rain gauges can be considered at daily, monthly or annual\ntemporal scales, and local, grid-wise, region-wise or country-wise spatial\nscales. In this work, we focus on detection of anomalies in such multi-scale\nspatio-temporal data. We consider an anomaly as an event where the measured\nvalues over a spatio-temporally extended region are significantly different\nfrom their long-term means. However we aim to avoid setting any thresholds on\nthe measured values and spatio-temporal sizes, because not only are thresholds\nsubjective but also the long-term mean values often vary spatially and\ntemporally. For this purpose we use spatio-Temporal Markov Random Field, where\nlatent states indicate anomaly type (positive anomaly, negative anomaly, no\nanomaly/normal). Spatio-temporal coherence is maintained through suitable edge\npotentials. The model is extended to multiple spatio-temporal scales to achieve\nour second goal: anomalies at any scale should be defined both on the data at\nthat scale, and also on anomalies at other scales. This allows us to trace an\nanomaly at a coarse scale to finer scales. For example, whether rainfall in a\nparticular year is anomalous over a region should depend not only on the total\nvolume of rainfall over the entire region, but also on whether there were such\nanomalies at the grid-scale, and the monthly scale. We use this approach to\nstudy rainfall anomalies over India -extremely diverse with respect to\nrainfall- for the period 1901-2011, and show its benefits over existing\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 10:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-02"}
