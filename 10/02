These ancilla\nstates are usually logical stabilizer states of the data code blocks, which are\ngenerally difficult to prepare if the code size is large.

However, it already has\nbeen demonstrated that software vulnerabilities give an attacker ample\nopportunity to insert arbitrary code into the program. This code can then\nmodify the data flow of the program and leak any secret in the program to an\nobserver in the cloud via SGX side-channels. Since any larger program is rife\nwith software vulnerabilities, it is not a good idea to outsource entire\nprograms to an SGX enclave. A secure alternative with a small trusted code base\nwould be fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) -- the holy grail of encrypted\ncomputation. However, due to its high computational complexity it is unlikely\nto be adopted in the near future. As a result researchers have made several\nproposals for transforming programs to perform encrypted computations on less\npowerful encryption schemes. Yet, current approaches fail on programs that make\ncontrol-flow decisions based on encrypted data. In this paper, we introduce the\nconcept of data flow authentication (DFAuth). DFAuth prevents an adversary from\narbitrarily deviating from the data flow of a program. Hence, an attacker\ncannot perform an attack as outlined before on SGX.

Prior works have claimed\nthat CF Massive MIMO inherits the basic properties of cellular Massive MIMO,\nnamely channel hardening and favorable propagation.

The fact that disc galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe\nsuggests that a quiescent history is not necessary for their formation. Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers. We extract a sample of approximately 100 disc\ngalaxies and follow the changes in their post-merger morphologies, as tracked\nby their disc-to-total ratios (D/T). We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions. We find that\napproximately half of present-day disc galaxies underwent at least one merger\nwith a satellite of total mass exceeding the host system's stellar mass, a\nthird had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar\nmass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding\n10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often\ntemporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually\ndisrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are\nrequired post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a\nfew Gyrs before z=0).

Operators have to make provisions for sudden traffic bursts and\nnetwork failures to assure uninterrupted operations. In practice, traffic\naverages are used to roughly estimate required capacity. More accurate\nsolutions often require traffic statistics easily obtained from packet\ncaptures, e.g. variance. Our investigations on real Internet traffic have\nemphasized that the traffic shows high variations at small aggregation times,\nwhich indicates that the traffic is self-similar and has a heavy-tailed\ncharacteristics. Self-similarity and heavy-tailedness are of great importance\nfor network capacity planning purposes. Traffic modeling process should\nconsider all Internet traffic characteristics. Thereby, the quality of service\n(QoS) of the network would not affected by any mismatching between the real\ntraffic properties and the reference statistical model.\n  This paper proposes a new class of traffic profiles that is better suited for\nmetering bursty Internet traffic streams. We employ bandwidth provisioning to\ndetermine the lowest required bandwidth capacity level for a network link, such\nthat for a given traffic load, a desired performance target is met. We validate\nour approach using packet captures from real IP-based networks.\n  The proposed link dimensioning approach starts by measuring the statistical\nparameters of the available traces, and then the degree of fluctuations in the\ntraffic has been measured. This is followed by choosing a proper model to fit\nthe traffic such as lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions.\nFinally, the optimal capacity for the link can be estimated by deploying the\nbandwidth provisioning approach. It has been shown that the heavy tailed\ndistributions give more precise values for the link capacity than the Gaussian\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 21:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

At this time, meteorites and interplanetary dust particles\ndelivered organics such as nucleobases (the characteristic molecules of\nnucleotides) to warm little ponds whose wet-dry cycles promoted rapid\npolymerization. We build a comprehensive numerical model for the evolution of\nnucleobases in warm little ponds leading to the emergence of the first\nnucleotides and RNA. We couple Earth's early evolution with complex prebiotic\nchemistry in these environments. We find that RNA polymers must have emerged\nvery quickly after the deposition of meteorites (< a few years). Their\nconstituent nucleobases were primarily meteoritic in origin and not from\ninterplanetary dust particles. Ponds appeared as continents rose out of the\nearly global ocean but this increasing availability of \"targets\" for meteorites\nwas offset by declining meteorite bombardment rates. Moreover, the rapid losses\nof nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation\nduring dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their\npolymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles. Under\nthese conditions, RNA polymers likely appeared prior to 4.17 billion years ago.\n  Significance: There are two competing hypotheses for the site at which an RNA\nworld emerged: hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and warm little ponds.\nBecause the former lacks wet and dry cycles, which are well known to promote\npolymerization (in this case, of nucleotides into RNA), we construct a\ncomprehensive model for the origin of RNA in the latter sites.

In particular, we modify QSRLib, a library that allows\ncomputation of Qualitative Spatial Relations and Calculi, and employ it for\nfeature extraction, before inputting features into our neural network models.\nUsing an experimental setup involving motion captures of human-object\ninteraction as three dimensional inputs, we observe that the use of qualitative\nspatial features significantly improves the performance of our machine learning\nalgorithm against our baseline, while quantitative features of similar kinds\nfail to deliver similar improvement. We also observe that sequential\nrepresentations of QSR features yield the best classification performance.

Well-motivated theories beyond the\nStandard Model contain viable dark matter candidates which could lead to a\ndetectable signal of antideuterons resulting from the annihilation or decay of\ndark matter particles. The dark matter contribution to the antideuteron flux is\nbelieved to be especially large at low energies (E < 1 GeV), where the\npredicted flux from conventional astrophysical sources (i.e. from secondary\ninteractions of cosmic rays) is very low. The GAPS low-energy antiproton search\nwill provide stringent constraints on less than 10 GeV dark matter, will\nprovide the best limits on primordial black hole evaporation on Galactic length\nscales, and will explore new discovery space in cosmic ray physics.\n  Unlike other antimatter search experiments such as BESS and AMS that use\nmagnetic spectrometers, GAPS detects antideuterons and antiprotons using an\nexotic atom technique.

As a result, varying the metallicity qualitatively\nchanges the way that the radiative feedback suppresses the accretion flow. With\na fixed accretion rate of $10^{-3}M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr^{-1}}$, the both direct and\ndiffuse lights jointly operate to prevent the mass accretion at $Z \\gtrsim\n10^{-1}Z_{\\odot}$.

However, these networks can be easily fooled by adversarial\nperturbations: minimal changes to correctly-classified inputs, that cause the\nnetwork to mis-classify them. This phenomenon represents a concern for both\nsafety and security, but it is currently unclear how to measure a network's\nrobustness against such perturbations. Existing techniques are limited to\nchecking robustness around a few individual input points, providing only very\nlimited guarantees. We propose a novel approach for automatically identifying\nsafe regions of the input space, within which the network is robust against\nadversarial perturbations. The approach is data-guided, relying on clustering\nto identify well-defined geometric regions as candidate safe regions. We then\nutilize verification techniques to confirm that these regions are safe or to\nprovide counter-examples showing that they are not safe. We also introduce the\nnotion of targeted robustness which, for a given target label and region,\nensures that a NN does not map any input in the region to the target label.

In addition, we\nshow that specifically designed microcavities can also offer further\nadvantages, such as compatibility with existing telecom standard (thus allowing\nto exploit the existing fiber network) and quantum memories (necessary in turns\nto extend the communication distance), as well as longitudinal multimode\ncharacter. This last property (i.e. the increased dimensionality necessary for\ndescribing the quantum state of a photon) is achieved thanks to the generating\nmultiple photon pairs on a frequency comb corresponding to the microcavity\nresonances. Further achievements include the possibility to fully exploit the\npolarization degree of freedom also for integrated devices. These results pave\nthe way to the generation of integrated quantum frequency combs, that in turn\nmay find application as quantum computing platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 06:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Our analysis shows that GCI\nfusion with labeled multi-object densities strongly relies on label\nconsistencies between local multi-object posteriors at different sensor nodes,\nand hence suffers from a severe performance degradation when perfect label\nconsistencies are violated. Moreover, we mathematically analyze this phenomenon\nfrom the perspective of Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information and the\nso called yes-object probability. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a novel\nand general solution for the distributed fusion with labeled multi-object\ndensities that is robust to label inconsistencies between sensors.\nSpecifically, the labeled multi-object posteriors are firstly marginalized to\ntheir unlabeled posteriors which are then fused using GCI method.

Convolution is the differentiator of\nCNNs in that it can powerfully model the higher-level representation of a word\nby taking into account its local fixed-size context in the input text t^x. In\nthis work, we propose an attentive convolution network, ATTCONV. It extends the\ncontext scope of the convolution operation, deriving higher-level features for\na word not only from local context, but also information extracted from\nnonlocal context by the attention mechanism commonly used in RNNs. This\nnonlocal context can come (i) from parts of the input text t^x that are distant\nor (ii) from extra (i.e., external) contexts t^y. Experiments on sentence\nmodeling with zero-context (sentiment analysis), single-context (textual\nentailment) and multiple-context (claim verification) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ATTCONV in sentence representation learning with the\nincorporation of context. In particular, attentive convolution outperforms\nattentive pooling and is a strong competitor to popular attentive RNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 07:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The ability to automatically select scientifically-important\ntransient events from an alert stream of many such events, and to conduct\nfollow-up observations in response, will become increasingly important in\nastronomy. With wide-angle time domain surveys pushing to fainter limiting\nmagnitudes, the capability to follow-up on transient alerts far exceeds our\nfollow-up telescope resources, and effective target prioritization becomes\nessential. The RoboNet-II microlensing program is a pathfinder project which\nhas developed an automated target selection process (RoboTAP) for gravitational\nmicrolensing events which are observed in real-time using the Las Cumbres\nObservatory telescope network. Aims. Follow-up telescopes typically have a much\nsmaller field-of-view compared to surveys, therefore the most promising\nmicrolens- ing events must be automatically selected at any given time from an\nannual sample exceeding 2000 events. The main challenge is to select between\nevents with a high planet detection sensitivity, aiming at the detection of\nmany planets and characterizing planetary anomalies. Methods. Our target\nselection algorithm is a hybrid system based on estimates of the planet\ndetection zones around a microlens. It follows automatic anomaly alerts and\nrespects the expected survey coverage of specific events. Results. We introduce\nthe RoboTAP algorithm, whose purpose is to select and prioritize microlensing\nevents with high sensitivity to planetary companions. In this work, we\ndetermine the planet sensitivity of the RoboNet follow-up program and provide a\nworking example of how a broker can be designed for a real-life transient\nscience program conducting follow-up observations in response to alerts,\nexploring the issues that will confront similar programs being developed for\nthe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other time domain surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 08:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Duplex ultrasound is a modality\nin which an ultrasound system is used for displaying simultaneously both B-mode\nimages and spectral Doppler data. In B-mode imaging short wide-band pulses are\nused to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in the images. In contrast, for\nDoppler imaging, narrow-band pulses are preferred in order to attain increased\nspectral resolution. Thus, the acquisition time must be shared between the two\nsequences. In this work, we propose a non-uniform slow-time transmission scheme\nfor spectral Doppler, based on nested arrays, which reduces the number of\npulses needed for accurate spectrum recovery. We derive the minimal number of\nDoppler emissions needed, using this approach, for perfect reconstruction of\nthe blood spectrum in a noise-free environment. Next, we provide two spectrum\nrecovery techniques which achieve this minimal number. The first method\nperforms efficient recovery based on the fast Fourier transform. The second\nallows for continuous recovery of the Doppler frequencies, thus avoiding\noff-grid error leakage, at the expense of increased complexity. The performance\nof the techniques is evaluated using realistic Field II simulations as well as\nin vivo measurements, producing accurate spectrograms of the blood velocities\nusing a significant reduced number of transmissions.

Each base station (BS) serves\nmultiple groups of users by forming a single beam with common information per\ngroup. We propose centralized and distributed beamforming algorithms for two\ndifferent optimization targets. The first objective is to minimize the total\ntransmission power of all the BSs while guaranteeing the user-specific minimum\nquality-of-service targets. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is used to\napproximate the non-convex multicast problem as a semidefinite program (SDP),\nwhich is solvable via centralized processing. Subsequently, two alternative\ndistributed methods are proposed. The first approach turns the SDP into a\ntwo-level optimization via primal decomposition. At the higher level,\ninter-cell interference powers are optimized for fixed beamformers while the\nlower level locally optimizes the beamformers by minimizing BS-specific\ntransmit powers for the given inter-cell interference constraints. The second\ndistributed solution is enabled via an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers, where the inter-cell interference optimization is divided into a\nlocal and a global optimization by forcing the equality via consistency\nconstraints. We further propose a centralized and a simple distributed\nbeamforming design for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nbalancing problem in which the minimum SINR among the users is maximized with\ngiven per-BS power constraints. This problem is solved via the bisection method\nas a series of SDP feasibility problems.

Since many\nexisting 3D file formats encode color and translucency by RGBA textures mapped\nto 3D shapes, RGBA information is particularly important for practical\napplications. In contrast to color (encoded by RGB), which is specified by the\nobject's reflectance, selected viewing conditions and a standard observer,\ntranslucency (encoded by A) is neither linked to any measurable physical nor\nperceptual quantity. Thus, reproducing translucency encoded by A is open for\ninterpretation.\n  In this paper, we propose a rigorous definition for A suitable for use in\ngraphical 3D printing, which is independent of the 3D printing hardware and\nsoftware, and which links both optical material properties and perceptual\nuniformity for human observers. By deriving our definition from the absorption\nand scattering coefficients of virtual homogeneous reference materials with an\nisotropic phase function, we achieve two important properties. First, a simple\nadjustment of A is possible, which preserves the translucency appearance if an\nobject is re-scaled for printing. Second, determining the value of A for a real\n(potentially non-homogeneous) material, can be achieved by minimizing a\ndistance function between light transport measurements of this material and\nsimulated measurements of the reference materials. Such measurements can be\nconducted by commercial spectrophotometers used in graphic arts.\n  Finally, we conduct visual experiments employing the method of constant\nstimuli, and derive from them an embedding of A into a nearly perceptually\nuniform scale of translucency for the reference materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 09:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 09:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

Different channels and persons can be compared when they are measured\nwith the same device and prefiltering options.

When they\nannihilate with each other, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition\nfrom three-dimensional Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase to a band insulator phase\nsuch as Chern band insulator (CI) phase. The phase transition is described by a\nnew critical theory with a `magnetic dipole' like object in the momentum space.\nIn this paper, we reveal that the critical theory hosts a novel disorder-driven\nquantum multicritical point, which is encompassed by three quantum phases,\nrenormalized WSM phase, CI phase, and diffusive metal (DM) phase. Based on the\nrenormalization group argument, we first clarify scaling properties around the\nband touching points at the quantum multicritical point as well as all phase\nboundaries among these three phases. Based on numerical calculations of\nlocalization length, density of states and critical conductance distribution,\nwe next prove that a localization-delocalization transition between the CI\nphase with a finite zero-energy density of states (zDOS) and DM phase belongs\nto an ordinary 3D unitary class. Meanwhile, a localization-delocalization\ntransition between the Chern insulator phase with zero zDOS and a renormalized\nWeyl semimetal (WSM) phase turns out to be a direct phase transition whose\ncritical exponent $\\nu=0.80\\pm 0.01$. We interpret these numerical results by a\nrenormalization group analysis on the critical theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 10:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2017 03:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2017 07:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Purpose: We\nemploy the time-dependent nucleon localization function (NLF) to reveal\nstructure of pre-compound states in nuclear reactions involving light and\nmedium-mass ions. We primarily focus on spin saturated systems with N = Z.\nFurthermore, we study reactions with oxygen and carbon ions, for which\nexperimental evidence for {\\alpha} clustering in pre-compound states exists.\nMethod: We utilize the symmetry-free TDDFT approach and compute the NLFs to\ndescribe $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, and\n$^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier.\nResults: We show that NLFs reveal a variety of time-dependent modes involving\ncluster structures. For instance, the $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O collision results in\na vibrational mode of a quasi-molecular \\alpha-$^{12}$C-$^{12}$C-\\alpha{}\nstate.

Conclusion: The time-dependent NLF is a good indicator of clusters\nstructures in complex pre-compound states formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions.\nThe localization reveals the presence of collective vibrations involving\ncluster structures, which dominate the initial dynamics of the fusing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 11:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

This system is monitored by a weak probe field, and at the same time\ndriven at various powers by a stronger microwave tone. We show that the\ntransition from the quantum to the classical regime is accompanied by a rapid\nincrease of the transmon occupation and, consequently that the qubit\napproximation is valid only in the extreme quantum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 11:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 08:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

With\nthe recent advances in deep learning, in particular distributed representation\nof words (a.k.a. word embeddings), we present a novel ER system, called DeepER,\nthat achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, as well as ease-of-use (i.e.,\nmuch less human efforts). For accuracy, we use sophisticated composition\nmethods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with\nlong short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a\ndistributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to\neffectively capture similarities between tuples. We consider both the case\nwhere pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are\nnot; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations. For\nefficiency, we propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking\napproach that uses distributed representations of tuples; it takes all\nattributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks,\ncompared with traditional methods that consider only a few attributes. For\nease-of-use, DeepER requires much less human labeled data and does not need\nfeature engineering, compared with traditional machine learning based\napproaches which require handcrafted features, and similarity functions along\nwith their associated thresholds.

The\nmodel of differential privacy has emerged as an accepted model to release\nsensitive information while giving a statistical guarantee for privacy. Many\ndifferent algorithms are possible to address different target functions. We\nfocus on the core problem of count queries, and seek to design mechanisms to\nrelease data associated with a group of n individuals. Prior work has focused\non designing mechanisms by raw optimization of a loss function, without regard\nto the consequences on the results. This can leads to mechanisms with\nundesirable properties, such as never reporting some outputs (gaps), and\noverreporting others (spikes). We tame these pathological behaviors by\nintroducing a set of desirable properties that mechanisms can obey. Any\ncombination of these can be satisfied by solving a linear program (LP) which\nminimizes a cost function, with constraints enforcing the properties. We focus\non a particular cost function, and provide explicit constructions that are\noptimal for certain combinations of properties, and show a closed form for\ntheir cost. In the end, there are only a handful of distinct optimal mechanisms\nto choose between: one is the well-known (truncated) geometric mechanism; the\nsecond a novel mechanism that we introduce here, and the remainder are found as\nthe solution to particular LPs. These all avoid the bad behaviors we identify.\nWe demonstrate in a set of experiments on real and synthetic data which is\npreferable in practice, for different combinations of data distributions,\nconstraints, and privacy parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 12:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Many of these applications\nare not latency-sensitive and thus can run as batch jobs in data centers. By\nrunning multiple applications on a computing host, task co-location can\nsignificantly improve the server utilization and system throughput. However,\neffective task co-location is a non-trivial task, as it requires an\nunderstanding of the computing resource requirement of the co-running\napplications, in order to determine what tasks, and how many of them, can be\nco-located.\n  In this paper, we present a mixture-of-experts approach to model the memory\nbehavior of Spark applications. We achieve this by learning, off-line, a range\nof specialized memory models on a range of typical applications; we then\ndetermine at runtime which of the memory models, or experts, best describes the\nmemory behavior of the target application. We show that by accurately\nestimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can\neffectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host\nto improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and\nCPU requirements of co-running application tasks. Our technique is applied to a\nset of representative data analytic applications built upon the Apache Spark\nframework. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average\nnormalized turnaround time on a multi-core cluster. Our approach achieves over\n83.9% of the performance delivered using an ideal memory predictor. We obtain,\non average, 8.69x improvement on system throughput and a 49% reduction on\nturnaround time over executing application tasks in isolation, which translates\nto a 1.28x and 1.68x improvement over a state-of-the-art co-location scheme for\nsystem throughput and turnaround time respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 12:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In this work, we resort to multitaper spectral\nanalysis to create visually interpretable images of sleep patterns from EEG\nsignals as inputs to a deep convolutional network trained to solve visual\nrecognition tasks. As a working example of transfer learning, a system able to\naccurately classify sleep stages in new unseen patients is presented.\nEvaluations in a widely-used publicly available dataset favourably compare to\nstate-of-the-art results, while providing a framework for visual interpretation\nof outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 13:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In particular, they gave rise to the design of various quantifiers\n(statistical complexity measures) of the internal complexity of a (quantum)\nsystem. In this paper, we introduce a three-parametric Fisher-R\\'enyi\ncomplexity, named $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Fisher--R\\'enyi complexity. This\ncomplexity measure quantifies the combined balance of the spreading and the\ngradient contents of $\\rho$, and has the three main properties of a statistical\ncomplexity: the invariance under translation and scaling transformations, and a\nuniversal bounding from below. The latter is proved by generalizing the Stam\ninequality, which lowerbounds the product of the Shannon entropy power and the\nFisher information of a probability density function. An extension of this\ninequality was already proposed by Bercher and Lutwak, a particular case of the\ngeneral one, where the three parameters are linked, allowing to determine the\nsharp lower bound and the associated probability density with minimal\ncomplexity. Using the notion of differential-escort deformation, we are able to\ndetermine the sharp bound of the complexity measure even when the three\nparameters are decoupled (in a certain range). We determine as well the\ndistribution that saturates the inequality: the $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Gaussian\ndistribution, which involves an inverse incomplete beta function. Finally, the\ncomplexity measure is calculated for various quantum-mechanical states of the\nharmonic and hydrogenic systems, which are the two main prototypes of physical\nsystems subject to a central potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 15:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Corridors are\nthus regions within a given landscape that connect fragmented habitat patches\nwithin the landscape. The major concern of designing corridors as a\nconservation strategy is primarily to counter, and to the extent possible,\nmitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of\nthe landscape, as well as support continuance of land use for essential local\nand global economic activities in the region of reference.

We identify the parameters which would affect the\ntiger population in a landscape complex and using the presence of these\nidentified parameters construct a graph using the habitat patches supporting\ntiger presence in the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths\nbetween them as edges. The passage of tigers through the possible paths have\nbeen modelled as an Assurance game, with tigers as an individual player. The\ngame is played recursively as the tiger passes through each grid considered for\nthe model. The iteration causes the tiger to choose the most suitable path\nsignifying the emergence of adaptability. As a formal explanation of the game,\nwe model this interaction of tiger with the parameters as deterministic finite\nautomata, whose transition function is obtained by the game payoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 14:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

They are well-suited for solving non-linear functional\nequations by means of hard implicit function theorems. They comprise Gevrey\nfunctions and thus, as a limiting case, analytic functions. Using majorizing\nseries, we manage to characterize them in terms of a real sequence M bounding\nthe growth of derivatives. In this functional setting, we prove two fundamental\nresults of Hamiltonian perturbation theory: the invariant torus theorem, where\nthe invariant torus remains ultra-differentiable under the assumption that its\nfrequency satisfies some arithmetic condition which we call BR M , and which\ngeneralizes the Bruno-R{\\\"u}ssmann condition ; and Nekhoroshev's theorem, where\nthe stability time depends on the ultra-differentiable class of the\npertubation, through the same sequence M. Our proof uses periodic averaging,\nwhile a substitute of the analyticity width allows us to bypass analytic\nsmoothing. We also prove converse statements on the destruction of invariant\ntori and on the existence of diffusing orbits with ultra-differentiable\nperturbations, by respectively mimicking a construction of Bessi (in the\nanalytic category) and Marco-Sauzin (in the Gevrey non-analytic category). When\nthe perturbation space satisfies some additional condition (we then call it\nmatching), we manage to narrow the gap between stability hypotheses (e.g. the\nBR M condition) and instability hypotheses, thus circumbscribing the stability\nthreshold. The formulas relating the growth M of derivatives of the\nperturbation on the one hand, and the arithmetics of robust frequencies or the\nstability time on the other hand, bring light to the competition between\nstability properties of nearly integrable systems and the distance to\nintegrability. Due to our method of proof using width of regularity as a\nregularizing parameter, these formulas are closer to optimal as the the\nregularity tends to analyticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 14:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Traffic congestion avoiding can be\nachieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning.\nAchieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected\nby many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and\nsudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely\ncollected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible\nto predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a\ndeep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the\ntraffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses\nthree deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and\ntrend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a\nbranch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the\nthree residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series\nprediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the\ntransportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP\noutperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in\nprediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 23:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

By means of the endo-reversible\nthermodynamics, we then discuss the power output of engine and its\noptimization. In doing so, we treat the temporal duration of a single cycle\nrigorously, i.e., without neglecting the duration of its adiabatic parts. Then\nwe find that the maximally obtainable power output P_m and the engine\nefficiency \\eta_m at the point of P_m explicitly depend on the heat conductance\nand the compression ratio. From this, it is immediate to observe that the\nwell-known results available in many references, in particular the\n(compression-ratio-independent) Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov expressions such as\n\\eta_m --> \\eta_{CAN} = 1 - (T_L/T_H)^(1/2) with the temperatures (T_H, T_L) of\nhot and cold reservoirs only, can be recovered, but, significantly enough, in\nthe limit of a vanishingly small heat conductance and an infinitely large\ncompression ratio only.
