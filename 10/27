Some examples are significant\nchanges in diffusion properties and the temperature at which the liquid-solid\nphase transition takes place. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations suggest\nthat thin layers of water on a diamond surface may remain solid even well above\nroom temperature. However, because of the small volumes that are involved, it\nis exceedingly difficult to examine these phenomena experimentally with current\ntechnologies. In this context, shallow NV centers promise a highly sensitive\ntool for the investigation of magnetic signals emanating from liquids and\nsolids that are deposited on the surface of a diamond. Moreover, NV centers are\nnon-invasive sensors with extraordinary performance even at room-temperature.\nTo that end, we present here a theoretical work, complemented with numerical\nevidence based on bosonization techniques, that predicts the measurable signal\nfrom a single NV center when interacting with large spin baths in different\nconfigurations. We therefore propose single NV centers as sensors capable to\nresolve structural water features at the nanoscale and even sensitive to phase\ntransitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}

The constraint of\nhaving the SINR meet or exceed a given threshold with high probability is\nintractable in general, which results in problems that are fundamentally hard\nto solve. In this paper, we will develop a high quality approximation of the\nSINR outage constraint that, along with a semidefinite relaxation, enables us\nto formulate the beamformer design problem as a convex optimization problem\nthat can be efficiently solved. For systems in which the uncertainty size is\nsmall, a further approximation yields algorithms based on iterative evaluations\nof closed-form expressions that have substantially lower computational cost.\nSince finding the beamforming directions incurs most of the computational load\nof these algorithms, analogous power loading algorithms for predefined\nbeamforming directions are developed and their performance is shown to be close\nto optimal.

The proposed power loading algorithm provides an\nexplicit relationship between the outage probability required and the power\nconsumed, which allows us to precisely control the power consumption, and\nautomatically identifies users who are consuming most of the power resources.\nThe flexibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by developing a power\nloading technique that minimizes an average notion of outage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}

The transmission response is composed of\npass-bands with oscillatory behaviour, separated by band gaps and covers a wide\nfrequency range. The presence of gain and loss in the layers leads to the\nemergence of symmetry breaking and re-entrant phases. In the general case, a\nsystem containing defects will display a more general property,\npseudo-Hermiticity (PH), of which $\\mathcal{PT}$ systems are a subset. In the\nPH-symmetric phase, unidirectional responses of the reflection, accomplished by\nreversing the parity $\\mathcal{P}$, can be found but the response sometimes\ndeviates from the predictions of simple scattering theory which call for a\npseudo-unitarity relation relating the transmission and the two directions of\nreflections to hold. The converse of reversing the parity, reversing the time\noperator $\\mathcal{T}$ in a spatially-asymmetric system within the PH-symmetric\nregime can lead to different transmissions: a pass-band versus a stop-band. As\nregions of stable PH-symmetric pass-band transmission oscillations occur over a\nwide spectral range, there is a large flexibility in system parameters such as\nlayer thicknesses, for leading to the desired unidirectional traits. In\naddition, we find that while defects in general lead to a near or complete loss\nof PH symmetry at all frequencies, they can be exploited to produce\nhighly-sensitive responses, making such systems good candidates for sensor\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 17:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 09:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a\npower law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of\nthe conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator\n(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival\nof the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,\nit develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only\nas a power of time instead of exponentially.

We show how these ambiguities arise and present\ngeneral techniques for identifying their presence and for correcting for them.\nWe demonstrate these techniques with specific examples in both heavy-meson\ndecay and pion--proton scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 18:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 14:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

However, the\nrange of radius available with the present observations does not enable to\ninvestigate whether the clouds follow the Larson relation or not. The large\nvirial parameter of the clouds suggests that gravity is not dominant.\n  Finally, the total energy injection in the filaments is of the same order as\nin the inner part of the Milky Way. The strong CO emission detected in the\nfilaments is an indication that the energy injected by the jet acts positively\nin the formation of dense molecular gas. The relatively high virial parameter\nof the molecular clouds suggests that the injected kinetic energy is too strong\nfor star formation to be efficient. This is particularly the case in the\nHorseshoe complex where the virial parameter is the largest and where strong CO\nis detected with no associated star formation.

These stringent requirements and the\ntime consuming data collection processes that they entail, are currently the\nmost important impediment that keeps deep reinforcement learning from being\ndeployed in real-world applications. Therefore, in this work we advocate an\nalternative approach, where instead of avoiding any domain shift by carefully\nselecting the training data, the goal is to learn a policy that can cope with\nit. To this end, we propose the DoShiCo challenge: to train a model in very\nbasic synthetic environments, far from realistic, in a way that it can be\napplied in more realistic environments as well as take the control decisions on\nreal-world data.

Accordingly, the\nfield of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) has leveraged impedance\ncontrol approaches, which support compliant interactions between human and\nrobot. However, a limitation of traditional impedance control is that---despite\nprovisions for the human to modify the robot's current trajectory---the human\ncannot affect the robot's future desired trajectory through pHRI. In this\npaper, we present an algorithm for physically interactive trajectory\ndeformations which, when combined with impedance control, allows the human to\nmodulate both the actual and desired trajectories of the robot. Unlike related\nworks, our method explicitly deforms the future desired trajectory based on\nforces applied during pHRI, but does not require constant human guidance. We\npresent our approach and verify that this method is compatible with traditional\nimpedance control. Next, we use constrained optimization to derive the\ndeformation shape. Finally, we describe an algorithm for real time\nimplementation, and perform simulations to test the arbitration parameters.\nExperimental results demonstrate reduction in the human's effort and\nimprovement in the movement quality when compared to pHRI with impedance\ncontrol alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 19:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

Typical\npoints lie in low-density regions and are not part of a collapsed structure of\nany scale. Locally, the dark matter distribution is then simply a stretched\nversion of that in the early universe. In this single-stream regime, the\ndistribution of unsmoothed density is sensitive to the initial power spectrum\non all scales, in particular on very small scales, and hence to the nature of\nthe dark matter. It cannot be estimated reliably using conventional\ncosmological simulations because of the enormous dynamic range involved, but a\nsuitable excursion set procedure can be used instead. For the Planck\ncosmological parameters, a 100 GeV WIMP, corresponding to a free-streaming mass\n$\\sim 10^{-6}M_\\odot$, results in a median density of $\\sim 4\\times 10^{-3}$ in\nunits of the mean density, whereas a 10 $\\mu$eV axion with free-streaming mass\n$\\sim 10^{-12}M_\\odot$ gives $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-3}$, and Warm Dark Matter with\na (thermal relic) mass of 1 keV gives $\\sim 8\\times 10^{-2}$. In CDM (but not\nin WDM) universes, single-stream regions are predicted to be topologically\nisolated by the excursion set formalism.

I show how to\ncalculate the effect of itinerant spin excitations on the electronic properties\nand formulate a theory of spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity. The\nsuperconducting state is unconventional and thus the system demonstrates\nunusual spin response with the spin resonance feature. I discuss its origin,\nconsequences, and relation to experimental observations.

The key\ninnovation lies in the use of short reads mapped to pairs of proximal single\nnucleotide variants (SNVs). In contrast, most existing methods use only\nmarginal reads for unpaired SNVs. In the same context of using mutation pairs,\nin order to recover the phylogenetic relationship of subclones, we then develop\na Bayesian treed feature allocation model. In contrast to commonly used feature\nallocation models, we allow the latent features to be dependent, using a tree\nstructure to introduce dependence. Finally, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian\napproach to monotone missing data in longitudinal studies with non-ignorable\nmissingness. In contrast to most existing methods, our method allows for\nincorporating information from auxiliary covariates and is able to capture\ncomplex structures among the response, missingness and auxiliary covariates.\nOur models are validated through simulation studies and are applied to\nreal-world biomedical datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 19:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

This also holds for isotropic\nmulti-band extensions, where the presence of multiple bands merely renormalises\nthe London penetration length. We show that, by contrast, the magnetic\nproperties of anisotropic multi-band London models are not this simple, and the\nanisotropy leads to the inter-band phase differences becoming coupled to the\nmagnetic field. This results in the magnetic field in such systems having N+1\npenetration lengths, where N is the number of field components or bands. That\nis, in a given direction, the magnetic field decay is described by N+1 modes\nwith different amplitudes and different decay length scales. For certain\nanisotropies we obtain magnetic modes with complex masses. That means that\nmagnetic field decay is not described by a monotonic exponential increment set\nby a real penetration length but instead is oscillating. Some of the\npenetration lengths are shown to diverge away from the superconducting phase\ntransition when the mass of the phase-difference mode vanishes. Finally the\nanisotropy-driven hybridization of the London mode with the Leggett modes can\nprovide an effectively non-local magnetic response in the nominally local\nLondon model. Focusing on the two-component model, we discuss the magnetic\nfield inversion that results from the effective non-locality, both near the\nsurface of the superconductor and around vortices. In the regime where the\nmagnetic field decay becomes non-monotonic, the multiband London superconductor\nis shown to form weakly-bound states of vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 20:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 13:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 14:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

The PSAC source emits thermal spectra of various\ntemperatures stratified along the column according to the PSAC model.

The current shows an initial rise when the device is operated at\nlower temperatures.

In addition, for about one-tenth of the orbital period,\nthe Balmer and He I emission lines transition into absorption features, with He\nII developing an absorption core. We use our observations of this phenomenon to\ntest theoretical models of the accretion curtain and conclude that the H and He\nI lines are produced throughout the curtain, in contravention of theoretical\npredictions of separate H and He I line-forming regions. Moreover, a\nsignificant amount of He II emission originates within the accretion curtain,\nimplying that the curtain is significantly hotter than expected from theory.\nFinally, we comment on the object's long-term photometry, including evidence\nthat it recently transitioned into a prolonged, exceptionally stable high state\nfollowing a potentially decades-long low state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 23:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

A general framework for\nthis kind of analysis is presented herein. The fluorescence Mueller matrix is\nexpressed as a product of Mueller matrices of the medium at the excitation and\nemission frequencies and a scattering matrix, integrated over path length. The\nStokes vector for the incident light, evolving according to the Mueller matrix\nof the medium at the excitation frequency, is multiplied by the scattering\nmatrix to give a Stokes vector of the emitted light along the propagation\ndirection. The scattering matrix is derived from an incoherent orientation\nensemble average over a phenomenological scattering tensor that embodies\nintrinsic molecular scattering proprieties, and dynamical processes that occur\nduring the excited state.

However, finding\nthe exact value of this number is computationally expensive. Hence, a number of\napproximation algorithms based on random sampling of edges, or wedges (adjacent\nedge pairs) have been proposed for estimating this value. We argue that for\nlarge sparse graphs with power-law degree distribution, random edge sampling\nrequires sampling large number of edges before providing enough information for\naccurate estimation, and existing wedge sampling methods lead to biased\nsamplings, which in turn lead to less accurate estimations. In this paper, we\npropose a hybrid algorithm between edge and wedge sampling that addresses the\ndeficiencies of both approaches. We start with uniform edge sampling and then\nextend each selected edge to form a wedge that is more informative for\nestimating the overall triangle count. The core estimate we make is the number\nof triangles each sampled edge in the first phase participates in.

The false information attack under different conditions\nis mathematically characterized. For the adversary, many closed-form results\nfor the optimal attack strategies that maximize Kalman filter's estimation\nerror are theoretically derived.

This question\nmay ultimately be addressed by comparing disk and bulge/bar planets, which is a\ngoal of the Spitzer microlens program.

They are more complex than Newtonian fluids because the\nrelationship between shear stress and shear rate is nonlinear. One particular\nsubclass of non-Newtonian fluids is the generalized Oldroyd-B fluid, which is\nmodelled using terms involving multi-term time fractional diffusion and\nreaction. In this paper, we consider the application of the finite difference\nmethod for this class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic\nnon-Newtonian fluid models. An important contribution of the work is that the\nnew model not only has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional\norder indices range from 0 to 2, but also possesses a special time fractional\noperator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate. There\nappears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of\nequation. We derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate\nthe model. Then we establish the stability and convergence analysis of these\nschemes based on the discrete $H^1$ norm and prove that their accuracy is of\n$O(\\tau+h^2)$ and $O(\\tau^{\\min\\{3-\\gamma_s,2-\\alpha_q,2-\\beta\\}}+h^2)$,\nrespectively.

Scaling these approaches to massive data sizes\nrequires proper distributed gradient descent schemes where distributed worker\nnodes compute partial gradients based on their partial and local data sets, and\nsend the results to a master node where all the computations are aggregated\ninto a full gradient and the learning model is updated. However, a major\nperformance bottleneck that arises is that some of the worker nodes may run\nslow. These nodes a.k.a. stragglers can significantly slow down computation as\nthe slowest node may dictate the overall computational time. We propose a\ndistributed computing scheme, called Batched Coupon's Collector (BCC) to\nalleviate the effect of stragglers in gradient methods. We prove that our BCC\nscheme is robust to a near optimal number of random stragglers. We also\nempirically demonstrate that our proposed BCC scheme reduces the run-time by up\nto 85.4% over Amazon EC2 clusters when compared with other straggler mitigation\nstrategies. We also generalize the proposed BCC scheme to minimize the\ncompletion time when implementing gradient descent-based algorithms over\nheterogeneous worker nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 04:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

In contrast to the local bifurcations of\ndynamical systems that are often related to a change in the number or stability\nof equilibria, bifurcations of boundary value problems are global in nature and\nmay not be related to any obvious change in dynamical behaviour. Catastrophe\ntheory is a well-developed framework which studies the bifurcations of critical\npoints of functions. In this paper we study the bifurcations of solutions of\nboundary-value problems for symplectic maps, using the language of\n(finite-dimensional) singularity theory. We associate certain such problems\nwith a geometric picture involving the intersection of Lagrangian submanifolds,\nand hence with the critical points of a suitable generating function. Within\nthis framework, we then study the effect of three special cases: (i) some\ncommon boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet boundary conditions for\nsecond-order systems, restrict the possible types of bifurcations (for example,\nin generic planar systems only the A-series beginning with folds and cusps can\noccur); (ii) integrable systems, such as planar Hamiltonian systems, can\nexhibit a novel periodic pitchfork bifurcation; and (iii) systems with\nHamiltonian symmetries or reversing symmetries can exhibit restricted\nbifurcations associated with the symmetry. This approach offers an alternative\nto the analysis of critical points in function spaces, typically used in the\nstudy of bifurcation of variational problems, and opens the way to the\ndetection of more exotic bifurcations than the simple folds and cusps that are\noften found in examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 05:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 21:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

The Freundlich parameters are often estimated using\nunweighted least squares (ULS) analysis after log-log transformation.\nEstimating the accuracy of these parameters (characterized by their coefficient\nof variation, CV) is an essential element of the use of these parameters.\nAccurate CVs can be derived with weighted least squares (WLS), but only if\nproper weights are assigned to the residuals in the fitting procedure. This\nwork presents the derivation of an analytical approximation of these weights\nwhich were found to decrease with increasing concentration, increasing\nFreundlich exponent, and increasing CVs of the initial and equilibrium\nconcentrations.

Sufficient number of measurements is imperative for a reliable\nand accurate state estimation. The limitation on the measurement devices is\ngenerally tackled with using the so-called pseudo measured data. However, the\nerrors in pseudo data by cur-rent techniques are quite high leading to a poor\nDSSE. As customer loads in distribution networks show high cross-correlation in\nvarious locations and over successive time steps, it is plausible that\ndeploying the spatial-temporal dependencies can improve the pseudo data\naccuracy and estimation. Although, the role of spatial dependency in DSSE has\nbeen addressed in the literature, one can hardly find an efficient DSSE\nframework capable of incorporating temporal dependencies present in customer\nloads. Consequently, to obtain a more efficient and accurate state estimation,\nwe propose a new non-iterative DSSE framework to involve spatial-temporal\ndependencies together.

In general, the empirical relationship\nof SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid\nvariables in the near distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther\ndistances. Two main problems arise. First, their calibration, in particular the\ndetermination of $M_{\\rm B}$, depends on the empirical relationship of Cepheid\nvariables, which suffers from various uncertainties. The second is related to\nthe homogeneity of SNIa in their true $M_{\\rm B}$, which is known to be poor in\ndifferent environments. The observed GW signal of the coalescence of compact\nbinary systems and their electromagnetic counterparts provide the novel and\nmodel-independent way to address these two problems. In the era of\nsecond-generation GW detectors, the low-redshift GW sources provide a novel\nmethod to calibrate the empirical relationship of SNIa, using their\nself-calibrated distances. Here, we use the event GW170817 to calibrate the\nempirical relationship in different low redshift ranges, and find that the\ncalibration results are consistent with the ones derived from the Cepheid\nvariables. Moreover, the uncertainties of $M_{\\rm B}$ in both methods are also\ncomparable. By the observations of third-generation GW detectors, GW sources\ncan also be used to measure the values of $M_{\\rm B}$ for the high-redshift\nSNIe, which provides a unique opportunity to study the dependence of $M_{\\rm\nB}$ on the local environment, strength of gravity, and the intrinsic properties\nof the explosion, in addition to test the homogeneity of standard candles.

Since nitrogen can be\nproduced both in massive and intermediate-mass stars with metallicity-dependent\nyields, its evolution is challenging to model, as evidenced by the differences\nbetween theoretical predictions and observations. In this work we attempt to\nidentify the sources of these discrepancies using a cosmic evolution model. To\nfurther complicate matters, there is considerable dispersion in the abundances\nfrom observations of DLAs at redshift 2 - 3. We study the evolution of nitrogen\nwith a detailed chemical evolution model and find good agreement with\nobservations, including the relative abundances of N/O and N/Si ratios. We find\nthat the principal contribution of nitrogen comes from intermediate mass stars,\nwith the exception of systems with the lowest N/H, where nitrogen production\nmight possibly be dominated by massive stars. This last result could be\nstrengthened if stellar rotation which is important at low metallicity can\nproduce significant amounts of nitrogen. Moreover, these systems likely reside\nin host galaxies with stellar masses below 10**8.5 solar mass. We also study\nthe origin of the observed dispersion in nitrogen abundances using the\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN.

TPIE provides an interface where list\nstream processing and sorting can be implemented in a simple and modular way\nwithout having to worry about memory management or block movement. However, if\ncare is not taken, such streaming-based implementations can lead to practically\ninefficient algorithms since lists of data items are typically written to (and\nread from) disk between components.\n  In this paper we present a major extension of the TPIE library that includes\na pipelining framework that allows for practically efficient streaming-based\nimplementations while minimizing I/O-overhead between streaming components. The\nframework pipelines streaming components to avoid I/Os between components, that\nis, it processes several components simultaneously while passing output from\none component directly to the input of the next component in main memory. TPIE\nautomatically determines which components to pipeline and performs the required\nmain memory management, and the extension also includes support for\nparallelization of internal memory computation and progress tracking across an\nentire application. The extended library has already been used to evaluate\nI/O-efficient algorithms in the research literature and is heavily used in\nI/O-efficient commercial terrain processing applications by the Danish startup\nSCALGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 11:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

As in classical HHO methods, the\npresent unfitted method introduces cell and face unknowns in uncut cells, but\ndoubles the unknowns in the cut cells and on the cut faces. The main difference\nwith classical HHO methods is that a Nitsche-type formulation is used to devise\nthe local reconstruction operator. As in classical HHO methods, cell unknowns\ncan be eliminated locally leading to a global problem coupling only the face\nunknowns by means of a compact stencil. We prove stability estimates and\noptimal error estimates in the $H^1$-norm. Robustness with respect to cuts is\nachieved by a local cell-agglomeration procedure taking full advantage of the\nfact that HHO methods support polyhedral meshes. Robustness with respect to the\ncontrast in the material properties from both sides of the interface is\nachieved by using material-dependent weights in Nitsche's formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 15:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

We selected a sample of 201 star-forming galaxies from the Vimos\nUltra Deep Survey at 3.5<z<4.3 to explore the validity of some of the proposed\nindirect indicators of LyC radiation. We created subsamples of galaxies with\nEWLya>70{\\AA}, Lya(ext)<5.7kpc, rUV<0.3kpc and |Dv Lya|<200km/s, stacked all\nthe galaxies in each subsample and measured the flux density ratio\nfnu(895)/fnu(1470), that we consider to be a proxy for LyC emission. We\ncompared these ratios to those obtained for the complementary samples. We find\nthat the stacks of galaxies which are UV compact (rUV<0.3kpc) and have bright\nLya emission (EWLya>70{\\AA}), have much higher LyC fluxes compared to the rest\nof the galaxy population in agreement with theoretical studies and previous\nobservational works. We also find that galaxies with low Lya(ext) have the\nhighest LyC flux: this new correlation seems even stronger than the\ncorrelations with high EWLya and small rUV.

A\nnarrow electron beam is desired, with both the mean free path and coherence\nlength exceeding the device size. One can form a collimating contact in\ngraphene by adding zigzag contacts on either side of the electron emitter that\nabsorb stray electrons to form a collimated electron beam [23]. Here we provide\nimages of electron flow from a collimating contact that directly show the width\nand shape of the electron beam, obtained using a Scanning Gate Microscope (SGM)\ncooled to 4.2 K. The device is a hBN-encapsulated graphene hall bar with narrow\nside contacts on either side of the channel that have an electron emitter at\nthe end and absorbing zig-zag contacts at both side. To form an image of\nelectron flow, the SGM tip is raster scanned at a constant height above the\nsample surface while the transmission to a receiving contact on opposite sides\nof the channel is measured. By displaying the change {\\Delta}T vs. tip\nposition, an image of ballistic flow is obtained. The angular width of the\nelectron beam leaving the collimating contact is found by applying a\nperpendicular magnetic field B that bends electron paths into cyclotron orbits.\nSGM images reveal that electron flow from a collimating contact disappears\nquickly at B = 0.05T while the flow from a non-collimating contact persists up\nto B = 0.19 T. Ray tracing simulations agree well with the experimental images\nover a range of B and electron density n. By fitting the half-width at half-max\n(HWHM) of the magnitude of electron flow in the experimental SGM images, we\nfind a narrow half angular width {\\Delta}{\\theta} = 9.2{\\deg} for the electron\nflow from the collimating contact, compared with a wide flow {\\Delta}{\\theta} =\n54{\\deg} from the non-collimating contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 15:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

In pursuit of\nthis goal, this paper builds a systematic design framework of feedback\ncontrollers for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems that continuously track the\noptimal solution of some predefined optimization problem. The proposed solution\ncan be logically divided into three components. The first component estimates\nthe system state from the output measurements. The second component uses the\nestimated state and computes a drift direction based on an optimization\nalgorithm. The third component computes an input to the LTI system that aims to\ndrive the system toward the optimal steady-state.\n  We analyze the equilibrium characteristics of the closed-loop system and\nprovide conditions for optimality and stability. Our analysis shows that the\nproposed solution guarantees optimal steady-state performance, even in the\npresence of constant disturbances. Furthermore, by leveraging recent results on\nthe analysis of optimization algorithms using integral quadratic constraints\n(IQCs), the proposed framework is able to translate input-output properties of\nour optimization component into sufficient conditions, based on linear matrix\ninequalities (LMIs), for global exponential asymptotic stability of the closed\nloop system.

Amplitudes can\nbe projected onto a minimal basis of kinematic factors through linear algebra,\nby employing four dimensional spinor helicity methods or at its most general\nusing projection techniques. The linear algebra analysis is closely related to\namplitude relations, especially the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for gluon\namplitudes and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations between gluons and graviton\namplitudes. Projection techniques are known to reduce the computation of loop\namplitudes with spinning particles to scalar integrals. Unitarity, locality and\nintegration-by-parts identities can then be used to fix complete tree and loop\namplitudes efficiently. The loop amplitudes follow algorithmically from the\ntrees. A range of proof-of-concept examples is presented. These include the\nplanar four point two-loop amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory as well as a\nrange of one loop amplitudes with internal and external scalars, gluons and\ngravitons. Several interesting features of the results are highlighted, such as\nthe vanishing of certain basis coefficients for gluon and graviton amplitudes.\nEffective field theories are naturally and efficiently included into the\nframework. The presented methods appear most powerful in non-supersymmetric\ntheories in cases with relatively few legs, but with potentially many loops.\nFor instance, iterated unitarity cuts of four point amplitudes for\nnon-supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories can be computed by matrix\nmultiplication, generalising the so-called rung-rule of maximally\nsupersymmetric theories. The philosophy of the approach to kinematics also\nleads to a technique to control color quantum numbers of scattering amplitudes\nwith matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 15:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 15:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 11:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

We\ndemonstrate Tikhonov-regularized $m$-mode analysis imaging using the Owens\nValley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) by generating 8 new maps of the sky\nnorth of $\\delta=-30^\\circ$ with 15 arcmin angular resolution, at frequencies\nevenly spaced between 36.528 MHz and 73.152 MHz, and $\\sim$800 mJy/beam thermal\nnoise. These maps are a 10-fold improvement in angular resolution over existing\nfull-sky maps at comparable frequencies, which have angular resolutions $\\ge\n2^\\circ$. Each map is constructed exclusively from interferometric observations\nand does not represent the globally averaged sky brightness. Future\nimprovements will incorporate total power radiometry, improved thermal noise,\nand improved angular resolution -- due to the planned expansion of the OVRO-LWA\nto 2.6 km baselines. These maps serve as a first step on the path to the use of\nmore sophisticated foreground filters in 21-cm cosmology incorporating the\nmeasured angular and frequency structure of all foreground contaminants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 17:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In this article we propose a language-based approach for\nprogramming the interactions of collective-adaptive systems by relying on\nattribute-based communication; a paradigm that permits a group of partners to\ncommunicate by considering their run-time properties and capabilities. We\nintroduce AbC, a foundational calculus for attribute-based communication and\nshow how its linguistic primitives can be used to program a complex and\nsophisticated variant of the well-known problem of Stable Allocation in Content\nDelivery Networks.
