Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Generalized Berk-Jones\n(GBJ) test for the association between a SNP-set and outcome. The GBJ extends\nthe Berk-Jones (BJ) statistic by accounting for correlation among SNPs, and it\nprovides advantages over the Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC) test when\nsignals in a SNP-set are moderately sparse. We also provide an analytic p-value\ncalculation procedure for SNP-sets of any finite size. Using this p-value\ncalculation, we illustrate that the rejection region for GBJ can be described\nas a compromise of those for BJ and GHC. We develop an omnibus statistic as\nwell, and we show that this omnibus test is robust to the degree of signal\nsparsity. An additional advantage of our method is the ability to conduct\ninference using individual SNP summary statistics from a genome-wide\nassociation study. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the GBJ though\nsimulation studies and application to gene-level association analysis of breast\ncancer risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 16:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 01:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

We study this claim in detail by focusing on a subset\nof wide-area future surveys: Stage-4 cosmic microwave background experiments\nand photometric redshift surveys. In particular, we look at the magnification\nlensing contribution to galaxy clustering and general relativistic corrections\nto all observables. We quantify the amount of information encoded in these\neffects in terms of the tightening of the final cosmological constraints as\nwell as the potential bias in inferred parameters associated with neglecting\nthem.

This question is often investigated using self-propelled particle\nmodels where particles represent the individual animals. These models differ in\nthe social interactions used, individual particle properties, and various\ntechnical assumptions. One particular technical assumption relates to whether\nall particles update their headings and positions at exactly the same time\n(synchronous update) or not (asynchronous update).

Since many important models in the\nliterature have been implemented with synchronous update only, we speculate\nthat our understanding of these models, or rather the social interactions on\nwhich they are based, may be incomplete.

In the framework of the investigation, XPS\nanalysis has been conducted for the samples stored after quenching for the\nspecified times t and a detailed experimental dependence of the YBa2Cu3O6+d\nlattice parameters a, b, and c on both d and t has been obtained. The regime of\nlow-speed quenching results in a threefold increase in the aging effect\nmagnitude. Particular cases of the c(d; t) dependence are well described by a\nsecond-order polynomial with applying different coefficients for different t.\nThe behavior c has been explained on the basis of a simple model of the Coulomb\ninteraction between the CuO2 and CuOd structural planes, in which the hole\ncharge transfer from CuOd to CuO2 takes place providing the standard level of\nTc in YBa2Cu3O6+d (this level is characterized by a maximum Tc of 93 K at d =\n0.9).

This study begins with a\nradiative transfer model that uses typical solar flare densities and geometries\nto show that hot coronal emission lines are not generally optically thin.\nFurther, the model demonstrates that the observed line intensity should exhibit\ncenter-to-limb variability (CTLV), with flares observed near the limb being\ndimmer than those occurring near disk-center. The model predictions are\nvalidated with an analysis of over 200 flares observed by EVE on SDO that uses\n6 lines, with peak formation temperatures between 8.9 and 15.8 MK, to show limb\nflares are systematically dimmer than disk-center flares.

In this paper, we\nexhibit equally simple families whose geometric monodromy groups are the\nalternating groups Alt(2q). $. We also determine their arithmetic monodromy\ngroups. By Raynaud's solution of the Abhyankar Conjecture, any finite simple\ngroup whose order is divisible by p will occur as the geometric monodromy group\nof some local system on the affine line in characteristic p; the interest here\nis that it occurs in our particularly simple local systems.\n  In the earlier work of Katz, he used a theorem to Kubert to know that the\nmonodromy groups in question were finite, then work of Gross to determine which\nfinite groups they were. Here we do not have, at present, any direct way of\nshowing this finiteness. Rather, the situation is more complicated and more\ninteresting. Using some basic information about these local systems, a\nfundamental dichotomy is proved:\n  The geometric monodromy group is either Alt(2q) or it is the special\northogonal group SO(2q-1). An elementary polynomial identity is used to show\nthat the third moment is 1. This rules out the SO(2q-1) case. This roundabout\nmethod establishes the theorem. It would be interesting to find a \"direct\"\nproof that these local systems have integer (rather than rational) traces; this\nintegrality is in fact equivalent to their monodromy groups being finite, Even\nif one had such a direct proof, it would still require serious group theory to\nshow that their geometric monodromy groups are the alternating groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 17:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

The X-rays from such sources\npreferentially heat the IGM at early times, which elongates the epoch of\nreheating and results in a more gradual transition from an absorption signal to\nemission.

The tidal interactions at every periastron passage exchange energy\nbetween the orbit and the planet's degree-2 fundamental-mode. Starting from\nzero energy, the f-mode can diffusively grow to large amplitudes if its\none-kick energy gain > 10^-5 of the orbital energy. This requires a pericentre\ndistance of < 4 tidal radii (or 1.6 Roche radii). If the f-mode has a\nnon-negligible initial energy, diffusive evolution can occur at a lower\nthreshold. The first effect can stall the secular migration as the f-mode can\nabsorb orbital energy and decouple the planet from its secular perturbers,\nparking all migrating jupiters safely outside the zone of tidal disruption. The\nsecond effect leads to rapid orbit circularization as it allows an excited\nf-mode to continuously absorb orbital energy as the orbit eccentricity\ndecreases. So without any explicit dissipation, other than the fact that the\nf-mode will damp nonlinearly when its amplitude reaches unity, the planet can\nbe transported from a few AU to ~ 0.2 AU in ~ 10^4 yrs. Such a rapid\ncircularization is equivalent to a dissipation factor Q ~ 1, and it explains\nthe observed deficit of super-eccentric Jovian planets.

Current datacenter networks\nprimarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where\ncongestion control and scheduling are distributed. While distributed\narchitecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance. Unlike\nInternet, data center is fundamentally a \"controlled\" environment. This raises\nthe possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better\nperformance. Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the\nproof of this concept. This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal\nperformance achievable in a data center?\n  We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow\ndelay bound of $O$(#hops $\\times$ flow-size $/$ gap-to-capacity). Effectively\nsuch an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed\ncongestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing\nnetworks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network,\nwhich has a product-form stationary distribution. In the language of Harrison\net al., we establish that baseline performance for this model class is\nachievable.\n  Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate\nsuch a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and\nscheduling constraints.

Discovered\nin 1963, it appears to be an exact copy of the proton except that its mass is\n50% greater. The mass is the first problem: it is difficult to explain with any\ntheoretical tool that can validly be used to study quantum chromodynamics\n[QCD]. In the last decade, a new challenge has appeared, viz. precise\ninformation on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors,\nreaching $Q^2\\approx 4.5\\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which\nhard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form\nfactor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a\nproblem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper\nresonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a\ndescription of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed\nunderstanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the\ntransition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly\ncomplete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year\ninternational effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has\npresented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's\nfirst radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a\nmeson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially\nalters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the\nproton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which\nenabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is\nunambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and\nopportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models\nand QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature\nof the Roper resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 18:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

Successful compilation of a\nprogram then guarantees that it satisfies its type-based specification.\n  While dependent types allow many runtime errors to be eliminated by rejecting\nerroneous programs at compile-time, dependently typed languages are yet to gain\npopularity in the wider programming community. One reason for this is their\nlimited support for computational effects, an integral part of all widely used\nprogramming languages, ranging from imperative languages, such as C, to\nfunctional languages, such as ML and Haskell. For example, in addition to\nsimply turning their inputs to outputs, programs written in these programming\nlanguages can raise exceptions, access computer's memory, communicate over a\nnetwork, render images on a screen, etc.\n  Therefore, if dependently typed programming languages are to truly live up to\ntheir promise of seamlessly integrating programming and formal program\nverification, we must first understand how to properly account for\ncomputational effects in such languages. While there already exists work on\nthis topic, ingredients needed for a comprehensive theory are generally\nmissing. For example, foundations are often not settled; available effects may\nbe limited; or effects may not be treated systematically.\n  In this thesis we address these shortcomings by providing a comprehensive\ntreatment of the combination of dependent types and general computational\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 21:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

To\naddress this issue, we developed a system to detect potholes and assess road\nconditions in real-time. Our solution is a mobile application that captures\ndata on a car's movement from gyroscope and accelerometer sensors in the phone.\nTo assess roads using this sensor data, we trained SVM models to classify road\nconditions with 93% accuracy and potholes with 92% accuracy, beating the base\nrate for both problems. As the user drives, the models use the sensor data to\nclassify whether the road is good or bad, and whether it contains potholes.\nThen, the classification results are used to create data-rich maps that\nillustrate road conditions across the city. Our system will empower civic\nofficials to identify and repair damaged roads which inconvenience passengers\nand cause accidents. This paper details our data science process for collecting\ntraining data on real roads, transforming noisy sensor data into useful\nsignals, training and evaluating machine learning models, and deploying those\nmodels to production through a real-time classification app. It also highlights\nhow cities can use our system to crowdsource data and deliver road repair\nresources to areas in need.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 21:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 05:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

By\nappropriate choice of the parameters, the fast process and the associated\ncontrol that arises from the weak convergence method decouple from each other.\nWe show that in this decoupling case one can use the weak convergence method to\ncharacterize the limiting process via a \"viable pair\" that captures the\nlimiting controlled dynamics and the effective invariant measure\nsimultaneously.

It is\nhighly desirable to preserve these bounds on the pressure field in predictive\nnumerical simulations, that is, one needs to satisfy discrete maximum\nprinciples (DMP). Unfortunately, many of the existing formulations for flow\nthrough porous media models do not satisfy DMP. This paper presents a robust,\nscalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities (VI), to model\nnon-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without\nviolating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the\nnumerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the\nideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account\npressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order\nRaviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element\nformulations. It will be shown that these formulations violate DMP, and, in\nfact, these violations increase with an increase in anisotropy. It will be\nshown that the proposed VI-based formulation provides a viable route to enforce\nDMP. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed formulation is scalable, and\ncan work with any numerical discretization and weak form. Parallel scalability\non modern computational platforms will be illustrated through strong-scaling\nstudies, which will prove the efficiency of the proposed formulation in a\nparallel setting. Algorithmic scalability as the problem size is scaled up will\nbe demonstrated through novel static-scaling studies. The performed\nstatic-scaling studies can serve as a guide for users to be able to select an\nappropriate discretization for a given problem size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 02:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The inorganic compound TiOCl, composed\nof chains of S=1/2 Ti ions, is an ideal realization of a spin-Peierls system\nwith a relatively simple unit cell. At ambient pressure, it is an insulator due\nto strong electronic interactions (a Mott insulator). Its resistivity shows a\nsudden decrease with increasing pressure, indicating a transition to a more\nmetallic state which may coincide with the emergence of charge density wave\norder. Therefore, high pressure studies of the structure with x-rays are\ncrucial in determining the ground-state physics in this quantum magnet. In\nambient pressure, TiOCl exhibits a transition to an incommensurate nearly\ndimerized state at $T_{c2}=92$ K and to a commensurate dimerized state at\n$T_{c1}=66$ K.

By reducing the size of cells, operators can pack\nmore (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands,\nwithout causing extra interference. However, this approach suffers from low\nspectrum temporal efficiency. When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer\nusers, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic\naggregation and exhibiting a large \"peak-to-mean\" ratio. As operators\ncustomarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal\nfluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency. In this\npaper, we advocate device-to-device (D2D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism\nto address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture. The idea is to\nshift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by\nleveraging inter-cell D2D communication, so that the traffic can be served\nwithout using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal\nefficiency. We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the\nbenefit of D2D load balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all\nindividual cells. We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred\nD2D traffic overhead. We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4G\ndata traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D2D load balancing under practical\nsettings. The results show that D2D load balancing can reduce the spectrum\nrequirement by 25% as compared to the standard scenario without D2D load\nbalancing, at the expense of negligible 0.7% D2D traffic overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 05:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 08:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 13:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 06:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 05:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

The observations indicate that a plenty\nof planet pairs could have firstly been captured into mean motion resonances\n(MMRs) in planetary formation. Subsequently, these planets depart from exact\nresonant locations to be near MMRs configurations. Through type I migration,\ntwo low-mass planets have a tendency to be trapped into first-order MMRs (2:1\nor 3:2 MMRs), however two scenarios of mass accretion of planets and potential\noutward migration play an important role in reshaping their final orbital\nconfigurations. Under the scenario of mass accretion, the planet pairs can\ncross 2:1 MMRs and then enter into 3:2 MMRs, especially for the inner pairs.\nWith such formation scenario, the possibility that two planets are locked into\n3:2 MMRs can increase if they are formed in a flat disk. Moreover, the outward\nmigration can make planets have a high likelihood to be trapped into 3:2 MMRs.\nWe perform additional runs to investigate the mass relationship for those\nplanets in three-planet systems, and we show that two peaks near 1.5 and 2.0\nfor the period ratios of two planets can be easily reproduced through our\nformation scenario.

We also give some\napplications for such a mapping where we study robustness of different\ntopological CSS codes against a uniform magnetic field including Kitaev's toric\ncodes defined on graphs and color codes in different dimensions. We show that a\nperturbed Kitaev's toric code on an arbitrary graph is mapped to an Ising model\nin a transverse field on the same graph and a perturbed color code on a D-colex\nis mapped to a Ising-like model on a D-simplicial lattice in a transverse\nfield.

For such models, the predicted choice probabilities often form a\nbounded and convex polyhedral set, or polytope. Polyhedral combinatorics have\nthus played a key role in studying the mathematical structure of these models.\nHowever, standard methods for characterizing the polytopes of such models are\nsubject to a combinatorial explosion in complexity as the number of choice\nalternatives increases. Specifically, this is the case for random preference\nmodels based on linear, weak, semi- and interval orders. For these, a complete,\nlinear description of the polytope is currently known only for, at most, 5--8\nchoice alternatives. We leverage the method of extended formulations to break\nthrough those boundaries. For each of the four types of preferences, we build\nan appropriate network, and show that the associated network flow polytope\nprovides an extended formulation of the polytope of the choice model. This\nextended formulation has a simple linear description that is more parsimonious\nthan descriptions obtained by standard methods for large numbers of choice\nalternatives.

Blinded estimators for the variance parameters of a SW-CRT analyzed\nusing the Hussey and Hughes model are derived.

We find that if the two key variance parameters were\nunder-specified by 50%, the SSRE procedures were able to increase power over\nthe conventional SW-CRT design by up to 29%, resulting in an empirical power\nabove the desired level. Moreover, the performance of the re-estimation\nprocedures was relatively insensitive to the timing of the interim assessment.\nThus, the considered SSRE procedures can bring substantial gains in power when\nthe underlying variance parameters are mis-specified.

About 60 years later, scientists\nsuccessfully observed this phenomenon in the microscopic world though the\nspectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in helium nano-droplets. This\nreduction of scale suggests that not only helium but also para-H2 (pH2) can be\na candidate for superfluidity. This expectation is based on the fact that the\nsmaller number of neighbours and surface effects of a finite-size cluster may\nhinder solidification and promote a liquid-like phase. The first prediction of\nsuperfluidity in pH2 clusters was reported in 1991 based on quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The possible superfluidity of pH2 was later indirectly observed in\na spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in 2000. Since then, a growing\nnumber of studies have appeared, and theoretical simulations have been playing\na special role because they help guide and interpret experiments. In this\nreview, we go over the theoretical studies of pH2 superfluid clusters since the\nexperiment of 2000. We provide a historical perspective and introduce the basic\ntheoretical formalism along with key experimental advances. We then present\nillustrative results of the theoretical studies and comment on the possible\nfuture developments in the field. We include sufficient theoretical details\nsuch that the review can serve as a guide for newcomers to the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 13:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

We find that the\nspectrum of $\\rho_A$ is described by a so-called Wishart random matrix, which\nexhibits universal spectral correlations between eigenvalues separated by\ndistances ranging from one up to many mean level spacings. We use these\nuniversal spectral characteristics of $\\rho_A$ as a definition of chaos in the\nwave function. A simple and precise characterization of such correlations is a\nsegment of linear growth at sufficiently long times, recently called the\n\"ramp\", of the spectral form factor. Specifically, numerical results for the\nspectral form factor of $\\rho_A$ of generic non-integrable systems, such as\none-dimensional quantum Ising and Floquet spin models, are found to exhibit an\nuniversal ramp identical to that appearing for a random pure state, in which\n$\\rho_A$ is the Wishart random matrix. In addition, we study the development of\nchaos in the wave function by letting an initial direct product state evolve\nunder the unitary time evolution. We find that the universal spectral\ncorrelations as manifested by the ramp set in as soon as the entanglement\nentropy begins to grow, and first develop for the eigenvalues at the top of the\nspectrum of $\\rho_A$, subsequently spreading over the entire spectrum at later\ntimes. Finally, we study a prethermalized regime described by a generalized\nGibbs ensemble, which develops in a rapidly driven Floquet model at\nintermediate times. We find that the prethermalized regime exhibits no chaos,\nas evidenced by the absence of a ramp in the spectral form factor of $\\rho_A$,\nwhile the universal spectral correlations start to develop when the\nprethermalized regime finally relaxes at late times to the fully thermalized\nchaotic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 14:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Unique entity estimation shares\nmany fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the\ncomputational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large\ndatabases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient\n(near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing.\nOur estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low\nvariance compared to existing random sampling based approaches.

These protocols are designed under the assumption that separating\nin-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient for protection\nagainst cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid\nby recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle\nnetwork. Motivated by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have\nbeen proposed for in-vehicle networks that attempt to detect attacks by making\nuse of device fingerprinting using properties such as clock skew of an ECU. In\nthis paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in\nwhich an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages in order to\nmatch the clock skew of a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that,\nwhile the clock skew is a physical property of each ECU that cannot be changed\nby the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is based on\nnetwork traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an\nadversary. We implement the proposed cloaking attack and test it on two IDSs,\nnamely, the current state-of-the-art IDS and a new IDS that we develop based on\nthe widely-used Network Time Protocol (NTP). We implement the cloaking attack\non two hardware testbeds, a prototype and a real connected vehicle, and show\nthat it can always deceive both IDSs.

This raises two questions: (I) what are the appropriate generalized\nequations of MFE in the presence of mesoscale fluctuations? (II) how precise\nare theoretical predictions from MFE? We address both by first deriving the\nequations of MFE for different types of averaging, along with mesoscale\ncorrection terms that depend on the ratio of averaging scale to variation scale\nof the mean. We then show that even if these terms are small, predictions of\nMFE can still have a significant precision error.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep self-paced learning (DSPL) algorithm to\nalleviate this problem, in which we apply a self-paced constraint and symmetric\nregularization to help the relative distance metric training the deep neural\nnetwork, so as to learn the stable and discriminative features for person\nRe-ID. Firstly, we propose a soft polynomial regularizer term which can derive\nthe adaptive weights to samples based on both the training loss and model age.\nAs a result, the high-confidence fidelity samples will be emphasized and the\nlow-confidence noisy samples will be suppressed at early stage of the whole\ntraining process. Such a learning regime is naturally implemented under a\nself-paced learning (SPL) framework, in which samples weights are adaptively\nupdated based on both model age and sample loss using an alternative\noptimization method. Secondly, we introduce a symmetric regularizer term to\nrevise the asymmetric gradient back-propagation derived by the relative\ndistance metric, so as to simultaneously minimize the intra-class distance and\nmaximize the inter-class distance in each triplet unit. Finally, we build a\npart-based deep neural network, in which the features of different body parts\nare first discriminately learned in the lower convolutional layers and then\nfused in the higher fully connected layers.
