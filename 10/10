In this paper we\nstudy spanners that are resistant to faults. A subgraph $H \\subseteq G$ is an\n$f$ vertex fault tolerant (VFT) $k$-spanner if $H \\setminus F$ is a $k$-spanner\nof $G \\setminus F$ for any small set $F$ of $f$ vertices that might \"fail.\" One\nof the main questions in the area is: what is the minimum size of an $f$ fault\ntolerant $k$-spanner that holds for all $n$ node graphs (as a function of $f$,\n$k$ and $n$)? This question was first studied in the context of geometric\ngraphs [Levcopoulos et al. STOC '98, Czumaj and Zhao SoCG '03] and has more\nrecently been considered in general undirected graphs [Chechik et al. STOC '09,\nDinitz and Krauthgamer PODC '11].\n  In this paper, we settle the question of the optimal size of a VFT spanner,\nin the setting where the stretch factor $k$ is fixed. Specifically, we prove\nthat every (undirected, possibly weighted) $n$-node graph $G$ has a\n$(2k-1)$-spanner resilient to $f$ vertex faults with $O_k(f^{1 - 1/k} n^{1 +\n1/k})$ edges, and this is fully optimal (unless the famous Erdos Girth\nConjecture is false). Our lower bound even generalizes to imply that no data\nstructure capable of approximating $dist_{G \\setminus F}(s, t)$ similarly can\nbeat the space usage of our spanner in the worst case. We also consider the\nedge fault tolerant (EFT) model, defined analogously with edge failures rather\nthan vertex failures. We show that the same spanner upper bound applies in this\nsetting. Our data structure lower bound extends to the case $k=2$ (and hence we\nclose the EFT problem for $3$-approximations), but it falls to $\\Omega(f^{1/2 -\n1/(2k)} \\cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ for $k \\ge 3$.

Thus, we perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations of shock\ninduced single gas-cavity collapse in nitromethane. Ignition is the result of a\ncomplex interplay between fluid dynamics and exothermic chemical reaction. In\npart I of this work we focused on the hydrodynamic effects in the collapse\nprocess by switching off the reaction terms in the mathematical model. Here, we\nreinstate the reactive terms and study the collapse of the cavity in the\npresence of chemical reactions. We use a multi-phase formulation which\novercomes current challenges of cavity collapse modelling in reactive media to\nobtain oscillation-free temperature fields across material interfaces to allow\nthe use of a temperature-based reaction rate law. The mathematical and physical\nmodels are validated against experimental and analytic data. We identify which\nof the previously-determined (in part I of this work) high-temperature regions\nlead to ignition and comment on their reactive strength and reaction growth\nrate. We quantify the sensitisation of nitromethane by the collapse of the\ncavity by comparing ignition times of neat and single-cavity material; the\nignition occurs in less than half the ignition time of the neat material. We\ncompare 2D and 3D simulations to examine the change in topology, temperature\nand reactive strength of the hot spots by the third dimension. It is apparent\nthat belated ignition times can be avoided by the use of 3D simulations.

Aims: Our aim is to\ninvestigate the dynamo properties of compressible convection in a rapidly\nrotating Cartesian domain, focusing upon a parameter regime in which the\nunderlying hydrodynamic flow is known to be unstable to a large-scale vortex\ninstability. Methods: The governing equations of three-dimensional nonlinear\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are solved numerically.

The components of the\nmean horizontal magnetic field oscillate, leading to a continuous overall\nrotation of the mean field. Whilst the large-scale vortex instability dominates\nthe early evolution of the system, it is suppressed by the magnetic field and\nmakes a negligible contribution to the mean electromotive force that is\nresponsible for driving the large-scale dynamo. The cycle period of the dynamo\nis comparable to the ohmic decay time, with longer cycles for dynamos in\nconvective systems that are closer to onset.

Although\nit was initially conceivable that that these far-from-CMC results would lead to\na solution theory for the non-CMC case that would mirror the good properties of\nthe CMC and near-CMC cases, examples of bifurcations and of nonexistence of\nsolutions have been since discovered. Nevertheless, the general properties of\nthe conformal method for far-from-CMC data remain unknown. In this article we\napply analytic and numerical continuation techniques to the study of the con-\nformal method, in an attempt to give some insight into what the solution\nbehavior is in the far-from-CMC case in various scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 17:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 17:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

We use this distribution of the energy density along the\nstring, choose an ensemble of strings whose opening angles and energies are\ndistributed as in perturbative QCD, and show that we can then fix one model\nparameter such that the mean jet shape in our ensemble matches that measured in\np-p collisions reasonably well.

Second, we use\nfor the first time the WISE~$\\times$~SuperCOSMOS catalog, which allows us to\nperform an all-sky analysis of the ISW up to $z\\sim0.4$. Third, thanks to the\nuse of photo-$z$s, we separate each dataset into different redshift bins,\nderiving the cross-correlation in each bin. This last step leads to a\nsignificant improvement in sensitivity. We remove cross-correlation between\ncatalogs using masks which mutually exclude common regions of the sky. We use\ntwo methods to quantify the significance of the ISW effect. In the first one,\nwe fix the cosmological model, derive linear galaxy biases of the catalogs, and\nthen evaluate the significance of the ISW using a single parameter. In the\nsecond approach we perform a global fit of the ISW and of the galaxy biases\nvarying the cosmological model.

A better approach is to\nuse a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a\nsingle expression.

The soliton solutions of the\nlatter allow us to reconstruct approximate traveling DB solitons for the\nreduced SO coupled system. For small values of the formal perturbation\nparameter, the resulting waveforms propagate undistorted, while for large\nvalues thereof, they shed some dispersive radiation, and subsequently distill\ninto a robust propagating structure. After quantifying the relevant radiation\neffect, we also study the dynamics of DB solitons in a parabolic trap,\nexploring how their oscillation frequency varies as a function of the bright\ncomponent mass and the Raman laser wavenumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 19:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

However, small sample sizes\nand sampling noise may result in patterns in the training data that are not\nrepresentative of the true relationship between the features and the outcome.\nAs a solution, regularization during training is often used (e.g. dropout).\nHowever, regularization is no panacea -- it does not perfectly address\noverfitting. Even with methods like dropout, two methodologies are commonly\nused in practice. First is to utilize a validation set independent to the\ntraining set as a way to decide when to stop training.

We also explore the strong connection\nbetween biclustering and frequent pattern mining to (1) provide filters to\nselect a compact bicluster set that exhibits high relevance and low redundancy,\nand (2) in the case of labeled datasets, automatically present the biclusters\nin a user-friendly and intuitive form, by means of quantitative class\nassociation rules. Our experimental results showed that the biclusters yield a\nparsimonious set of relevant rules, providing useful and interpretable models\nfor five mixed-attribute labeled datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 19:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The bullet-outflow source is associated with a\nlarge pseudo-disk and three molecular outflows -- a high-velocity outflow\n(HVO), a medium-velocity outflow (MVO), and a slow, extended outflow (SEO). The\nsize (mass) of the pseudo-disk is 10,350 AU x 6,400 AU (0.64-0.17 Msun); from a\nmodel-fit assuming infall and rotation we derive a central stellar mass of\n8--19 Msun.

The size of\nthe assignment problem is addressed through an adaptive procedure: a sequence\nof linear programming problems which utilize at each level the solution from\nthe previous coarser mesh to restrict the size of the function space where\nsolutions are sought. The linear programming approach for pairwise optimal\ntransportation, combined with an iterative scheme, gives a data driven\nalgorithm for the Wasserstein barycenter problem, which is well suited to\nparallel computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 21:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

If adversarial examples\nexisted that could fool a detector, they could be used to (for example) wreak\nhavoc on roads populated with smart vehicles. Recently, we described our\ndifficulties creating physical adversarial stop signs that fool a detector.\nMore recently, Evtimov et al. produced a physical adversarial stop sign that\nfools a proxy model of a detector. In this paper, we show that these physical\nadversarial stop signs do not fool two standard detectors (YOLO and Faster\nRCNN) in standard configuration. Evtimov et al.'s construction relies on a crop\nof the image to the stop sign; this crop is then resized and presented to a\nclassifier. We argue that the cropping and resizing procedure largely\neliminates the effects of rescaling and of view angle. Whether an adversarial\nattack is robust under rescaling and change of view direction remains moot. We\nargue that attacking a classifier is very different from attacking a detector,\nand that the structure of detectors - which must search for their own bounding\nbox, and which cannot estimate that box very accurately - likely makes it\ndifficult to make adversarial patterns. Finally, an adversarial pattern on a\nphysical object that could fool a detector would have to be adversarial in the\nface of a wide family of parametric distortions (scale; view angle; box shift\ninside the detector; illumination; and so on). Such a pattern would be of great\ntheoretical and practical interest.

Phase curves of the\nplanets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a\nsubstantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock\nsurface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has\npreviously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot\nJupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the\nthermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We\nutilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared\nphotometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary\nproperties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio\nbetween radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and\natmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by\nthermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat\nredistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective\ntimescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement\ncannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by\ncurrents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the\nscenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat\nredistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar. The\nSpitzer 4.5-micron band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet\n55 Cancri e.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 22:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The approach taken led to a more\nabstract algebra of atomic steps, in which atomic steps synchronise (rather\nthan interleave) when composed in parallel. The algebra of rely/guarantee\nconcurrency then becomes an instantiation of the more abstract algebra. Many of\nthe core properties needed for rely/guarantee reasoning can be shown to hold in\nthe abstract algebra where their proofs are simpler and hence allow a higher\ndegree of automation. The algebra has been encoded in Isabelle/HOL to provide a\nbasis for tool support for program verification.\n  In rely/guarantee concurrency, programs are specified to guarantee certain\nbehaviours until assumptions about the behaviour of their environment are\nviolated. When assumptions are violated, program behaviour is unconstrained\n(aborting), and guarantees need no longer hold. To support these guarantees a\nsecond synchronous operator, weak conjunction, was introduced: both processes\nin a weak conjunction must agree to take each atomic step, unless one aborts in\nwhich case the whole aborts. In developing the laws for parallel and weak\nconjunction we found many properties were shared by the operators and that the\nproofs of many laws were essentially the same. This insight led to the idea of\ngeneralising synchronisation to an abstract operator with only the axioms that\nare shared by the parallel and weak conjunction operator, so that those two\noperators can be viewed as instantiations of the abstract synchronisation\noperator. The main differences between parallel and weak conjunction are how\nthey combine individual atomic steps; that is left open in the axioms for the\nabstract operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 23:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We\nconsider three plausible spillover modes, quantifying and comparing their\neffects on the evolution of cooperation. In our model, social interactions take\nplace on two network layers: one represents repeated interactions with close\nneighbours in a lattice, the other represents one-shot interactions with random\nindividuals across the same population. Spillover can occur during the social\nlearning process with accidental cross-layer strategy transfer, or during\nsocial interactions with errors in implementation due to contextual\ninterference. Our analytical results, using extended pair approximation, are in\ngood agreement with extensive simulations. We find double-edged effects of\nspillover on cooperation: increasing the intensity of spillover can promote\ncooperation provided cooperation is favoured in one layer, but too much\nspillover is detrimental. We also discover a bistability phenomenon of\ncooperation: spillover hinders or promotes cooperation depending on initial\nfrequencies of cooperation in each layer. Furthermore, comparing strategy\ncombinations that emerge in each spillover mode provides a good indication of\ntheir co-evolutionary dynamics with cooperation.

Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA)\ntreatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is\noften delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or\nlater) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and\nmedically assisted treatment (MAT) for addiction are known to be less costly,\nbut have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. Little\nis known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT\ntreatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While\nsimulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior\nsimulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents--a\nscenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health\nagencies.

In philosophy, the concept of overdetermination\nand the concept of preemption serve an important purpose in this regard,\nalthough their exact meaning tends to remain elusive. In this paper, I provide\ntheory-neutral definitions of these concepts using structural equations in the\nHalpern-Pearl tradition. While my definitions do not presuppose any particular\ncausal theory, they take such a theory as a variable parameter. This enables us\nto specify formal constraints on theories of causality, in terms of a\npre-theoretic understanding of what preemption and overdetermination actually\nmean. I demonstrate the usefulness of this by presenting and arguing for what I\ncall the principle of presumption. Roughly speaking, this principle states that\na possible cause can only be regarded as having been preempted if there is\nindependent evidence to support such an inference. I conclude by showing that\nthe principle of presumption is violated by the two main theories of causality\nformulated in the Halpern-Pearl tradition. The paper concludes by defining the\nclass of empirical causal theories, characterised in terms of a fixed-point of\ncounterfactual reasoning about difference-making.

In this paper, we\noutline an approach to managing epistemic uncertainty in existing hazard\nanalysis techniques by focusing on known and unknown uncertainty. We have\ncreated a reference populated with a wide range of safety-critical causal\nrelationships to recognise unknown uncertainty, and we have developed a model\nto systematically capture and track known uncertainty around such factors. We\nhave also defined a process for using the reference and model to assess\npossible causal factors that are suspected during hazard analysis. To assess\nthe applicability of our approach, we have analysed the widely-used MoDAF\narchitectural model and determined that there is potential for our approach to\nidentify additional causal factors that are not apparent from individual MoDAF\nviews. We have also reviewed an existing safety assessment example (the ARP4761\nAircraft System analysis) and determined that our approach could indeed be\nincorporated into that process.

The\nprotostellar system is viewed nearly edge-on, and the jet has a flow speed of\n35 km/s and a precession period of 1600 years. The CO outflow length gives a\ndynamical timescale of 6300 years, and the protostar must be extremely young.\nThe inferred binary separation of 6-70 au implies that this protobinary system\nmay have been formed through the disk instability process.

Generically, the idea is to perform a\nstatistical test of the hypothesis that a new feature is better than the\nexisting platform---for example, it results in higher revenue. If the p value\nfor the test is below some pre-defined threshold---often, 0.05---the new\nfeature is implemented. The difficulty of choosing an appropriate threshold has\nbeen noted before, particularly because dependent tests are often done\nsequentially, leading some to propose control of the false discovery rate (FDR)\nrather than use of a single, universal threshold. However, it is still\nnecessary to make an arbitrary choice of the level at which to control FDR.\nHere we suggest a decision-theoretic approach to determining whether to adopt a\nnew feature, which enables automated selection of an appropriate threshold. Our\nmethod has the basic ingredients of any decision-theory problem: a loss\nfunction, action space, and a notion of optimality, for which we choose Bayes\nrisk. However, the loss function and the action space differ from the typical\nchoices made in the literature, which has focused on the theory of point\nestimation. We give some basic results for Bayes-optimal thresholding rules for\nthe feature adoption decision, and give some examples using eBay data. The\nresults suggest that the 0.05 p-value threshold may be too conservative in some\nsettings, but that its widespread use may reflect an ad-hoc means of\ncontrolling multiplicity in the common case of repeatedly testing variants of\nan experiment when the threshold is not reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 05:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

As a first step to study this problem analytically\nusing the inverse-scattering transform, we consider the direct spectral\ntransform for the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II equation for smooth initial\ndata in the semiclassical limit. The direct spectral transform involves a\nsingularly-perturbed elliptic Dirac system in two dimensions.

This is because, if the walls are thin, the\nlowest energy modes of deformation are strain-free, and thus described by\nsurface isometries. If it is to stand, however, an arch had better possess some\nminimum rigidity. The bending energy consistent with this construction\nprotocol, we will show, can only depend on curvature deviations away from the\nreference equilibrium form. The question of stability, like the determination\nof equilibrium, turns on the geometry. We show how to construct the\nself-adjoint operator controlling the response to deformations consistent with\nisometry. As illustration, we reassess the stability of a simple catenary arch\nin terms of the behavior of the ground state of this operator. The energy of\nthis state increases monotonically with the bending rigidity and it is possible\nto identify the critical rigidity above which the arch is rendered stable.\nWhile this dependence may be monotonic, it exhibits a number of subcritical\nkinks indicating significant qualitative changes in the ground state associated\nwith eigenvalue crossovers among the unstable modes in the spectrum; the number\nof such competing modes increasing rapidly as the rigidity is lowered. The\ninitial collapse of a subcritical arch is controlled by the ground state; on\nthe critical threshold, there are two unstable modes of equal energy, one\nraising the arch at its center, the other lowering it.

Emerging technologies now allow for mass spectrometry based\nprofiling of up to thousands of small molecule metabolites (metabolomics) in an\nincreasing number of biosamples. While offering great promise for revealing\ninsight into the pathogenesis of human disease, standard approaches have yet to\nbe established for statistically analyzing increasingly complex,\nhigh-dimensional human metabolomics data in relation to clinical phenotypes\nincluding disease outcomes. To determine optimal statistical approaches for\nmetabolomics analysis, we sought to formally compare traditional statistical as\nwell as newer statistical learning methods across a range of metabolomics\ndataset types. Results. In simulated and experimental metabolomics data derived\nfrom large population-based human cohorts, we observed that with an increasing\nnumber of study subjects, univariate compared to multivariate methods resulted\nin a higher false discovery rate due to substantial correlations among\nmetabolites. In scenarios wherein the number of assayed metabolites increases,\nas in the application of nontargeted versus targeted metabolomics measures,\nmultivariate methods performed especially favorably across a range of\nstatistical operating characteristics. In nontargeted metabolomics datasets\nthat included thousands of metabolite measures, sparse multivariate models\ndemonstrated greater selectivity and lower potential for spurious\nrelationships. Conclusion. When the number of metabolites was similar to or\nexceeded the number of study subjects, as is common with nontargeted\nmetabolomics analysis of relatively small sized cohorts, sparse multivariate\nmodels exhibited the most robust statistical power with more consistent\nresults. These findings have important implications for the analysis of\nmetabolomics studies of human disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 08:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

(2013) is extended to a general multivariate\nframework (MMSQ) and to provide a sparse estimator of the scale matrix\n(sparse-MMSQ). The MSQ, like alternative likelihood-free procedures, is based\non the minimisation of the distance between appropriate statistics evaluated on\nthe true and synthetic data simulated from the postulated model. Those\nstatistics are functions of the quantiles providing an effective way to deal\nwith distributions that do not admit moments of any order like the\n$\\alpha$-Stable or the Tukey lambda distribution. The lack of a natural\nordering represents the major challenge for the extension of the method to the\nmultivariate framework. Here, we rely on the notion of projectional quantile\nrecently introduced by Hallin etal. (2010) and Kong Mizera (2012). We establish\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. The smoothly\nclipped absolute deviation (SCAD) $\\ell_1$--penalty of Fan and Li (2001) is\nthen introduced into the MMSQ objective function in order to achieve sparse\nestimation of the scaling matrix which is the major responsible for the curse\nof dimensionality problem. We extend the asymptotic theory and we show that the\nsparse-MMSQ estimator enjoys the oracle properties under mild regularity\nconditions. The method is illustrated and its effectiveness is tested using\nseveral synthetic datasets simulated from the Elliptical Stable distribution\n(ESD) for which alternative methods are recognised to perform poorly. The\nmethod is then applied to build a new network-based systemic risk measurement\nframework. The proposed methodology to build the network relies on a new\nsystemic risk measure and on a parametric test of statistical dominance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 08:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In a sub-set of the asteroids called main-belt comets (MBCs),\nthe sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity\n[6-8]. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of\nactive comets [9] and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei\n[10].

Enzymatic activity\ncan induce broken detailed balance at the molecular scale. This molecular scale\nbreaking of detailed balance is crucial to achieve biological functions such as\nhigh-fidelity transcription and translation, sensing, adaptation, biochemical\npatterning, and force generation. While biological systems such as motor\nenzymes violate detailed balance at the molecular scale, it remains unclear how\nnon-equilibrium dynamics manifests at the mesoscale in systems that are driven\nthrough the collective activity of many motors. Indeed, in several cellular\nsystems the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics is not always evident at large\nscales. For example, in the cytoskeleton or in chromosomes one can observe\nstationary stochastic processes that appear at first glance thermally driven.\nThis raises the question how non-equilibrium fluctuations can be discerned from\nthermal noise. We discuss approaches that have recently been developed to\naddress this question, including methods based on measuring the extent to which\nthe system violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying\nsuch as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two\ndifferent possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing\n(HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of\nthe object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information\nis implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure)\nrepresents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In\ncontrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure\nholds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of\nthe whole set of particles.\n  The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and\nflexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance\nof SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our\nparticle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon\nprocessors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the\nAoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor\nof ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and\nmulti-purpose GPUs.\n  Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has\noptimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same\nhandiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such\ntemplate meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user\ndefined heterogeneous data structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 09:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This work presents a theoretical analysis of dropout for matrix\nfactorization, where Bernoulli random variables are used to drop a factor,\nthereby attempting to control the size of the factorization. While recent work\nhas demonstrated the empirical effectiveness of dropout for matrix\nfactorization, a theoretical understanding of the regularization properties of\ndropout in this context remains elusive. This work demonstrates the equivalence\nbetween dropout and a fully deterministic model for matrix factorization in\nwhich the factors are regularized by the sum of the product of the norms of the\ncolumns. While the resulting regularizer is closely related to a variational\nform of the nuclear norm, suggesting that dropout may limit the size of the\nfactorization, we show that it is possible to trivially lower the objective\nvalue by doubling the size of the factorization. We show that this problem is\ncaused by the use of a fixed dropout rate, which motivates the use of a rate\nthat increases with the size of the factorization. Synthetic experiments\nvalidate our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 10:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

A\nmotor efficient in cargo transport would move along cytoskeletal filaments with\na high speed and a minimal error in transport distance (or time) while\nconsuming a minimal amount of energy.

A recently formulated \\emph{thermodynamic uncertainty relation}\noffers a theoretical framework for the energy-accuracy trade-off relation\nubiquitous in biological processes. According to the relation, a measure\n$\\mathcal{Q}$, the product between the heat dissipated from a motor and the\nsquared relative error in the displacement, has a minimal theoretical bound\n($\\mathcal{Q} \\geq 2 k_B T$), which is approached when the time trajectory of\nthe motor is maximally regular for a given amount of free energy input.

Recently Carleo and Troyer Science\n355, 602 (2017) introduced a new type sampleable ansatz called neural-network\nquantum states (NQS) that are inspired by the restricted Boltzmann model used\nin machine learning. By employing the formalism of tensor networks we show that\nNQS are a special form of CPS with novel properties. Diagramatically a number\nof simple observations become transparent. Namely, that NQS are CPS built from\nextensively sized GHZ-form correlators, which are related to a canonical\npolyadic decomposition of a tensor, making them uniquely unbiased\ngeometrically. Another immediate implication of the equivalence to CPS is that\nwe are able to formulate exact NQS representations for a wide range of\nparadigmatic states, including superposition of weighed-graph states, the\nLaughlin state, toric code states, and the resonating valence bond state. These\nexamples reveal the potential of using higher dimensional hidden units and a\nsecond hidden layer in NQS. The major outlook of this study is the elevation of\nNQS to correlator operators allowing them to enhance conventional\nwell-established variational Monte Carlo approaches for strongly correlated\nfermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 12:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

Two situations result in the\nproduction of classical Turing patterns; regularly spaced spots and labyrinth\npatterns. Moreover, an initial slope in the activation of the transcription\nfactor produces straight lines. The third situation does not lead to patterns,\nbut results in different homogeneous color tones. Finally, the fourth one sheds\nnew light on the possible mechanisms leading to the formation of piebald\npatterns exemplified by the random patterns on the fur of some cow strains and\nDalmatian dogs. We demonstrate that these piebald patterns are of transient\nnature, develop from random initial conditions and rely on a system's\nbi-stability.

The achieved evaluation results assured\nthe significant scalability and the high quality resource mapping of the\nproposed resource discovery and management over highly heterogeneous,\nhierarchical and dynamic computing environments with respect to several\nscalability and efficiency aspects while supporting flexible and complex\nqueries with guaranteed discovery results accuracy.

The local\nwell-posedness of the Green-Naghdi equations (and their justification as an\nasymptotic model for the water waves equations) has been extensively studied,\nbut always under the assumption that the water depth is bounded from below by a\npositive constant. The aim of this article is to remove this assumption. The\nproblem then becomes a free-boundary problem since the position of the\nshoreline is unknown and driven by the solution itself. For the (hyperbolic)\nnonlinear shallow water equation, this problem is very related to the vacuum\nproblem for a compressible gas.

Recent studies have found turbulent\nspeeds smaller than what fully-developed MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.\n2015, 2017). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H2 ratio of 0.0001\nin locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated.

Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in\nlinear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics\nof learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and\nsignal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of\ngradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and\noverfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network\nsizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of\nsamples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.\nAdditionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires\nstarting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural\nnetworks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their\ngeneralization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce\novertraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort.

The\nscaling notion stems from noting that the path length has to be larger than\nwhat it would be in free space to have the same potential difference across the\ncharged discs since the electric field strength is reduced within a homogenous\ndielectric medium by the relative permittivity. This scaling permits\ntranslation of practical measurements across a range of aspect ratios and\nrelative permittivities.

Second, the interior of the neutron star may well be\nmade of quarks due to very very high pressure. It is further shown that the\ninterior of heavy neutron star, recently discovered $\\approx$ 2M$_{\\odot}$,\nwith an appropriate equation of state, can also be made of quark core.

A fundamental\nproblem is that the borders of such systems are often not well-defined\na-priori, which among other problems can lead to unwanted behavior during\nruntime. Ideally, unwanted behavior should be prevented. If this is not\npossible the system shall at least be able to help determine potential cause(s)\na-posterori, identify responsible parties and make them accountable for their\nbehavior. Recently, several algorithms addressing these concepts have been\nproposed. However, the applicability of the corresponding approaches,\nspecifically their effectiveness and performance, is mostly unknown. Therefore,\nin this paper, we propose ACCBench, a benchmark tool that allows to compare and\nevaluate causality algorithms under a consistent setting. Furthermore, we\ncontribute an implementation of the two causality algorithms by G\\\"o{\\ss}ler\nand Metayer and G\\\"o{\\ss}ler and Astefanoaei as well as of a policy compliance\napproach based on some concepts of Main et al.

In the course of this, we\nshow that the effectiveness of the algorithms in terms of cause detection as\nwell as their performance differ to some extent. In addition, our analysis\nreports on some qualitative aspects that should be considered when evaluating\neach algorithm. For example, the human effort needed to configure the algorithm\nand model the use case is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 05:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}
