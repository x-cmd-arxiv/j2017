We begin by\nreviewing the basic concepts and notions of DFT. Afterwards, we turn to Double\nField Theory on group manifolds (DFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$). In order to obtain its\naction and gauge transformations, Closed String Field Theory (CSFT)\ncomputations are performed on a worldsheet, governed by a Wess-Zumino-Witten\nmodel on a group manifold. We consider generalized diffeomorphisms and their\ngauge algebra, which closes under a modified strong constraint. To explore the\nconnection between this theory and DFT, we recast it in terms of doubled\ngeneralized objects and extrapolate it to all orders in fields. This yields a\ngeneralized metric formulation and a flux formulation. We study the underlying\nsymmetries and field equations for both formulations. A novel feature in\nDFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$ is an additional $2D$-diffeomorphism invariance. An\nadditional extended strong constraint which breaks the $2D$-diffeomorphism\ninvariance can be imposed to reduce DFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$ to DFT. Furthermore,\nwe perform a generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactification to recover the bosonic\nsubsector of half-maximal, electrically gauged supergravities. In this context,\nwe show how to construct twists for each embedding tensor solution explicitly\nby using Maurer-Cartan forms. Finally, we generalize the ideas and notions from\nDFT$_\\mathrm{WZW}$ to geometric Exceptional Field Theory (gEFT). This allows us\nto present a systematic construction for generalized parallelizable spaces in\ndim M = 4 SL(5) Exceptional Field Theory (EFT). These spaces permit a unified\ntreatment of consistent maximally supersymmetric truncations of ten- and\neleven-dimensional supergravity in Generalized Geometry (GG) and their\nsystematic construction has always been an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 16:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Once these measurements are included in a\nUV radiative transfer model, we find that modelled UV sol-integrated energies\nacross the planet are lower than pre-measurement estimates by 35% on average,\nconsidering all latitudes and seasons. This reduction, in turn, reduces the\npredicted production of methane from individual accreting IDPs, extending their\nlifetimes and increasing the surface concentration of organics that must\naccumulate in order to emit sufficient methane to balance the accretion of\norganic compounds to Mars. Emission from reasonable accumulations of IDPs could\nrange up to ~7.9x10^-4 ppbv sol^-1. Richer deposits of organic carbon at the\nsurface may emit methane at no more than 3.9 ppbv sol^-1.

This in\nturn affects planet formation. Recently, the effect of disk wind torque has\nbeen considered with the suggestion that it would carve out the surface density\nof the disk from inside and would induce global gas flows (wind-driven\naccretion). We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I\nmigration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to\naddress this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were\nalso performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by\nturbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation\neffect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven\naccretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In\nMRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk\nevolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow\nis fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated. Then, the fact that\nthe surface density slope can be positive in the inner region due to the wind\ntorque can generate an outward migration region extended to super-Earth mass\nplanets. In this case, we observe that no planets fall onto the central star in\nN-body simulations with migration forces imposed to reproduce such migration\npattern. We also see that super-Earth mass planets can undergo outward\nmigration. Relatively rapid gas flows affects type I migration and thus the\nformation of close-in planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 16:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

This paper aims to\ndevelop communication techniques for making such a paradigm shift from the\nconventional human-type broadband communications to the emerging machine-type\nURLLC. One fundamental task for URLLC is to deliver a short command from the\ncontroller to each actuator within the stringent delay requirement and also\nwith high-reliability in the downlink. Motivated by the geographic feature in\nindustrial automation that in the factories many tasks are assigned to\ndifferent groups of devices who work in close proximity to each other and thus\ncan form clusters of reliable device-to-device (D2D) networks, this paper\nproposes a novel two-phase transmission protocol for achieving the above goal.\nSpecifically, in the first phase within the latency requirement, the\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) combines the messages of each group together\nand multicasts them to the corresponding groups; while in the second phase, the\ndevices that have decoded the messages successfully, who are defined as the\nleaders, help relay the messages to the other devices in their groups. Under\nthis protocol, we further design an innovative leader selection based\nbeamforming strategy at the BS by utilizing the sparse optimization technique,\nwhich leads to the desired sparsity pattern in user activity, i.e., at least\none leader exists in each group, in the first phase, thus making full\nutilization of the reliable D2D networks in the second phase. Simulation\nresults are provided to show that the proposed two-phase transmission protocol\nconsiderably improves the reliability of the whole system within the stringent\nlatency requirement as compared to other existing schemes for URLLC such as\nOccupy CoW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 16:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 15:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 02:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Current challenges\nfall into two groups: the content of the video, such as rate of speech or; the\nparameters of the video recording e.g, video resolution. We show that HD video\nis not needed to successfully lipread with a computer. The term \"viseme\" is\nused in machine lipreading to represent a visual cue or gesture which\ncorresponds to a subgroup of phonemes where the phonemes are visually\nindistinguishable. A phoneme is the smallest sound one can utter, because there\nare more phonemes per viseme, maps between units show a many-to-one\nrelationship. Many maps have been presented, we compare these and our results\nshow Lee's is best. We propose a new method of speaker-dependent\nphoneme-to-viseme maps and compare these to Lee's. Our results show the\nsensitivity of phoneme clustering and we use our new knowledge to augment a\nconventional MLR system. It has been observed in MLR, that classifiers need\ntraining on test subjects to achieve accuracy. Thus machine lipreading is\nhighly speaker-dependent. Conversely speaker independence is robust\nclassification of non-training speakers. We investigate the dependence of\nphoneme-to-viseme maps between speakers and show there is not a high\nvariability of visemes, but there is high variability in trajectory between\nvisemes of individual speakers with the same ground truth. This implies a\ndependency upon the number of visemes within each set for each individual. We\nshow that prior phoneme-to-viseme maps rarely have enough visemes and the\noptimal size, which varies by speaker, ranges from 11-35. Finally we decode\nfrom visemes back to phonemes and into words. Our novel approach uses the\noptimum range visemes within hierarchical training of phoneme classifiers and\ndemonstrates a significant increase in classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 17:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

A major challenge for the adoption of synthesis\nremains in having the programmer communicate their intent. When the expressed\nintent is coarse-grained (for example, restriction on the expected type of an\nexpression), the synthesizer often produces a long list of results for the\nprogrammer to choose from, shifting the heavy-lifting to the user. An\nalternative approach, successfully used in end-user synthesis is programming by\nexample (PBE), where the user leverages examples to interactively and\niteratively refine the intent. However, using only examples is not expressive\nenough for programmers, who can observe the generated program and refine the\nintent by directly relating to parts of the generated program.\n  We present a novel approach to interacting with a synthesizer using a\ngranular interaction model. Our approach employs a rich interaction model where\n(i) the synthesizer decorates a candidate program with debug information that\nassists in understanding the program and identifying good or bad parts, and\n(ii) the user is allowed to provide feedback not only on the expected output of\na program, but also on the underlying program itself.

We find that\nBroad Line (BL) AGN have a considerably larger fraction of variable sources\nthan Narrow Line (NL) AGN, and that they have different distributions of the\n$A$ parameter. We find evidence that suggests that most of the low luminosity\nvariable NL sources correspond to BL AGN, where the host galaxy could be\ndamping the variability signal. For high luminosity variable NL, we propose\nthat they can be examples of \"True type II\" AGN or BL AGN with limited spectral\ncoverage which results in missing the Broad Line emission. We also find that\nthe fraction of variable sources classified as unobscured in the X-ray is\nsmaller than the fraction of variable sources unobscured in the optical range.\nWe present evidence that this is related to the differences in the origin of\nthe obscuration in the optical and X-ray regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

While slight perturbation is\ntolerable for robots with moveable bases, correcting the problem is imperative\nfor fixed-base robots if some essential task sections are out of reach. For\nmobile manipulation robots, it is necessary to decide on a specific base\nposition before beginning manipulation tasks.\n  This paper presents Reuleaux, an open source library for robot reachability\nanalyses and base placement.

We find that a toroidally dominated magnetic field is\nessential for the generation of a single spot with a strong magnetic field.\nOnce a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total\nmagnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not\nstationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general\ncoincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal\ndipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\\circ}$ per century. A misaligned\npoloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant\ndisplacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss\nthe evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the $P-\\dot{P}$\ndiagram and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a\nvery short time before they cross the Death-Line of the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram,\ncompared to their characteristic ages.

Previous studies have shown how the braking torque depends\non magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar mass and radius, mass-loss\nrate, and the rotation rate of the star, assuming a fixed coronal temperature.\nFor this study we explore how different coronal temperatures can influence the\nstellar torque.

Hotter winds lead to a faster acceleration, and we\nshow that (for a given magnetic field strength and mass-loss rate) a hotter\noutflow leads to a weaker torque on the star.

We call the\nnew algorithms Lanczos-Stieltjes inverse regression (LSIR) and\nLanczos-Stieltjes average variance estimation (LSAVE) due to their connection\nwith Stieltjes' method---and Lanczos' related discretization---for generating a\nsequence of polynomials that are orthogonal to a given measure. We show that\nthe quadrature-based approach approximates the desired integrals, and we study\nthe behavior of LSIR and LSAVE with three numerical examples. As expected in\nhigh order numerical integration, the quadrature-based LSIR and LSAVE exhibit\nexponential convergence in the integral approximations compared to the first\norder convergence of the classical SIR and SAVE. The disadvantage of LSIR and\nLSAVE is that the underlying tensor product quadrature suffers from the curse\nof dimensionality---that is, the number of quadrature nodes grows exponentially\nwith the input space dimension. Therefore, the proposed approach is most\nappropriate for deterministic functions with fewer than ten independent inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 20:15:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 19:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

As such, developing analytical tools to model and analyze\ncompetitive resource allocation is crucial for devising optimal allocation\nstrategies and anticipating the potential outcomes of the competition. To this\nend, the Colonel Blotto game is one of the most popular game-theoretic\nframeworks for modeling and analyzing such competitive resource allocation\nproblems. However, in many real-world competitive situations, the Colonel\nBlotto game does not admit solutions in deterministic strategies and, hence,\none must rely on analytically complex mixed-strategies with their associated\ntractability, applicability, and practicality challenges. In this paper, a\ngeneralization of the Colonel Blotto game which enables the derivation of\ndeterministic, practical, and implementable equilibrium strategies is proposed\nwhile accounting for the heterogeneity of the battlefields. In addition, the\nproposed generalized game enables accounting for the consumed resources in each\nbattlefield, a feature that is not considered in the classical Blotto game. For\nthe generalized game, the existence of a Nash equilibrium in pure-strategies is\nshown. Then, closed-form analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategies,\nare derived and the outcome of the game is characterized; based on the number\nof resources of each player as well as the valuation of each battlefield. The\ngenerated results provide invaluable insights on the outcome of the\ncompetition. For example, the results show that, when both players are fully\nrational, the more resourceful player can achieve a better total payoff at the\nNash equilibrium, a result that is not mimicked in the classical Blotto game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 20:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 01:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

In other words, cloaking has long served as a\nmajor malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). Cloaking hides\nthe true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users\nversus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of\nemploying cloaking in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting\ncloaking is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP cloaking and are\nnot suitable for detecting cloaking in SEM because their search-and-visit\nmethod leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring\ncloaking on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help\nthem avoid frauds.\n  Our work focuses on mitigating IP cloaking and SEM cloaking, and providing\nclient-based real-time cloaking detection services. To achieve these goals, we\nfirst propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation\nof websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and\nimplement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving\nsystem, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on\ndemand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from\nthe server and compares them with user views to detect cloaking. Since Cloaker\nCatcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP cloaking can be\ndetected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using\nour system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM cloaking and found that the\nmain purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 20:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Using adaptive optics-corrected integral field spectroscopy from\nthe OSIRIS instrument at the W. M.

Understanding its effect on\nplanetary climate and habitability is critical for us to search for a habitable\nworld beyond our solar system. The orbital configurations of M-dwarf planets\nare always tidally-locked at resonance states, which are quite different from\nthose around Sun-like stars. M-dwarf planets need to be investigated\nseparately. Here we use a comprehensive three-dimensional atmospheric general\ncirculation model to systematically investigate how eccentricity influences\nclimate and habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets. The simulation results show\nthat (1) the seasonal climatic cycles of such planets are very weak even for e\n= 0.4. It is unlikely that an aqua planet falls out of a habitable zone during\nits orbit. (2) The annual global mean surface temperature significantly\nincreases with increased eccentricity, due to the decrease of the cloud albedo.\nBoth the runaway greenhouse inner edge and moist greenhouse inner edge shift\noutward. (3) Planets in an eccentric orbit can be captured in other spin-orbit\nresonance states which lead to different climate patterns, namely eyeball\npattern and striped-ball pattern.The striped-ball pattern has evidently higher\nsurface temperatures due to the reduced planetary albedo. Near the outer edge,\nplanets with p = 1.0 and 2.0 are more resistant to the snowball state due to\nmore locally-concentrated stellar fluxes. Thus, planets with integer spin-orbit\nresonance numbers have wider habitable zones than those with half-integer\nspin-orbit resonance states. Above all, as a comparison to circular orbit,\neccentricity shrinks the width of the habitable zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 22:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

While there has been extensive research on modeling the fMRI\nsignal (i.e., the covolution of the experimental design with the functional\nchoice for the hemodynamic response function) and its spatial variability, less\nattention has been paid to realistic modeling of the temporal dependence that\ntypically exists within the fMRI noise, where a low order autoregressive\nprocess is typically adopted.

However, the\nmeasurement of black hole spin remains extremely challenging. We here aim at\ncomparing the mean radiative efficiencies of carefully matched samples of\nradio-loud and radio-quiet SDSS quasars at 0.3<z<0.8.

Moreover, the generalization\nability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require\nelaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning\nfeatures/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning\nframework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure\nand texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input\nface photo into different components according to their representational\ncontents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, we utilize a Branched Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (BFCN) for learning structural and textural\nrepresentations, respectively. In addition, we design a Sorted Matching Mean\nSquare Error (SM-MSE) metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function.\nIn the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates\nstructural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the\nfinal result via a probabilistic fusion scheme. Extensive experiments on\nseveral challenging benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms\nexample-based synthesis algorithms in terms of both perceptual and objective\nmetrics. In addition, the proposed method also has better generalization\nability across dataset without additional training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 03:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Most of past works have\nattributed the charge modulation to electrostatic field effect. However, some\nrecent reports have argued that the electrolyte gating effect in VO2, TiO2 and\nSrTiO3 originated from field-induced oxygen vacancy formation. This gives rise\nto a controversy about the gating mechanism, and it is therefore vital to\nreveal the relationship between the role of electrolyte gating and the\nintrinsic properties of materials.

As the electron spin of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in\ndiamond can be optically initialised nearly perfectly even at room temperature\nand ambient conditions, new opportunities become possible by the combination of\nefficient DNP with optically polarised NV centres. Among such applications are\nnanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of liquids, hyperpolarised\nnanodiamonds as MRI contrast agents as well as the initialisation of nuclear\nspin based diamond quantum simulators. Current realisations of DNP perform the\npolarisation transfer by achieving energetic resonance between electrons and\nnuclei via carefully tuned microwave fields or by using quasi-adiabatic\nsweep-based schemes across resonance points. The former limits robustness\nagainst control errors while the latter limits polarisation rates, making the\nrealisation of the applications extremely challenging. Here we introduce the\nconcept of Hamiltonian engineering by pulse sequences and use it for the\nsystematic design of polarisation sequences that are simultaneously robust and\nfast. We derive sequences theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that\nthey are capable of efficient polarisation transfer from an optically polarised\nnitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond to the surrounding $^{13}$C nuclear spin\nbath even in the presence of control errors, making it an ideal tool for the\nrealisation of the above NV centre based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 08:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Tree spanners with provably good stretch factors find applications in\ncommunication networks, distributed systems, and network design.

We study examples where this relaxation can be\nexpressed explicitly, and we also provide refinements for weighted total\nvariation for a wide range of weights. Since an integral characterization of\nthe relaxation in function space is, in general, not always available, we show\nthat, for a rather general linear inverse problems setting, instead of the\nclassical Tikhonov regularization problem, one can equivalently solve a\nsaddle-point problem where no a priori knowledge of an explicit formulation of\nthe structural TV functional is needed. In particular, motivated by concrete\napplications, we deduce corresponding results for linear inverse problems with\nnorm and Poisson log-likelihood data discrepancy terms. Finally, we provide\nproof-of-concept numerical examples where we solve the saddle-point problem for\nweighted TV denoising as well as for MR guided PET image reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 10:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Nevertheless,\nrecent studies suggest that spin-triplet Cooper pairs can be created at\ncarefully engineered superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces. If Cooper pairs are\nspin-polarized they would transport not only charge but also a net spin\ncomponent, but without dissipation, and therefore minimize the heating effects\nassociated with spintronic devices. Although it is now established that triplet\nsupercurrents exist, their most interesting property - spin - is only inferred\nindirectly from transport measurements. In conventional spintronics, it is well\nknown that spin currents generate spin-transfer torques that alter\nmagnetization dynamics and switch magnetic moments. The observation of similar\neffects due to spin-triplet supercurrents would not only confirm the net spin\nof triplet pairs but also pave the way for applications of superconducting\nspintronics. Here, we present a possible evidence for spin-transfer torques\ninduced by triplet supercurrents in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor\n(S/F/S) Josephson junctions. Below the superconducting transition temperature\nT_c, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field at X-band (~ 9.0 GHz) shifts\nrapidly to a lower field with decreasing temperature due to the spin-transfer\ntorques induced by triplet supercurrents.

This separation is also related to local acidification of the\nsolution. This spontaneous change is associated with a much faster corrosion\nrate. Material morphology is closely related to corrosion kinetics, which can\nbe used for technological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 11:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Using ALMA\nobservations of a number of tracers (12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1)\nand HCO+(4-3)), we map the differences in excitation, density and temperature\nof the gas. The results show that in the immediate vicinity of the radio jet, a\nfast outflow, with velocities up to 800 km/s, is occurring of which the gas has\nhigh excitation temperatures in the range 30-55 K, demonstrating the direct\nimpact of the jet on the ISM. The relative brightness of the CO lines show that\nthe outflow is optically thin. We estimate the mass of the molecular outflow to\nbe 1.2 x 10^6 Msol and likely to be a factor 2-3 larger. This is similar to\nthat of the outflow of atomic gas, but much larger than that of the ionised\noutflow, showing that the outflow is dominated by cold gas. The total mass\noutflow rate we estimate to be ~12 Msol/yr. The mass of the outflow is much\nsmaller than the total gas mass of the ISM of IC 5063. Therefore, although the\ninfluence of the radio jet is very significant in the inner regions, globally\nspeaking the impact will be very modest. We use RADEX modelling to explore the\nphysical conditions of the molecular gas in the outflow. Models with the\noutflowing gas being quite clumpy give the most consistent results and our\npreferred solutions have kinetic temperatures in the range 20-100 K and\ndensities between 10^5 and 10^6 cm^-3. The resulting pressures are 10^6-10^7.5\nK cm^-3, about two orders of magnitude higher than in the outer quiescent disk.\nThe results strongly suggest that the outflow is driven by the radio jet\nexpanding into a clumpy medium, creating a cocoon of gas which is pushed away\nfrom the jet axis resulting in a lateral outflow, very similar to what is\npredicted by numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 12:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Unlike\nmodern SfM pipelines that use vocabulary (Voc.) trees to quickly build the\nmatching graph and avoid a costly brute-force search of matching image pairs,\nGraphMatch does not require an expensive offline pre-processing phase to\nconstruct a Voc. tree. Instead, GraphMatch leverages two priors that can\npredict which image pairs are likely to match, thereby making the matching\nprocess for SfM much more efficient. The first is a score computed from the\ndistance between the Fisher vectors of any two images. The second prior is\nbased on the graph distance between vertices in the underlying matching graph.\nGraphMatch combines these two priors into an iterative \"sample-and-propagate\"\nscheme similar to the PatchMatch algorithm. Its sampling stage uses Fisher\nsimilarity priors to guide the search for matching image pairs, while its\npropagation stage explores neighbors of matched pairs to find new ones with a\nhigh image similarity score. Our experiments show that GraphMatch finds the\nmost image pairs as compared to competing, approximate methods while at the\nsame time being the most efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 13:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Assuming a stochastic independence of the angular and radial\npositions of the GRBs we obtained 1502 additional samples, altogether 542222\ndata points, by bootstrapping the original one. None of these data points\nparticipated in rings having similar level of compactness and regularity as the\noriginal one. Using an appropriate kernel we estimated the joint probability\ndensity of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. Performing MCMC\nsimulations we obtained 1502 new samples, altogether 542222 data points. Among\nthese data points only three represented ring like patterns having similar\nparameters as the original one. By defining a new statistical variable we\ntested the independence of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. We\nconcluded that despite the existence of local irregularities in the GRBs'\nspatial distribution (e.g. the GGR) one can not reject the Cosmological\nPrinciple, based on their spatial distribution as a whole. We pointed out the\nlarge scale spatial pattern of the GRB activity does not necessarily re ects\nthe large scale distribution of the cosmic matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 14:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Here we solve them simultaneously, by\nrecasting all the equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on\nthe same grid with the same finite-volume numerical schemes. The proposed\ncompressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ a hierarchy of\nfive reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more\ninvolved applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection.\nThe communication between the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is\nfacilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the\nsystems, which represent physical material boundaries.

In this paper we identify a class of scalable directed\ngraphs whose edge set is determined by a parameter k and prove that the\nrobustness of these graphs is also determined by k.

This means that the\nconductivity of ZnO can be increased by adding a trace amount of conducting\nmaterial such as Cu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 02:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

A major\ndrawback of hyperspectral imaging devices is their intrinsic low spatial\nresolution. In this paper, we propose a method for increasing the spatial\nresolution of a hyperspectral image by fusing it with an image of higher\nspatial resolution that was obtained with a different imaging modality. This is\naccomplished by solving a variational problem in which the regularization\nfunctional is the directional total variation. To accommodate for possible\nmis-registrations between the two images, we consider a non-convex blind\nsuper-resolution problem where both a fused image and the corresponding\nconvolution kernel are estimated. Using this approach, our model can realign\nthe given images if needed. Our experimental results indicate that the\nnon-convexity is negligible in practice and that reliable solutions can be\ncomputed using a variety of different optimization algorithms. Numerical\nresults on real remote sensing data from plant sciences and urban monitoring\nshow the potential of the proposed method and suggests that it is robust with\nrespect to the regularization parameters, mis-registration and the shape of the\nkernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 15:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 13:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 23:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 14:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}
