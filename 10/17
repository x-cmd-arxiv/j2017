Our data reveal a rapidly-fading\nblue component ($T\\approx5500$ K at 1.5 days) that quickly reddens; spectra\nlater than $\\gtrsim 4.5$ days peak beyond the optical regime. The spectra are\nmostly featureless, although we identify a possible weak emission line at $\\sim\n7900$ \\AA\\ at $t\\lesssim 4.5$ days. The colours, rapid evolution and\nfeatureless spectrum are consistent with a \"blue\" kilonova from polar ejecta\ncomprised mainly of light $r$-process nuclei with atomic mass number $A\\lesssim\n140$. This indicates a sight-line within $\\theta_{\\rm obs}\\lesssim 45^{\\circ}$\nof the orbital axis. Comparison to models suggests $\\sim0.03$ M$_\\odot$ of blue\nejecta, with a velocity of $\\sim 0.3c$. The required lanthanide fraction is\n$\\sim 10^{-4}$, but this drops to $<10^{-5}$ in the outermost ejecta. The large\nvelocities point to a dynamical origin, rather than a disk wind, for this blue\ncomponent, suggesting that both binary constituents are neutron stars (as\nopposed to a binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole). For\ndynamical ejecta, the high mass favors a small neutron star radius of $\\lesssim\n12$ km. This mass also supports the idea that neutron star mergers are a major\ncontributor to $r$-process nucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

To use those, they first need to be accurately characterised. In\nparticular, colours are needed to derive the interstellar extinction. As no\nfilter is available for the first Gaia data release and to avoid the atmosphere\nmodel mismatch, an empirical calibration is unavoidable. The purpose of this\nwork is to provide the first complete and robust photometric empirical\ncalibration of the Gaia Red Clump stars of the solar neighbourhood, through\ncolour-colour, effective temperature-colour and absolute magnitude-colour\nrelations, from the Gaia, Johnson, 2MASS, Hipparcos, Tycho-2, APASS-SLOAN and\nWISE photometric systems, and the APOGEE DR13 spectroscopic temperatures. We\nused a 3D extinction map to select low reddening red giants. To calibrate the\ncolour-colour and the effective temperature-colour relations, we developed a\nMCMC method which accounts for all variable uncertainties and selects the best\nmodel for each photometric relation. We estimate the Red Clump absolute\nmagnitude through the mode of a kernel-based distribution function. We provide\n20 colour vs G-Ks relations and the first Teff vs G-Ks calibration.

Merging neutron stars (NS) represent the standard\nscenario for short-duration (< 2 sec) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which are\nproduced in a collimated, relativistically expanding jet with an opening angle\nof a few degrees and a bulk Lorentz factor of 300-1000. While the present aLIGO\ndetection is consistent with predictions, the measured faint gamma-ray emission\nfrom GW 170817A, if associated to the merger event at a distance of 40 Mpc, is\nabout 1000x less luminous than known short-duration GRBs (sGRBs). Hence, the\npresence of this sGRB in the local Universe is either a very rare event, or\npoints to a dramatic ignorance of the emission properties of sGRBs outside\ntheir narrow jets. Here we show that the majority of previously detected faint\nsGRBs are local, at redshift smaller than 0.1, seen off-axis. In contrast, the\nbrighter sGRBs are seen on-axis, and therefore out to larger distances,\nconsistent with the measured redshift distribution. Examining the\nobserver-frame parameter space of all Fermi/GBM sGRBs shows that the sGRB\nassociated with GW 170817A is extreme in its combination of flux, spectral\nsoftness and temporal structure. We identify a group of similar GRBs, one of\nwhich has been associated to a bright galaxy at 75 Mpc. We incorporate off-axis\nemission in the estimate of the rates of sGRBs, and predict that the majority\nof future GW-detections of NS-NS mergers will be accompanied by faint gamma-ray\nemission, contrary to previous thinking. The much more frequent off-axis\nemission of sGRBs also implies a much higher deadly rate of gamma-rays for\nextraterrestrial life in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

On 17\nAugust 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong\nsignal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds\nafter the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region\nof the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the\ngravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical\nastronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient\nsignal within $\\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger\nobservations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the\ngravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the\nHubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of\nthe Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental\nimportance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source\ninferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity\ninferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This\napproach does not require any form of cosmic \"distance ladder;\" the\ngravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out\nto cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical\ndistance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be\n$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \\, \\mathrm{km} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$\n(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent with\nexisting measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional\nstandard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide\nprecision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The two week long electromagnetic\ncounterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical\ntransient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the\ndynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation\nof the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological\nmodel calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta.\nSpecifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the\ngravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical\nejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the\ncorresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of\ndynamical ejecta mass range between $M_{ej} = 10^{-3} - 10^{-2} M_{\\odot}$ for\nvarious equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In\naddition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron\nstar merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of\nevents like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta\nmass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if $\\gtrsim10\\%$ of the\nmatter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements,\nGW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process\nmaterial observed in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 17:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

The\nmerger rate of binary neutron stars estimated from this event suggests that\ndistant, unresolvable binary neutron stars create a significant astrophysical\nstochastic gravitational-wave background. The binary neutron star background\nwill add to the background from binary black holes, increasing the amplitude of\nthe total astrophysical background relative to previous expectations. In the\nAdvanced LIGO-Virgo frequency band most sensitive to stochastic backgrounds\n(near 25 Hz), we predict a total astrophysical background with amplitude\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW} (f=25 \\text{Hz}) = 1.8_{-1.3}^{+2.7} \\times 10^{-9}$ with\n$90\\%$ confidence, compared with $\\Omega_{\\rm GW} (f=25 \\text{Hz}) =\n1.1_{-0.7}^{+1.2} \\times 10^{-9}$ from binary black holes alone. Assuming the\nmost probable rate for compact binary mergers, we find that the total\nbackground may be detectable with a signal-to-noise-ratio of 3 after 40 months\nof total observation time, based on the expected timeline for Advanced LIGO and\nVirgo to reach their design sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 22:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The\noptical source was associated with the early-type galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance\nof just $\\sim$40 Mpc, consistent with the gravitational-wave measurement, and\nthe merger was localized to be at a projected distance of $\\sim$2 kpc away from\nthe galaxy's center. We use this minimal set of facts and the mass posteriors\nof the two neutron stars to derive the first constraints on the progenitor of\nGW170817 at the time of the second supernova (SN). We generate simulated\nprogenitor populations and follow the three-dimensional kinematic evolution\nfrom the binary neutron star (BNS) birth to the merger time, accounting for\npre-SN galactic motion, for considerably different input distributions of the\nprogenitor mass, pre-SN semimajor axis, and SN-kick velocity. Though not\nconsiderably tight, we find these constraints to be comparable to those for\nGalactic BNS progenitors. The derived constraints are very strongly influenced\nby the requirement of keeping the binary bound after the second SN and having\nthe merger occur relatively close to the center of the galaxy. These\nconstraints are insensitive to the galaxy's star formation history, provided\nthe stellar populations are older than 1 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 18:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

We identify line features in the\nspectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (90 < A < 140). As it\nfades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and emission may have contribution by\na higher opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component.

In models of such mergers a small amount of mass\n($10^{-4}$-$10^{-2}$ solar masses) with a low electron fraction is ejected at\nhigh velocities (0.1-0.3 times light speed) and/or carried out by winds from an\naccretion disk formed around the newly merged object.

A large uncertainty in the composition of the\nnewly synthesized material leads to various expected colours, durations and\nluminosities for such transients.

The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of DLT17ck are unique,\nwith an absolute peak magnitude of Mr = -15.8 \\pm 0.1 and an r-band decline\nrate of 1.1mag/d. This fast evolution is generically consistent with kilonova\nmodels, which have been predicted as the optical counterpart to binary neutron\nstar coalescences. Analysis of archival DLT40 data do not show any sign of\ntransient activity at the location of DLT17ck down to r~19 mag in the time\nperiod between 8 months and 21 days prior to GW170817. This discovery\nrepresents the beginning of a new era for multi-messenger astronomy opening a\nnew path to study and understand binary neutron star coalescences, short\ngamma-ray bursts and their optical counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The emerging near-infrared component is\nwidely attributed to the formation of r-process elements which provide the\nopacity to shift the blue light into the near infrared. An alternative scenario\nis that the light from the blue component gets extinguished by dust formed by\nthe kilonova and subsequently is re-emitted at near-infrared wavelengths. We\nhere test this hypothesis using the lightcurves of AT2017gfo, the kilonova\naccompanying GW170817. We find that of order 10$^{-5}$ $M_\\odot$ of carbon is\nrequired to reproduce the optical/near-infrared lightcurves as the kilonova\nfades. This putative dust cools from $\\sim$ 2000 K at $\\sim$ 4 d after the\nevent to $\\sim$ 1500 K over the course of the following week, thus requiring\ndust with a high condensation temperature, such as carbon. We contrast this\nwith the nucleosynthetic yields predicted by a range of kilonova wind models.\nThese suggest that at most 10$^{-9}$ $M_\\odot$ of carbon is formed. Moreover,\nthe decay in the inferred dust temperature is slower than that expected in\nkilonova models. We therefore conclude that in current models of the blue\ncomponent of the kilonova, the near-infrared component in the kilonova\naccompanying GW170817 is unlikely to be due to dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 16:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

However,\nit is limited in accuracy by the well-known problem of the mass-sheet\ndegeneracy: too rigid assumptions on the density profile of the lens can\npotentially bias the inference on cosmological parameters. I investigate the\ndegeneracy between the choice of the lens density profile and the inference on\nthe Hubble constant, focusing on double image systems. By expanding lensing\nobservables in terms of the local derivatives of the lens potential around the\nEinstein radius, and assuming circular symmetry, I show that three degrees of\nfreedom in the radial direction are necessary to achieve a few percent accuracy\nin the time-delay distance. Additionally, while the time delay is strongly\ndependent on the second derivative of the potential, observables typically used\nto constrain lens models in time-delay studies, such as image position and\nradial magnification information, are mostly sensitive to the first and third\nderivatives, making it very challenging to accurately determine time-delay\ndistances with lensing data alone.

The expected thermal emission and\nwavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital parameters and\ngeometries, including dust that is optically thick to stellar radiation, and\nfor a size distribution of dust with realistic optical properties. We first\nconsider dust distributed evenly around the orbit, then show how to derive its\nuneven distribution from the optical light curve and to predict light curves at\ndifferent wavelengths. The fractional luminosity of an even distribution is\napproximately the level of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance\nfrom the star at transit. Non-detection of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852\nthus provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement the 0.6au\nupper limit imposed by 0.4day dips. Unless the dust distribution is optically\nthick, the putative 16% century-long secular dimming must have disappeared\nbefore the WISE 12micron measurement in 2010, and subsequent 4.5micron\nobservations require transits at >0.05au. However, self-absorption of thermal\nemission removes these constraints for opaque dust distributions.

To achieve this, the ejecta must be\nreheated at a substantial distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to\navoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can\noccur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star\nhas evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner\nbinary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because\nthe outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical\nejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process.

Previous work has characterized temporal\naccumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,\nreal-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change\nover time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the\ncurrent state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a\ndynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence\nby adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing\nresults about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the\noptimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus\nstatistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these\ncomponents were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted\nevidence almost optimally.

Nevertheless, location of such events remain\nunknown. A promising solution to the localization problem is to find an\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterpart of GW- generating events, such as binary\nneutron star mergers (BNS). Indeed, their GW emission will be above sensitivity\nthreshold in the near future. BNS are also considered as short Gamma Ray Bursts\n(sGRB) progenitors. However, sGRB are highly beamed. In this study, we will\ntherefore focus on another EM counterpart candidate: the cocoon afterglow. The\npropagation of the GRB jet inside the matter ejected by the BNS produces a\ncocoon. Then, similarly to the GRB afterglow, a cocoon afterglow is produced,\nbut with a mildly relativistic velocity. Firstly, we propose a model that gives\nthe full hydrodynamic evolution of the cocoon including the mildly relativistic\nregime. Then we calculate the cocoon afterglow emission in X-ray, optical and\nradio wavelengths. Finally, we compare the cocoon afterglow emission to the GRB\nafterglow emission and conclude that the cocoon afterglow is a promising EM\ncounterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 18:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Instead\nof using expensive pump sources at special wavelengths and bulky active or\npassive modulation elements for Q-switching or mode-locking, the cascade\ngain-switching only requires the pumping of an electric-modulated 1.55-$\\mu$m\npulsed laser and two continuous-wave (CW) 975-nm laser diodes. They are all\nstandard products for fiber optic communication applications, which can greatly\nlower the cost of mid-infrared laser pulse generation.

Even though\nthe growth of EMRs is at a lighting fast speed in the era of big data, content\nlimitations in EMRs restrain the existed recommendation systems to reflect\nrelevant medical facts, such as drug-drug interactions. Many medical knowledge\ngraphs that contain drug-related information, such as DrugBank, may give hope\nfor the recommendation systems. However, the direct use of these knowledge\ngraphs in the systems suffers from robustness caused by the incompleteness of\nthe graphs. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in graph\nembedding learning techniques and propose a novel framework, called Safe\nMedicine Recommendation (SMR), in this paper. Specifically, SMR first\nconstructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMRs (MIMIC-III) and\nmedical knowledge graphs (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, SMR jointly\nembeds diseases, medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a\nshared lower dimensional space. Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose\nthe medicine recommendation into a link prediction process while considering\nthe patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions. To our best knowledge, SMR\nis the first to learn embeddings of a patient-disease-medicine graph for\nmedicine recommendation in the world.

One common solution to these problems is to deploy monitors to detect\nmisbehaviors on certain channel. However, in multi-channel CRNs, it is very\ncostly to deploy monitors on every channel. With a limited number of monitors,\nwe have to decide which channels to monitor. In addition, we need to determine\nhow long to monitor each channel and in which order to monitor, because\nswitching channels incurs costs. Moreover, the information about the misuse\nbehavior is not available a priori. To answer those questions, we model the\nspectrum monitoring problem as an adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with\nswitching costs (MAB-SC), propose an effective framework, and design two online\nalgorithms, SpecWatch-II and SpecWatch-III, based on the same framework. To\nevaluate the algorithms, we use weak regret, i.e., the performance difference\nbetween the solution of our algorithm and optimal (fixed) solution in\nhindsight, as the metric. We prove that the expected weak regret of\nSpecWatch-II is O(T^{2/3}), where T is the time horizon. Whereas, the actual\nweak regret of SpecWatch-III is O(T^{2/3}) with probability 1 - {\\delta}, for\nany {\\delta} in (0, 1). Both algorithms guarantee the upper bounds matching the\nlower bound of the general adversarial MAB- SC problem. Therefore, they are all\nasymptotically optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

One of its most important applicative fields is that\nof robotics, in particular the needing of a robot to be aware of what's around\nand the consequent exploitation of that information as a benefit for its tasks.\nIn this work we consider the problem of a robot that enters a new environment\nand wants to understand visual data coming from its camera, so to extract\nknowledge from them. As main novelty we want to overcome the needing of a\nphysical robot, as it could be expensive and unhandy, so to hopefully enhance,\nspeed up and ease the research in this field. That's why we propose to develop\nan application for a mobile platform that wraps several deep visual recognition\ntasks. First we deal with a simple Image classification, testing a model\nobtained from an AlexNet trained on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. Several photo\nsettings are considered to better understand which factors affect most the\nquality of classification. For the same purpose we are interested to integrate\nthe classification task with an extra module dealing with segmentation of the\nobject inside the image. In particular we propose a technique for extracting\nthe object shape and moving out all the background, so to focus the\nclassification only on the region occupied by the object. Another significant\ntask that is included is that of object discovery. Its purpose is to simulate\nthe situation in which the robot needs a certain object to complete one of its\nactivities. It starts searching for what it needs by looking around and trying\nto understand the location of the object by scanning the surrounding\nenvironment. Finally we provide a tool for dealing with the creation of\ncustomized task-specific databases, meant to better suit to one's needing in a\nparticular vision task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 11:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

Assuming small\nvariations from ideal-gas behavior, a closed-form solution is obtained that is\nvalid over a wide range of conditions. An expansion in these\nmolecular-interaction parameters simplifies relations for flow variables,\nelucidating the role of molecular repulsion and attraction in variations from\nideal-gas behavior. Real-gas modifications in density, enthalpy, and sound\nspeed for a given pressure and temperature lead to variations in many basic\ncompressible flow configurations.

The decision maker needs to choose a pair of items for\ncomparison in each step, decide when to stop data collection, and make a final\ndecision after stopping, based on a sequential flow of information. Due to the\ncomplex ranking structure, existing sequential analysis methods are not\nsuitable.\n  In this paper, we formulate the problem under a Bayesian decision framework\nand propose sequential procedures that are asymptotically optimal. These\nprocedures achieve asymptotic optimality by seeking for a balance between\nexploration (i.e. finding the most indistinguishable pair of items) and\nexploitation (i.e. comparing the most indistinguishable pair based on the\ncurrent information).

We formulate a computation offloading game to model the competition\nbetween IoT users and allocate the limited processing power of fog nodes\nefficiently. Each user aims to maximize its own quality of experience (QoE),\nwhich reflects its satisfaction of using computing services in terms of the\nreduction in computation energy and delay.

Once\nan initial solution is found, their performance can be dramatically improved by\nrestricting subsequent samples to regions of the state space that can\npotentially improve the current solution. When the motion planning problem lies\nin a Euclidean space, this region $X_{inf}$, called the informed set, can be\nsampled directly. However, when planning with differential constraints in\nnon-Euclidean state spaces, no analytic solutions exists to sampling $X_{inf}$\ndirectly.\n  State-of-the-art approaches to sampling $X_{inf}$ in such domains such as\nHierarchical Rejection Sampling (HRS) may still be slow in high-dimensional\nstate space.

To have an analytic headway\nwe assume that scalars have a big mass. At past and future infinities of the\nbackground we have flat Minkowski regions which are joint by the inflationary\nexpansion region. We use the tree-level Keldysh propagator in the theory in\nquestion to calculate the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor which\nis, thus, due to the excitations of the zero-point fluctuations. Then we show\nthat even for large mass, if the de Sitter expansion stage is long enough, the\nquantum loop corrections to the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor\nare not negligible in comparison with the tree-level contribution. That is\nrevealed itself via the excitation of the higher-point fluctuations of the\nexact modes: During the expansion stage a non-zero particle number density for\nthe exact modes is generated. This density is not Plankian and serves as a\nquench which leads to a thermalization in the out Minkowski stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 06:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 09:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 22:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

In this paper, a anomaly detection method for\nlarge-scale Internet topology is proposed by considering the changes of network\ncrashes. In order to quantify the dynamic changes of Internet topology, the\nnetwork path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which will highlight the\nInternet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously. Furthermore we\nproposed the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to\ndetermine whether the Internet is abnormal or not. That is the current Internet\nis abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain which structured by the\nprevious k NPCCs of Internet topology. Finally the new Internet anomaly\ndetection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly\nevents. The results show that the detection accuracy of all events are over\n97%, the detection precision of each event are 90.24%, 83.33% and 66.67%, when\nk = 36. According to the experimental values of the index F_1, we found the the\nbetter the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has\nbetter performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than\nthat caused by intentional attack. Compared with traditional anomaly detection,\nour work may be more simple and powerful for the government or organization in\nitems of detecting large-scale abnormal events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 06:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\naliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the\nsampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals.

(2011) pointed out that the complicated\nradiative transfer (RT) of the resonant Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission line generates\nan anisotropic selection bias in the LAE clustering on large scales, $s\\gtrsim\n10$ Mpc. This effect could potentially induce a systematic error in the BAO and\nRSD measurements. Also, Croft et al. (2016) claims an observational evidence of\nthe effect in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ intensity map, albeit statistically\ninsignificant. We aim at quantifying the impact of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ RT on the\nlarge-scale galaxy clustering in detail. For this purpose, we study the\ncorrelations between the large-scale environment and the ratio of an apparent\nLyman-$\\alpha$ luminosity to an intrinsic one, which we call the `observed\nfraction', at $2<z<6$. We apply our Lyman-$\\alpha$ RT code by post-processing\nthe full Illustris simulations. We simply assume that the intrinsic luminosity\nof the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission is proportional to the star formation rate of\ngalaxies in Illustris, yielding a sufficiently large sample of LAEs to measure\nthe anisotropic selection bias. We find little correlations between large-scale\nenvironment and the observed fraction induced by the RT, and hence a smaller\nanisotropic selection bias than what was claimed by Zheng et al. (2011). We\nargue that the anisotropy was overestimated in the previous work due to the\ninsufficient spatial resolution: it is important to keep the resolution such\nthat it resolves the high density region down to the scale of the interstellar\nmedium, $\\sim1$ physical kpc.

Study of spin-isospin or Gamow-Teller (GT) response may provide\nvaluable information on both the quenching of the axial-vector coupling\nconstant as well as on nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. We have\nperformed a seminal calculation of the GT response by using the\nno-core-configuration-interaction approach rooted on multi-reference density\nfunctional theory (DFT-NCCI). The model treats properly isospin and rotational\nsymmetries and can be applied to calculate both the nuclear spectra and\ntransition rates in atomic nuclei, irrespectively of their mass and\nparticle-number parity. The method is applied to compute the GT strength\ndistribution in selected $N\\approx Z$ nuclei including the $p$-shell $^8$Li and\n$^8$Be nuclei and the $sd$-shell well-deformed nucleus $^{24}$Mg. In order to\ndemonstrate a flexibility of the approach we present also a calculation of the\nsuperallowed GT beta decay in doubly-magic spherical $^{100}$Sn and the\nlow-spin spectrum in $^{100}$In. It is demonstrated that the DFT-NCCI model is\ncapable to capture the GT response satisfactorily well by using relatively\nsmall configuration space exhausting simultaneously the GT sum rule. The model,\ndue to its flexibility and broad range of applicability, may either serve as a\ncomplement or even as an alternative to other theoretical approaches including\nthe conventional nuclear shell model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 09:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

To constraint\nthe dynamical behavior of the system with a core field model deriving from\ndirect measurements of the Earth's magnetic field we used an Ensemble Kalman\nfilter algorithm. By simulating an ensemble of possible states, access to the\ncomplete statistical properties of the considered fields is available.\nFurthermore, the method enables to provide predictions and to assess their\nreliability. In this study, we could highlight the cohabitation of two distinct\nflow regimes. One associated with the large scale part of the eccentric gyre,\nwhich evolves slowly in time and posses a very long memory of its past, and a\nfaster one associated with the small scale velocity field. We show that the\nlatter can exhibit rapid variations in localized areas. The combination of the\ntwo regimes can predict quite well the decadal variations in length of day, but\nit can also explain the discrepancies between the physically predicted and the\nobserved trend in these variations. Hindcast tests demonstrate that the model\nis well balanced and that it can provide accurate short term predictions of a\nmean state and its associated uncertainties.

Economical and energy efficient analog/digial hybrid\nprecoding and combining transceivers have been often proposed for mmWave\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to overcome the severe\npropagation loss of mmWave channels. One major shortcoming of existing\nsolutions lies in the assumption of infinite or high-resolution phase shifters\n(PSs) to realize the analog beamformers. However, low-resolution PSs are\ntypically adopted in practice to reduce the hardware cost and power\nconsumption. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we investigate the\npractical design of hybrid precoders and combiners with low-resolution PSs in\nmmWave MIMO systems. In particular, we propose an iterative algorithm which\nsuccessively designs the low-resolution analog precoder and combiner pair for\neach data stream, aiming at conditionally maximizing the spectral efficiency.\nThen, the digital precoder and combiner are computed based on the obtained\neffective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency. In an\neffort to achieve an even more hardware-efficient large antenna array, we also\ninvestigate the design of hybrid beamformers with one-bit resolution (binary)\nPSs, and present a novel binary analog precoder and combiner optimization\nalgorithm with quadratic complexity in the number of antennas. The proposed\nlow-resolution hybrid beamforming design is further extended to multiuser MIMO\ncommunication systems. Simulation results demonstrate the performance\nadvantages of the proposed algorithms compared to existing low-resolution\nhybrid beamforming designs, particularly for the one-bit resolution PS\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 10:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In the case of a locally adapted or even sparse input space, the\nprediction of a test point can be worse dependent of its position. A possible\nsolution to this, is the usage of a non-stationary covariance function, where\nthe hyperparameters are calculated by a deep neural network.

However, we show that two-time quantum\ncorrelations between the retarded source-fields of a stationary dipole and the\nquantum vacuum-field possess advanced wave-like contributions. Despite their\nadvanced nature, these correlations are perfectly consistent with Einstein\ncausality. It is shown that while they do not significantly contribute to\nphoto-detection amplitudes in the vacuum state, they do effect the statistics\nof measurements involving the radiative force experienced by a point charge in\nthe field of the dipole. Specifically, the dispersion in the charge's momentum\nis found to increase with time. This entails the possibility of obtaining\ndirect experimental evidence for the existence of advanced waves in physical\nreality, and provides yet another signature of the quantum nature of the\nvacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 11:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 10:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 13:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

Three transits have\nbeen observed, allowing radius estimates of both objects. Here we investigate\npossible mass regimes of the transiting system that could produce the observed\nsignatures and study them in the context of moon formation in the solar system,\ni.e. via impacts, capture, or in-situ accretion. The radius of Kepler-1625 b\nsuggests it could be anything from a gas giant planet somewhat more massive\nthan Saturn (0.4 M_Jup) to a brown dwarf (BD) (up to 75 M_Jup) or even a\nvery-low-mass star (VLMS) (112 M_Jup ~ 0.11 M_sun). The proposed companion\nwould certainly have a planetary mass. Possible extreme scenarios range from a\nhighly inflated Earth-mass gas satellite to an atmosphere-free water-rock\ncompanion of about 180 M_Ear. Furthermore, the planet-moon dynamics during the\ntransits suggest a total system mass of 17.6_{-12.6}^{+19.2} M_Jup. A\nNeptune-mass exomoon around a giant planet or low-mass BD would not be\ncompatible with the common mass scaling relation of the solar system moons\nabout gas giants. The case of a mini-Neptune around a high-mass BD or a VLMS,\nhowever, would be located in a similar region of the satellite-to-host mass\nratio diagram as Proxima b, the TRAPPIST-1 system, and LHS 1140 b. The capture\nof a Neptune-mass object around a 10 M_Jup planet during a close binary\nencounter is possible in principle. The ejected object, however, would have had\nto be a super-Earth object, raising further questions of how such a system\ncould have formed. In summary, this exomoon candidate is barely compatible with\nestablished moon formation theories. If it can be validated as orbiting a\nsuper-Jovian planet, then it would pose an exquisite riddle for formation\ntheorists to solve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 11:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 21:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Here we propose an exact and\nsystematic approach including an algorithm based on Markov chain theory to\ncompute the average waiting time (and hence the transmission rates) of quantum\nrepeaters with arbitrary numbers of links. For up to four repeater segments, we\nexplicitly give the exact rate formulae for arbitrary entanglement swapping\nprobabilities. Starting with three segments, we explore schemes with arbitrary\n(not only doubling) and dynamical (not only predetermined) connections. The\neffect of finite memory times is also considered and the relative influence of\nthe classical communication (of heralded signals) is shown to grow\nsignificantly for larger probabilities. Conversely, we demonstrate that for\nsmall swapping probabilities the statistical behavior of the waiting time in a\nquantum repeater cannot be characterized by its average value alone and\nadditional statistical quantifiers are needed. For large repeater systems, we\npropose a recursive approach based on exactly but still efficiently computable\nwaiting times of sufficiently small sub-repeaters.

Manual search usually leads to get stuck in a local\nhyperparameter configuration, and heavily depends on human intuition and\nexperience. A simple alternative of manual search is random/grid search on a\nspace of hyperparameters, which still undergoes extensive evaluations of\nvalidation errors in order to find its best configuration. Bayesian\noptimization that is a global optimization method for black-box functions is\nnow popular for hyperparameter optimization, since it greatly reduces the\nnumber of validation error evaluations required, compared to random/grid\nsearch. Bayesian optimization generally finds the best hyperparameter\nconfiguration from random initialization without any prior knowledge. This\nmotivates us to let Bayesian optimization start from the configurations that\nwere successful on similar datasets, which are able to remarkably minimize the\nnumber of evaluations.

A\ncombination of several different sensors such as LiDAR, radar, ultrasound\nsensors and cameras are utilized to sense the surrounding environment of\nautonomous vehicles. These heterogeneous sensors simultaneously capture various\nphysical attributes of the environment. Such multimodality and redundancy of\nsensing need to be positively utilized for reliable and consistent perception\nof the environment through sensor data fusion.

Alternatively, this scenario can be characterized by\nthe existence of pairs of neutrinos with almost degenerate masses, and a lepton\nmixing matrix which has 12 angles and 12 phases. In this work we discuss the\nphenomenology of quasi-Dirac neutrino oscillations and derive limits on the\nrelevant parameter space from various experiments.

Here we lay out a program\nof research into monetary and economic dynamics and preliminary steps toward\nits execution. We use principles of response theory to derive implications for\npolicy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money\nsupply, is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some\ndegree of control, optimizing growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing\nmonetary injection between two dominant loop flows, the consumption and wages\nloop, and investment and returns loop. The balance arises from a composite of\ngovernment tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as\nmonetary policy. We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between\ntwo regimes--an oversupply to the consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply\nof the investment and returns loop. The imbalance is manifest in savings and\nborrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased\nuntil 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely\nunrelated to the financial crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis\nare part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now requires shifting the balance.\nOur analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government support\nfor the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption. This promotes\ninvestment due to growth in demand. Otherwise, investment opportunities are\nlimited, capital remains uninvested, and does not contribute to growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 13:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 15:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

Most available probability and\nstatistical models for dynamic network data are deduced from random graph\ntheory where the networks are characterized on the node and edge level. They\nare often very restrictive for applications and unscalable to high-dimensional\ndynamic network data which is very common nowadays. In this paper, we take a\ndifferent perspective: The evolving sequence of networks are treated as a time\nseries of network matrices. We adopt a matrix factor model where the observed\nsurface dynamic network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic network\nwith lower dimensions. The linear relationship between the surface network and\nthe latent network is characterized by unknown but deterministic loading\nmatrices. The latent network and the corresponding loadings are estimated via\nan eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix constructed from the\nauto-cross-covariances of the network times series, thus capturing the dynamics\npresenting in the network. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent\ndynamic structure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction.

An\nalternative is to attempt to monitor signalling in real time and dynamically\nmake adjustments to the dark liquidity accessed.\n  In practice, price slippage against the order is commonly taken as an\nindication of signalling. However, estimating slippage is difficult and\nrequires a large number of fills to reliably detect it. Ultimately, even if\ndetected, it fails to capture an important element of causality between dark\nfills and lit prints - a signature of information leakage. In the extreme, this\ncan lead to scaling back trading at a time when slippage is caused by a\ncompeting trader consuming liquidity, and the appropriate action would be to\nscale trading up -- not down -- in order to capture good prices.\n  In this paper we describe a methodology aimed to address this dichotomy of\ntrading objectives, allowing to maximally capture available liquidity while at\nthe same time protecting the trader from excessive signalling. The method is\ndesigned to profile dark liquidity in a dynamic fashion, on a per fill basis,\nin contrast to historical venue analyses based on estimated slippage.

Leaving the interferometer blades\nconnected to the same base preserves Bragg plane alignment, but if the\ninterferometer contains crystallographic misalignments of greater than about 10\nnrad between the blades, interference fringe visibility begins to suffer.\nAdditionally, the parallelism, thickness, and distance between the blades must\nbe machined to micron tolerances. Traditionally, interferometers do not exhibit\nusable interference fringe visibility until 30 $\\mu$m to 60 $\\mu$m of machining\nsurface damage is chemically etched away. However, if too much material is\nremoved, the uneven etch rates across the interferometer cause the shape of the\ncrystal blades to be outside of the required tolerances. As a result, the\nultimate interference fringe visibility varies widely among neutron\ninterferometers that are created under similar conditions.

To quantify this uncertainty, these PDEs must\nbe solved over a large ensemble of parameters. Even for a single realization\nthis can a computationally intensive process. In the case of flows governed by\nthe Navier-Stokes equations, an efficient method has been devised for computing\nan ensemble of solutions. To further reduce the computational cost of this\nmethod, an ensemble proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method was recently\nproposed.\n  The main contribution of this work is the introduction of POD spatial\nfiltering for ensemble-POD methods. The POD spatial filter makes possible the\nconstruction of the Leray ensemble-POD model, which is a regularized reduced\norder model for the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. The\nLeray ensemble-POD model employs the POD spatial filter to smooth (regularize)\nthe convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations and greatly diminishes the\nnumerical inaccuracies produced by the ensemble-POD method in the numerical\nsimulation of convection-dominated flows. Specifically, for the numerical\nsimulation of a convection-dominated two-dimensional flow between two offset\ncylinders, we show that the Leray ensemble-POD method yields accurate results,\nwhereas the ensemble-POD is highly inaccurate.\n  The second contribution of this work is a new numerical discretization of the\nvariable viscosity ensemble algorithm in which the average viscosity is\nreplaced with the maximum viscosity.

One of the most appropriate mathematical tools to\nstudy this behaviour is an agent-based velocity-jump process. In the absence of\nagent-agent interaction, the mean-field continuum limit of the agent-based\nmodel (ABM) gives rise to the well known hyperbolic telegraph equation. When\nagent-agent interaction is included in the ABM, a strictly advective system of\npartial differential equations (PDEs) can be derived at the population-level.\nHowever, no diffusive limit of the ABM has been obtained from such a model.\nConnecting the microscopic behaviour of the ABM to a diffusive macroscopic\ndescription is desirable, since it allows the exploration of a wider range of\nscenarios and establishes a direct connection with commonly used statistical\ntools of movement analysis. In order to connect the ABM at the population-level\nto a diffusive PDE at the population-level, we consider a generalisation of the\nagent-based velocity-jump process on a two-dimensional lattice with three forms\nof agent interaction. This generalisation allows us to take a diffusive limit\nand obtain a faithful population-level description.

However, so far, the availability of conductive diamond\nmembranes remained an unreachable goal. In this work we present a complete\nnanofabrication methodology for engineering high aspect ratio, electrically\nactive single crystal diamond membranes. The membranes have large lateral\ndirections, exceeding 500x500 um2 and are only several hundreds of nanometers\nthick. We further realize vertical single crystal p-n junctions, made from the\ndiamond membranes that exhibit onset voltages of ~ 10V and a current of several\nmA. Moreover, we deterministically introduce optically active color centers\ninto the membranes, and demonstrate for the first time a single crystal\nnanoscale diamond LED. The robust and scalable approach to engineer the\nelectrically active single crystal diamond membranes, offers new pathways for\nadvanced nanophotonics, nanoelectronics and optomechanics devices employing\ndiamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 13:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

This requires the inclusion of the\nscatterings of the charge carriers with the impurities and the phonons of the\nsubstrate, besides the interaction mechanisms already present in the graphene\nlayer. As physical model, the semiclassical Boltzmann equation is assumed and\nthe results are based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). A crucial point\nis the correct inclusion of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Two different\nsubstrates are investigated: SiO$_2$ and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). In the\nadopted model for the charge-impurities scattering, a crucial parameter is the\ndistance $d$ between the graphene layer and the impurities of the substrate.\nUsually $d$ is considered constant. Here we assume that $d$ is a random\nvariable in order to take into account the roughness of the substrate and the\nrandomness of the location of the impurities. We confirm, where only the\nlow-field mobility has been investigated, that h-BN is one of the most\npromising substrate also for the high-field mobility on account of the reduced\ndegradation of the velocity due to the remote impurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 08:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}
