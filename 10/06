Observations show this is not the\ncase. In this work, a magnetic pumping model is developed as a possible\nexplanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution\nfunctions observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area\nfocus on the role that the dissipation of turbulent energy on microscopic\nkinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However, with\nmagnetic pumping particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent\nfluctuations, thus bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models,\nwe include the pressure anisotropy term, providing a channel for the large\nscale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete set of\ncoupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of\nthe distribution function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form\nsolution. Numerical simulations using the VPIC kinetic code are applied to\nverify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the model for\nrealistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of\nparticles are important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic\nperturbations and the pressure anisotropy. In turn, averaged over a pump cycle,\nthe phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly to heat in the\nplasma. The results of this scenario show that magnetic pumping may account for\na significant portion of the solar wind energization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 16:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 20:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

To obtain an unbiased and low variance estimate of the count we\npartition the available memory to tiers (layers) of reservoir samples. While\nthe base layer is a standard reservoir sample of edges, other layers are\nreservoir samples of sub-structures of the desired motif.

The pose of the SQs with respect to the direction of gravity is\ncalculated and used together with the parameters of the SQs and specification\nof the gripper, to select the best direction of approach and contact points.\nThe SQ fitting method has been tested on custom datasets containing objects in\nisolation as well as in clutter. The grasping algorithm is evaluated on a PR2\nand real time results are presented. Initial results indicate that though the\nmethod is based on simplistic shape information, it outperforms other learning\nbased grasping algorithms that also work in clutter in terms of time-efficiency\nand accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 17:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

In this work, we assess\nin the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the\nprospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations\nin the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and\nthe annihilation rates in the Sun is not assumed in our analysis; instead, the\ndark matter scattering and annihilation cross sections are taken as free and\nindependent parameters. We consider capture via both spin-dependent and\nspin-independent interactions, and annihilations into three representative\nfinal states: $b\\bar b$, $W^+W^-$, and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. We find that when the\ncapture in the Sun is dominated by spin-independent interactions, current\ndirect detection bounds already preclude the observation of a neutrino signal\nin future experiments. For capture via spin-dependent interactions, a strong\ncomplementarity is observed, over most of the parameter space, between future\nneutrino detectors and planned direct and indirect dark matter detection\nexperiments, such as PICO-500 and CTA. In this case, we also identify some\nregions of the parameter space that can be probed, via the neutrino flux from\nthe Sun, only by future neutrino experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 18:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

In black hole perturbation theory, this phase\nconsists of a simple linear superposition of exponentially damped sinusoids\n(the quasinormal modes) and of a power-law tail. How many quasinormal modes are\nnecessary to describe waveforms with a prescribed precision? What error do we\nincur by only including quasinormal modes, and not tails? What other systematic\neffects are present in current state-of-the-art numerical waveforms? These\nissues, which are basic to testing fundamental physics with distorted black\nholes, have hardly been addressed in the literature. We use numerical\nrelativity waveforms and accurate evolutions within black hole perturbation\ntheory to provide some answers. We show that (i) a determination of the\nfundamental $l=m=2$ quasinormal mode to within $1\\%$ or better requires the\ninclusion of at least the first overtone, and preferably of the first two or\nthree overtones; (ii) a determination of the black hole mass and spin with\nprecision better than $1\\%$ requires the inclusion of at least two quasinormal\nmodes for any given angular harmonic mode $(\\ell,\\,m)$.

These long-range\nprojections are typically characterized in a two-step process: dMRI is used to\nestimate the orientation of axons within each voxel, then these local\norientations are linked together to estimate the spatial extent of putative\nwhite matter bundles. Tractography, the process of tracing bundles across\nvoxels, either requires computationally expensive (probabilistic) simulations\nto model uncertainty in fiber orientation or ignores it completely\n(deterministic). Probabilistic simulation necessarily generates a finite number\nof trajectories, introducing \"simulation error\" to trajectory estimates.

The photoionization code XSTAR is\nemployed together with reddening-insensitive emission line diagnostics to\nconstrain a dynamical model for the broad-line region (BLR) in NGC 3998. The\nBLR is modelled as a large H$^+$ region ${\\sim}$ 7 pc in radius consisting of\ndust-free, low density ${\\sim}$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, low metallicity ${\\sim}$ 0.01\n$Z/Z_\\odot$ gas. Modelling the shape of the broad H${\\alpha}$ emission line\nsignificantly discriminates between two independent measures of the black hole\nmass, favouring the estimate of de Francesco et al.

Interpreting the\nbroad H${\\alpha}$ emission line in terms of a steady-state spherically\nsymmetric inflow leads to a mass inflow rate of 1.4 ${\\times}$ 10$^{-2}$\nM$_\\odot$/yr, well within the present uncertainty of calculations that attempt\nto explain the observed X-ray emission in terms of an advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF). Collectively, the model provides an explanation for the\nshape of the H${\\alpha}$ emission line, the relative intensities and\nluminosities for the H Balmer, [O III], and potentially several of the broad UV\nemission lines, as well as refining the initial conditions needed for future\nmodelling of the ADAF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 18:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Studies of the quality of the detector data yield insights into the\ncause of instrumental artifacts and data quality vetoes specific to a search\nare produced to mitigate the effects of problematic data. In this paper, the\nsystematic removal of noisy data from analysis time is shown to improve the\nsensitivity of searches for compact binary coalescences. The output of the\nPyCBC pipeline, which is a python-based code package used to search for\ngravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences, is used as a\nmetric for improvement. GW150914 was a loud enough signal that removing noisy\ndata did not improve its significance. However, the removal of data with excess\nnoise decreased the false alarm rate of GW151226 by more than two orders of\nmagnitude, from 1 in 770 years to less than 1 in 186000 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 19:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 22:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 13:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

However, controllers that can achieve such traffic shaping over the\nmultiple dimensions of target time-gap and velocity over a region of space are\nunknown. The objective of this work is to design such a controller, and to show\nthat we can design candidate time-gap and velocity profiles such that it can\nstabilize the string of vehicles in attaining the target profiles. Our analysis\nis based on studying the system in the spacial rather than the time domain,\nwhich enables us to study stability as in terms of minimizing errors from the\ntarget profile and across vehicles as a function of location.

The high-resolution images enable us to perform\nrigorous two-dimensional image modeling to decouple the luminous central point\nsource from the host galaxy, which, when warranted, is further decomposed into\nits principal structural components (bulge, bar, and disk). In many cases, care\nmust be taken to account for structural complexities such as spiral arms, tidal\nfeatures, and overlapping or interacting companion galaxies. We employ Fourier\nmodes to characterize the degree of asymmetry of the light distribution of the\nstars, as a quantitative measure of morphological distortion due to\ninteractions or mergers. We examine the dependence of the physical parameters\nof the host galaxies on the properties of the AGNs, namely radio-loudness and\nthe width of the broad emission lines. In accordance with previous studies,\nnarrow-line (H$\\beta$ FWHM $\\leq 2000$ km~s$^{-1}$) type 1 AGNs, in contrast to\ntheir broad-line (H$\\beta$ FWHM $> 2000$ km~s$^{-1}$) counterparts, are\npreferentially hosted in later type, lower luminosity galaxies, which have a\nhigher incidence of pseudo-bulges, are more frequently barred, and are less\nmorphologically disturbed. This suggests narrow-line type 1 AGNs experienced a\nmore quiescent evolutionary history driven primarily by internal secular\nevolution instead of external dynamical perturbations. The fraction of AGN\nhosts showing merger signatures is larger for more luminous sources.

For two-layer neural networks, we provide affirmative\nanswers to these questions by introducing Porcupine Neural Networks (PNNs)\nwhose weight vectors are constrained to lie over a finite set of lines.

The question we address in this work is whether the vacuum and the\nstring moduli decouple at low energies, allowing a description of the\nlow-energy dynamics in terms of a two-dimensional theory on the string\nworldsheet. We find a simple condition controlling the bulk-string coupling: If\nthere exist two flavors such that the product of their U(1) charge difference\nwith the magnetic flux carried by the string configuration is not an integer\nmultiple of 2\\pi, the string has zero-modes that decay slower than 1/r, where r\nis the radial distance from the string core.

The success of RL algorithms in these\ndomains depends crucially on generalization from limited training experience.\nFunction approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalize in order to\nestimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods have\nachieved generalization about the agent's uncertainty regarding unvisited\nstates.

The bosons coming from the resonance\ndecay can be W, Z, or the SM Higgs. For very heavy resonances, bosons are\nproduced with momentum considerably higher than their mass, modifying in a very\nappreciable way the event topology. The quarks originated from the hadronic\ndecay of the SM bosons will be collimated into a smaller area such that they\nare clustered within a single large cone jet. Dedicated reconstruction\ntechniques are used to distinguish the merged decay products of W, Z and H\nbosons produced with high transverse momentum, from jets that originate from\nsingle partons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 21:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Here, we\nshow that enhanced thermal conductivities can be achieved in semiconductor\nnanostructures by rationally engineering phonon spectral coupling between\nmaterials. By embedding a germanium film between silicon layers, we show that\nits thermal conductivity can be increased by more than 100% at room temperature\nin contrast to a free standing thin-film. The injection of phonons from the\ncladding silicon layers creates the observed enhancement in thermal\nconductivity.

There are papers showing an association between the consumption of\nsugar-sweetened beverages and Type 2 diabetes. Many meta-analyses use\nindividual studies that do not adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling\nand thus provide biased estimates of effect. Hence the claims reported in a\nmeta-analysis paper may be unreliable if the primary papers do not ensure\nunbiased estimates of effect. Objective: Determine the statistical reliability\nof 10 papers and indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. Method:\nTen primary papers used in a meta-analysis paper and counted the numbers of\noutcomes, predictors, and covariates. We estimated the size of the potential\nanalysis search space available to the authors of these papers; i.e. the number\nof comparisons and models available. Since we noticed that there were\ndifferences between predictors and covariates cited in the abstract and in the\ntext, we applied this formula to information found in the abstracts, Space A,\nas well as the text, Space T, of each primary paper. Results: The median and\nrange of the number of comparisons possible across the primary papers are 6.5\nand (2-12,288) for abstracts, and 196,608 and (3,072-117,117,952) the texts.\nNote that the median of 6.5 for Space A is misleading as each primary study has\n60-165 foods not mentioned in the abstract. Conclusion: Given that testing is\nat the 0.05 level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal\nstatistical significance is very weak support for a claim. The claims in these\npapers are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable. Thus, the\nclaims of the meta-analysis paper lack evidentiary confirmation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 21:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Churn prediction models allow to understand\nplayer loyalty and to anticipate when they will stop playing a game. Thanks to\nthese predictions, several initiatives can be taken to retain those players who\nare more likely to churn.\n  Survival analysis focuses on predicting the time of occurrence of a certain\nevent, churn in our case.

Fine-tuning is by far the simplest and most widely used approach that\nseeks to exploit and adapt these feature representations to novel tasks with\nlimited data. Despite the effectiveness of fine-tuning, itis often sub-optimal\nand requires very careful optimization to prevent severe over-fitting to small\ndatasets. The problem of sub-optimality and over-fitting, is due in part to the\nlarge number of parameters used in a typical deep convolutional neural network.\nTo address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective regularization\nmethod for fine-tuning pre-trained deep networks for the task of k-shot\nlearning. To prevent overfitting, our key strategy is to cluster the model\nparameters while ensuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster diversity\nof the parameters, effectively regularizing the dimensionality of the parameter\nsearch space. In particular, we identify groups of neurons within each layer of\na deep network that shares similar activation patterns. When the network is to\nbe fine-tuned for a classification task using only k examples, we propagate a\nsingle gradient to all of the neuron parameters that belong to the same group.\nThe grouping of neurons is non-trivial as neuron activations depend on the\ndistribution of the input data. To efficiently search for optimal groupings\nconditioned on the input data, we propose a reinforcement learning search\nstrategy using recurrent networks to learn the optimal group assignments for\neach network layer. Experimental results show that our method can be easily\napplied to several popular convolutional neural networks and improve upon other\nstate-of-the-art fine-tuning based k-shot learning strategies by more than10%\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 05:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Since rapid cloud\ncollapse is suppressed until the magnetic flux is sufficiently removed from the\ninitially magnetically subcritical cloud by ambipolar diffusion, it takes >\n5-10t_ff to form a protostar, where t_ff is the freefall timescale of the\ninitial cloud. The angular momentum of the star forming cloud is efficiently\ntransferred to the interstellar medium before the rapid collapse begins, and\nthe collapsing cloud has a very low angular momentum. Unlike the magnetically\nsupercritical case, no large-scale low-velocity outflow appears in such a\ncollapsing cloud due to the short lifetime of the first core. Following\nprotostar formation, a very weak high-velocity jet, which has a small momentum\nand might disappear at a later time, is driven near the protostar, while the\ncircumstellar disc does not grow during the early mass accretion phase. The\nresults show that the star formation process in magnetically subcritical clouds\nis qualitatively different from that in magnetically supercritical clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 05:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Music produced by pure rule-based systems often sounds mechanical. Music\nproduced by machine learning sounds better, but still lacks hierarchical\ntemporal structure. We restore temporal hierarchy by augmenting machine\nlearning with a temporal production grammar, which generates the music's\noverall structure and chord progressions. A compatible melody is then generated\nby a conditional variational recurrent autoencoder. The autoencoder is trained\nwith eight-measure segments from a corpus of 10,000 MIDI files, each of which\nhas had its melody track and chord progressions identified heuristically. The\nautoencoder maps melody into a multi-dimensional feature space, conditioned by\nthe underlying chord progression. A melody is then generated by feeding a\nrandom sample from that space to the autoencoder's decoder, along with the\nchord progression generated by the grammar. The autoencoder can make musically\nplausible variations on an existing melody, suitable for recurring motifs. It\ncan also reharmonize a melody to a new chord progression, keeping the rhythm\nand contour.

However, the merger environment is polluted by\ndynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate.

Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal\ncan reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be\nexplained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may\nleave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the\norigin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102.

We investigate the corresponding enumeration problem, that is, given\na graph and an RPQ, enumerate all paths in the graph that match the RPQ. We\nconsider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics\nof RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths,\nsimple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be\nenumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple\npaths and trails. For instance, already the question if a given graph contains\na simple path or trail of a certain length has cases with highly non-trivial\nsolutions and cases that are long-standing open problems. In this setting, we\nstudy RPQ evaluation from a parameterized complexity perspective. We define a\nclass of simple transitive expressions that is prominent in practice and for\nwhich we can prove two dichotomy-like results: one for simple paths and one for\ntrails paths. We observe that, even though simple path semantics and trail\nsemantics are intractable for RPQs in general, they are feasible for the vast\nmajority of the kinds of RPQs that users use in practice. At the heart of this\nstudy is a result of independent interest on the parameterized complexity of\nfinding disjoint paths in graphs: the two disjoint paths problem is W[1]-hard\nif parameterized by the length of one of the two paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 09:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Text summarization is to produce a brief summary of\nthe main ideas of the text, while text simplification aims to reduce the\nlinguistic complexity of the text and retain the original meaning. Recently,\nmost approaches for text summarization and text simplification are based on the\nsequence-to-sequence model, which achieves much success in many text generation\ntasks. However, although the generated simplified texts are similar to source\ntexts literally, they have low semantic relevance. In this work, our goal is to\nimprove semantic relevance between source texts and simplified texts for text\nsummarization and text simplification. We introduce a Semantic Relevance Based\nneural model to encourage high semantic similarity between texts and summaries.\nIn our model, the source text is represented by a gated attention encoder,\nwhile the summary representation is produced by a decoder. Besides, the\nsimilarity score between the representations is maximized during training. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nsystems on two benchmark corpus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 09:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

The leading protocol for\nlow-power IPv6 routing, RPL, is no exception, as it is often studied in\nmultipoint-to-point scenarios. As a result, downward routing (from root to\nnode) is still notoriously difficult, holding back the emergence of Internet of\nThings applications that involve actuation. In this paper, we focus on\nachieving industrial-grade reliability levels (1e-5 failure rate) in downward\nrouting with RPL. We make every packet count, and classify the different causes\nof packet loss. We show how to mitigate each source of packet loss, by (1)\nintroducing a gradient metric that favors reliable links, (2) increasing\nneighborhood awareness for accurate link selection, and (3) ensuring a robust\nrouting state maintenance and packet forwarding. We demonstrate RPL downward\nrouting with loss rates in the order of 1e-5 in four different testbeds up to\n352 nodes, in both sparse and dense settings. We also validate our solution on\ntop of a low-power TSCH scheduler, and achieve sub-percent low duty cycles and\na channel utilization of 0.07% at every node, spread over 16 channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 09:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

We show that the synchronization problem for DRAs is in general\nPSPACE-complete, and it is NLOGSPACE-complete for 1-DRAs.

Moreover, they equilibrate their\ntemperatures by electron phonon coupling. The relaxation of the electronic\nnonequilibrium and its effect on the electron phonon coupling was subject to a\nnumber of studies and it is comparably well understood, while the\nnonequilibrium within the phononic subsystem is usually neglected and its\ninfluence of the nonequilibrium phonons on other relaxation processes is\nunclear.

It is thus important to understand how these\nchanges and their localization mechanically affect the total NO flux\npenetrating the airway lumen (JawNO), hence FENO, independently from any\ninflammatory status change. A new model was used which simulates NO production,\nconsumption and diffusion inside the airway epithelium wall, then, NO excretion\nthrough the epithelial wall into the airway lumen and, finally, its axial\ntransport by diffusion and convection in the airway lumen. This model may also\nconsider the presence of a mucus layer coating the epithelial wall. Simulations\nwere performed that showed the great sensitivity of JawNO to peripheral airways\ncaliber changes. Moreover, FENO showed distinct behaviors depending on the\nlocation of the caliber change. Considering a bronchodilation, absence of FENO\nchange was associated with dilation of central airways, FENO increase with\ndilation up to pre-acinar small airways, and FENO decrease with intra-acinar\ndilation due to amplification of the back-diffusion flux. The presence of a\nmucus layer was also shown to play a significant role in FENO changes.\nAltogether, the present work provides theoretical evidences that specific FENO\nchanges in acute situations are linked to specifically located airway caliber\nchanges in the lung periphery.

The reason for enhanced uniform magnetic\nsusceptibility, \\c{hi}, in Zn substituted cuprates is debatable. So far, the\nobserved magnetic behavior has been analyzed mainly in terms of two somewhat\ncontrasting scenarios, (a) that due to independent localized moments appearing\nin the vicinity of Zn arising because of the strong electronic/magnetic\ncorrelations present in the host compound and (b) that due to transfer of\nquasiparticle spectral weight and creation of weakly localized low energy\nelectronic states associated with each Zn atom in place of an in-plane Cu. If\nthe second scenario is correct, one should expect a direct correspondence\nbetween Zn induced suppression of superconducting transition temperature, Tc,\nand the extent of the enhanced magnetic susceptibility at low temperature. In\nthis case, the low-T enhancement of \\c{hi} would be due to weakly localized\nquasiparticle states at low energy and these electronic states will be\nprecluded from taking part in Cooper pairing.

By periodically switching on and off\nthe inter-particle bonds, one expects to smooth-out the kinetic pathways and\nfavor the assembly of targeted structures. Preliminary results have shown that\nthe efficiency of annealing cycles depends strongly on their frequency. Here,\nwe study numerically how this frequency-dependence scales with the strength of\nthe directional interactions (size of the patch $\\sigma$). We use analytical\narguments to show that the scaling results from the statistics of a random walk\nin configurational space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 12:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

At low\ntemperature, our field-effect transistors (FETs) show a monotonic decay of the\ncritical current under increasing electrostatic field up to total quenching for\ngate voltage values as large as $\\pm 40$V in titanium-based devices. This\n$bipolar$ field effect persists up to $\\sim 85\\%$ of the critical temperature\n($\\sim 0.41$K), and in the presence of sizable magnetic fields. A similar\nbehavior was observed in aluminum thin film FETs. A phenomenological theory\naccounts for our observations, and points towards the interpretation in terms\nof an electric-field-induced perturbation propagating inside the\nsuperconducting film. In our understanding, this affects the pairing potential\nand quenches the supercurrent. These results could represent a groundbreaking\nasset for the realization of an $all$-metallic superconducting field-effect\nelectronics and leading-edge quantum information architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 13:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 08:14:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 09:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 09:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 10:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The small mass splittings amongst the higgsinos, typically 4-20\nGeV, results in very little visible energy arising from decays of the heavier\nhiggsinos.

In a series of papers, Christodoulou proved\nthat naked singularities are not stable in the context of the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein equations coupled with a massless scalar field. We study in\nthis paper the next simplest case: a characteristic initial value problem of\nthis coupled system with the initial data given on two intersecting null cones,\nthe incoming one of which is assumed to be spherically symmetric and singular\nat its vertex, and the outgoing one of which has no symmetries. It is shown\nthat, arbitrarily fixing the initial scalar field, the set of the initial\nconformal metrics on the outgoing null cone such that the maximal future\ndevelopment does not have any sequences of closed trapped surfaces approaching\nthe singularity, is of first category in the whole space in which the shear\ntensors are continuous. Such a set can then be viewed as exceptional, although\nthe exceptionality is weaker than the at least $1$ co-dimensionality in\nspherical symmetry. Almost equivalently, it is also proved that, arbitrarily\nfixing an incoming null cone $\\underline{C}_\\varepsilon$ to the future of the\ninitial incoming null cone, the set of the initial conformal metrics such that\nthe maximal future development has at least one closed trapped surface before\n$\\underline{C}_\\varepsilon$, contains an open and dense subset of the whole\nspace.

Thus we perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations of shock induced\ngas-cavity collapse in nitromethane. Ignition is the result of a complex\ninterplay between fluid dynamics and exothermic chemical reaction. To\nunderstand the relative contribution between these two processes we consider in\nthis first part of the work the evolution of the physical system in the absence\nof chemical reactions. We employ a multi-phase mathematical formulation which\naccounts for the large density difference across the gas-liquid interface\nwithout generating spurious temperature peaks. The mathematical and physical\nmodels are validated against experimental, analytic and numerical data.\nPrevious studies identified the impact of the upwind side of the cavity wall to\nthe downwind one as the main reason for the generation of a hot-spot outside of\nthe cavity; this is also observed in this work. However, it is apparent that\nthe topology of the temperature field is more complex than previously thought\nand additional hot spots locations exist, arising from the generation of Mach\nstems rather than jet impact. To explain the generation mechanisms and topology\nof the hot spots we follow the complex wave patterns generated and identify the\ntemperature elevation or reduction generated by each wave. This allows to track\neach hot spot back to its origins. We show that the highest hot spot\ntemperatures can be more than twice the post-incident shock temperature of the\nneat material and can thus lead to ignition.

The presence of magnetic dead layers of 0.44 nm has been\ndetected by VSM. The MS-FMR with perpendicular applied magnetic field has been\nused to determine the gyromagnetic factor. The BLS measurements reveal a\npronounced nonreciprocal spin waves propagation, due to the interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induced by Ir interface with CFA, which\nincreases with decreasing CFA thickness. The DMI sign has been found to be the\nsame (negative) as that of Pt/Co, in contrast to the ab-initio calculation on\nIr/Co. The thickness dependence of the effective DMI constant shows the\nexistence of two regimes similarly to that of the perpendicular anisotropy\nconstant. The DMI constant Ds was estimated to be -0.37 pJ/m for the thickest\nsamples where a linear thickness dependence of the effective DMI constant has\nbeen observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 14:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Increasingly, these data are being used to\ndevelop predictive models of citizen concerns and problem conditions within the\ncity. However, predictive models trained on these data can suffer from biases\nin the propensity to make a request that can vary based on socio-economic and\ndemographic characteristics of an area, cultural differences that can affect\ncitizens' willingness to interact with their government, and differential\naccess to Internet connectivity. Using more than 20,000,000 311 requests -\ntogether with building violation data from the NYC Department of Buildings and\nthe NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development; property data from\nNYC Department of City Planning; and demographic and socioeconomic data from\nthe U.S. Census American Community Survey - we develop a two-step methodology\nto evaluate the propensity to complain: (1) we predict, using a gradient\nboosting regression model, the likelihood of heating and hot water violations\nfor a given building, and (2) we then compare the actual complaint volume for\nbuildings with predicted violations to quantify discrepancies across the City.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 15:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Preliminary time\ntrend analysis conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) uncovered\ndisparities in county jail incarceration rates by geography. Contrary to\nassumptions that incarceration is an urban phenomenon, Vera discovered that\nduring the past few decades, pretrial jail rates have declined in many urban\nareas whereas rates have grown or remained flat in rural counties. In an effort\nto uncover the factors contributing to continued jail growth in rural areas,\nVera joined forces with Two Sigma's Data Clinic, a volunteer-based program that\nleverages employees' data science expertise. Using county jail data from 2000 -\n2013 and county-specific demographic, political, socioeconomic, jail and prison\npopulation variables, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was\nspecified to account for correlations within counties over time. The results\nrevealed that county-level poverty, police expenditures, and spillover effects\nfrom other county and state authorities are all significant predictors of local\njail rates. In addition, geographic investigation of model residuals revealed\nclusters of counties where observed rates were much higher (and much lower)\nthan expected conditioned upon county variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 15:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

The mathematical problem is governed by two coupled fourth-order\nnonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that live on an evolving\ntwo-dimensional manifold. For the phase transitions, the PDE is the\nCahn-Hilliard equation for curved surfaces, which can be derived from surface\nmass balance in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. For the surface\ndeformation, the PDE is the (vector-valued) Kirchhoff-Love thin shell equation.\nBoth PDEs can be efficiently discretized using $C^1$-continuous interpolations\nwithout derivative degrees-of-freedom (dofs). Structured NURBS and unstructured\nspline spaces with pointwise $C^1$-continuity are utilized for these\ninterpolations.

In particular, it is pointed out that one need to clearly distinguish\nbetween the rate of the energy-momentum being carried by the electromagnetic\nradiation to far-off space, and that of the mechanical energy-momentum losses\nbeing incurred by the radiating charge. It is also demonstrated that while the\nPoynting flux is always positive through a spherical surface centred on the\nretarded position of the charge, it could surprisingly be negative through a\nsurface centred on the \"present\" position of the charge. It is further shown\nthat the mysterious Schott term, hitherto thought in literature to arise from\nsome acceleration-dependent energy in fields, is actually nothing but the\ndifference in rate of change of energy in self-fields of the charge between the\nretarded and present times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 13:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 12:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-22"}

In the current work, we use structural and phylogenetic differences\nbetween pairs of virus strains to identify important antigenic sites on the\nsurface of the influenza A(H1N1) virus through the prediction of\nhaemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, pairwise measures of the antigenic\nsimilarity of virus strains. We propose a sparse hierarchical Bayesian model\nthat can deal with the pairwise structure and inherent experimental variability\nin the H1N1 data through the introduction of latent variables. The latent\nvariables represent the underlying HI assay measurement of any given pair of\nvirus strains and help account for the fact that for any HI assay measurement\nbetween the same pair of virus strains, the difference in the viral sequence\nremains the same. Through accurately representing the structure of the H1N1\ndata, the model is able to select virus sites which are antigenic, while its\nlatent structure achieves the computational efficiency required to deal with\nlarge virus sequence data, as typically available for the influenza virus. In\naddition to the latent variable model, we also propose a new method, block\nintegrated Widely Applicable Information Criterion (biWAIC), for selecting\nbetween competing models. We show how this allows us to effectively select the\nrandom effects when used with the proposed model and apply both methods to an\nA(H1N1) dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 10:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

A relaxed version of MLP condition,\nsimply named as weak-MLP, is proposed for reducing dissipation. Moreover, a\nstricter condition, that is the strict-MLP condition, is proposed to enhance\nthe numerical stability. The maximum/minimum principle is fulfilled by both the\nstrict- and weak-MLP condition. A differentiable pressure weight function is\napplied for the combination of two novel conditions, and thus the modified\nlimiter is named as MLP-pw(pressure-weighted). A series of numerical test cases\nshow that MLP-pw limiter has improved stability and convergence, especially in\nhypersonic simulations. Furthermore, the limiter also shows lower dissipation\nin regions without significant pressure transition.

This can potentially damage the surroundings and/or the\nrobot. Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are a popular way to reduce the output\nimpedance of a robotic arm to improve control authority over the force exerted\non the environment. However this increased control over forces with lower\nimpedance comes at the cost of lower positioning precision and bandwidth. This\narticle examines the use of an iteratively-learned feedforward command to\nimprove position tracking when using SEAs. Over each iteration, the output\nresponses of the system to the quantized inputs are used to estimate a\nlinearized local system models. These estimated models are obtained using a\ncomplex-valued Gaussian Process Regression (cGPR) technique and then, used to\ngenerate a new feedforward input command based on the previous iteration's\nerror. This article illustrates this iterative machine learning (IML) technique\nfor a two degree of freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm, and demonstrates successful\nconvergence of the IML approach to reduce the tracking error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 19:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}
