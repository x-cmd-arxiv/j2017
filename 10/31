Even so, BPS models typically require a large number\nof simulation realizations, a computationally expensive endeavor, to generate\nstatistically robust results. Recent advances in statistical methods have led\nus to revisit the traditional approach to BPS. In this work we describe our\npublicly available code dart_board which combines rapid binary evolution codes,\ntypically used in traditional BPS, with modern Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethods. dart_board takes a novel approach that treats the initial binary\nparameters and the supernova kick vector as model parameters. This formulation\nhas several advantages, including the ability to model either populations of\nsystems or individual binaries, the natural inclusion of observational\nuncertainties, and the flexible addition of new constraints which are\nproblematic to include using traditional BPS. After testing our code with mock\nsystems, we demonstrate the flexibility of dart_board by applying it to three\nexamples: (i) a generic population of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), (ii)\nthe population of HMXBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in which the\nspatially resolved star formation history is used as a prior, and (iii) one\nparticular HMXB in the LMC, Swift J0513.4-6547, in which we include\nobservations of the system's component masses and orbital period. Although this\nwork focuses on HMXBs, dart_board can be applied to a variety of stellar\nbinaries including the recent detections by gravitational wave observatories of\nmerging compact object binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 09:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

But, how should a robot quantify risk? A natural\nand common approach is to consider the framework whereby costs are assigned to\nstochastic outcomes - an assignment captured by a cost random variable.\nQuantifying risk then corresponds to evaluating a risk metric, i.e., a mapping\nfrom the cost random variable to a real number. Yet, the question of what\nconstitutes a \"good\" risk metric has received little attention within the\nrobotics community. The goal of this paper is to explore and partially address\nthis question by advocating axioms that risk metrics in robotics applications\nshould satisfy in order to be employed as rational assessments of risk. We\ndiscuss general representation theorems that precisely characterize the class\nof metrics that satisfy these axioms (referred to as distortion risk metrics),\nand provide instantiations that can be used in applications. We further discuss\npitfalls of commonly used risk metrics in robotics, and discuss additional\nproperties that one must consider in sequential decision making tasks.

Using BOAT we analyzed costs for hip\nreplacement surgery for 168,676 patients is in New York State, and showed that\n88% of these patients had surgery costs of less than \\$30,000. This figure\nprovides a basis to understand the decision by The California Public Employees'\nRetirement System to cap hip replacement reimbursements at $30,000, resulting\nin significant savings. Our tool could enable researchers, hospitals, insurers\nand citizens to obtain an unbiased view on health-care expenditures, costs and\nemerging trends. Our tool is especially valuable in the current economic\nenvironment, where a significant amount of reporting is controlled by special\ninterests groups and lobbies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

To allow the\ninsurance company's survival after ruin, the reinsurer injects capital only at\nruin times caused by jumps larger than a chosen retention level. Otherwise\ncapital must be raised from the shareholders for small deficits. The problem\nhere is to determine adequate reinsurance premiums. It seems fair to base the\nnet reinsurance premium on the discounted expected value of any future capital\ninjections. Inspired by the results of Huzak et al.

The thermodynamic potential for quarks in QCD is a desired\ningredient for computations of the equation of state in the early universe,\nsupernovae, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. The 2-loop contributions\nare normally divergent and become even more difficult in the limit of finite\nquark masses and finite chemical potential. We introduce various means to\ninterpolate between the low and high chemical potential limits. Although\nphysically well motivated, we show that the infinite series Pad\\'e rational\npolynomial interpolation scheme introduces spurious poles.

A weaker\nproperty, $T(K, s)$, of the set $X$ is that every subset $Y \\subseteq X$\nconsisting of at most $s$ elements satisfies the property $T(K)$.\n  The following question goes back to Gr\\\"unbaum: given $K$ and $s$, what is\nthe minimal positive number $\\lambda = \\lambda(K, s)$ such that every finite\npoint set in $\\mathbb R^2$ with the property $T(K, s)$ also satisfies the\nproperty $T(\\lambda K)$?

The anti-diffracting distance is no longer restricted\nby finite power in free space but instead depends on the number of energy\noscillations. This unprecedented propagation behavior is attributed to a new\nunderstanding of non-diffractive light beam: when an anti-diffracting light\nbeam completely discharges its energy, it cannot recharge again. A versatile\noptical pen is therefore developed to manipulate the number, amplitude,\nposition and phase of energy oscillations for an arbitrary numerical aperture\nof a focusing lens so that energy recharge can occur in free space and multiple\nenergy oscillations can be realized. A light beam with a tunable number of\nenergy oscillations is eventually generated in free space and propagates along\na wavy trajectory.

The host star shows no signs of activity, and the kinematics\nhint at the star being from the thick disk population. With a deep (2.5%)\ntransit around a $K=11.9$ host, NGTS-1b will be a strong candidate to probe\ngiant planet composition around M-dwarfs via JWST transmission spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 17:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We re-examine why the attempt seems a \"Mission:\nImpossible\" in the 345 model. We point out that the effective operators to\nbreak the fermion number symmetries ('t Hooft operators plus others) in the\nmirror sector do not have sufficiently strong couplings even in the limit of\nlarge Majorana-Yukawa couplings. We observe also that the type of Majorana mass\nterm considered there is singular in the large limit due to the nature of the\nchiral projection of the Ginsparg-Wilson fermions, but a slight modification\nwithout such singularity is allowed by virtue of the very nature. We then\nconsider a simpler four-flavor axial gauge model, the 1$^4$(-1)$^4$ model, in\nwhich the U(1)$_A$ gauge and Spin(6)(SU(4)) global symmetries prohibit the\nbilinear terms, but allow the quartic terms to break all the other continuous\nmirror-fermion symmetries.

The toric code has two types of\nelementary excitations (defects) costing different energies. We show that an\n$O(1)$ density of the lower energy defect is required to degrade the\nzero-temperature entanglement between two subsystems in contact with one\nanother. However, one type of excitation alone is not sufficient to kill all\nquantum correlations, and an $O(1)$ density of the higher energy defect is\nrequired to cause the so-called sudden death of the negativity. Interestingly,\nif the energy cost of one of the excitations is taken to infinity, quantum\ncorrelations survive up to arbitrarily high temperatures, a feature that is\nlikely shared with other quantum spin liquids and frustrated systems in\ngeneral, when projected down to their low-energy states.

The mass range for ECSN from close binary systems is\nthought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects of\nmass transfer on the helium core. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we\nexplored the parameter space of initial primary masses between 8 $M_\\odot$ and\n17 $M_\\odot$, using a large grid of models. We find that the initial primary\nmass and the mass transfer evolution are important factors in the final fate of\nstars in this mass range.

The photon Green function of each nanostructure within\nits environment is first obtained from a semi-analytical modal theory, which is\nused in a quantum optics formalism of the molecule-nanostructure interaction to\nmodel the SERS spectrum. An intuitive methodology is presented for calculating\nthe single molecule enhancement factor (SMEF), which is also able to predict\nknown experimental SERS enhancement factors of an example gold nano-dimer.

We\nconsider the continuum model and use the transfer matrix method to solve the\nDirac-like equation for graphene where the electrostatic potential, energy gap\nand Fermi velocity are piecewise constant functions of the position x. We found\nthat in the presence of an energy gap, it is possible to tune the energy of the\nFano factor peak and consequently the location of the Dirac point, by a\nmodulations in the Fermi velocity. Hence, the peak of the Fano factor can be\nused experimentally to identify the Dirac point. We show that for higher values\nof the Fermi velocity the Fano factor goes below 1/3 in the Dirac point.\nFurthermore, we show that in periodic superlattices the location of Fano factor\npeaks is symmetric when the Fermi velocity $v_A$ and $v_B$ is exchanged,\nhowever by introducing quasi-periodicity the symmetry is lost. The Fano factor\nusually holds a universal value for a specific transport regime, which reveals\nthat the possibility of controlling it in graphene is a notable result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 18:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The Tenti-S6 model, based on macroscopic gas\ntransport coefficients, reproduces the scattering profiles in the entire\npressure range at less than 2\\% deviation at a similar level as does the\nalternative kinetic Grad's 6-moment model, which is based on the internal\ncollisional relaxation as a decisive parameter. A hydrodynamic model fails to\nreproduce experimental spectra for the low pressures of 0.5-1 bar, but yields\nvery good agreement ($< 1$\\%) in the pressure range $2-4$ bar.

One of the main limitations to image quality\nafter wavefront correction comes from atmospheric refraction. An Atmospheric\ndispersion compensator (ADC) is employed to correct for atmospheric refraction.\nThe correction is applied based on a look-up table consisting of dispersion\nvalues as a function of telescope elevation angle. The look-up table based\ncorrection of atmospheric dispersion results in imperfect compensation leading\nto the presence of residual dispersion in the point-spread function (PSF) and\nis insufficient when sub-milliarcsecond precision is required.

The risk of colorectal cancer\ncan be mitigated by the identification and removal of premalignant lesions\nthrough optical colonoscopy. Unfortunately, conventional colonoscopy misses\nmore than 20% of the polyps that should be removed, due in part to poor\ncontrast of lesion topography. Imaging tissue topography during a colonoscopy\nis difficult because of the size constraints of the endoscope and the deforming\nmucosa. Most existing methods make geometric assumptions or incorporate a\npriori information, which limits accuracy and sensitivity. In this paper, we\npresent a method that avoids these restrictions, using a joint deep\nconvolutional neural network-conditional random field (CNN-CRF) framework.\nEstimated depth is used to reconstruct the topography of the surface of the\ncolon from a single image. We train the unary and pairwise potential functions\nof a CRF in a CNN on synthetic data, generated by developing an endoscope\ncamera model and rendering over 100,000 images of an anatomically-realistic\ncolon. We validate our approach with real endoscopy images from a porcine\ncolon, transferred to a synthetic-like domain, with ground truth from\nregistered computed tomography measurements. The CNN-CRF approach estimates\ndepths with a relative error of 0.152 for synthetic endoscopy images and 0.242\nfor real endoscopy images. We show that the estimated depth maps can be used\nfor reconstructing the topography of the mucosa from conventional colonoscopy\nimages. This approach can easily be integrated into existing endoscopy systems\nand provides a foundation for improving computer-aided detection algorithms for\ndetection, segmentation and classification of lesions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 19:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 13:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 20:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The Wald statistic is a\nprime candidate for the task, on the grounds of the asymptotic validity of the\nstandard normal approximation to its finite-sample distribution, simplicity and\nlow computational cost. It is well known, though, that this normal\napproximation can be inadequate, especially when the sample size is small or\nmoderate relative to the number of parameters. A novel, algebraic adjustment to\nthe Wald statistic is proposed, delivering significant improvements in\ninferential performance with only small implementation and computational\noverhead, predominantly due to additional matrix multiplications. The Wald\nstatistic is viewed as an estimate of a transformation of the model parameters\nand is appropriately adjusted, using either maximum likelihood or reduced-bias\nestimators, bringing its expectation asymptotically closer to zero. The\nlocation adjustment depends on the expected information, an approximation to\nthe bias of the estimator, and the derivatives of the transformation, which are\nall either readily available or easily obtainable in standard software for a\nwealth of models. An algorithm for the implementation of the location-adjusted\nWald statistics in general models is provided, as well as a bootstrap scheme\nfor the further scale correction of the location-adjusted statistic. Ample\nanalytical and numerical evidence is presented for the adoption of the\nlocation-adjusted statistic in prominent modelling settings, including\ninference about log-odds and binomial proportions, logistic regression in the\npresence of nuisance parameters, beta regression, and gamma regression.

We compared these\ndiagnostics to photo-ionisation models and shock models. The structure is\ndivided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended\nsub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and\ndisplays filamentary patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure\nlinks another massive galaxy hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass\ngalaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN host disk over ~35 kpc. This\nextent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse\nregions in the R23 vs. O32 diagram is compatible with photo-ionisation.\nHowever, the location of three of these regions in this diagram (low O32, high\nR23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported by their large\nvelocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be\na source of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non\nprimordial.

We demonstrate that a simple enough functional neuronal model is\ncapable of explaining: i) the extreme selectivity of single neurons to the\ninformation content, ii) simultaneous separation of several uncorrelated\nstimuli or informational items from a large set, and iii) dynamic learning of\nnew items by associating them with already \"known\" ones. These results\nconstitute a basis for organization of complex memories in ensembles of single\nneurons. Moreover, they show that no a priori assumptions on the structural\norganization of neuronal ensembles are necessary for explaining basic concepts\nof static and dynamic memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 20:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 11:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In this paper, we study the mean field method for community detection\nunder the Stochastic Block Model. For an iterative Batch Coordinate Ascent\nVariational Inference algorithm, we show that it has a linear convergence rate\nand converges to the minimax rate within $\\log n$ iterations. This complements\nthe results of Bickel et al. (2013) which studied the global minimum of the\nmean field variational Bayes and obtained asymptotic normal estimation of\nglobal model parameters. In addition, we obtain similar optimality results for\nGibbs sampling and an iterative procedure to calculate maximum likelihood\nestimation, which can be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 23:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 03:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

It turns out that\nthis minimal width is exactly equal to $d_{in}+1.$ That is, if all the hidden\nlayer widths are bounded by $d_{in}$, then even in the infinite depth limit,\nReLU nets can only express a very limited class of functions, and, on the other\nhand, any continuous function on the $d_{in}$-dimensional unit cube can be\napproximated to arbitrary precision by ReLU nets in which all hidden layers\nhave width exactly $d_{in}+1.$ Our construction in fact shows that any\ncontinuous function $f:[0,1]^{d_{in}}\\to\\mathbb R^{d_{out}}$ can be\napproximated by a net of width $d_{in}+d_{out}$.

A similar result holds for Quick-Look-In (QLI)\ncodes as well. In this case, however, the precise innovation is not defined. We\nsee that this innovation-like quantity is related to the linear smoothed\nestimate of the information. The essence of innovations approach to a linear\nfiltering problem is first to whiten the observed data, and then to treat the\nresulting simpler white-noise observations problem. In our case, this\ncorresponds to the reduction of decoding complexity in the main decoder in an\nSST Viterbi decoder. We show the distributions related to the main decoder\n(i.e., the input distribution and the state distribution in the code trellis\nfor the main decoder) are much biased under moderately noisy conditions.

This indicates a universal mechanism of\nenergy release on solar and stellar flares, i.e., magnetic reconnection. We\nhere carried out a statistical research on 50 solar WLFs observed with\n\\textit{SDO}/HMI and examined the correlation between the energies and\ndurations. As a result, the $E$--$\\tau$ relation on solar WLFs ($\\tau \\propto\nE^{0.38}$) is quite similar to that on stellar superflares ($\\tau \\propto\nE^{0.39}$). However, the durations of stellar superflares are one order of\nmagnitude shorter than those expected from solar WLFs. We present the following\ntwo interpretations for the discrepancy. (1) In solar flares, the cooling\ntimescale of WLFs may be longer than the reconnection one, and the decay time\nof solar WLFs can be elongated by the cooling effect. (2) The distribution can\nbe understood by applying a scaling law ($\\tau \\propto E^{1/3}B^{-5/3}$)\nderived from the magnetic reconnection theory. In this case, the observed\nsuperflares are expected to have 2-4 times stronger magnetic field strength\nthan solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 04:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

But in real life applications,\nwe are more interested in the relative importance of the node that can be\nmeasured using its centrality rank based on the given centrality measure. To\ncompute the centrality rank of a node, we need to compute the centrality value\nof all the nodes and compare them to get the rank. This process requires the\nentire network. So, it is not feasible for real-life applications due to the\nlarge size and dynamic nature of real world networks. In the present project,\nwe aim to propose fast and efficient methods to estimate the global centrality\nrank of a node without computing the centrality value of all nodes. These\nmethods can be further extended to estimate the rank without having the entire\nnetwork. The proposed methods use the structural behavior of centrality\nmeasures, sampling techniques, or the machine learning models. In this work, we\nalso discuss how to apply these methods for degree and closeness centrality\nrank estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 06:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Here we extend\ncoarse-graining to open Markov processes. An \"open\" Markov process is one where\nprobability can flow in or out of certain states called \"inputs\" and \"outputs\".\nOne can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two\nbasic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov\nprocess with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov\nprocesses side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author\nshowed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms\nof a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a\nsymmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms are ways of\ncoarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known\n\"black-boxing\" functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double\ncategory. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation\nbetween input and output data that holds in steady states, including\nnonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability\nthrough the process.

The task requires matching a response candidate with\na conversation context, whose challenges include how to recognize important\nparts of the context, and how to model the relationships among utterances in\nthe context. Existing matching methods may lose important information in\ncontexts as we can interpret them with a unified framework in which contexts\nare transformed to fixed-length vectors without any interaction with responses\nbefore matching. The analysis motivates us to propose a new matching framework\nthat can sufficiently carry the important information in contexts to matching\nand model the relationships among utterances at the same time. The new\nframework, which we call a sequential matching framework (SMF), lets each\nutterance in a context interacts with a response candidate at the first step\nand transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors are then\naccumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) which models the relationships among the\nutterances. The context-response matching is finally calculated with the hidden\nstates of the RNN. Under SMF, we propose a sequential convolutional network and\nsequential attention network and conduct experiments on two public data sets to\ntest their performance. Experimental results show that both models can\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art matching methods.

While there are two explicit\nconstructions (Sch\\\"affer \\cite{sfr} and Douglas \\cite{Doug-Dilation}) of the\nminimal isometric dilation of a single contraction, there was no such explicit\nconstruction of an And\\^o dilation for a commuting pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of\ncontractions, except in some special cases \\cite{A-M-Dist-Var, D-S, D-S-S}. In\nthis paper, we give two new proofs of And\\^o's dilation theorem by giving both\nSch\\\"affer-type and Douglas-type explicit constructions of an And\\^o dilation\nwith function-theoretic interpretation, for the general case.

For InAs/GaSb structures with band inversion (12~nm and 14 nm\nsamples), we observe distinct low-energy structures, which we regard as direct\nevidence for the proximity-induced superconductivity within the\ncurrent-carrying edge state. For 14~nm InAs well samples, we additionally\nobserve mesoscopic-like resistance fluctuations, which are subjected to\nthreshold suppression in low magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 08:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 06:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 13:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

In this paper, we study the cache resource\nallocation problem in a Multi-Cache Multi-CP environment. We propose a cache\npartitioning approach, where each cache can be partitioned into slices with\neach slice dedicated to a content provider.

Our\nhigh-contrast imaging observations show a bright (delta L=7.0+/-0.3 mag)\npoint-like emission, south of MWC 758 at a deprojected separation of about 20\nau (r=0.111+/- 0. 004 arcsec) from the central star.

We say that a\nset $D \\subseteq V$ of vertices is a {\\em dominating set} of $G$ if for each $v\n\\in V \\setminus D$, there exists a vertex $u \\in D$ such that $\\{ u, v \\} \\in\nE$. The vertices are revealed to an online algorithm one by one over time. When\na vertex is revealed, edges between the vertex and vertices revealed in the\npast are also revealed.

To address these challenges, we propose\nTreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete\nactions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a\ntransition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating\npredicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values.

All the proteomic analyses including\npeptide/protein identification and quantification, differential expression\nanalysis, biomarker discovery and so on are all based on the matching of mass\nspectra with peptide sequences, which is significantly influenced by the\nquality of the spectra, such as the peak numbers, noisy peaks, signal-to-noise\nratios, etc. Hence, it is crucial to assess the quality of the spectra in order\nfor filtering and/or post-processing after identification. The handcrafted\nfeatures representing spectra quality, however, need human expertise to design\nand are difficult to optimize, and thus the existing assessing algorithms are\nstill lacking in accuracy. Thus, there is a critical need for the robust and\nadaptive algorithm for mass spectra quality assessment. Results: We have\ndeveloped a novel mass spectrum assessment software DeepQuality, based on the\nstate-of-the-art compressed sensing and deep learning algorithms. We evaluated\nthe algorithm on two publicly available tandem MS data sets, resulting in the\nAUC of 0.96 and 0.92, respectively, a significant improvement compared with the\nAUC of 0.85 and 0.91 of the existing method SpectrumQuality v2.0.

The discriminatory power of M-SSA is often enhanced by\nusing only the time series of the variable that provides the best observability\nof the node dynamics. In practice, however, diverse factors could prevent one\nto have access to this variable in some nodes and other variables should be\nused, resulting in a mixed set of variables. In the present work, the impact of\nthis mixed measurement approach on the M-SSA is numerically investigated in\nnetworks of R\\\"ossler systems and cord oscillators. The results are threefold.\nFirst, a node measured by a poor variable, in terms of observability, becomes\nvirtually invisible to the technique. Second, a side effect of using a poor\nvariable is that the characterization of phase synchronization clustering of\nthe {\\it other}\\, nodes is hindered by a small amount. This suggests that,\ngiven a network, synchronization analysis with M-SSA could be more reliable by\nnot measuring those nodes that are accessible only through poor variables.\nThird, global phase synchronization could be detected even using only poor\nvariables, given enough of them are measured. These insights could be useful in\ndefining measurement strategies for both experimental design and real world\napplications for use with M-SSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 12:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

When the silicon nanospheres are placed\nonto the WS2 monolayer with a point contact, resonance coupling manifested by\nthe quenching dips in the scattering spectra can also be observed at ambient\nconditions, which involves only a few excitons. Finally, resonance coupling in\nthe all-semiconductor heterostructure can be active controlled by temperature\nscanning. Our findings suggest that this all-semiconductor heterostructure can\nbe exploited for future on-chip nanophotonics associated with strong\nlight-matter interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 13:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

The acceleration of protons is modeled by numerically\nsolving the Parker transport equation with spatial diffusion both along and\nacross the magnetic field.

When the shock\npropagates through a streamer-like magnetic field, particles are more\nefficiently accelerated compared to the case with a simple radial magnetic\nfield, mainly due to perpendicular shock geometry and the natural trapping\neffect of closed magnetic fields.

RNA sequences fold into secondary structures where some bases\nmatch one another while others remain unpaired. Pseudoknot-free secondary\nstructures can be represented as well-parenthesized expressions with additional\ndots, where pairs of matching parentheses symbolize paired bases and dots,\nunpaired bases. The two fundamental problems in RNA algorithmic are to predict\nhow sequences fold within some model of energy and to design sequences of bases\nwhich will fold into targeted secondary structures. Predicting how a given RNA\nsequence folds into a pseudoknot-free secondary structure is known to be\nsolvable in cubic time since the eighties and in truly subcubic time by a\nrecent result of Bringmann et al. (FOCS 2016). As a stark contrast, it is\nunknown whether or not designing a given RNA secondary structure is a tractable\ntask; this has been raised as a challenging open question by Anne Condon (ICALP\n2003). Because of its crucial importance in a number of fields such as\npharmaceutical research and biochemistry, there are dozens of heuristics and\nsoftware libraries dedicated to RNA secondary structure design. It is therefore\nrather surprising that the computational complexity of this central problem in\nbioinformatics has been unsettled for decades.\n  In this paper we show that, in the simplest model of energy which is the\nWatson-Crick model the design of secondary structures is NP-complete if one\nadds natural constraints of the form: index $i$ of the sequence has to be\nlabeled by base $b$. This negative result suggests that the same lower bound\nholds for more realistic models of energy. It is noteworthy that the additional\nconstraints are by no means artificial: they are provided by all the RNA design\npieces of software and they do correspond to the actual practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 14:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 13:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Simulation results demonstrate that the energy efficiency of\nconventional Poison point process (PPP) cellular networks is underestimated\nwhen the minimum distance between adjacent BSs is ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 15:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Of the 2550 continuum sources detected in\nthis field, 302 (12 per cent) show rapid fluctuations caused by IPS.

Perhaps\nsurprisingly, peaked-spectrum radio sources are the dominant population among\nthe strongly-scintillating, low-frequency sources in our sample. While\ngamma-ray AGN are generally compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher\nfrequencies, the 162 MHz properties of many of the Fermi blazars in our field\nare consistent with a compact component embedded within more extended\nlow-frequency emission.

However, the growth reduction varied among species in accordance\nwith their tolerance level. It is important to note that all species survived\nat the highest salinity (400 mM). Whereas A. horrida and A. raddiana were\nproved to be often the best tolerant, they recorded the lowest reduction\npercentage at this stage. Conclusion: The genetic variability found in the\nstudied species at seedling stage may be used to select genotypes particularly\nsuitable for rehabilitation and exploitation of lands affected by salinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 22:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

In recent years, motion recognition based\non RGB-D data has attracted much attention. Along with the development in\nartificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have gained remarkable\nsuccess in computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nhave achieved great success for image-based tasks, and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNN) are renowned for sequence-based problems. Specifically, deep\nlearning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for\nmotion recognition using RGB-D data. In this paper, a detailed overview of\nrecent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented. The reviewed\nmethods are broadly categorized into four groups, depending on the modality\nadopted for recognition: RGB-based, depth-based, skeleton-based and\nRGB+D-based. As a survey focused on the application of deep learning to\nRGB-D-based motion recognition, we explicitly discuss the advantages and\nlimitations of existing techniques. Particularly, we highlighted the methods of\nencoding spatial-temporal-structural information inherent in video sequence,\nand discuss potential directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 09:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 23:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

This\npaper suggests an agent based model of the decision making processs using\nspectral graph theory, where the voting agents are the vertices of the graph,\nand edge weights are determined based on the extent of collaborative research\nbetween the agents, as well as their estimated levels of social interactions.\nThe model assumes that agents with lower research productivities tend to\ninteract more often with one another. Using the graph theoretic spectrum, the\npaper proposes a 2-dimensional influence diagram that maps the voting agents\ninto points on a 2-dimensional grid, where agents that are likely to influence\neach other more are closely spaced. Next, a dynamic model is addressed, where\nvotes are determined based on very small randomly assigned initial values, and\nthe mutual interaction during the decision making process. The model is able to\naccurately reproduce a known promotion decision making from a department of a\nresearch oriented university which involved a sizeable number of voting agents\nwith low research outputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

Our motivation is to study the\neffect of Majorana-Kramers pair on Kondo fixed point and conversely the effect\nof Kondo interaction on Majorana-Kramers pair. This way we can capture the\nsignatures of Majorana fermions on Kondo effect in quantum dots which can be\nprobed feasibly in experiments. Employing the renormalization group method, we\nreport the first study of the signatures of Majorana-Kramers pair in the\ndynamical spin susceptibility of the quantum dot electrons. We not only\ncalculate the flow equations for coupling constants but also study the\nrenormalization of observables and especially calculate dynamical spin\nsusceptibility. We propose that since these dynamical quantities have\nsignatures of Majorana-Kramers pair, so they provide an unambiguous\nexperimental probe for detection of Majorana fermions in TRITOPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 17:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 07:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

By sweeping\nthe external voltage, a reversible manipulation of V_O and a corresponding\nfixed magnetic phase transition sequence in cobaltite/manganite\n(SrCoO3-x/La0.45Sr0.55MnO3-y) heterostructures are reported. The magnetic phase\ntransition sequence confirms that the priority of electric-field-induced V_O\nformation/annihilation in the complex bilayer system is mainly determined by\nthe V_O formation energies and Gibbs free energy differences, which is\nsupported by theoretical analysis.

The\nsimulation results show that it is possible to achieve a linear sensor with a\ndynamic range of 0.1 - 10 Oe, power consumption of 1uW - 1 mW, and sensitivity\nof 0.1-0.5 Ohm/Oe. These characteristics can be controlled by varying the\nsensor dimension and current density in the Pt layer. The latter is in the\nrange of 1 x 10^5 - 10^7 A/cm^2. Experimental results of fabricated sensors\nwith selected sizes agree well with the simulation results. For a Wheatstone\nbridge sensor comprising of four sensing elements, a sensitivity up to 0.548\nOhm/Oe, linearity error below 6%, and detectivity of about 2.8 nT/Sqrt(Hz) were\nobtained.
