Such tests rely sensitively on the phase\nevolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the\nenergy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four\ndifferent methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy\npseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or\ntensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the\naction under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field\nequations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy\ncomplex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem\nin field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General\nRelativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory to find the\ngravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which\nenergy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy\ntensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory are\npresented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate\nof energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally\ndifferent. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor\nthat is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante\nprocedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz\ninvariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory. The\nmethods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of\npredictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 16:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We\nshow how for close enough separations (20-30 AU for average X-ray luminosities)\nthe tidal torque of the companion changes the qualitative behaviour of disc\ndispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in\nclose binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing\naround both components, consistent with $\\textit{unresolved}$ observations.\nWhen looking at the $\\textit{differential}$ disc evolution around the two\ncomponents, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first due to the\nshorter viscous timescale associated with the smaller outer radius. In wide\nbinaries instead the difference in photo-evaporation rate makes the secondaries\nlonger lived, though this is somewhat dependent on the assumed scaling of\nviscosity with stellar mass. We find that our models are broadly compatible\nwith the growing sample of $\\textit{resolved}$ observations of discs in\nbinaries. We also predict that binaries have higher accretion rates than single\nstars for the same disc mass. Thus binaries probably contribute to the observed\nscatter in the relationship between disc mass and accretion rate in young\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

A sharp asymmetry in the distribution of spectral\nweight appears when a hole is created in an isotropic Heisenberg spin chain.\nThis effect slowly vanishes for anisotropic spin interactions and disappears\ncompletely in the case of pure Ising interactions. The asymmetry strongly\ndepends on the total magnetization of the spin chain, which can be tuned in\nexperiments with quantum gas microscopes.

Specifically, our idea\nis to exploit the incrementally aggregated Hessian matrix to trace the full\ngradient vector at every incremental step, therefore achieving an improved\nlinear convergence rate over the state-of-the-art IAG methods. For strongly\nconvex problems, the fast linear convergence rate requires the objective\nfunction to be close to quadratic, or the initial point to be close to optimal\nsolution. Importantly, we show that running one iteration of the CIAG method\nyields the same improvement to the optimality gap as running one iteration of\nthe full gradient method, while the complexity is $O(d^2)$ for CIAG and $O(md)$\nfor the full gradient. Overall, the CIAG method strikes a balance between the\nhigh computation complexity incremental Newton-type methods and the slow IAG\nmethod. Our numerical results support the theoretical findings and show that\nthe CIAG method often converges with much fewer iterations than IAG, and\nrequires much shorter running time than IN when the problem dimension is high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 18:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

Existing distributed methods are usually iterative and\nrequire synchronization of all workers at each iteration, which is hard to\nscale and could result in the under-utilization of computation resources due to\nthe heterogeneity of the subproblems. To address those limitations of\nsynchronous schemes, this paper proposes an asynchronous distributed\noptimization method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM) for non-convex optimization. The proposed method only requires local\ncommunications and allows each worker to perform local updates with information\nfrom a subset of but not all neighbors. We provide sufficient conditions on the\nproblem formulation, the choice of algorithm parameter and network delay, and\nshow that under those mild conditions, the proposed asynchronous ADMM method\nasymptotically converges to the KKT point of the non-convex problem.

However, training RNN components often requires a very\npowerful computer, or a very long time, typically several days or weeks. Recent\nother studies, on the other hand, have shown that CNN-based sequence synthesis\ncan be much faster than RNN-based techniques, because of high\nparallelizability. The objective of this paper is to show that an alternative\nneural TTS based only on CNN alleviate these economic costs of training. In our\nexperiment, the proposed Deep Convolutional TTS was sufficiently trained\novernight (15 hours), using an ordinary gaming PC equipped with two GPUs, while\nthe quality of the synthesized speech was almost acceptable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 19:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 05:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

One classic approach is to decompose the\nproblem into smaller sub-problems and solve them in a distributed fashion.\nHowever, there is little discussion in the literature on which variables should\nbe grouped together to form the sub-problems, especially when the optimization\nformulation involves complex constraints. We focus on one of the most popular\ndistributed approaches, dual decomposition and distributed sub-gradient\nmethods. Based on a theoretical guarantee on its convergence rate, we explain\nthat a partition of variables can critically affect the speed of convergence\nand highlight the importance of the number of dualized constraints. Then, we\nintroduce a novel approach to find a partition that reduces the number of\ndualized constraints by utilizing a community detection algorithm from physics\nliterature. Roughly speaking, the proposed method groups decision variables\nthat appear together in con- straints and solves the resulting sub-problems\nwith blocks of variables in parallel. Empirical experiments on a real\napplication show that the proposed method significantly accelerates the\nconvergence of the distributed sub-gradient method. The advantage of our\napproach becomes more significant as the size of the problem increases and each\nconstraint involves more variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 21:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

It identifies a\nlow-dimensional subspace for approximation of the parametric solution manifold\nthat is embedded in high-dimensional space. A reduced order model is\nsubsequently constructed in this subspace. RBM relies on residual-based error\nindicators or {\\em a posteriori} error bounds to guide construction of the\nreduced solution subspace, to serve as a stopping criteria, and to certify the\nresulting surrogate solutions. Unfortunately, it is well-known that the\nstandard algorithm for residual norm computation suffers from premature\nstagnation at the level of the square root of machine precision.\n  In this paper, we develop two alternatives to the standard offline phase of\nreduced basis algorithms. First, we design a robust strategy for computation of\nresidual error indicators that allows RBM algorithms to enrich the solution\nsubspace with accuracy beyond root machine precision. Secondly, we propose a\nnew error indicator based on the Lebesgue function in interpolation theory.\nThis error indicator does not require computation of residual norms, and\ninstead only requires the ability to compute the RBM solution. This\nresidual-free indicator is rigorous in that it bounds the error committed by\nthe RBM approximation, but up to an uncomputable multiplicative constant.\nBecause of this, the residual-free indicator is effective in choosing snapshots\nduring the offline RBM phase, but cannot currently be used to certify error\nthat the approximation commits.

To evaluate network performance, we consider a practical network\nscenario with a fixed antennas density and multiuser\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) operations for single-antenna users.\nThe number of antennas in each BS is calculated by dividing the antenna density\nby the BS density. With the consideration of several practical network models,\ni.e., pilot contamination, a limited user equipment (UE) density and\nprobabilistic line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path loss model, we\nevaluate the area spectral efficiency (ASE) performance. From our simulation\nresults, we conclude that there exists an optimal BS density for a certain UE\ndensity to maximize the ASE performance when the antenna density is fixed. The\nintuition is that (i) by densifying the network with more BSs, we can achieve a\nreceive power gain due to the smaller distance between the typical UE and its\nserving BS; (ii) by installing more antennas in each BS, we can achieve a\nbeamforming gain for UEs using MU-MIMO, although such beamforming gain is\ndegraded by pilot contamination; (iii) thus, a trade-off exists between the\nreceive power gain and the beamforming gain, if we fix the antenna density in\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

The main problem\nwith the THz band is its huge propagation loss, which is caused by the\ntremendous signal attenuation due to molecule absorption of the\nelectro-magnetic wave. To overcome the path loss issue, massive MIMO has been\nsuggested to be employed in the network and is expected to provide Tbps for a\ndistance within a few meters. In this context, beamforming is studied recently\nas the main technique to take advantage of MIMO in THz and overcome the very\nhigh path loss with the assumption that the THz communication channel is\nLine-of-Sight (LoS) and there are not significant multipath rays. On the other\nhand, recent studies also showed that the well-known absorbed energy by\nmolecules can be re-radiated immediately in the same frequency. Such\nre-radiated signal is correlated with the main signal and can provide rich\nscattering paths for the communication channel. This means that a significant\nMIMO multiplexing gain can be achieved even in a LoS scenario for the THz band.\nOur simulation results reveal a surprising observation that the MIMO\nmultiplexing could be a better choice than the MIMO beamforming under certain\nconditions in THz communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 02:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}

The proposed technique\nrelies on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the stochastic gradient\ndescent method. Of particular interest is to predict the unsteady fluid forces\nfor different bluff body shapes at low Reynolds number. The discrete\nconvolution process with a nonlinear rectification is employed to approximate\nthe mapping between the bluff-body shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural\nnetwork is fed by the Euclidean distance function as the input and the target\ndata generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations for primitive bluff\nbody shapes. The convolutional networks are iteratively trained using the\nstochastic gradient descent method with the momentum term to predict the fluid\nforce coefficients of different geometries and the results are compared with\nthe full-order computations. We attempt to provide a physical analogy of the\nstochastic gradient method with the momentum term with the simplified form of\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation. We also construct a direct\nrelationship between the CNN-based deep learning and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism\nfor the model reduction of a fluid dynamical system.

One of the major reasons of the high\nexpense of CFD is the need for a fine grid to resolve phenomena at the relevant\nscale, and obtain a grid-independent solution. The fine grid requirements often\ndrive the computational time step size down, which makes long transient\nproblems prohibitively expensive. In the research presented, the feasibility of\na Coarse Grid CFD (CG-CFD) approach is investigated by utilizing Machine\nLearning (ML) algorithms. Relying on coarse grids increases the discretization\nerror. Hence, a method is suggested to produce a surrogate model that predicts\nthe CG-CFD local errors to correct the variables of interest. Given\nhigh-fidelity data, a surrogate model is trained to predict the CG-CFD local\nerrors as a function of the coarse grid local features. ML regression\nalgorithms are utilized to construct a surrogate model that relates the local\nerror and the coarse grid features. This method is applied to a\nthree-dimensional flow in a lid driven cubic cavity domain. The performance of\nthe method was assessed by training the surrogate model on the flow full field\nspatial data and tested on new data (from flows of different Reynolds number\nand/or computed by different grid sizes). The proposed method maximizes the\nbenefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive\ncapability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 08:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

We find that the inferred columns implied by $A_{\\rm V}$\ntowards the broad line region (BLR) are often orders of magnitude less than the\ncolumns measured towards the X-ray emitting region indicating a small scale\norigin for the X-ray absorbing gas. After removing 30\\% of Sy 1.9s that\npotentially have been misclassified due to outflows, we find that 86\\%\n(164/190) of the Type 1 population (Sy 1--1.9) are X-ray unabsorbed as expected\nbased on a single obscuring structure.

Here we discuss the\npossibility of achieving a transient excitonic condensate in optically-pumped\nthree-dimensional (3D) DMs, such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals, described by\nnon-equilibrium chemical potentials for photoexcited electrons and holes.\nSimilar to the equilibrium case with long-range interactions, we find that for\npumped 3D DMs with screened Coulomb potential two possible excitonic phases\nexist, an excitonic insulator phase and the charge density wave phase\noriginating from intranodal and internodal interactions, respectively. In the\npumped case, the critical coupling for excitonic instability vanishes;\ntherefore, the two phases coexist for arbitrarily weak coupling strengths. The\nexcitonic gap in the charge density wave phase is always the largest one. The\ncompetition between screening effects and the increase of the density of states\nwith optical pumping results in a reach phase diagram for the transient\nexcitonic condensate. Based on the static theory of screening, we find that\nunder certain conditions for the value of the dimensionless coupling constant\nscreening in 3D DMs can be weaker than in 2D DMs. Furthermore, we identify the\nsignatures of the transient excitonic condensate that could be probed by\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy, photoemission and optical conductivity\nmeasurements. Finally, we provide estimates of critical temperatures and\nexcitonic gaps for existing and hypothetical 3D DMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 09:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

However, in spite of several claims, conclusive evidence is still\nlacking. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We\ninvestigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The\nfirst two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$, where\n$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\\mu$ the\nmagnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose\ncoronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by\nplanets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in\nweakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly\nopen field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is of\nthe order of $(0.002-0.1) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$ and depends on the ratio of the\nplanetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing an indirect measurement of the\nformer when the latter is known. We compute the released energy for different\nseparations of the planet and different stellar parameters finding the\nconditions for the operation of the proposed mechanisms. An application to\neight selected systems is presented. The computed energies and dissipation\ntimescales are in agreement with flare observations in the eccentric system HD\n17156 and in the circular systems HD 189733 and HD 179949.

The accuracy of the consensus model is in the\npicosecond range for the group delay but this is not sufficient for current\ngeodetic pur- poses. This paper provides a fully documented derivation of a new\nrelativistic model having an accuracy substantially higher than one picosecond\nand based upon a well accepted formalism of relativistic celestial mechanics,\nastrometry and geodesy. Our new model fully confirms the consensus model at the\npicosecond level and in several respects goes to a great extent beyond it.

Essentially, we control in terms of suitable norms\ndifferences between the micro- and macro-concentrations and between the\ncorresponding micro- and macro-concentration gradients. The major challenges\nthat we face are the coupled flux structure of the system, the nonlinear drift\nterms and the presence of the microstructures. Employing various energy-like\nestimates, we discuss several scalings choices and boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

The origin of these changes was proposed to be linked to\nlarge-scale structures in the wind, but further characterization of the\nvariability at high energies was needed. Since then, a number of new X-ray\nobservations have become available. Furthermore, a cyclic behaviour with a\n1.78d period was identified in long optical photometric runs, which is thought\nto be associated with the launching mechanism of large-scale wind structures.\nWe analysed these new X-ray data, revisited the old data, and compared X-ray\nwith optical data, including when simultaneous. We found that the behaviour in\nX-rays cannot be explained in terms of a perfect clock because the amplitude\nand shape of its variations change with time. For example, zeta Puppis was much\nmore strongly variable between 2007 and 2011 than before and after this\ninterval. Comparing the X-ray spectra of the star at maximum and minimum\nbrightness yields no compelling difference beyond the overall flux change: the\ntemperatures, absorptions, and line shapes seem to remain constant, well within\nerrors. The only common feature between X-ray datasets is that the variation\namplitudes appear maximum in the medium (0.6-1.2keV) energy band. Finally, no\nclear and coherent correlation can be found between simultaneous X-ray and\noptical data. Only a subgroup of observations may be combined coherently with\nthe optical period of 1.78d, although the simultaneous optical behaviour is\nunknown. The currently available data do not reveal any obvious, permanent, and\ndirect correlation between X-ray and optical variations. The origin of the\nX-ray variability therefore still needs to be ascertained, highlighting the\nneed for long-term monitoring in multiwavelengths, i.e. X-ray, UV, and optical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 07:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Depending on the magnitude of the tilting\nparameter, the undoped system can have either Fermi points (type-I) or Fermi\nlines (type-II). Previous studies usually performed the renormalization-group\ntransformations by integrating out the modes with large momenta. This is\nproblematic when the Fermi surface is open, like type-II Dirac fermions. In\nthis work, we study the effects of Coulomb interactions, following the spirit\nof Shankar\\cite{Shankar}, by introducing a cutoff in the energy scale around\nthe Fermi surface and integrating out the high-energy modes. For type-I Dirac\nfermions, our result is consistent with that of the previous work. On the other\nhand, we find that for type-II Dirac fermions, the magnitude of the tilting\nparameter increases monotonically with lowering energies. This implies the\nstability of type-II Dirac fermions in the presence of Coulomb interactions, in\ncontrast with previous results. Furthermore, for type-II Dirac fermions, the\nvelocities in different directions acquire different renormalization even if\nthey have the same bare values. By taking into account the renormalization of\nthe tilting parameter and the velocities due to the Coulomb interactions, we\nshow that while the presence of a charged impurity leads only to charge\nredistribution around the impurity for type-I Dirac fermions, for type-II Dirac\nfermions, the impurity charge is completely screened, albeit with a very long\nscreening length. The latter indicates that the temperature dependence of\nphysical observables are essentially determined by the RG equations we derived.\nWe illustrate this by calculating the temperature dependence of the\ncompressibility and specific heat of the interacting tilted Dirac fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 13:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

The theory assumes turbulence is excited by a forcing supported on\nsmall scales, and uses a linear shear model to relate the turbulent momentum\nflux to the mean shear rate. Extending the theory, it will be shown here that\nthe relation between the momentum flux and mean shear is valid, and the\nmomentum flux is non-zero, for both an isotropic and an anisotropic forcing,\nindependent of the dissipation mechanism at small scales. This conclusion\nrequires taking into account that the linear shear model is an approximation to\nthe real system. The proportionality between the momentum flux and the inverse\nof the shear can then be inferred most simply on dimensional grounds. Moreover,\nfor a homogeneous pumping, the proportionality constant can be determined by\nsymmetry considerations, recovering the result of the original theory.

In fact, it is known\nthat any online routing protocol has a poor performance in the worst case, in a\nsense that there is a distribution of nodes resulting in bad routing paths for\nthat protocol, even if the nodes know their geographic positions and the\ngeographic position of the destination of a message is known. The reason for\nthat is that radio holes in the ad hoc network may require messages to take\nlong detours in order to get to a destination, which are hard to find in an\nonline fashion.\n  In this paper, we assume that the wireless ad hoc network can make limited\nuse of long-range links provided by a global communication infrastructure like\na cellular infrastructure or a satellite in order to compute an abstraction of\nthe wireless ad hoc network that allows the messages to be sent along\nnear-shortest paths in the ad hoc network.

In this work, we study how the optimal\nprivacy-utility tradeoff region is affected by constraints on the data that is\ndirectly available as input to the release mechanism. In particular, we\nconsider the availability of only sensitive data, only useful data, and both\n(full data).

It turns out that ordinary\n(clas- sical) probe beams, namely with Poissonian photon number distribution,\nare fundamentally inadequate to measure small losses with the highest\nsensitivity. Conversely, we demonstrate that a quantum-correlated pair of\nbeams, known as twin-beam state, allows reaching the ultimate sensitivity for\nall energy regimes (even less than one photon per mode) with the simplest\nmeasurement strategy. One beam of the pair addresses the sample, while the\nsecond one is used as a reference to compensate both for classical drifts and\nfor uctuation at the most fundamental quantum level.

NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations\nof RRL stars are particularly useful for distance determinations to galaxies\nand globular clusters up to 300 kpc, that lack young standard candles, like\nCepheids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 07:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Although, the inter-working of IEEE 802.11 WLANs with\n3GPP LTE has indicated enhanced network performance in the context of capacity\nand load balancing, the WLAN discovery scheme implemented in most of the\ncommercially available smartphones is very inefficient and results in high\nbattery drainage. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient WLAN\ndiscovery scheme for 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.11 WLAN inter-working scenario. User\nEquipment (UE), in the proposed scheme, uses 3GPP network assistance along with\nthe results of past channel scans, to optimally select the next channels to\nscan. Further, we have also developed an algorithm to accurately estimate the\nUE's mobility state, using 3GPP network signal strength patterns. We have\nimplemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature.\nSince, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented\nmodules in Android to enable selective scanning. Further, we have also used\nsimulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling.\nThe results from the field experiments and simulations have shown high power\nsavings using the proposed scanning scheme without any discovery performance\ndeterioration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 07:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

One of the major issues is the low\nprogression rates from first to second year in third level Computer Science\ncourses with introductory programming courses proving to be a high contributing\nfactor. This is something that needs to be addressed. One such way to address\nthe issue is to get children involved and engaged with computing at young ages.\n  This paper describes a study undertaken that is the first step in a body of\nwork that aims to garner the interest of potential Computer Science students at\nan early age. The study involves a comparison of two short courses; one based\nin Java and one based in Snap. The goal is to determine whether either of these\nlanguages is a better first programming language for students than the other,\nor if both are viable. These languages were chosen to allow for a comparison\nbetween a Visual Programming Language and a Textual Programming Language.\n  Feedback in the form of a survey will be used to gather the opinions of the\nstudents. This will provide data on issues such as which language was easier to\nlearn and which language was preferred amongst others.

Many properties have been discovered and multiple designs\nhave been devised that lead to multiple conceptual and practical applications.\nSuperconducting MMs have the advantage of ultra low losses, a highly desirable\nfeature. The additional use of the Josephson effect and SQUID configurations\nproduce further specificity and functionality. SQUID-based MMs are both\ntheoretically investigated but also fabricated and analyzed experimentally in\nmany labs and exciting new phenomena have been found both in the classical and\nquantum realms. The SQUID is a unique nonlinear oscillator that can be\nmanipulated through multiple external means. This flexibility is inherited to\nSQUID-based MMs, i.e. extended units that contain a large arrangement of\nSQUIDs. Such an assembly of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators presents a\nnonlinear dynamics laboratory where numerous complex spatio-temporal phenomena\nmay be explored. We focus primarily on SQUID-based MMs and present basic\nproperties related to their individual and collective responses to external\ndrives. We start by showing how a SQUID-based system acts as a genuine MM,\ndemonstrate that the Josephson nonlinearity leads to wide-band tunability,\nintrinsic nonlinear as well as flat band localization. We explore further\nproperties such as multistability and self-organization and the emergence of\nchimera states. We then dwell into the truly quantum regime and explore the\ninteraction of electromagnetic pulses with superconducting qubits where the\ncoupling between the two yields self-induced transparency and superradiance.
