However,\nthe question of interpretation of the type of wave arriving has not been\naddressed. The problem lies in the fact that the algorithm detects more than\ntwo arrivals even on seismograms with little noise, the peaks corresponding to\nP and S wave arrivals on the indicator function are not always the strongest,\nand the peak corresponding to the P wave arrival is not always the first peak\ndetected.

Intense PL emission from IZn related shallow donor bound excitons\n(DBX) is visible in the 10 K spectra for all samples. Although overall PL is\nlargely reduced with irradiation disorder, DBX intensity is increased for the\nhighest fluence irradiated sample. Raman study indicates damage in both zinc\nand oxygen sub-lattice by energetic ion beam. Representative Raman modes from\ndefect complexes involving VO, IZn and IO are visible after irradiation with\nintermediate fluence.

Yet, both functionals are routinely computed at\ngreat speed in practice. We aim to resolve this apparent paradox by studying\nclasses of functions which can be feasibly integrated and maximised, together\nwith representations for these classes of functions which encode the\ninformation which is necessary to uniformly compute integral and maximum in\npolynomial time. The theoretical framework for this is the second-order\ncomplexity theory for operators in analysis which was introduced by Kawamura\nand Cook (2012). The representations we study are based on rigorous\napproximation by polynomials, piecewise polynomials, and rational functions. We\ncompare these representations with respect to polytime reducibility as well as\nwith respect to their ability to quickly evaluate symbolic expressions in a\ngiven language. We show that the representation based on rigorous approximation\nby piecewise polynomials is polytime equivalent to the representation based on\nrigorous approximation by rational functions. With this representation, all\nterms in a certain language, which is expressive enough to contain the maximum\nand integral of most functions of practical interest, can be evaluated in\npolynomial time. By contrast, both the representation based on polynomial\napproximation and the standard representation based on function evaluation,\nwhich implicitly underlies the Ko-Friedman result, require exponential time to\nevaluate certain terms in this language. We confirm our theoretical results by\nan implementation in Haskell, which provides some evidence that second-order\npolynomial time computability is similarly closely tied with practical\nfeasibility as its first-order counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 16:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Modeling\nof this nature generally involves analysis of past claim history and different\ncharacteristics of the insured objects and the policyholders. Generalized\nlinear models (GLMs) have become the industry's standard approach for pricing\nand modeling risks of this nature. However, the GLM approach utilizes a single\n\"best\" model on which loss predictions are based, which ignores the uncertainty\namong the competing models and variable selection. An additional characteristic\nof motor insurance data sets is the presence of many categorical variables,\nwithin which the number of levels is high. In particular, not all levels of\nsuch variables may be statistically significant and rather some subsets of the\nlevels may be merged to give a smaller overall number of levels for improved\nmodel parsimony and interpretability. A method is proposed for assessing the\noptimal manner in which to collapse a factor with many levels into one with a\nsmaller number of levels, then Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to blend\nmodel predictions from all reasonable models to account for factor collapsing\nuncertainty. This method will be computationally intensive due to the number of\nfactors being collapsed as well as the possibly large number of levels within\nfactors.

We show that a CMB\nsurvey covering 4,000 square degrees of sky, with an instrumental sensitivity\nof 0.5 uK-arcmin at 18 arcsecond resolution, could distinguish between cold\ndark matter and an alternative, such as 1 keV warm dark matter or 10^(-22) eV\nfuzzy dark matter with about 4-sigma significance. A survey of the same\nresolution with 0.1 uK-arcmin noise could distinguish between cold dark matter\nand these alternatives at better than 20-sigma significance; such\nhigh-significance measurements may also allow one to distinguish between a\nsuppression of power due to either baryonic effects or the particle nature of\ndark matter, since each impacts the shape of the lensing power spectrum\ndifferently. CMB temperature maps yield higher signal-to-noise than\npolarization maps in this small-scale regime; thus, systematic effects, such as\nfrom extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds, need to be carefully considered.\nHowever, these systematic concerns can likely be mitigated with known\ntechniques.

Features include: 1) data pre-processing\nand visualization; 2) user-specified probability distributions for an unlimited\nnumber of data streams and latent behavior states; 3) biased and correlated\nrandom walk movement models, including \"activity centers\" associated with\nattractive or repulsive forces; 4) user-specified design matrices and\nconstraints for covariate modelling of parameters using formulas familiar to\nmost R users; 5) multiple imputation methods that account for measurement error\nand temporally-irregular or missing data; 6) seamless integration of\nspatio-temporal covariate raster data; 7) cosinor and spline models for\ncyclical and other complicated patterns; 8) model checking and selection; and\n9) simulation. momentuHMM considerably extends the capabilities of existing HMM\nsoftware while accounting for common challenges associated with telemetery\ndata. It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis-driven animal movement\nanalyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non-statisticians.\nWhile motivated by telemetry data, the package can be used for analyzing any\ntype of data that is amenable to HMMs. Practitioners interested in additional\nfeatures are encouraged to contact the authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 19:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 23:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Multichannel is often\nused in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes\nand the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention.\nThe health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink\nnode (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health\nemergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for\nmultichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to\nmeet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links.\nAs a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the\nscheduled lossy links.

The\ncustomers are served on a first-come, first served basis (FCFS) regardless of\ntheir class. Such systems are common in customer call centers, which often\nsegment their arrivals into classes of callers whose requests differ in their\ncomplexity and criticality. We first consider an $M$/$G$/1 + $M$ queue and then\nanalyze the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ case. Analyzing these systems using a queue\nlength process proves intractable as it would require us to keep track of the\nclass of each customer at each position in queue. Consequently, we introduce a\nvirtual waiting time process where the service times of customers who will\neventually abandon the system are not considered. We analyze this process to\nobtain performance measures such as the percentage of customers receiving\nservice in each class, the expected waiting times of customers in each class,\nand the average number of customers waiting in queue. We use our\ncharacterization to perform a numerical analysis of the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$\nsystem, and find several managerial implications of administering a FCFS system\nwith multiple classes of impatient customers.

While\nsome studies have examined the impact of gene flow on estimation accuracy for\ncertain methods, limited analytical work has been undertaken to directly assess\nthe potential effect of gene flow across a species phylogeny. In this paper, we\nconsider a three-taxon isolation-with-migration model that allows gene flow\nbetween sister taxa for a brief period following speciation, as well as\nvariation in the effective population sizes across the tree. We derive the\nprobabilities of each of the three gene tree topologies under this model, and\nshow that for certain choices of the gene flow and effective population size\nparameters, anomalous gene trees (i.e., gene trees that are discordant with the\nspecies tree but that have higher probability than the gene tree concordant\nwith the species tree) exist. We characterize the region of parameter space\nproducing anomalous trees, and show that the probability of the gene tree that\nis concordant with the species tree can be arbitrarily small. We then show that\nthe SVDQuartets method is theoretically valid under the model of gene flow\nbetween sister taxa. We study its performance on simulated data and compare it\nto two other commonly-used methods for species tree inference, ASTRAL and\nMP-EST. The simulations show that ASTRAL and MP-EST can be statistically\ninconsistent when gene flow is present, while SVDQuartets performs well, though\nlarge sample sizes may be required for certain parameter choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

In this paper, we present the first\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for solar panel soiling and\ndefect analysis. Our approach takes an RGB image of solar panel and\nenvironmental factors as inputs to predict power loss, soiling localization,\nand soiling type. In computer vision, localization is a complex task which\ntypically requires manually labeled training data such as bounding boxes or\nsegmentation masks. Our proposed approach consists of specialized four stages\nwhich completely avoids localization ground truth and only needs panel images\nwith power loss labels for training. The region of impact area obtained from\nthe predicted localization masks are classified into soiling types using the\nwebly supervised learning. For improving localization capabilities of CNNs, we\nintroduce a novel bi-directional input-aware fusion (BiDIAF) block that\nreinforces the input at different levels of CNN to learn input-specific feature\nmaps. Our empirical study shows that BiDIAF improves the power loss prediction\naccuracy by about 3% and localization accuracy by about 4%.

This study evaluates the efficacy of 2D deep convolutional\nneural networks (DCNNs) for detecting basal ganglia (BG) hemorrhage on\nnoncontrast head CT.\n  Materials and Methods: 170 unique de-identified HIPAA-compliant noncontrast\nhead CTs were obtained, those with and without BG hemorrhage. 110 cases were\nheld-out for test, and 60 were split into training (45) and validation (15),\nconsisting of 20 right, 20 left, and 20 no BG hemorrhage. Data augmentation was\nperformed to increase size and variation of the training dataset by 48-fold.\nTwo DCNNs were used to classify the images-AlexNet and GoogLeNet-using\nuntrained networks and those pre-trained on ImageNet. Area under the curves\n(AUC) for the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated,\nusing the DeLong method for statistical comparison of ROCs.\n  Results: The best performing model was the pre-trained augmented GoogLeNet,\nwhich had an AUC of 1.00 in classification of hemorrhage. Preprocessing\naugmentation increased accuracy for all networks (p<0.001), and pretrained\nnetworks outperformed untrained ones (p<0.001) for the unaugmented models. The\nbest performing GoogLeNet model (AUC 1.00) outperformed the best performing\nAlexNet model (AUC 0.95)(p=0.01).\n  Conclusion: For this dataset, the best performing DCNN identified BG\nhemorrhage on noncontrast head CT with an AUC of 1.00. Pretrained networks and\ndata augmentation increased classifier accuracy. Future prospective research\nwould be important to determine if the accuracy can be maintained on a larger\ncohort of patients and for very small hemorrhages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 21:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 16:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

We identify\na region on the parameter space where a hydrostatic atmosphere cannot be\nbalanced by any plausible interplanetary pressure, so that the atmosphere is\nparticularly susceptible to loss by Parker wind. This region may lead an\nabsence of rich atmosphere (substantially H/He) for planets with low mass (M ~\n3 M_earth).

This means that implementing streaming algorithms in such\nlanguages requires new types of data structures, with operations that are not\nimmediately compatible with existing array operations or compiler\noptimisations.\n  In this paper, we propose a design for a functional language that natively\nsupports infinite arrays. We use ordinal numbers to introduce the notion of\ninfinity in shapes and indices. By doing so, we obtain a calculus that\nnaturally extends existing array calculi and, at the same time, allows for\nrecursive specifications as they are found in stream- and list-based settings.\nFurthermore, the main language construct that can be thought of as an $n$-fold\ncons operator gives rise to expressing transfinite recursion in data, something\nthat lists or streams usually do not support. This makes it possible to treat\nthe proposed calculus as a unifying theory of arrays, lists and streams. We\ngive an operational semantics of the proposed language, discuss design choices\nthat we have made, and demonstrate its expressibility with several examples.

The new disturbing\nfunction, like the polar one, may model any resonance as expansion order is\nunrelated to resonance order. The powers of eccentricity and inclination of the\nforce amplitude of a $p$:$q$ resonance depend only on the parity of the\nresonance order $|p-q|$. Disturbing functions with non zero reference\ninclinations are thus physically different from the classical disturbing\nfunction as the former are based on the three-dimensional three-body problem\nand the latter on the two-dimensional one.

In a previous paper\n(Nonlinearity 2016), the authors addressed the characterization of stability of\nperiodic waves for a rather large class of Hamiltonian partial differential\nequations that includes quasilinear generalizations of the Korteweg--de Vries\nequation and dispersive perturbations of the Euler equations for compressible\nfluids, either in Lagrangian or in Eulerian coordinates. They derived a\nsufficient condition for orbital stability with respect to co-periodic\nperturbations, and a necessary condition for spectral stability, both in terms\nof the negative signature - or Morse index - of the Hessian matrix of the\naction integral. Here the asymptotic behavior of this matrix is investigated in\ntwo asymptotic regimes, namely for small amplitude waves and for waves\napproaching a solitary wave as their wavelength goes to infinity. The special\nstructure of the matrices involved in the expansions makes possible to actually\ncompute the negative signature of the action Hessian both in the harmonic limit\nand in the soliton limit. As a consequence, it is found that nondegenerate\nsmall amplitude waves are orbitally stable with respect to co-periodic\nperturbations in this framework. For waves of long wavelength, the negative\nsignature of the action Hessian is found to be exactly governed by the second\nderivative with respect to the wave speed of the Boussinesq momentum associated\nwith the limiting solitary wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Efforts to derive size estimates are often frustrated by a\nrange of factors that preclude conventional survey strategies, including social\nstigma associated with group membership or members' involvement in illegal\nactivities.\n  This paper extends prior research on the problem of network population size\nestimation, building on established survey/sampling methodologies commonly used\nwith hard-to-reach groups. Three novel one-step, network-based population size\nestimators are presented, to be used in the context of uniform random sampling,\nrespondent-driven sampling, and when networks exhibit significant clustering\neffects. Provably sufficient conditions for the consistency of these estimators\n(in large configuration networks) are given. Simulation experiments across a\nwide range of synthetic network topologies validate the performance of the\nestimators, which are seen to perform well on a real-world location-based\nsocial networking data set with significant clustering. Finally, the proposed\nschemes are extended to allow them to be used in settings where participant\nanonymity is required. Systematic experiments show favorable tradeoffs between\nanonymity guarantees and estimator performance.\n  Taken together, we demonstrate that reasonable population estimates can be\nderived from anonymous respondent driven samples of 250-750 individuals, within\nambient populations of 5,000-40,000. The method thus represents a novel and\ncost-effective means for health planners and those agencies concerned with\nhealth and disease surveillance to estimate the size of hidden populations.\nLimitations and future work are discussed in the concluding section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 08:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

An example of such a computation\nis matrix multiplication, whereby a vector representing coherent state\namplitudes is multiplied by a matrix representing a linear optics network,\nyielding a new vector of coherent state amplitudes. By finding an orthogonal\npartitioning of the support of our encoded states, we quantify the security of\nour scheme via the indistinguishability of the encrypted codewords.

Having such an accurate method is of\ngreat importance for taking full advantage of the Juno mission, and its\nextremely precise determination of Jupiter gravitational moments, to better\nconstrain the internal structure of the planet. Recently, several authors have\napplied this method to the Juno mission with 512 spheroids linearly spaced in\naltitude. We demonstrate in this paper that such calculations lead to errors\nlarger than Juno's error bars, invalidating the aforederived Jupiter models at\nthe level required by Juno's precision. We show that, in order to fulfill\nJuno's observational constraints, at least 1500 spheroids must be used with a\ncubic, square or exponential repartition, the most reliable solutions. When\nusing a realistic equation of state instead of a polytrope, we highlight the\nnecessity to properly describe the outermost layers to derive an accurate\nboundary condition, excluding in particular a zero pressure outer condition.\nProviding all these constraints are fulfilled, the CMS method can indeed be\nused to derive Jupiter models within Juno's present observational constraints.\nHowever, we show that the treatment of the outermost layers leads to\nirreducible errors in the calculation of the gravitational moments and thus on\nthe inferred physical quantities for the planet. We have quantified these\nerrors and evaluated the maximum precision that can be reached with the CMS\nmethod in the present and future exploitation of Juno's data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 09:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a new risk minimization framework for speech enhancement, in which, one\noptimizes an unbiased estimate of the distortion/risk instead of the actual\nrisk.

We consider several perceptually relevant distortion measures and\ndevelop corresponding unbiased estimates under realistic assumptions on the\nnoise distribution and a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

We show that the maximum compactness and maximum masses\nconstraints extracted from the recent pulsars masses and radii observations can\nprovide the upper and lower limits of $\\kappa$ value of EiBI theory. By using\nBSP parameter set of relativistic mean field (RMF) model to describe NS core\nEOS including hyperons, it can be estimated that $ (2.7 \\le \\kappa_g \\le 7.9)\n\\times$ $\\rm 10^{-2} m^5 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$.

To address these issues, we present a fast and flexible denoising\nconvolutional neural network, namely FFDNet, with a tunable noise level map as\nthe input. The proposed FFDNet works on downsampled sub-images, achieving a\ngood trade-off between inference speed and denoising performance. In contrast\nto the existing discriminative denoisers, FFDNet enjoys several desirable\nproperties, including (i) the ability to handle a wide range of noise levels\n(i.e., [0, 75]) effectively with a single network, (ii) the ability to remove\nspatially variant noise by specifying a non-uniform noise level map, and (iii)\nfaster speed than benchmark BM3D even on CPU without sacrificing denoising\nperformance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real noisy images are\nconducted to evaluate FFDNet in comparison with state-of-the-art denoisers. The\nresults show that FFDNet is effective and efficient, making it highly\nattractive for practical denoising applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 12:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 15:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Due to the nascent nature of the topic, the existing\nresearch and knowledge on the pivots of software startups are very limited. In\nthis study, we aimed at identifying the major types of pivots that software\nstartups make during their startup processes, and highlighting the factors that\nfail software projects and trigger pivots. To achieve this, we conducted a case\nsurvey study based on the secondary data of the major pivots happened in 49\nsoftware startups. 10 pivot types and 14 triggering factors were identified.\nThe findings show that customer need pivot is the most common among all pivot\ntypes. Together with customer segment pivot, they are common market related\npivots. The major product related pivots are zoom-in and technology pivots.\nSeveral new pivot types were identified, including market zoom-in, complete and\nside project pivots. Our study also demonstrates that negative customer\nreaction and flawed business model are the most common factors that trigger\npivots in software startups. Our study extends the research knowledge on\nsoftware startup pivot types and pivot triggering factors.

This\npaper addresses the need to better understand the intentions of bots on social\nmedia and to develop a shared understanding of how 'social' bots differ from\nother types of bots. We thus describe a systematic review of publications that\nresearched bot accounts on social media. Based on the results of this\nliterature review, we propose a scheme for categorising bot accounts on social\nmedia sites. Our scheme groups bot accounts by two dimensions - Imitation of\nhuman behaviour and Intent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 13:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

Possible scenarios of the contribution\nof the magnetic field to the star-formation rate are evaluated. Archival data\nfrom the VLA and WSRT were combined and re-reduced to cover the wavelength\nregime between 3cm and 22cm.

Commonly, nodes are defined by Regions of Interest (ROIs),\npre-determined groupings of fMRI measurement voxels. Earlier, we have\ndemonstrated that the functional homogeneity of ROIs, captured by their spatial\nconsistency, varies widely across ROIs in commonly-used brain atlases. Here, we\nask how ROIs behave as nodes of dynamic brain networks. To this end, we use two\nmeasures: spatiotemporal consistency measures changes in spatial consistency\nacross time and network turnover quantifies the changes in the local network\nstructure around a ROI. We find that spatial consistency varies non-uniformly\nin space and time, which is reflected in the variation of spatiotemporal\nconsistency across ROIs. Further, we see time-dependent changes in the network\nneighborhoods of the ROIs, reflected in high network turnover. Network turnover\nis nonuniformly distributed across ROIs: ROIs with high spatiotemporal\nconsistency have low network turnover. Finally, we reveal that there is rich\nvoxel-level correlation structure inside ROIs. Because the internal structure\nand the connectivity of ROIs vary in time, the common approach of using static\nnode definitions may be surprisingly inaccurate.

Our main result is the first one pass W-Streaming\nalgorithm computing an Euler tour of G in the form of an edge successor\nfunction with only O(n log(n)) RAM which is optimal for this setting (e.g., Sun\nand Woodruff (2015)). The previously best-known result in this model is\nimplicitly given by Demetrescu et al. (2010) with the parallel algorithm of\nAtallah and Vishkin (1984) using O(m/n) passes under the same RAM limitation.\nFor graphs with \\omega(n) edges this is non-constant. Our overall approach is\nto partition the edges into edge-disjoint cycles and to merge the cycles until\na single Euler tour is achieved. Note that in the W-Streaming model such a\nmerging is far from being obvious as the limited RAM allows the processing of\nonly a constant number of cycles at once. This enforces us to merge cycles that\npartially are no longer present in RAM. Furthermore, the successor of an edge\ncannot be changed after the edge has left RAM. So, we steadily have to output\nedges and their designated successors, not knowing the appearance of edges and\ncycles yet to come. We solve this problem with a special edge swapping\ntechnique, for which two certain edges per node are sufficient to merge tours\nwithout having all of their edges in RAM. Mathematically, this is controlled by\nstructural results on the space of certain equivalence classes corresponding to\ncycles and the characterization of associated successor functions.

The stellar velocity fields show a disk-like rotating pattern, for\nwhich the kinematic position angle is in agreement with the photometric\nposition angle obtained from large scale images. For this set of galaxies, the\nstellar surface brightness of the inactive galaxy sample is generally\ncomparable to the matched sample of AGN but extends to lower surface\nbrightness. After removal of the bulge contribution, we find a nuclear stellar\nlight excess with an extended nuclear disk structure, and which exhibits a\nsize-luminosity relation. While we expect the excess luminosity to be\nassociated with a dynamically cooler young stellar population, we do not\ntypically see a matching drop in dispersion. This may be because these galaxies\nhave pseudo-bulges in which the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the\ncentre. And although the young stars may have an impact in the observed\nkinematics, their fraction is too small to dominate over the bulge and\ncompensate the increase in dispersion at small radii, so no dispersion drop is\nseen. Finally, we find no evidence for a difference in the stellar kinematics\nand nuclear stellar luminosity excess between these active and inactive\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 14:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

It is however an open question how\nfar these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we\ninvestigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning\napproaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and\nshow how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of\nboth worlds.

Consequently, there are\nincreasing concerns and interest in designing efficient strategies and\nregulations that health agencies can follow in order to reduce the imminent\nimpact of viruses like Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. That includes fumigation,\nabatization, reducing the hatcheries, picking up trash, information campaigns.\nA basic question that arise when designing control strategies is about which\nand where these ones should focus. In other words, one would like to know\nwhether preventing the contagion or decrease vector population, and in which\narea of the city, is more efficient. In this work, we propose risk indexes\nbased on the idea of secondary cases from patch to patch. Thus, they take into\naccount human mobility and indicate which patch has more chance to be a\ncorridor for the spread of the disease and which is more vulnerable. They can\nalso indicate the neighborhood where hatchery control will reduce more the\nnumber of potential cases. In order to illustrate the usefulness of these\nindexes, we run a set of numerical simulations in a mathematical model that\ntakes into account the urban mobility and the differences in population density\namong the areas of a city. If i is a particular neighborhood, the transmission\nrisk index TR_i measures the potential secondary cases caused by a host in that\nneighborhood. The vector transmission risk index VTR_i measures the potential\nsecondary cases caused by a vector. Finally, the vulnerability risk index VR_i\nmeasures the potential secondary cases in the neighborhood. Transmission\nindexes can be used to give geographical priority to some neighborhoods when\napplying prevention and control measures. On the other hand, the vulnerability\nindex can be useful to implement monitoring campaigns or public health\ninvestment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 15:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

Event sequences, characterized by discrete observations stamped\nwith continuous-valued times of occurrence, are challenging due to the\npotentially wide dynamic range of relevant time scales as well as interactions\nbetween time scales. We describe four forms of inductive bias that should\nbenefit architectures for event sequences: temporal locality, position and\nscale homogeneity, and scale interdependence. We extend the popular gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) architecture to incorporate these biases via intrinsic\ntemporal dynamics, obtaining a continuous-time GRU. The CT-GRU arises by\ninterpreting the gates of a GRU as selecting a time scale of memory, and the\nCT-GRU generalizes the GRU by incorporating multiple time scales of memory and\nperforming context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage\nand retrieval. Event time-stamps drive decay dynamics of the CT-GRU, whereas\nthey serve as generic additional inputs to the GRU. Despite the very different\nmanner in which the two models consider time, their performance on eleven data\nsets we examined is essentially identical.

The\nmotivation for GFG automata comes from their adequacy for games and synthesis,\nwherein general nondeterminism is inappropriate. We continue the ongoing effort\nof studying the power of nondeterminism in GFG automata. Initial indications\nhave hinted that every GFG automaton embodies a deterministic one. Today we\nknow that this is not the case, and in fact GFG automata may be exponentially\nmore succinct than deterministic ones.\n  We focus on the typeness question, namely the question of whether a GFG\nautomaton with a certain acceptance condition has an equivalent GFG automaton\nwith a weaker acceptance condition on the same structure. Beyond the\ntheoretical interest in studying typeness, its existence implies efficient\ntranslations among different acceptance conditions. This practical issue is of\nspecial interest in the context of games, where the Buchi and co-Buchi\nconditions admit memoryless strategies for both players. Typeness is known to\nhold for deterministic automata and not to hold for general nondeterministic\nautomata.\n  We show that GFG automata enjoy the benefits of typeness, similarly to the\ncase of deterministic automata. In particular, when Rabin or Streett GFG\nautomata have equivalent Buchi or co-Buchi GFG automata, respectively, then\nsuch equivalent automata can be defined on a substructure of the original\nautomata. Using our typeness results, we further study the place of GFG\nautomata in between deterministic and nondeterministic ones. Specifically,\nconsidering automata complementation, we show that GFG automata lean toward\nnondeterministic ones, admitting an exponential state blow-up in the\ncomplementation of a Streett automaton into a Rabin automaton, as opposed to\nthe constant blow-up in the deterministic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 15:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

Limitations include\ncomputational cost of some algorithms with strong performance, which may be\nameliorated through distributed computing and the development of more efficient\nversions of these algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 14:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

This is because these\nedge devices are often not as well maintained, dependable, powerful, or robust\nas centralized server-class cloud resources. This article explores\ndependability and deployment challenges in the field of edge computing, what\naspects are solvable with today's technology, and what aspects call for new\nsolutions.\n  The first issue addressed is failures, both hard (crash, hang, etc.) and soft\n(performance-related), and real-time constraint violation. In this domain, edge\ncomputing bolsters real-time system capacity through reduced end-to-end\nlatency. However, much like cache misses, overloaded or malfunctioning edge\ncomputers can drive latency beyond tolerable limits. Second, decentralized\nmanagement and device tampering can lead to chain of trust and security or\nprivacy violations. Authentication, access control, and distributed intrusion\ndetection techniques have to be extended from current cloud deployments and\nneed to be customized for the edge ecosystem.
