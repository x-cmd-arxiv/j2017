The protocol is readily scalable due to the triblock's commercial\navailability. Different production methods (ultrasonication, microfluidics and\nmembrane emulsification) are used with different oils (hexadecane and silicone\noil) to produce functional droplets in various size ranges (sub-micron, $\\sim\n20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ and $> 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$), showcasing the generality of\nthe protocol.

Machine learning\n(ML), neural network, and AI research has been primarily driven by tasks\nrequiring such abilities. However, another central facet of cognition,\nsingle-trial formation of permanent memories of experiences, i.e., episodic\nmemory (EM), has had relatively little focus. Only recently has EM-like\nfunctionality been added to Deep Learning (DL) models, e.g., Neural Turing\nMachine, Memory Networks. However, in these cases: a) EM is implemented as a\nseparate module, which entails substantial data movement (and so, time and\npower) between the DL net itself and EM; and b) individual items are stored\nlocalistically within the EM, precluding realizing the exponential\nrepresentational efficiency of distributed over localist coding.

At\ninference time, the number of channels used can be dynamically adjusted to\ntrade off accuracy for lowered power consumption and reduced latency by\nselecting only a beginning subset of channels. This approach allows for a\nsingle network to dynamically scale over a computation range, as opposed to\ntraining and deploying multiple networks to support different levels of\ncomputation scaling.

Most existing\napproaches for crafting adversarial examples necessitate some knowledge\n(architecture, parameters, etc.) of the network at hand. In this paper, we\nfocus on image classifiers and propose a feature-guided black-box approach to\ntest the safety of deep neural networks that requires no such knowledge. Our\nalgorithm employs object detection techniques such as SIFT (Scale Invariant\nFeature Transform) to extract features from an image. These features are\nconverted into a mutable saliency distribution, where high probability is\nassigned to pixels that affect the composition of the image with respect to the\nhuman visual system. We formulate the crafting of adversarial examples as a\ntwo-player turn-based stochastic game, where the first player's objective is to\nminimise the distance to an adversarial example by manipulating the features,\nand the second player can be cooperative, adversarial, or random. We show that,\ntheoretically, the two-player game can con- verge to the optimal strategy, and\nthat the optimal strategy represents a globally minimal adversarial image. For\nLipschitz networks, we also identify conditions that provide safety guarantees\nthat no adversarial examples exist. Using Monte Carlo tree search we gradually\nexplore the game state space to search for adversarial examples. Our\nexperiments show that, despite the black-box setting, manipulations guided by a\nperception-based saliency distribution are competitive with state-of-the-art\nmethods that rely on white-box saliency matrices or sophisticated optimization\nprocedures. Finally, we show how our method can be used to evaluate robustness\nof neural networks in safety-critical applications such as traffic sign\nrecognition in self-driving cars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 22:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 07:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Approximate universal relations insensitive to the star's\ninternal structure exist among certain observables and are useful in testing\nGeneral Relativity, as they project out the uncertainties in the equation of\nstate. One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this\ntheory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic\norder in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in\nGeneral Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the\ndimensional coupling constant of the theory. Finally, we study the variation of\nthe eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star and its relation to the\ndegree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation\nis smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity,\nproviding further support to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of\nisodensity contours is responsible for universality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2017 23:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

We particularly study the price of\nanarchy for such networks, that is, the ratio of the total delay experienced by\nselfish routing to the socially optimal routing policy. Unlike the case when\nall vehicles are of the same type, for which the price of anarchy is known to\nbe bounded, we first show that the price of anarchy can be arbitrarily large\nfor such mixed autonomous networks.

We show that when the degree of asymmetry of all links in\nthe network is bounded by a factor less than 4, the price of anarchy is\nbounded. We also bound the bicriteria, which is a bound on the cost of\nselfishly routing traffic compared to the cost of optimally routing additional\ntraffic.

The encoding replaces each logical\nqubit by a complete graph of degree $C$. The nesting level $C$ represents the\ndistance of the error-correcting code and controls the amount of protection\nagainst thermal and control errors. Theoretical mean-field analyses and\nempirical data obtained with a D-Wave Two quantum annealer (supporting up to\n$512$ qubits) showed that NQAC has the potential to achieve a scalable\neffective temperature reduction, $T_{\\rm eff} \\sim C^{-\\eta}$, with $\\eta \\leq\n2$. We confirm that this scaling is preserved when NQAC is tested on a D-Wave\n2000Q device (supporting up to $2048$ qubits). In addition, we show that NQAC\ncan be also used in sampling problems to lower the effective temperature of a\nquantum annealer. Such effective temperature reduction is relevant for\nmachine-learning applications. Since we demonstrate that NQAC achieves error\ncorrection via an effective reduction of the temperature of the quantum\nannealing device, our results address the problem of the \"temperature scaling\nlaw for quantum annealers\", which requires the temperature of quantum annealers\nto be reduced as problems of larger sizes are attempted to be solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 02:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We tabulate infrared photometry for 709 such objects using\nimages from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), Wide-Field Infrared Explorer\n(WISE), and Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). Of the 709 objects identified at\n24 or 22 microns, 422 are detected at the HSO 70 micron bandpass. Of these,\nonly 39 are detected at HSO 160 microns. The 70 micron peak surface\nbrightnesses are 0.5 to 2.5 Jy/square arcminute. Color temperatures calculated\nfrom the 24 micron to 70 micron ratios range from 80 K to 400 K. Color\ntemperatures from 70 micron to 160 micron ratios are systematically lower, 40 K\nto 200 K. Both of these temperature are, on average, 75% higher than the\nnominal temperatures derived by assuming that dust is in steady-state radiative\nequilibrium. This may be evidence of stellar wind bowshocks sweeping up and\nheating --- possibly fragmenting but not destroying --- interstellar dust.\nInfrared luminosity correlates with standoff distance, R_0, as predicted by\npublished hydrodynamical models. Infrared spectral energy distributions are\nconsistent with interstellar dust exposed to a either single radiant energy\ndensity, U=10^3 to 10^5 (in more than half of the objects) or a range of\nradiant energy densities U_min=25 to U_max=10^3 to 10^5 times the mean\ninterstellar value for the remainder. Hence, the central OB stars dominate the\nenergetics, making these enticing laboratories for testing dust models in\nconstrained radiation environments. SEDs are consistent with PAH fractions\nq_PAH <1% in most objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 05:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

The\ntheory of spot pricing is the basis of electricity market design in many\ncountries, but it has two major drawbacks: one is that it is still based on the\ntraditional hourly scheduling/dispatch model, ignores the crucial time\ncontinuity in electric power production and consumption and does not treat the\ninter-temporal constraints seriously; the second is that it assumes that the\nelectricity products are homogeneous in the same dispatch period and cannot\ndistinguish the base, intermediate and peak power with obviously different\ntechnical and economic characteristics. To overcome the shortcomings, this\npaper presents a continuous time commodity model of electricity, including spot\npricing model and load duration model. The market optimization models under the\ntwo pricing mechanisms are established with the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals\nrespectively and the functional optimization problem are solved by the\nEuler-Lagrange equation to obtain the market equilibria. The feasibility of\npricing according to load duration is proved by strict mathematical derivation.\nSimulation results show that load duration pricing can correctly identify and\nvalue different attributes of generators, reduce the total electricity\npurchasing cost, and distribute profits among the power plants more equitably.\nThe theory and methods proposed in this paper will provide new ideas and\ntheoretical foundation for the development of electric power markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 10:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Understanding the topological symplectic\ntransport of the Dirac fermions is a key issue to study and design the TI-based\ndevices. In this review, we introduce the progress on the universal conductance\nfluctuation (UCF) of TSSs. Firstly, we report the two dimensional UCF\nphenomenon in TIs, and its topological nature is demonstrated based on the\ninvestigations of UCF by angle-varying, in-plane field tuning and scaling\nanalysis. Secondly, we discuss the statistical symmetry of UCF in TIs. For a\nsingle TSS, the applied magnetic field will drive the system from a Gaussian\nsymplectic ensemble into a Gaussian unitary ensemble. It results a 2^0.5 fold\nincrease of the UCF amplitude. However, the experiment reveals a decreasing of\nthe UCF amplitude of 2^0.5 times. This is contradictory to the theoretical\nprediction. Actually, there are two TSSs and they are coherently coupled to\neach other in TIs since the sample's thickness is shorter than its bulk\ndephasing length. This leads to a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of the interface\ncoupling system without an external field. In such situation, the UCF amplitude\nwill decrease by 2^0.5 times with the field increasing.

We develop a framework for designing an\nendurable network by allocating the expected lifetimes of its components, given\na limited budget. Based on percolation theory and simulation, we find that the\nmaximal network endurance can be achieved with a quantitative balance between\nnetwork duration and connectivity. For different endurance requirements, we\nfind that the optimal design can be separated into two categories: strong\ndependence of lifetime on node's degree leads to larger network lifetime, while\nweak dependence generates stronger network connectivity.

Traditional tools to measure the energy cascade from\nturbulence theory, such as spectral flux or spectral transfer rely on the\nassumption of statistical homogeneity, or at least a large separation between\nthe scales of motion and the scales of statistical inhomogeneity. The\ncoarse-graining framework allows for probing the fully nonlinear dynamics\nsimultaneously in scale and in space, and is not restricted by those\nassumptions. This paper describes how the framework can be applied to ocean\nflows.\n  Energy transfer between scales is not unique due to a gauge freedom. Here, it\nis argued that a Galilean invariant subfilter scale (SFS) flux is a suitable\nquantity to properly measure energy scale-transfer in the Ocean. It is shown\nthat the SFS definition can yield answers that are qualitatively different from\ntraditional measures that conflate spatial transport with the scale-transfer of\nenergy. The paper presents geographic maps of the energy scale-transfer that\nare both local in space and allow quasi-spectral, or scale-by-scale, dynamics\nto be diagnosed. Utilizing a strongly eddying simulation of flow in the North\nAtlantic Ocean, it is found that an upscale energy transfer does not hold\neverywhere. Indeed certain regions, near the Gulf Stream and in the Equatorial\nCounter Current have a marked downscale transfer. Nevertheless, on average an\nupscale transfer is a reasonable mean description of the extra-tropical energy\nscale-transfer over regions of O(10^3) kilometers in size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 15:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We discuss herein a simple and intuitive approach to\ndemonstrate that the two seemingly disparate mechanisms are closely related. A\ncompelling analogy between the respective Hamiltonian is presented and that the\nusual derivation of spin-relaxation times, in the respective frameworks of the\ntwo theories, can be performed. The result also allows to obtain the less\ncanonical spin-relaxation regimes; the generalization of the EY when the\nmaterial has a large quasiparticle broadening and the DP mechanism in ultrapure\nsemiconductors. The method also allows a practical and intuitive numerical\nimplementation of the spin-relaxation calculation, which is demonstrated for\nMgB$_2$ that has anomalous spin-relaxation properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 15:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Such equations can model phenomena described by complex\nGinzburg-Landau systems under the added assumption of saturable media. When the\nsaturation parameter is set to zero, we recover a general complex cubic\nGinzburg-Landau system with XPM. We first derive conditions for the existence\nof bounded dynamics, approximating the absorbing set for solutions. We use this\nto then determine conditions for amplitude death of a single wavefunction. We\nalso construct exact plane wave solutions, and determine conditions for their\nmodulational instability. In a degenerate limit where dispersion and\nnonlinearity balance, we reduce our system to a saturable nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger system with XPM parameters, and we demonstrate the existence and\nbehavior of spatially heterogeneous stationary solutions in this limit. Using\nnumerical simulations we verify the aforementioned analytical results, while\nalso demonstrating other interesting emergent features of the dynamics, such as\nspatiotemporal chaos in the presence of modulational instability. In other\nregimes, coherent patterns including uniform states or banded structures arise,\ncorresponding to certain stable stationary states. For sufficiently large yet\nequal XPM parameters, we observe a segregation of wavefunctions into different\nregions of the spatial domain, while when XPM parameters are large and take\ndifferent values, one wavefunction may decay to zero in finite time over the\nspatial domain (in agreement with the amplitude death predicted analytically).\nWhile saturation will often regularize the dynamics, such transient dynamics\ncan still be observed - and in some cases even prolonged - as the saturability\nof the media is increased, as the saturation may act to slow the timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 15:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 19:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}
