Such a three-level system,\nfor instance, can be mapped onto physical in form of a three-waveguide system.\nActively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes\nallows modulating light propagating through the device, as proposed here. The\nouter waveguides act as an effective two- photonic-mode system similar to\nground- and excited states of a three-level atomic system, whilst the center\nwaveguide is partially plasmonic. In adiabatic elimination regime, the\namplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster in comparison to the\nouter waveguides leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the middle\nwaveguide becomes a dark state and hence a low insertion-loss of 8 decibel is\nexpected to keep when achieving the modulation depth as high as 70 decibel\ndespite the involvement of a plasmonic waveguide in the design presented here.\nThe modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a\ncritical coupling regime to adiabatic elimination condition via\nelectrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration and hence the optical\nindex of a thin ITO layer residing in the plasmonic center waveguide. This\nalters the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus\nmodulation in each of outer waveguides.

An important\nconsideration is fairness between Wi-Fi and duty cycled LTE-U, which is often\ndefined in terms of channel access time, as adopted by the LTE-U Forum. Despite\nmany studies on duty cycle adaptation design for fair sharing, one crucial fact\nhas often been neglected: LTE-U systems unilaterally control LTE-U duty cycles;\nhence, as self- interested users, they have incentives to misbehave, e.g.,\ntransmitting with a larger duty cycle that exceeds a given limit, so as to gain\na greater share in channel access time and throughput. In this paper, we\npropose a scheme that allows the spectrum manager managing the shared bands to\nestimate the duty cycle of a target LTE-U cell based on PHY layer observations\nfrom a nearby Wi-Fi AP, without interrupting normal Wi-Fi operations. We\nfurther propose a thresholding scheme to detect duty cycling misbehavior (i.e.,\ndetermining if the duty cycle exceeds the assigned limit), and analyze its\nperformance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities. The proposed\nschemes are implemented in ns3 and evaluated with extensive simulations.

Using the catalog of 2148 probable cluster\nmembers obtained from Chandra, VVV, and optical surveys (Paper I), we examine\nthe cluster's spatial structure and dynamical state. The spatial distribution\nof stars is remarkably well fit by an isothermal sphere with moderate\nelongation, while other commonly used models like Plummer spheres, multivariate\nnormal distributions, or power-law models are poor fits. The cluster has a core\nradius of $1.2\\pm0.1$ pc and a central density of ~200 stars pc$^{-3}$. The\ndistribution of stars is mildly mass segregated. However, there is no radial\nstratification of the stars by age. Although most of the stars belong to a\nsingle cluster, a small subcluster of stars is found superimposed on the main\ncluster, and there are clumpy non-isotropic distributions of stars outside ~4\ncore radii. When the size, mass, and age of NGC 6231 are compared to other\nyoung star clusters and subclusters in nearby active star-forming regions, it\nlies at the high-mass end of the distribution but along the same trend line.\nThis could result from similar formation processes, possibly hierarchical\ncluster assembly. We argue that NGC 6231 has expanded from its initial size but\nthat it remains gravitationally bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Giant planets are generally\nbelieved to form far from their host stars, where volatile materials like water\nexist in their solid phase, making it easier for giant planet cores to\naccumulate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how giant planets\ncan migrate inward from their birth sites to short-period orbits. One such\nmechanism, called Kozai-Lidov migration, requires the presence of distant\ncompanions in orbits inclined by more than $\\sim40$ degrees with respect to the\nplane of the hot Jupiter's orbit. The high occurrence rate of wide companions\nin hot Jupiter systems lends support to this theory for migration. However, the\nexact orbital inclinations of these detected planetary and stellar companions\nis not known, so it is not clear whether the mutual inclination of these\ncompanions is large enough for the Kozai-Lidov process to operate. This paper\nshows that in systems orbiting cool stars with convective outer layers, the\norbits of most wide planetary companions to hot Jupiters must be well aligned\nwith the orbits of the hot Jupiters and the spins of the host stars. For a\nvariety of possible distributions for the inclination of the companion, the\nwidth of the distribution must be less than $\\sim20$ degrees to recreate the\nobservations with good fidelity. As a result, the companion orbits are likely\nwell-aligned with those of the hot Jupiters, and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism does\nnot enforce migration in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Theory: Parallel imaging and compressed\nsensing reconstructions become time consuming when the problem size or the\nnumber of coils is large, due to the large linear system of equations that has\nto be solved in l_1 and l_2-norm based reconstruction algorithms. Such linear\nsystems can be solved efficiently using effective preconditioning techniques.\nMethods: In this paper we construct such a preconditioner by approximating the\nsystem matrix of the linear system, which comprises the data fidelity and\nincludes total variation and wavelet regularization, by a matrix with the\nassumption that is a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. Due to its\ncirculant structure, the preconditioner can be constructed quickly and its\ninverse can be evaluated fast using only two fast Fourier transformations. We\ntest the performance of the preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method as\nthe linear solver, integrated into the Split Bregman algorithm. Results: The\ndesigned circulant preconditioner reduces the number of iterations required in\nthe conjugate gradient method by almost a factor of~5. The speed up results in\na total acceleration factor of approximately 2.5 for the entire reconstruction\nalgorithm when implemented in MATLAB, while the initialization time of the\npreconditioner is negligible.

Here we show that the cores of Earth- and\nVenus-like planets should grow with stable compositional stratification unless\ndisturbed by late energetic impacts. They do so because higher abundances of\nlight elements are incorporated into the liquid metal that sinks to form the\ncore as the temperatures and pressures of metal-silicate equilibration increase\nduring accretion.

However, if a late energetic impact occurs, it could mechanically\nstir the core creating a single homogenous region within which a long-lasting\ngeodynamo would operate. While Earth's accretion has been punctuated by a late\ngiant impact with likely enough energy to mix the core (e.g. the impact that\nformed the Moon), we hypothesize that the accretion of Venus is characterized\nby the absence of such energetic giant impacts and the preservation of its\nprimordial stratifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 19:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

While quantum information science has relied on\nsystems with entanglement in 2D degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum bits with\npolarization states, the field is moving towards ever-higher dimensions of\nentanglement. Increasing the dimensionality enhances the channel capacity and\nsecurity of quantum communication protocols, gives rise to exponential speed-up\nof quantum computation, and is necessary for quantum imaging. Yet,\ncharacterization of even bipartite quantum states of high-dimensional\nentanglement remains a prohibitively time-consuming challenge, as the\ndimensionality of the joint Hilbert space scales quadratically with the number\nof modes. Here, we develop and experimentally demonstrate a new, more complete\ntheory of detection in CCD cameras for rapid measurement of the full joint\nprobability distribution of high-dimensional quantum states. The theory spans\nthe intensity range from low photon count to saturation of the detector, while\nthe massive parallelization inherent in the pixel array makes measurements\nscale favorably with dimensionality. The results accurately account for partial\ndetection and electronic noise, resolve the paradox of ignoring two-photon\ndetection in a single pixel despite collinear spatial entanglement, and reveal\nthe full Hilbert space for exploration. For example, use of a megapixel array\nallows measurement of a joint Hilbert space of 1012 dimensions, with a speed-up\nof nearly four orders of magnitude over traditional methods.

Besides, the third chapter is devoted to the computational complexity\nissues of the permanent and some related functions on a variety of Cauchy\nmatrices and their certain generalizations, including constructing a\npolynomial-time algorithm (based on them) for the permanent of an arbitrary\nmatrix in characteristic 5 (implying RP = NP) and conjecturing the existence of\na similar scheme in characteristic 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 19:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 20:50:03 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 10:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 15:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 14:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

To remedy this problem, many\npapers include prescriptions for scaling down the bet size. Such schemes are\nreferred to as Fractional Kelly Betting. In this paper, we take the opposite\ntack. That is, we show that in many cases, the theoretical Kelly-based results\nmay lead to bets which are \"too conservative\" rather than too aggressive. To\nmake this argument, we consider a random vector X with its assumed probability\ndistribution and draw m samples to obtain an empirically-derived counterpart\nXhat. Subsequently, we derive and compare the resulting Kelly bets for both X\nand Xhat with consideration of sample size m as part of the analysis. This\nleads to identification of many cases which have the following salient feature:\nThe resulting bet size using the true theoretical distribution for X is much\nsmaller than that for Xhat. If instead the bet is based on empirical data,\n\"golden\" opportunities are identified which are essentially rejected when the\npurely theoretical model is used. To formalize these ideas, we provide a result\nwhich we call the Restricted Betting Theorem. An extreme case of the theorem is\nobtained when X has unbounded support. In this situation, using X, the Kelly\ntheory can lead to no betting at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 20:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

As an imperfect\nproxy for true energy usage, we define energy complexity to be the number of\ntime slots a device transmits/listens; idle time and computation are free.\n  In this paper we investigate the energy complexity of fundamental\ncommunication primitives such as broadcast in multi-hop radio networks. We\nconsider models with collision detection (CD) and without (No-CD), as well as\nboth randomized and deterministic algorithms. Some take-away messages from this\nwork include:\n  1. The energy complexity of broadcast in a multi-hop network is intimately\nconnected to the time complexity of leader election in a single-hop (clique)\nnetwork. Many existing lower bounds on time complexity immediately transfer to\nenergy complexity. For example, in the CD and No-CD models, we need\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ and $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ energy, respectively.\n  2. The energy lower bounds above can almost be achieved, given sufficient\n($\\Omega(n)$) time.

The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart\ncities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the\nwired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations)\nto provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource and\nenergy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Moreover, smart city\napplications are developed with the goal of improving the management of urban\nflows and allowing real-time responses to challenges that can arise in users'\ntransactional relationships. This article presents a Fog-supported smart city\nnetwork architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a\nmulti-tier structure in which the applications running on things jointly\ncompute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city\nenvironment to decrease latency and improve energy provisioning and the\nefficiency of services among things with different capabilities. An important\nconcern that arises with the introduction of FOCAN is the need to avoid\ntransferring data to/from distant things and instead to cover the nearest\nregion for an IoT application. We define three types of communications between\nFOCAN devices (e.g., interprimary, primary, and secondary communication) to\nmanage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for\nthe IoE. One of the main advantages of FOCAN is that the devices can provide\nthe services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner. Simulation\nresults for a selected case study demonstrate the tremendous impact of the\nFOCAN energy-efficient solution on the communication performance of various\ntypes of things in smart cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 20:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Although the capacity of this planet to (i) reproduce the observed\nclustering of distant orbits in physical space, (ii) facilitate dynamical\ndetachment of their perihelia from Neptune, and (iii) excite a population of\nlong-period centaurs to extreme inclinations is well established through\nnumerical experiments, a coherent theoretical description of the dynamical\nmechanisms responsible for these effects remains elusive. In this work, we\ncharacterize the dynamical processes at play, from semi-analytic grounds. We\nbegin by considering a purely secular model of orbital evolution induced by\nPlanet Nine, and show that it is at odds with the ensuing stability of distant\nobjects. Instead, the long-term survival of the clustered population of\nlong-period KBOs is enabled by a web of mean-motion resonances driven by Planet\nNine. Then, by taking a compact-form approach to perturbation theory, we show\nthat it is the secular dynamics embedded within these resonances that regulates\nthe orbital confinement and perihelion detachment of distant Kuiper belt\nobjects. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset of large-amplitude oscillations\nof orbital inclinations is accomplished through capture of low-inclination\nobjects into a high-order secular resonance and identify the specific harmonic\nthat drives the evolution. In light of the developed qualitative understanding\nof the governing dynamics, we offer an updated interpretation of the current\nobservational dataset within the broader theoretical framework of the Planet\nNine hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 21:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

An adult macaque\nmonkey is trained to perform a memory-based saccade. The objective is to decode\nthe eye movement goals from the LFP collected during a memory period. The LFP\nclassification problem is modeled as that of classification of smooth functions\nembedded in Gaussian noise. It is then argued that using minimax function\nestimators as features would lead to consistent LFP classifiers. The theory of\nGaussian sequence models allows us to represent minimax estimators as finite\ndimensional objects. The LFP classifier resulting from this mathematical\nendeavor is a spectrum based technique, where Fourier series coefficients of\nthe LFP data, followed by appropriate shrinkage and thresholding, are used as\nfeatures in a linear discriminant classifier.

Though the uniformity of their light curves makes\nthem powerful cosmological distance indicators, long-standing issues remain\nregarding their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Recent detection of the\nearly ultraviolet pulse of a peculiar subluminous SN Ia has been claimed as new\nevidence for the companion-ejecta interaction through the single-degenerate\nchannel. Here, we report the discovery of a prominent but red optical flash at\n$\\sim$ 0.5 days after the explosion of a SN Ia which shows hybrid features of\ndifferent SN Ia sub-classes: a light curve typical of normal-brightness SNe Ia,\nbut with strong titanium absorptions, commonly seen in the spectra of\nsubluminous ones. We argue that the early flash of such a hybrid SN Ia is\ndifferent from predictions of previously suggested scenarios such as the\ncompanion-ejecta interaction. Instead it can be naturally explained by a SN\nexplosion triggered by a detonation of a thin helium shell either on a\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\\gtrsim$ 1.3 M$_{\\odot}$) with low-yield\n$^{56}$Ni or on a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\\sim$ 1.0 M$_{\\odot}$)\nmerging with a less massive white dwarf.

There is a unique\nthree-qubit quantum gate called the Deutsch gate~[$\\mathbb{D}(\\theta)$], from\nwhich alone a circuit can be constructed so that any feasible quantum computing\nis attainable.

Thus, the\nnumber of nodes is upper bounded by $2^{\\fb}$, where $\\fb$ is the bits of data\nstored in each node. From both theoretical and practical points of view (see\nthe details in Section 1), it is natural to consider regenerating codes that\nnearly have minimum storage of data, and meanwhile the number of nodes is\nunbounded. One of the candidates for such regenerating codes is an algebraic\ngeometry code. In this paper, we generalize the repairing algorithm of\nReed-Solomon codes given in \\cite[STOC2016]{GW16} to algebraic geometry codes\nand present an efficient repairing algorithm for arbitrary one-point algebraic\ngeometry codes.

To test this hypothesis, we\ncouple the outcomes of 3-D hydrodynamic models for the formation of CIRs in\nstellar winds with a simplified recipe for the accretion onto a neutron star.\nThe results show that the synthetic X-ray light curves are indeed modulated by\nthe presence of the CIRs. The exact period and amplitude of these modulations\ndepend on a number of parameters governing the hydrodynamic wind models and on\nthe binary orbital configuration. To compare our model predictions with the\nobservations, we apply the 3-D wind structure previously shown to well explain\nthe appearance of discrete absorption components in the UV time series of a\nprototypical B0.5I-type supergiant. Using the orbital parameters of\nIGRJ16493-4348 which has the same B0.5I donor spectral type, the period and\nmodulations in the simulated X-ray light-curve are similar to the observed\nones, thus providing support to our scenario.

This hints at the possibility that the baseline models\nin these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and\na viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number\nof hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure,\nexposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy.

To examine formation and\noscillation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (NS) after merger, we present an\nexploratory study of fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using\nthe public code Einstein Toolkit. The attention is focused on qualitative\naspects of long-term postmerger evolution. As simplified test models, we use a\nmoderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of state and unmagnetized\nirrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold for\nprompt collapse. Our high resolution simulations generate postmerger \"ringdown\"\ngravitational wave (GW) signals of 170 ms, sustained by rotating massive NS\nremnants without collapsing to black holes. We observe that the high-density\ndouble-core structure inside the remnants gradually turns into a\nquasi-axisymmetric toroidal shape. It oscillates in a quasi-periodic manner and\nshrinks in size due to gravitational radiation. In the GW spectrograms,\ndominant double peaks persist throughout the postmerger simulations and slowly\ndrift to higher frequencies. A new low-frequency peak emerges at about 100 ms\nafter merger, owing to the growth of GW-driven unstable oscillation modes. The\nlong-term effect of grid resolution is also investigated using the same initial\nmodel. Moreover, we comment on physical conditions that are favorable for the\ntransient toroidal configuration to form, and discuss implication of our\nfindings on future GW observation targeting rapidly rotating NSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 04:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

Due to the heterogeneity of the system, the\nparticle's mean displacement does not vanish even if it does not experience any\nphysical force. This phenomenon has been termed \"noise-induced drift\", and has\nbeen extensively studied for one-dimensional systems. Here, we examine the\nnoise-induced drift in a two-dimensional anisotropic system, characterized by a\nsymmetric diffusion tensor with unequal diagonal elements. A general expression\nfor the mean displacement vector is derived and presented as a sum of two\nvectors, depicting two distinct drifting effects. The first vector describes\nthe tendency of the particle to drift toward the high diffusvity side in each\northogonal principal diffusion direction. This is a generalization of the\nwell-known expression for the noise-induced drift in one-dimensional systems.\nThe second vector represents a novel drifting effect, not found in\none-dimensional system, originating from the spatial rotation in the directions\nof the principal axes. The validity of the derived expressions is verified by\nusing Langevin dynamics simulations. As a specific example, we consider the\nrelative diffusion of two transmembrane proteins, and demonstrate that the\naverage distance between them increases at a surprisingly fast rate of several\ntens of micrometers per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 06:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

We present a new method to enhance head shadow in the low\nfrequencies. Head shadow enhancement is achieved with a fixed beamformer with\ncontralateral attenuation in each ear. The method results in interaural level\ndifferences which vary monotonically with angle. It also improves low-frequency\nsignal-to-noise ratios in conditions with spatially separated speech and noise.\nWe validated the method in two experiments with acoustic simulations of bimodal\nlistening.

These genes usually play an essential role in gene\nregulation and cellular processes. Despite recent advancements in\nhigh-throughput technology, inferring gene networks with hub genes from\nhigh-dimensional data still remains a challenging problem. Novel statistical\nnetwork inference methods are needed for efficient and accurate reconstruction\nof hub networks from high-dimensional data. To address this challenge we\npropose DW-Lasso, a degree weighted Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator) method which infers gene networks with hubs efficiently\nunder the low sample size setting. Our network reconstruction approach is\nformulated as a two stage procedure: first, the degree of networks is estimated\niteratively, and second, the gene regulatory network is reconstructed using\ndegree information. A useful property of the proposed method is that it\nnaturally favors the accumulation of neighbors around hub genes and thereby\nhelps in accurate modeling of the high-throughput data under the assumption\nthat the underlying network exhibits hub structure. In a simulation study, we\ndemonstrate good predictive performance of the proposed method in comparison to\ntraditional Lasso type methods in inferring hub and scale-free graphs.

A two-stage Tullock contest framework is constructed:at the\nsecond stage the potential contributors compete for splittable reward by\nexerting efforts, and at the first stage the requester can orchestrate the\nincentive mechanism to maximize his crowdsensing efficiency given the rewarding\nbudget. A general reward discrimination mechanism is developed for timeliness\nsensitive crowdsensing where an earlier contributor usually has a larger\nmaximum achievable reward and thus allocates more efforts. Owning to the lack\nof joining time information, two practical implementations, namely earliest-n\nand termination time, are announced to the contributors. For each of them, we\nformulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game in which the joining time of a\ncontributor is his type and not available to his opponents. The uniqueness of\nBayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is proved in each strategy. To maximize the\nrequester's efficiency, we compute the optimal number of rewarded contributors\nin the earliest-n scheme and the optimal deadline in the termination time\nscheme. Our contest framework is applicable not only to the closed crowdsensing\nwith fixed number of contributors, but also to the open crowdsensing that the\narrival of contributors is governed by a stochastic process.

Our\ncalculations are based on minimal surfaces that correspond to elliptic\nsolutions of the corresponding Pohlmeyer reduced system. For these minimal\nsurfaces, the entangling curve contains singular points that are not cusps, but\nthe joint point of two logarithmic spirals one being the rotation of the other\nby a given angle. It turns out that, similarly to the case of cusps, the\nentanglement entropy contains a logarithmic term, which is absent when the\nentangling curve is smooth. The latter depends solely on the geometry of the\nsingular points and not on the global characteristics of the entangling curve.\nThe results suggest that a careful definition of the geometric characteristic\nof such a singular point that determines the logarithmic term is required,\nwhich does not always coincide with the definition of the angle. Furthermore,\nit is shown that the smoothness of the dependence of the logarithmic terms on\nthis characteristic is not in general guaranteed, depending on the uniqueness\nof the minimal surface for the given entangling curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 10:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

Moreover, after\ndetermining the vitality of arcs and/or nodes, and given a planar embedding of\nthe graph, we can determine the vitality of a `contiguous' set of arcs/nodes in\ntime proportional to the size of the set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 11:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 21:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 15:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB\nhas increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content\nof JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United\nKingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over\ntime. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily\nbetween 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader\npatterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research\nliterature. Finally, we used a combination of topic modeling and nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article fields\nwithin JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of\nfields on multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the\nrepresentation of thematic fields has increased overall, with most of that\ndiversification occurring in recent years. Drawing on the dataset generated in\nthe course of this analysis, as well as web services in the emerging digital\nhistory and philosophy of science ecosystem, we have developed an interactive\nweb platform for exploring the content of JHB, and we provide a brief overview\nof the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses presented\nhere provide a starting-place for further critical reflection on the evolution\nof the history of biology over the past half-century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 11:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

These\nregions or patches may be highly heterogeneous in their properties, and often\nexhibit anomalous behaviour (resulting from e.g. crowding or viscoelastic\neffects) which necessitates the inclusion of non-Markovian dynamics in their\nstudy. However, many such processes are also subject to an internal\nself-regulating or tempering process due to concurrent competing functions\nbeing carried out. In this work we develop a model for anomalous transport\nacross a heterogeneous, patchy environment subject to tempering.

A direct result from the\nderived HRD is that subgiant CH stars occupy the same region as barium dwarfs,\ncontrary to what their designations imply. By comparing the position of barium\nstars in the HRD with STAREVOL evolutionary tracks, it is possible to evaluate\ntheir masses, provided the metallicity is known. We used an average metallicity\n[Fe/H] = -0.25 and derived the mass distribution of barium giants. The\ndistribution peaks around 2.5 Msun with a tail at higher masses up to 4.5 Msun.\nThis peak is also seen in the mass distribution of a sample of normal K and M\ngiants used for comparison and is associated with stars located in the red\nclump. When we compare these mass distributions, we see a deficit of low-mass\n(1 - 2 Msun) barium giants. This is probably because low-mass stars reach large\nradii at the tip of the red giant branch, which may have resulted in an early\nbinary interaction. Among barium giants, the high-mass tail is however\ndominated by stars with barium indices of less than unity, based on a visual\ninspection of the barium spectral line; that is, these stars have a very\nmoderate barium line strength. We believe that these stars are not genuine\nbarium giants, but rather bright giants, or supergiants, where the barium lines\nare strengthened because of a positive luminosity effect. Moreover, contrary to\nprevious claims, we do not see differences between the mass distributions of\nmild and strong barium giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 14:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 11:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Such data are\nnot only unbounded and rapidly evolving. Rather, the content thereof\ndynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations are\ndue to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data\ngeneration mechanisms. In a classification setting, concept drift causes the\npreviously learned models to become inaccurate, unsafe and even unusable.\nAccordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon as\npossible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example,\nchange in behaviours should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential\nloss of life. To this end, we introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method\n(MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid's inequality in order to detect concept drift.\nThe MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and\nassociate window entries with weights.

However, quantum confinement in superlattices is not always easy to\nachieve and needs to be carefully validated. In the past decade, large values\nof S have been measured in (SrTiO3)/(SrTi0:8Nb0:2O3) superlattices (Nat. Mater.\n6, 129 (2007) and Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 192105 (2007)). In the $\\delta$-doped\ncompound, the measured S was almost 6 times larger than that of the bulk\nmaterial. This huge increase has been attributed to the two dimensional\nconfinement of the carriers in the doped regions. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat the experimental data can be well explained quantitatively within the\nscenario in which electrons are delocalized in both in-plane and growth\ndirections, hence strongly suggesting that the confinement picture in these\nsuperlattices may be unlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 14:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

To optimize our IBCCF model, we develop\nan alternating direction method of multipliers.

These\nspectra are penetration spectra that describe the asymptotic depths of\npenetration of geodesics in the cusps. Their study is in particular motivated\nby Diophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. In the classical case of the\nmodular surface and classical Diophantine approximation, Hall proved in 1947\nthat the classical Lagrange spectrum contains a half-line, known as a Hall ray.\nWe generalize this result to the context of Riemann surfaces with cusps and\nDiophantine approximation on Fuchsian groups. One can measure excursion into a\ncusp both with respect to a natural height function or, more generally, with\nrespect to any proper function. We prove the existence of a Hall ray for the\nLagrange spectrum of any non co-compact, finite covolume Fuchsian group with\nrespect to any given cusp, both when the penetration is measured by a height\nfunction induced by the imaginary part as well as by any proper function close\nto it with respect to the Lipschitz norm. This shows that Hall rays are stable\nunder (Lipschitz) perturbations. As a main tool, we use the boundary expansion\ndeveloped by Bowen and Series to code geodesics and produce a geometric\ncontinued fraction-like expansion and mimic the key ideas in Hall's original\nargument. A key element in the proof of the results for proper functions is a\ngeneralization of Hall's theorem on the sum of Cantor sets, where we consider\nfunctions which are small perturbations in the Lipschitz norm of the sum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 14:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

First, inability\nto meet diverse comfort requirements of the occupants. Second, heat or cool an\nentire zone even when the zone is only partially occupied. Both issues can be\nmitigated by using personal comfort systems (PCS) which bridge the comfort gap\nbetween what is provided by a central HVAC system and the personal preferences\nof the occupants. In recent work, we have proposed and deployed such a system,\ncalled SPOT.\n  We address the question, \"How should an existing HVAC system modify its\noperation to benefit the availability of PCS like SPOT?\" For example, energy\nconsumption could be reduced during sparse occupancy by choosing appropriate\nthermal set backs, with the PCS providing the additional offset in thermal\ncomfort required for each occupant. Our control strategy based on Model\nPredictive Control (MPC), employs a bi-linear thermal model, and has two\ntime-scales to accommodate the physical constraints that limit certain\ncomponents of the central HVAC system from frequently changing their set\npoints.\n  We compare the energy consumption and comfort offered by our SPOT-aware HVAC\nsystem with that of a state-of-the-art MPC-based central HVAC system in\nmultiple settings including different room layouts and partial deployment of\nPCS. Numerical evaluations show that our system obtains, in average, 45% (15%)\nsavings in energy in summer (winter), compared with the benchmark system for\nthe case of homogeneous comfort requirements. For heterogeneous comfort\nrequirements, we observe 51% (29%) improvement in comfort in summer (winter) in\naddition to significant savings in energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 15:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

It is found that the c-QPWP contains a localized\ncharge which is less than the magnitude of the bare charge and the remaining\ncharge resides at the system boundary. The amount of charge delocalized turns\nout to be inversely proportional to the degenerate Fermi velocity $v_0 ( =\n\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 2\\mu / m})$ when RSOC (with strength $\\alpha$) is weak, and\ntherefore externally tunable. For strong RSOC, the magnitudes of both the\ndelocalized charge and the current further strongly depend on the direction of\npropagation of the wave packet. Both the charge and the current densities\nconsist of an anisotropic $r^{-2}$ tail away from the centre of the wave\npacket.

The\nclassical theory of rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic\nelasticity of networks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The\nkinetic theories for vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect\nexperimental measurements all indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates\nis made of polymer strands with a random distribution of length. The\npolydispersity in strand length is expected to control the mechanical strength\nof rubber as the overloaded short strands break at small deformations and\ntransfer the load to the longer strands. The purpose of the contributions\npresented in this thesis is to present simple theories of rubber mechanics that\ntake into account the length distribution of strands and its effect on\nelasticity and the onset of bulk failure in unfilled and filled elastomers. In\nunfilled system, the population of short chains is identified as the culprits\nfor damage initiation. Upon deformation of a polydisperse network, shorter\nstrands break at considerably smaller stretches compared to the longer ones.\nThe network alteration continues concurrent with increasing deformation and\ncontrols the onset of mechanical failure. In the filled networks, the\ndegradation in network mechanical behavior is assumed to be controlled by the\nadhesive failure of the short strands adsorbed onto the filler surface. The\nfinite extensibility of the short adsorbed strands is a key determinant of\nmechanical strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 00:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Both scalar-tensor theories and Palatini formalism are means\nof alternating classical theory of gravity, general relativity, in order to\naccount for phenomena being seemingly unexplainable on the ground of the\nEinstein theory or to serve as toy models used to test limitations of the\ntheory in question. In the literature, both Palatini approach and scalar-tensor\ntheories have been widely discussed, but there are very few - if none - authors\nwriting about a merge of these two ideas. The present paper is a result of an\ninsufficient attention given to the topic of scalar-tensor theories in Palatini\nformalism.\n  In the course of the thesis action functional for scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity will be introduced. This action functional differs significantly from\nthe action defined in case of scalar-tensor theories in metric approach. We aim\nat analysing the theory using the language of invariants, allowing us to write\ndown all equations in a frame-independent manner. We discover that invariants\ndefined for the metric case do not always have their counterparts in Palatini\nformalism. Also, two frames most frequently used in the literature are\ndiscussed: Einstein and Jordan frame. Possible applications of the theory\ndeveloped in the first part of the thesis are presented. We show the\nequivalence between $f(R)$ and scalar-tensor theories of gravity and exploit\nthis fact by analysing the former using methods developed for scalar-tensor\ntheories. We conclude the thesis with calculating the Friedmann equations for\nan empty universe of vanishing spatial curvature and preparing set-up for\nanalysing inflationary behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 13:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}
