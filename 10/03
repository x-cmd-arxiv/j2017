DMD can be considered as a\nnumerical approximation to the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear\noperator defined for (nonlinear) dynamical systems. This work proposes a new\ncriterion to estimate the accuracy of DMD on a mode-by-mode basis, by\nestimating how closely each individual DMD eigenfunction approximates the\ncorresponding Koopman eigenfunction. This approach does not require any prior\nknowledge of the system dynamics or the true Koopman spectral decomposition.\nThe method may be applied to extensions of DMD (i.e., extended/kernel DMD),\nwhich are applicable to a wider range of problems. The accuracy criterion is\nfirst validated against the true error with a synthetic system for which the\ntrue Koopman spectral decomposition is known. We next demonstrate how this\nproposed accuracy criterion can be used to assess the performance of various\nchoices of kernel when using the kernel method for extended DMD. Finally, we\nshow that our proposed method successfully identifies modes of high accuracy\nwhen applying DMD to data from experiments in fluids, in particular particle\nimage velocimetry of a cylinder wake and a canonical separated boundary layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 16:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

We discover that participants employ all three processes, but in different\nproportions, depending on the analytical needs in each domain. Our findings\nsuggest that all three sensemaking processes must be integrated in order to\nmake future VQSs useful for a wide range of analytical inquiries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 16:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 02:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 17:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 15:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 03:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 19:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Our results show that\nthe dynamical evolution of the population of wide binary stars with exoplanets\nin the solar neigh- bourhood is modelled by the process of disruption of binary\nstar systems induced by the Galaxy.

In this iterative method, successive pairs of agents bargain over\nthe decision space using the previous decision as a disagreement alternative.\nWe describe the general method and analyze the quality of its outcome when the\nspace of preferences define a median graph.

The exploration is successful if\neach node of the graph is visited before its deadline by a reliable robot. The\nedge weight corresponds to the time needed by a robot to traverse the edge.\nGiven the number of robots which may crash, is it possible to design an\nalgorithm, which will always guarantee the exploration, independently of the\nchoice of the subset of unreliable robots by the adversary? We find the optimal\ntime, during which the graph may be explored. Our approach permits to find the\nmaximal number of robots, which may turn out to be unreliable, and the graph is\nstill guaranteed to be explored.\n  We concentrate on line graphs and rings, for which we give positive results.\nWe start with the case of the collections involving only reliable robots.

We extend our consideration to the case\nwhen some number of robots may be unreliable.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of\nidentifying critical nodes in large-scale networks, with algebraic connectivity\n(the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian) as the chosen metric.\nEmploying a graph-embedding technique, we reduce the class of considered\nweight-balanced graphs to spatial networks with uniformly distributed nodes and\nnearest-neighbors communication topologies. Through a continuum approximation,\nwe consider the Laplace operator on a manifold (with the Neumann boundary\ncondition) as the limiting case of the graph Laplacian. We then reduce the\ncritical node set identification problem to that of finding a ball of fixed\nradius, whose removal minimizes the second (Neumann) eigenvalue of the Laplace\noperator on the residual domain. This leads us to consider two functional and\nnested optimization problems. Resorting to the min-max theorem, we first treat\nthe problem of determining the second smallest eigenvalue for a fixed domain by\nminimizing an energy functional. We then obtain a projected gradient flow that\nconverges to the set of points satisfying the KKT conditions and prove that the\nonly locally asymptotically stable critical point is the second eigenfunction\nof the Laplace operator. Building on these results, we consider the critical\nball identification problem and construct a dynamics to converge asymptotically\nto these points. Finally, we provide a characterization of the location of\ncritical nodes (for infinitesimally-small balls) as those points which belong\nto the nodal set of the second eigenfunction of the Laplace operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 21:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 16:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 23:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism to\ndefend reinforcement learning agents from adversarial attacks by leveraging an\naction-conditioned frame prediction module. Our core idea is that the\nadversarial examples targeting at a neural network-based policy are not\neffective for the frame prediction model. By comparing the action distribution\nproduced by a policy from processing the current observed frame to the action\ndistribution produced by the same policy from processing the predicted frame\nfrom the action-conditioned frame prediction module, we can detect the presence\nof adversarial examples. Beyond detecting the presence of adversarial examples,\nour method allows the agent to continue performing the task using the predicted\nframe when the agent is under attack.

Instabilities can be beneficial since their growth often leads to\nprominent observable signatures which makes them especially relevant to\nrelatively low signal-to-noise ratio measurements such as gravitational wave\ndetections. An indefinitely growing instability usually renders a theory\nunphysical, hence a desirable instability should also come with underlying\nphysical machinery that stops the growth at finite values, i.e. regularization\nmechanisms. The prototypical gravity theory that presents such an instability\nis the spontaneous scalarization phenomena of scalar-tensor theories, which\nfeature a tachyonic instability. We identify the regularization mechanisms in\nthis theory, and show that they can be utilized to regularize other\ninstabilities as well. Namely, we present theories where spontaneous growth is\ntriggered by a ghost rather than a tachyon, and numerically calculate\nstationary solutions of scalarized neutron stars in these theories. We\nspeculate on the possibility of regularizing known divergent instabilities in\ncertain gravity theories using our findings, and discuss alternative theories\nof gravitation where regularized instabilities may be present. Even though we\nstudy many specific examples, our main point is the recognition of regularized\ninstabilities as a common theme and unifying mechanism in a vast array of\ngravity theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 18:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 16:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 14:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Comparing to classical batch-mode clustering, there are two key\nchallenges in stream clustering: (i) Given that input data are changing\ncontinuously, how to incrementally update clustering results efficiently? (ii)\nGiven that clusters continuously evolve with the evolution of data, how to\ncapture the cluster evolution activities? Unfortunately, most of existing\nstream clustering algorithms can neither update the cluster result in real time\nnor track the evolution of clusters.\n  In this paper, we propose an stream clustering algorithm EDMStream by\nexploring the Evolution of Density Mountain. The density mountain is used to\nabstract the data distribution, the changes of which indicate data distribution\nevolution. We track the evolution of clusters by monitoring the changes of\ndensity mountains. We further provide efficient data structures and filtering\nschemes to ensure the update of density mountains in real time, which makes\nonline clustering possible. The experimental results on synthetic and real\ndatasets show that, comparing to the state-of-the-art stream clustering\nalgorithms, e.g., D-Stream, DenStream, DBSTREAM and MR-Stream, our algorithm\ncan response to a cluster update much faster (say 7-15x faster than the best of\nthe competitors) and at the same time achieve comparable cluster quality.\nFurthermore, EDMStream can successfully capture the cluster evolution\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 18:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

For instance, simple but important non-strongly-convex consensus\nproblems have not yet being analyzed, especially concerning the dependency of\nthe convergence rate on the graph topology. Recently, for a non-strongly-convex\nconsensus problem, a connection between distributed ADMM and lifted Markov\nchains was proposed, followed by a conjecture that ADMM is faster than GD by a\nsquare root factor in its convergence time, in close analogy to the mixing\nspeedup achieved by lifting several Markov chains. Nevertheless, a proof of\nsuch a claim is is still lacking. Here we provide a full characterization of\nthe convergence of distributed over-relaxed ADMM for the same type of consensus\nproblem in terms of the topology of the underlying graph. Our results provide\nexplicit formulas for optimal parameter selection in terms of the second\nlargest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of the graph's random walk. Another\nconsequence of our results is a proof of the aforementioned conjecture, which\ninterestingly, we show it is valid for any graph, even the ones whose random\nwalks cannot be accelerated via Markov chain lifting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 20:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The goal of this paper is to test these relations with extreme\nequations of state at supranuclear densities constrained to satisfy only a\nhandful of generic, physically sensible conditions. By requiring that the\nequation of state be (i) barotropic and (ii) its associated speed of sound be\nreal, we construct a piecewise function that matches a tabulated equation of\nstate at low densities, while matching a stiff equation of state parametrized\nby its sound speed in the high-density region. We show that the I-Love-Q\nrelations hold to 1 percent with this class of equations of state, even in the\nextreme case where the speed of sound becomes superluminal and independently of\nthe transition density. We also find further support for the interpretation of\nthe I-Love-Q relations as an emergent symmetry due to the nearly constant\neccentricity of isodensity contours inside the star. These results reinforce\nthe robustness of the I-Love-Q relations against our current incomplete picture\nof physics at supranuclear densities, while strengthening our confidence in the\napplicability of these relations in neutron star astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 21:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

This invariance is independent of the operator basis adopted and\nof the choice of the input parameters. This is verified comparing the results\nobtained in the {$\\hat \\alpha_{em}, \\hat m_Z, \\hat G_F$} input scheme with\nthose of a {$\\hat m_W, \\hat m_Z, \\hat G_F$} scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 06:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The spatial propagation network is a generic framework that\ncan be applied to many affinity-related tasks, including but not limited to\nimage matting, segmentation and colorization, to name a few. Essentially, the\nmodel can learn semantically-aware affinity values for high-level vision tasks\ndue to the powerful learning capability of the deep neural network classifier.\nWe validate the framework on the task of refinement for image segmentation\nboundaries. Experiments on the HELEN face parsing and PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic\nsegmentation tasks show that the spatial propagation network provides a\ngeneral, effective and efficient solution for generating high-quality\nsegmentation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 08:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

NH$_3$ is again detected in very high abundance in O-rich CSEs.\nIts emission mainly arises from localised spatial-kinematic structures that are\nprobably denser than the ambient gas.

Further they are also incapable to consider\ninter-individual variability. A physical description of platelets deposition\nwas introduced recently in Chopard et. al. [2017], by integrating fundamental\nunderstandings of how platelets interact in a numerical model, parameterized by\nfive parameters. These parameters specify the deposition process and are\nrelevant for a biomedical understanding of the phenomena. One of the main\nintuition is that these parameters are precisely the information needed for a\npathological test identifying CVD captured and that they capture the\ninter-individual variability. Following this intuition, here we devise a\nBayesian inferential scheme for estimation of these parameters. As the\nlikelihood function of the numerical model is intractable due to the complex\nstochastic nature of the model, we use a likelihood-free inference scheme\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to calibrate the parameters in a\ndata-driven manner. As ABC requires the generation of many pseudo-data by\nexpensive simulation runs, we use a high performance computing (HPC) framework\nfor ABC to make the inference possible for this model. We illustrate that our\nmean posterior prediction of platelet deposition pattern matches the\nexperimental dataset closely with a tight posterior prediction error margin for\na collective dataset of 7 volunteers.

Using this approach a porous medium is modelled as a\nquenched matrix of hard spheres (HS) or overlapping hard spheres (OHS). A hard\nsphere fluid immersed in a matrix can move in a void between matrix particles.\nA number of approximations were previously proposed within the SPT2 approach.\nAmong these approximations, the SPT2b1 has been considered as the most\nsuccessful and accurate one in a large range of fluid densities and for\ndifferent matrix parameters. However, at high densities, it can lack accuracy,\nsince it does not take into account that the maximum packing fraction of a HS\nfluid in a matrix is limited, not by the geometrical porosity of a matrix\n$\\phi_{0}$ and the probe particle porosity $\\phi$, but by another type of\nporosity $\\phi^{*}$ introduced in our previous studies. The porosity $\\phi^{*}$\nis related to the maximal adsorption capacity of a matrix and it is lower than\n$\\phi_{0}$ and larger than $\\phi$. This can be crucial for a fluid in matrices\nof low porosities and at high fluid density, especially in the region near\nclose-packing conditions. Therefore, the approximations SPT2b2 and SPT2b3\ntaking into account this feature were suggested, although they still needed a\ncorrection because of their poor accuracy. In the present study, we improved\nthe versions of these approximations, named as SPT2b2$^*$ and SPT2b3$^*$. We\ncompare these different approximations with the results of computer simulations\nperformed in the Monte Carlo grand-canonical ensemble.

A\nstriking correspondence is found between the temperature of this boundary and\nthe static Leidenfrost temperature for all pressures. We therefore conclude\nthat both phenomena share the same mechanism, and are dominated by the dynamics\ntaken place at the contact line. On the other hand, the boundary between\ntransition boiling and Leidenfrost boiling, i.e. the dynamic Leidenfrost\ntemperature, increases for increasing impact velocity for all ambient gas\npressures. Moreover, the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature coincides for\npressures between P = 0.13 and P = 0.54 bar, whereas for atmospheric pressure\nthe dynamic Leidenfrost temperature is slightly elevated. This indicates that\nthe dynamic Leidenfrost temperature is at most weakly dependent on the enhanced\nevaporation by the lower saturation temperature of the liquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 12:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

This work is a collection of three studies done\nduring my Ph.D. period. First we present how to use the reweighting technique\nto compensate for the breaking of unitarity due to the use of different\nboundary conditions in the valence and sea sector. In particular when twisted\nboundary conditions are employed, with $\\theta$ twisting angle. In large volume\nwe found that the breaking is negligible, while in rather small volumes an\neffect is present. The quark mass appears to change with $\\theta$ as a cutoff\neffect. In the second part of the dissertation we present an optimization\nmethod for Hybrid Monte Carlo performances. The work is based on the existence\nof a shadow Hamiltonian, an exactly conserved quantity along the Molecular\nDynamics trajectory. The optimization method is economic since it only requires\nthe forces to be measured, which are already used for the evolution from one\nconfiguration to the new one. We found predictions for the cost of the\nsimulations with an accuracy of 10% and we could estimate the optimal\nparameters for the Omelyan integrator with mass-preconditioning and multi\ntime-scale. In the last part of the work we address the calculation of\nelectromagnetic corrections to the hadronic contribution to the $(g-2)$ anomaly\nof the muon. A long standing discrepancy between theoretical calculations and\nexperimental results is present.

The 4th release of the SDSS Moving Object Catalog (SDSSMOC) is\npresently the largest photometric dataset of asteroids. Up to this point, the\nrelease of large asteroid datasets has always been followed by a redefinition\nof asteroid taxonomy. In the years that followed the release of the first\nSDSSMOC, several classification schemes using its data were proposed, all using\nthe taxonomic classes from previous taxonomies. However, no successful attempt\nhas been made to derive a new taxonomic system directly from the SDSS dataset.\nAims. The scope of the work is to propose a different interpretation scheme for\ngauging u0g0r0i0z0 asteroid observations based on the continuity of spectral\nfeatures. The scheme is integrated into previous taxonomic labeling, but is not\ndependent on them. Methods. We analyzed the behavior of asteroid sampling\nthrough principal components analysis to understand the role of uncertainties\nin the SDSSMOC. We identified that asteroids in this space follow two separate\nlinear trends using reflectances in the visible, which is characteristic of\ntheir spectrophotometric features. Results. Introducing taxonomic classes, we\nare able to interpret both trends as representative of featured and featureless\nspectra. The evolution within the trend is connected mainly to the band depth\nfor featured asteroids and to the spectral slope for featureless ones. We\ndefined a different taxonomic system that allowed us to only classify asteroids\nby two labels. Conclusions. We have classified 69% of all SDSSMOC sample, which\nis a robustness higher than reached by previous SDSS classifications.\nFurthermore, as an example, we present the behavior of asteroid (5129) Groom,\nwhose taxonomic labeling changes according to one of the trends owing to phase\nreddening. Now, such behavior can be characterized by the variation of one\nsingle parameter, its position in the trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 14:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

In addition to the anisotropic expansion of\nI-fronts into a filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional\nanisotropic pressure which might favor expansion and propagation of I-fronts to\nform a bipolar bubble. We present results based on near-infrared polarimetric\nobservations towards the central $\\sim$8'$\\times$8' area of the star-forming\nregion RCW57A which hosts an Hii region, a filament, and a bipolar bubble.\nPolarization measurements of 178 reddened background stars, out of the 919\ndetected sources in the JHKs-bands, reveal B-fields that thread perpendicular\nto the filament long axis. The B-fields exhibit an hour-glass morphology that\nclosely follows the structure of the bipolar bubble.

Thermal pressure might\nact in the same orientation as those of B-fields to accelerate the expansion of\nthose I-fronts. The observed morphological correspondence among the B-fields,\nfilament, and bipolar bubble demonstrate that the B-fields are important to the\ncloud contraction that formed the filament, gravitational collapse and star\nformation in it, and in feedback processes. The latter include the formation\nand evolution of mid-infrared bubbles by means of B-field supported propagation\nand expansion of I-fronts.

We\ndevelop a new methodology to automatically fit the abundance radial profiles,\nfinding that 55 galaxies of the sample exhibit a single negative gradient. The\nremaining 47 galaxies also display, as well as this negative trend, either an\ninner drop in the abundances (21), an outer flattening (10) or both (16), which\nsuggests that these features are a common property of disc galaxies. The\npresence and depth of the inner drop depends on the stellar mass of the\ngalaxies with the most massive systems presenting the deepest abundance drops,\nwhile there is no such dependence for the outer flattening. We find that the\ninner drop appears always around $\\rm 0.5\\,r_e$, while the position of the\nouter flattening varies over a wide range of galactocentric distances.\nRegarding the main negative gradient, we find a characteristic slope of\n$\\alpha_{O/H} = -\\,0.10\\pm0.03\\,\\rm{dex}/r_e$.

However, when inner drops\nor outer flattenings are detected, slightly steeper gradients are observed.\nThis suggests that radial motions might play an important role in shaping the\nabundance profiles.

We consider the problem of PIR with\ncolluding servers and eavesdroppers, named T-EPIR. Specifically, any $T$ out of\n$N$ databases may collude, i.e. they may communicate their interactions with\nthe user to guess the identity of the requested message. An eavesdropper is\ncurious to know the database and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing\ntransmissions of any $E$ databases. The databases share some common randomness\nunknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to\ngenerate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about\nthe $K$ messages. Define $R^*$ as the optimal ratio of the number of the\ndesired message information bits to the number of total downloaded bits, and\n$\\rho^*$ to be the optimal ratio of the information bits of the shared common\nrandomness to the information bits of the desired file. In our previous work,\nwe found that when $E \\geq T$, the optimal ratio that can be achieved equals\n$1-\\frac{E}{N}$. In this work, we focus on the case when $E \\leq T$. We derive\nan outer bound $R^* \\leq (1-\\frac{T}{N}) \\frac{1-\\frac{E}{N} \\cdot\n(\\frac{T}{N})^{K-1}}{1-(\\frac{T}{N})^K}$.

For the achievability, we propose a scheme which\nachieves the rate (inner bound)\n$R=\\frac{1-\\frac{T}{N}}{1-(\\frac{T}{N})^K}-\\frac{E}{KN}$. The amount of shared\ncommon randomness used in the achievable scheme is\n$\\frac{\\frac{E}{N}(1-(\\frac{T}{N})^K)}{1-\\frac{T}{N}-\\frac{E}{KN}(1-(\\frac{T}{N})^K)}$\ntimes the file size.

A breakthrough on these correlations\nwas made by Tao, who showed that the correlation average is negligibly small\nwhenever $g_1$ or $g_2$ does not pretend to be any twisted Dirichlet character,\nin the sense of the pretentious distance for multiplicative functions. We\nconsider a wider class of real-valued multiplicative functions $g_j$, namely\nthose that are uniformly distributed in arithmetic progressions to fixed\nmoduli. Under this assumption, we obtain a discorrelation estimate, showing\nthat the correlation of $g_1$ and $g_2$ is asymptotic to the product of their\nmean values. We derive several applications, first showing that the number of\nlarge prime factors of $n$ and $n+1$ are independent of each other with respect\nto the logarithmic density. Secondly, we prove a logarithmic version of the\nconjecture of Erd\\H{o}s and Pomerance on two consecutive smooth numbers.\nThirdly, we show that if $Q$ is cube-free and belongs to the Burgess regime\n$Q\\leq x^{4-\\varepsilon}$, the logarithmic average around $x$ of the real\ncharacter $\\chi \\pmod{Q}$ over the values of a reducible quadratic polynomial\nis small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 14:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 02:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Direct numerical\nsimulations of FENE-P fluid flows are performed in two- and three-dimensional\nchannels. The Reynolds number is set to $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau = 85$ which is\nsub-critical for 2D flows but beyond transition for 3D ones. The polymer\nproperties correspond to those of typical dilute polymer solutions and two\nmoderate Weissenberg numbers, $\\mathrm{Wi}_\\tau = 40, 100$, are considered. The\nsimulation results show that sustained turbulence can be observed in 2D\nsub-critical flows, confirming the existence of a bi-dimensional\nelasto-inertial instability. The same type of instability is also observed in\n3D simulations where both Newtonian and elasto-inertial turbulent structures\nco-exist. Depending on the Wi number, one type of structure can dominate and\ndrive the flow. For large Wi values, the elasto-inertial instability tends to\nprevail over the Newtonian turbulence. This statement is supported by (i) the\nabsence of the typical Newtonian near-wall vortices and (ii) strong\nsimilarities between two- and three-dimensional flows when considering larger\nWi numbers. The role of the small elastic scales is investigated by introducing\nglobal artificial diffusion in the hyperbolic transport equation for polymers.\nThe study results show that the introduction of large polymer diffusion in the\nsystem strongly damps a significant part of the elastic scales that are\nnecessary to feed turbulence, eventually leading to the flow laminarization. A\nsufficiently high Schmidt number is necessary to allow self-sustained\nturbulence to settle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 15:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The peak abundance and distribution of methanol observed\nin TW Hya differed from that predicted by chemical models. Here, the chemistry\nof methanol gas and ice is calculated using a physical model tailored for TW\nHya with the aim to contrast the results with the recent detection in this\nsource. New pathways for the formation of larger complex molecules (e.g.,\nethylene glycol) are included in an updated chemical model, as well as the\nfragmentation of methanol ice upon photodesorption. It is found that including\nfragmentation upon photodesorption improves the agreement between the peak\nabundance reached in the chemical models with that observed in TW Hya ($\\sim\n10^{-11}$ with respect to \\ce{H2}); however, the model predicts that the peak\nin emission resides a factor of $2-3$ farther out in the disk than the ALMA\nimages. Reasons for the persistent differences in the gas-phase methanol\ndistribution between models and the observations of TW Hya are discussed. These\ninclude the location of the ice reservoir which may coincide with the compact\nmm-dust disk ($\\lesssim 60$~au) and sources of gas-phase methanol which have\nnot yet been considered in models. The possibility of detecting larger\nmolecules with ALMA is also explored. Calculations of the rotational spectra of\ncomplex molecules other than methanol using a parametric model constrained by\nthe TW Hya observations suggest that the detection of individual emission lines\nof complex molecules with ALMA remains challenging.

Therefore, different steganography methods have been\nproposed for mp3 hosts. But, current literature has only focused on\nsteganalysis of mp3stego. In this paper we mention some of the limitations of\nmp3stego and argue that UnderMp3Cover (Ump3c) does not have those limitations.\nUmp3c makes subtle changes only to the global gain of bitstream and keeps the\nrest of bitstream intact. Therefore, its detection is much harder than\nmp3stego. To address this, joint distributions between global gain and other\nfields of mp3 bit stream are used. The changes are detected by measuring the\nmutual information from those joint distributions. Furthermore, we show that\ndifferent mp3 encoders have dissimilar performances. Consequently, a novel\nmulti-layer architecture for steganalysis of Ump3c is proposed. In this manner,\nthe first layer detects the encoder and the second layer performs the\nsteganalysis job. One of advantages of this architecture is that feature\nextraction and feature selection can be optimized for each encoder separately.\nWe show this multi-layer architecture outperforms the conventional single-layer\nmethods. Comparing results of the proposed method with other works shows an\nimprovement of 20.4% in the accuracy of steganalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 15:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 03:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The discovery of services in MANET is a\nchallenging job due to the unique properties of network. In this paper, a novel\nservice discovery framework called Hybrid Association Rules Based Network Layer\nDiscovery of Services for Ad hoc Networks (HANDY) has been proposed. HANDY\nprovides three major research contributions. At first, it adopts a cross-layer\noptimized design for discovery of services that is based on simultaneous\ndiscovery of services and corresponding routes. Secondly, it provides a\nmulti-level ontology-based approach to describe the services. This resolves the\nissue of semantic interoperability among the service consumers in a scalable\nfashion. Finally, to further optimize the performance of the discovery process,\nHANDY recommends exploiting the inherent associations present among the\nservices. These associations are used in two ways. First, periodic service\nadvertisements are performed based on these associations. In addition, when a\nresponse of a service discovery request is generated, correlated services are\nalso attached with the response. The proposed service discovery scheme has been\nimplemented in JIST/SWANS simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nmodifications give rise to improvement in hit ratio of the service consumers\nand latency of discovery process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 14:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

In particular, global\nproperties such as the Poisson's ratio or local responses related to\ndeformation can be precisely altered. Tunable mechanical responses would be\nuseful in areas ranging from impact mitigation to robotics and, more generally,\nfor creation of metamaterials with engineered properties. However, experimental\nattempts to create auxetic materials based on pruning-based theoretical ideas\nhave not been successful. Here we introduce a new and more realistic model of\nthe networks, which incorporates angle-bending forces and the appropriate\nexperimental boundary conditions. A sequential pruning strategy of select bonds\nin this model is then devised and implemented that enables engineering of\nspecific mechanical behaviors upon deformation, both in the linear and\nnon-linear regimes. In particular, it is shown that the Poisson's ratio can be\ntuned to arbitrary values. The model and concepts discussed here are validated\nby preparing physical realizations of the networks designed in this manner,\nwhich are produced by laser cutting two-dimensional sheets and are found to\nbehave as predicted. Furthermore, by relying on optimization algorithms, we\nexploit the networks' susceptibility to tuning to design networks that posses a\ndistribution of stiffer and more compliant bonds, and whose auxetic behavior is\neven greater than that of homogeneous networks. Taken together, the findings\nreported here serve to establish that pruned networks represent a promising\nplatform for the creation of novel mechanical metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 21:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We describe the erosion of the material\nsurface, the evolution of its roughness and predict the detachment of the\nmaterial particles. Size distributions of the emitted particles are obtained in\nthis study. The simulation results of the model are in a qualitative agreement\nwith the size histogram of particles produced from the material containing\nlava-like fuel formed during the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 11:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}
