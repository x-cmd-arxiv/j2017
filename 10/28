In this paper we\nexplain why the quadratic estimator will also be suboptimal for measuring\nlensing on very small scales, even for measurements in temperature where this\nestimator typically performs well. Though maximum likelihood methods could be\nimplemented to improve performance, we explore a much simpler solution,\nrevisiting a previously proposed method to measure lensing which involves a\ndirect inversion of the background gradient. An important application of this\nsimple formalism is the measurement of cluster masses with CMB lensing.

While the difference is not relevant for existing surveys,\nfor future surveys it can translate to significant improvements in mass\ncalibration for distant clusters, where galaxy lensing calibration is\nineffective due to the lack of enough resolved background galaxies.\nImprovements can be as large as $\\sim 50\\%$ for a cluster at $z = 2$ and a\nnext-generation CMB experiment with 1$\\mu$K-arcmin noise, and over an order of\nmagnitude for lower noise levels.

Ni, on the other hand, can be\nincorporated at the Li site and/or the Mn site, and the distribution of Ni over\nthe lattice sites can be tuned by tuning the materials preparation conditions.\nThere is a strong interplay between the lattice site preference and charge and\nspin states of the dopant, the electronic structure of the doped material, and\nthe delithiation mechanism. The calculated electronic structure and voltage\nprofile indicate that, in Ni-, Mo-, or Ru-doped Li$_2$MnO$_3$, oxidation occurs\non the electrochemically active transition-metal ion(s) before it does on\noxygen during the delithiation process. The role of the dopants is to provide\ncharge-compensation and bulk electronic conduction mechanisms in the initial\nstages of delithiation, hence enabling the oxidation of the lattice oxygen in\nthe later stages.

Empirically-calibrated methods to measure M\ndwarf metallicity from moderate-resolution spectra are currently limited to\nmeasuring overall metallicity and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations\nin stellar populations.

The high brightness\ntemperatures (>10^{35} K) of FRBs mean that the emission process must be\ncoherent. Two general classes of coherent radiation mechanisms are considered\n--- maser and the antenna mechanism. We use the observed properties of the\nrepeater FRB 121102 to constrain the plasma conditions needed for these two\nmechanisms. We have looked into a wide variety of maser mechanisms operating in\neither vacuum or plasma and find that none of them can explain the high\nluminosity of FRBs without invoking unrealistic or fine-tuned plasma\nconditions. The most favorable mechanism is antenna curvature emission by\ncoherent charge bunches where the burst is powered by magnetic reconnection\nnear the surface of a magnetar (B > 10^{14} G). We show that the plasma in the\ntwisted magnetosphere of a magnetar may be clumpy due to two-stream\ninstability. When magnetic reconnection occurs, the pre-existing density clumps\nmay provide charge bunches for the antenna mechanism to operate.

This\nsystem, when expressed in their normal coordinates, yields a softened\nHenon-Heiles system. By reducing the stiffness of one low-frequency vibrational\nmode, a faster relaxation is enabeled. This is due to a reduction of the energy\nbarrier heights along the softened normal mode as well as for a widening of the\nopening channels of the energy landscape in configurational space. The\nrelaxation is for the most part exponential, and can be explained by a simple\nflux equation. Yet, for some initial conditions the relaxation follows as a\npower law and, and in many cases, there is a regime change from exponential to\npower law decay. We pin point the initial conditions for the power law decay,\nfinding two regions of sticky states. For such states, quasiperiodic orbits are\nfound since almost for all components of the initial momentum orientation, the\nsystem is trapped inside two pockets of configurational space.

The entrainment of particles in the attractive parts of their\nspontaneous flows has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying this\nphenomenon. Here, combining experiments, theory and numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate the validity of this flow-induced ordering mechanism in a\nsuspension of active emulsion droplets. We show that the mechanism can be\ncontrolled, with a variety of resultant ordered structures, by simply altering\nhydrodynamic boundary conditions. Thus, for flow in Hele-Shaw cells, metastable\nlines or stable traveling bands can be obtained by varying the cell height.\nSimilarly, for flow bounded by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a\nno-slip wall the crystallites are characterised by a continuous out-of-plane\nflux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges, thereby\nstabilising them. At an interface where the tangential stress vanishes the\ncrystallites are strictly two-dimensional, with no out-of-plane flux. We\nrationalize these experimental results by calculating, in each case, the slow\nviscous flow produced by the droplets and the dissipative, long-ranged,\nmany-body active forces and torques between them. The results of numerical\nsimulations of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in\nexcellent agreement with experiments.

Measurements at high field\nwere made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a\ndistortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a\nsymmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.\nThe vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic\nsuperconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,\nyielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields.

Experiments in a variety of\ndifferent settings demonstrate GraphWave's real-world potential for capturing\nstructural roles in networks, and our approach outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines in every experiment, by as much as 137%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 20:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 16:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 05:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 17:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

To perform large-scale manipulation tasks for various objects,\na multi-fingered robotic hand sometimes has to sequentially adjust its grasping\ngestures, i.e. the finger gaits, to address the workspace limits and guarantee\nthe object stability. However, realizing finger gaits planning in dexterous\nmanipulation is challenging due to the complicated grasp quality metrics,\nuncertainties on object shapes and dynamics (mass and moment of inertia), and\nunexpected slippage under uncertain contact dynamics. In this paper, a\ndual-stage optimization based planner is proposed to handle these challenges.\nIn the first stage, a velocity-level finger gaits planner is introduced by\ncombining object grasp quality with hand manipulability. The proposed finger\ngaits planner is computationally efficient and realizes finger gaiting without\n3D model of the object. In the second stage, a robust manipulation controller\nusing robust control and force optimization is proposed to address object\ndynamics uncertainties and external disturbances. The dual-stage planner is\nable to guarantee stability under unexpected slippage caused by uncertain\ncontact dynamics.

It is of critical scientific\nimportance to gain a better understanding of early disease mechanisms in the\nbrain to facilitate effective, targeted therapies. The volume of the\nhippocampus is often used in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Measuring\nthis volume via neuroimaging is difficult since each hippocampus must either be\nmanually identified or automatically delineated, a task referred to as\nsegmentation. Automatic hippocampal segmentation often involves mapping a\npreviously manually segmented image to a new brain image and propagating the\nlabels to obtain an estimate of where each hippocampus is located in the new\nimage. A more recent approach to this problem is to propagate labels from\nmultiple manually segmented atlases and combine the results using a process\nknown as label fusion. To date, most label fusion algorithms employ voting\nprocedures with voting weights assigned directly or estimated via optimization.\nWe propose using a fully Bayesian spatial regression model for label fusion\nthat facilitates direct incorporation of covariate information while making\naccessible the entire posterior distribution. Our results suggest that\nincorporating tissue classification (e.g, gray matter) into the label fusion\nprocedure can greatly improve segmentation when relatively homogeneous, healthy\nbrains are used as atlases for diseased brains. The fully Bayesian approach\nalso produces meaningful uncertainty measures about hippocampal volumes,\ninformation which can be leveraged to detect significant, scientifically\nmeaningful differences between healthy and diseased populations, improving the\npotential for early detection and tracking of the disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 22:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 14:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 19:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We calculate the localization length in a precise\nway using the invariant imbedding method. From analytical considerations, we\nprovide an interpretation of the Brewster anomaly as a phenomenon arising when\nthe wave impedance is effectively uniform. Similarly, the ordinary Brewster\neffect is interpreted as an impedance matching phenomenon. We derive the\nexistence condition for the Brewster anomaly and concise analytical expressions\nfor the localization length, which are accurate in the weak disorder regime.

Principal component analysis, as a popular\ndimension reduction method, especially when the number of phenotypes is\nhigh-dimensional, has been proposed to analyze multiple correlated phenotypes.\nIt has been empirically observed that the first PC, which summarizes the\nlargest amount of variance, can be less powerful than higher order PCs and\nother commonly used methods in detecting genetic association signals. In this\npaper, we investigate the properties of PCA-based multiple phenotype analysis\nfrom a geometric perspective by introducing a novel concept called principal\nangle. A particular PC is powerful if its principal angle is $0^o$ and is\npowerless if its principal angle is $90^o$. Without prior knowledge about the\ntrue principal angle, each PC can be powerless. We propose linear, non-linear\nand data-adaptive omnibus tests by combining PCs. We show that the omnibus PC\ntest is robust and powerful in a wide range of scenarios.

To achieve this goal, cellular base\nstations (BSs) can be leveraged to provide a new and promising solution to\nsupport massive UAV communications simultaneously in a cost-effective way.\nHowever, different from terrestrial communication channels, UAV-to-BS channels\nare usually dominated by the light-of-sight (LoS) link, which aggravates the\nco-channel interference and renders the spatial frequency reuse in existing\ncellular networks ineffective. In this paper, we consider the use of a\ndirectional antenna at each UAV to confine the interference to/from other UAV\nusers within a limited region and hence improve the spatial reuse of the\nspectrum. Under this model, a UAV user may be temporarily blocked from\ncommunication if it cannot find any BS in its antenna main-lobe, or it finds\nthat all BSs under its main-lobe are simultaneously covered by those of some\nother UAVs and hence suffer from strong co-channel interference. Assuming\nindependent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs) for the UAVs' and\nground BSs' locations respectively, we first analytically derive a closed-form\nupper bound for the UAV blocking probability and then characterize the\nachievable average spatial throughput of the cellular-enabled UAV communication\nnetwork, in terms of various key parameters including the BS/UAV densities as\nwell as the UAV's flying altitude and antenna beamwidth.

For the adaptivity\nprocedure, we consider the residual-based error estimates for the underlying\ndifferential equations of the two-phase system. In particular, the adaptive\nrefinement/coarsening is carried out by the newest vertex bisection algorithm\nby evaluating the residual error indicators based on the error estimates of the\nAllen-Cahn equation.

In this work we discuss how the\nbehaviour of the model at high energy scales causes it to have a scalar with\nproperties very similar to those of the SM -- which means the 2HDM can be seen\nto naturally favor a decoupling or alignment limit. For a type II 2HDM, we show\nthat requiring the model to be theoretically valid up to a scale of 1 TeV, by\nstudying the renormalization group equations (RGE) of the parameters of the\nmodel, causes a significant reduction in the allowed magnitude of the quartic\ncouplings. This, combined with $B$-physics bounds, forces the model to be\nnaturally decoupled. As a consequence, any non-decoupling limits in type II,\nlike the wrong-sign scenario, are excluded. On the contrary, even with the very\nconstraining limits for the Higgs couplings from the LHC, the type I model can\ndeviate substantially from alignment. An RGE analysis similar to that made for\ntype II shows, however, that requiring a single scalar to be heavier than about\n500 GeV would be sufficient for the model to be decoupled. Finally, we show\nthat not only a 2HDM where the lightest of the CP-even scalars is the 125 GeV\none does not require new physics to be stable up to the Planck scale but this\nis also true when the heavy CP-even Higgs is the 125 GeV and the theory has no\ndecoupling limit for the type I model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2017 07:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2017 12:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

However, these so-called SAT attacks\nhave so far targeted only camouflaged combinational circuits.

Different experimental probes have led to vastly disparate\nconclusions on the temperature range of superconducting fluctuations. The main\nchallenges have been to separate the SC response from complex normal-state\nbehavior, and to distinguish the underlying behavior of the quintessential\nCuO$_{2}$ layers from compound-specific properties. Here we reveal remarkably\nsimple and universal behavior of the SC precursor using torque magnetometry, a\nunique thermodynamic probe with extremely high sensitivity to SC diamagnetism.\nWe comprehensively study four distinct cuprate compounds:\nsingle-CuO$_{2}$-layer La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO),\nBi$_{2}$(Sr,La)$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ (Bi2201) and HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$\n(Hg1201), and double-layer\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{0.95}$Y$_{0.05}$CuO$_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi2212). Our approach,\nwhich focuses on the nonlinear diamagnetic response, completely removes\nnormal-state contributions and thus allows us to trace the diamagnetic signal\nabove Tc with great precision. We find that SC diamagnetism vanishes in an\nunusual, yet surprisingly simple exponential manner, marked by a universal\ntemperature scale that is independent of compound and Tc. We discuss the\ndistinct possibility that this unusual behavior signifies the proliferation of\nSC clusters as a result of the intrinsic inhomogeneity known to be an inherent\nproperty of the cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 16:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Feasibility of the method with complex and magnitude images\nis demonstrated with a series of patient studies and accuracy of predicted\nquantitative values is analyzed.\n  Methods: Water-fat separation of 1200 gradient-echo acquisitions from 90\nimaging sessions (normal, acute and chronic myocardial infarction) was\nperformed using a conventional model based method with modeling of R2* and\noff-resonance and a multi-peak fat spectrum. A U-Net convolutional neural\nnetwork for calculation of water-only, fat-only, R2* and off-resonance images\nwas trained with 900 gradient-echo Multiple and single-echo complex and\nmagnitude input data algorithms were studied and compared to conventional\nextended echo modeling.\n  Results: The U-Net ConvNet was easily trained and provided water-fat\nseparation results visually comparable to conventional methods. Myocardial fat\ndeposition in chronic myocardial infarction and intramyocardial hemorrhage in\nacute myocardial infarction were well visualized in the DL results. Predicted\nvalues for R2*, off-resonance, water and fat signal intensities were well\ncorrelated with conventional model based water fat separation (R2>=0.97,\np<0.001). DL images had a 14% higher signal-to-noise ratio (p<0.001) when\ncompared to the conventional method.\n  Conclusion: Deep learning utilizing ConvNets is a feasible method for MR\nwater-fat separationimaging with complex, magnitude and single echo image data.\nA trained U-Net can be efficiently used for MR water-fat separation, providing\nresults comparable to conventional model based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 17:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

Recent works have looked at multi-task learning (MTL) to mitigate\ndata scarcity by leveraging domain-specific information from related tasks. In\nthis paper, we present a novel soft-parameter sharing mechanism for CNNs in a\nMTL setting, which we refer to as Deep Collaboration. We propose taking into\naccount the notion that task relevance depends on depth by using lateral\ntransformation blocs with skip connections. This allows extracting\ntask-specific features at various depth without sacrificing features relevant\nto all tasks. We show that CNNs connected with our Deep Collaboration obtain\nbetter accuracy on facial landmark detection with related tasks. We finally\nverify that our approach effectively allows knowledge sharing by showing\ndepth-specific influence of tasks that we know are related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2017 03:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}
