We hypothesized that this is reflected in regionally different outflow\nstructures and analyzed the entire limbus by high-resolution, full-thickness\nribbon-scanning confocal microscopy (RSCM). Methods: We perfused pig eyes by\nanterior chamber cannulation with eight lectin-fluorophore conjugates, followed\nby optical clearance with benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB). RSCM and an\nadvanced analysis software (Imaris) were used to reconstruct a\nthree-dimensional, whole-specimen rendering of the perilimbal outflow\nstructures. We performed morphometric analyses of the outflow tract from the\nlevel of the trabecular meshwork (TM) to the scleral vascular plexus (SVP).\nResults: Except for pigmented structures, BABB cleared the entire eye.\nRhodamine-conjugated Glycine max agglutinin (soybean, SBA) labeled the outflow\ntract evenly and retained fluorescence for months. RSCM produced terabyte-sized\nfiles allowing for in silico dissection of outflow tract vessel at a high\nresolution and in 3D. Networks of interconnected lumina were traced from the TM\nto downstream drainage structures. The collector channel (CC) volumes were ten\ntimes smaller than the receiving SVP vessels, the largest of which were in the\ninferior limbus.

First, sufficient\nconditions on the model parameters are provided under which the optimal policy\nfor the fusion center has a threshold structure. The optimal policy is\ndetermined in closed form, and is such that it switches between two exactly\nspecified incentive policies at the threshold. Second, it is shown that the\noptimal incentive sequence is a sub-martingale, i.e, the optimal incentives\nincrease on average over time. Third, it is shown that it is possible for the\nfusion center to learn the true state asymptotically by employing a sub-optimal\npolicy; in other words, controlled information fusion with social sensors can\nbe consistent. Fourth, uniform bounds on the average additional cost incurred\nby the fusion center for employing a sub-optimal policy are provided. This\ncharacterizes the trade-off between the cost of information acquisition and\nconsistency for the fusion center. Finally, when it is sufficient to estimate\nthe state with a degree of confidence, uniform bounds on the budget saved by\nemploying policies that guarantee state estimation in finite time are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 01:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 15:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation\nitself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions\nis extremely fragile in the following sense: two perceptively indistinguishable\ninputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different\ninterpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of several\nwidely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, relevance\npropagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that\neven small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new\nsystematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations\nwithout changing the label. We extend these results to show that\ninterpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly\nfragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on\nwhy fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 01:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 05:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Here we show\nthat changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios\n(Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking\nmodel nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on\nstimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle\ntemporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid\nanesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing\ntrial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia,\nwithin-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time\nscales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In\ncontrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely\nsub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by\nfiring rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability\ntuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability\nbetween states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the\ndistribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain\nfluctuations in the alert state.

We find that in most cases, the special Rademacher\nsummability property present for monstrous and umbral moonshine does not hold\nfor the other extremal CFTs, with the exception of the Conway module and two\n$c=12, ~\\mathcal N=4$ superconformal theories with $M_{11}$ and $M_{22}$\nsymmetry. This suggests that the connection between extremal CFT, sporadic\ngroups, and mock modular forms transcends strict Rademacher summability\ncriteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 04:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

The motivation is that a robust training process for deep\nlearning models depends on large annotated datasets, which are expensive to be\nacquired, stored and processed. Therefore a reasonable alternative is to be\nable to automatically generate new annotated training samples using a process\nknown as data augmentation. The dominant data augmentation approach in the\nfield assumes that new training samples can be obtained via random geometric or\nappearance transformations applied to annotated training samples, but this is a\nstrong assumption because it is unclear if this is a reliable generative model\nfor producing new training samples. In this paper, we provide a novel Bayesian\nformulation to data augmentation, where new annotated training points are\ntreated as missing variables and generated based on the distribution learned\nfrom the training set. For learning, we introduce a theoretically sound\nalgorithm --- generalised Monte Carlo expectation maximisation, and demonstrate\none possible implementation via an extension of the Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN).

By contrast, the USS allows MBS and SBS to\nsimultaneously transmit over the shared spectrum with the aid of power control\nfor limiting their mutual interference, thus called interference-limited USS\n(IL-USS). In order to take advantage of mutual interference in confusing the\neavesdropper without causing adverse effect on the MU, we propose an\ninterference-canceled USS (IC-USS) scheme. Closed-form expressions of overall\noutage probability and intercept probability are derived for OSS, IL-USS and\nIC-USS schemes by taking into account both MBS-MU and SBS-SU transmissions. The\nsecrecy diversity analysis is also carried out by characterizing an asymptotic\nbehavior of the overall outage probability with a given intercept probability\nin the high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is shown that the secrecy\ndiversity gains of conventional OSS and IL-USS are zero, whereas the proposed\nIC-USS achieves a higher secrecy diversity gain of one. This implies that with\nan arbitrarily low overall intercept probability, the conventional OSS and\nIL-USS methods converge to their respective outage probability floors, however\nthe proposed IC-USS scheme can make the overall outage probability\nasymptotically decrease to zero by simply increasing the transmit power.\nAdditionally, numerical results demonstrate an obvious advantage of the\nproposed IC-USS over OSS and IL-USS against eavesdropping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 09:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 01:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 08:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 06:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Our concern\nhere is to lay the foundation for a theory that, we believe, will lead to such\na proof- and to further applications. Let p be a prime number. Let k be a\nperfect field of characteristic p. Let m be a positive integer. Our first goal\nis to provide a canonical process for \"lifting\" a module M, over the ring of\nWitt vectors $W_m(k)$ (of length m), to a $W_{m+1}(k)$-module, in a way that\ndeeply respects Pontryagin duality. These are our big, medium and small Omega\npowers, each of which naturally occurs as a direct factor of the previous one.\nIn the case where M is a k-vector space, they come equipped with Verschiebung\nand Frobenius operations. If moreover the field k is finite, Omega powers are\nendowed with a striking extra operation: the Transfer, to shifted Omega powers\nof finite-codimensional linear subspaces. To show how this formalism fits into\nGalois theory, we first offer an axiomatized approach to Hilbert's Theorem 90\n(or more precisely, to its consequence for cohomology with finite coefficients:\nKummer theory). In the context of profinite group cohomology, we thus define\nthe notions a cyclotomic G-module, and of a smooth profinite group. We bear in\nmind that the fundamental example is that of an absolute Galois group, together\nwith the Tate module of roots of unity. We then define the notion of exact\nsequences of G-modules of Kummer type. To finish, we give applications of this\nformalism. The first ones are the Stable Lifting Theorems, enabling the lifting\nto higher torsion in the cohomology of smooth profinite groups, with p-primary\ncoefficients. We finish by an application to p-adic deformations. We state and\nprove a general descent statement, for the quotient map\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 15:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

To develop\nimage/visual-captioning-based CAPTCHAs, this paper proposes a new image\ncaptioning architecture by exploiting tensor product representations (TPR), a\nstructured neural-symbolic framework developed in cognitive science over the\npast 20 years, with the aim of integrating DL with explicit language structures\nand rules. We call it the Tensor Product Generation Network (TPGN). The key\nideas of TPGN are: 1) unsupervised learning of role-unbinding vectors of words\nvia a TPR-based deep neural network, and 2) integration of TPR with typical DL\narchitectures including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The novelty of\nour approach lies in its ability to generate a sentence and extract partial\ngrammatical structure of the sentence by using role-unbinding vectors, which\nare obtained in an unsupervised manner.

The transition towards this phase in the cosmic evolution history is\ndiscussed in detail and, moreover, a complete classification of the future\nfinite-time singularities is obtained for six different possible forms of the\nnon-gravitational interaction between dark energy (the van der Waals fluid) and\ndark matter. This study shows, in particular, that a universe with a\nnon-interacting three-parameter van der Waals fluid can evolve into a universe\ncharacterized by a Type IV~(Generalized Sudden) Singularity. On the other hand,\nfor certain values of the parameters, exit from the accelerated expanding phase\nis possible in the near future, what means that the expansion of the universe\nin the future could become decelerated. On the other hand, our study shows that\nspace can be divided into different regions. For some of them, in particular,\nthe non-gravitational interactions $Q = 3 H b \\rho_{de}$, $Q = 3 H b \\rho_{dm}$\nand $Q = 3 H b (\\rho_{de} + \\rho_{de})$ may completely suppress future\nfinite-time singularity formation, for sufficiently high values of $b$. On the\nother hand, for some other regions of the parameter space, the mentioned\ninteractions would not affect the singularity type, namely the Type IV\nsingularity generated in the case of the non-interacting model would be\npreserved. A similar conclusion has been archived for the cases of $Q = 3 b H\n\\rho_{de}\\rho_{dm}/(\\rho_{de}+\\rho_{dm})$, $Q = 3 b H\n\\rho_{dm}^{2}/(\\rho_{de}+\\rho_{dm})$ and $Q = 3 b H\n\\rho_{de}^{2}/(\\rho_{de}+\\rho_{dm})$ non-gravitational interactions, with only\none difference: the $Q = 3 b H \\rho_{dm}^{2}/(\\rho_{de}+\\rho_{dm})$ interaction\nwill change the Type IV singularity of the non-interacting model into a Type\nII~(The Sudden) singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 08:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}
