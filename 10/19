The remaining non-thermal broadening is significant\n(5-30 km/s) and correlated with the intensity. Here we study spectra of the TR\nSi IV 1403 Angstrom line obtained at high resolution with the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS). We find that the large improvement in spatial\nresolution (0.33 arcsec) of IRIS compared to previous spectrographs (2 arcsec)\ndoes not resolve the non-thermal line broadening which in most regions remains\nat pre-IRIS levels of about 20 km/s. This invariance to spatial resolution\nindicates that the processes behind the broadening occur along the\nline-of-sight (LOS) and/or on spatial scales (perpendicular to the LOS) smaller\nthan 250 km. Both effects appear to play a role. Comparison with IRIS\nchromospheric observations shows that, in regions where the LOS is more\nparallel to the field, magneto-acoustic shocks driven from below impact the TR\nand can lead to significant non-thermal line broadening. This scenario is\nsupported by MHD simulations. While these do not show enough non-thermal line\nbroadening, they do reproduce the long-known puzzling correlation between\nnon-thermal line broadening and intensity. This correlation is caused by the\nshocks, but only if non-equilibrium ionization is taken into account. In\nregions where the LOS is more perpendicular to the field, the prevalence of\nsmall-scale twist is likely to play a significant role in explaining the\ninvariance and correlation with intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 16:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

The cluster-centric radius at which this process occurs, r_sp, defines a\nhalo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster. A rapid decline\nin the halo profile is expected near r_sp. We measure the galaxy number density\nand weak lensing mass profiles around redMaPPer galaxy clusters in the first\nyear Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean M_200m mass\n~2.5 x 10^14 M_sun, we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of\nthe galaxy density profile and measure r_sp=1.13 +/- 0.07 Mpc/h, consistent\nwith earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017).\nMoreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the\nexistence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy\nclusters. We measure r_sp=1.34 +/- 0.21 Mpc/h from the weak lensing data, in\ngood agreement with our galaxy density measurements. For different cluster and\ngalaxy samples, we find that consistent with LCDM simulations, r_sp scales with\nR_200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6.\nWe also find that potential systematic effects associated with the redMaPPer\nalgorithm may impact the location of r_sp. We discuss progress needed to\nunderstand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from\nDES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock\ncatalogs and independent cluster samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 16:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 13:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Increasing stiffness\nleads to bigger and less deformable domains.

This unique property is achieved by mapping the light field onto\nspin orientation within a decoherence-free subspace of spin states. We report\non a record storage time of 1 second in cesium vapor, a 100-fold improvement\nover existing storage schemes. Furthermore, our scheme lays the foundations for\nhour-long quantum memories using rare-gas nuclear spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 17:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 14:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

Both models have\nbeen proposed as scenarios for reconciling a disc origin of the MW bulge with a\nnegative vertical metallicity gradient. The first model is a superposition of\nco-spatial, i.e. overlapping, disc populations with different scaleheights,\nkinematics and metallicities. In this model the thick, metal-poor, and\ncentrally concentrated disc populations contribute significantly to the stellar\nmass budget in the inner galaxy. The second model is a single disc with an\ninitial steep radial metallicity gradient, which is mapped by the bar into the\nb/p bulge in such a way that the vertical metallicity gradient of the MW bulge\nis reproduced -- as shown already in previous works in the literature. However,\nas we show here, the latter model does not reproduce the positive longitudinal\nmetallicity gradient of the inner disc, nor the metal-poor innermost regions of\nthe Bulge seen in the data. On the other hand, the model with co-spatial thin\nand thick disc populations reproduces all the aforementioned trends. We\ntherefore see that it is possible to reconcile a (primarily) disc origin for\nthe MW bulge with the observed trends in metallicity by mapping the inner thin\nand thick discs of the MW into a b/p. For this scenario to reproduce the\nobservations, the $\\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor, thick disc populations must\nhave a significant mass contribution in the inner regions -- as has been\nsuggested for the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 14:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

We take a different approach by foregrounding the\nways that ethics are implicated in the day-to-day work of data science,\nfocusing on instances in which data scientists recognize, grapple with, and\nconscientiously respond to ethical challenges. This paper presents a case study\nof ethical dilemmas that arose in a \"data science for social good\" (DSSG)\nproject focused on improving navigation for people with limited mobility. We\ndescribe how this particular DSSG team responded to those dilemmas, and how\nthose responses gave rise to still more dilemmas. While the details of the case\ndiscussed here are unique, the ethical dilemmas they illuminate can commonly be\nfound across many DSSG projects. These include: the risk of exacerbating\ndisparities; the thorniness of algorithmic accountability; the evolving\nopportunities for mischief presented by new technologies; the subjective and\nvalue- laden interpretations at the heart of any data-intensive project; the\npotential for data to amplify or mute particular voices; the possibility of\nprivacy violations; and the folly of technological solutionism. Based on our\ntracing of the team's responses to these dilemmas, we distill lessons for an\nethical data science practice that can be more generally applied across DSSG\nprojects. Specifically, this case experience highlights the importance of: 1)\nSetting the scene early on for ethical thinking 2) Recognizing ethical\ndecision-making as an emergent phenomenon intertwined with the quotidian work\nof data science for social good 3) Approaching ethical thinking as a thoughtful\nand intentional balancing of priorities rather than a binary differentiation\nbetween right and wrong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 18:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

This suggests that \"long-term\"\nshelter residents and those that re-enter shelters contribute significantly to\nthe rise of the homeless population living in city shelters and indicate\nsystemic challenges to finding adequate permanent housing. Women in Need (Win)\nis a non-profit agency that provides shelter to almost 10,000 homeless women\nand children (10% of all homeless families of NYC), and is the largest homeless\nshelter provider in the City. This paper focuses on our preliminary work with\nWin to understand the factors that affect the rate of readmission of homeless\nfamilies at Win shelters, and to predict the likelihood of re-entry into the\nshelter system on exit. These insights will enable improved service delivery\nand operational efficiencies at these shelters.

We identified four distinct parameter domains $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ for\nwhich the pair of critical points engenders distinct features in the dynamics.\nIn the domain $A$ the dynamics consists basically of periodic bouncing orbits,\nor oscillatory orbits with a finite number of bounces. The center with\nmultiplicity two engenders in its neighborhood the topology of stable and\nunstable cylinders $R \\times S^3$ of orbits. We show that the stable and\nunstable cylinders coalesce realizing a smooth homoclinic connection to the\ncenter manifold, a rare event of regular/non-chaotic dynamics in bouncing\nBianchi IX cosmologies. The presence of a saddle of multiplicity two in the\ndomain $B$ engenders a high instability in the dynamics so that the cylinders\nemerging from the center manifold towards the bounce have four distinct\nattractors: the center manifold itself, the de Sitter attractor at infinity and\ntwo further momentum-dominated attractors with infinite anisotropy.

Synchronous algorithms like\nAllReduce-SGD perform poorly in a heterogeneous environment, while asynchronous\nalgorithms using a parameter server suffer from 1) communication bottleneck at\nparameter servers when workers are many, and 2) significantly worse convergence\nwhen the traffic to parameter server is congested. Can we design an algorithm\nthat is robust in a heterogeneous environment, while being communication\nefficient and maintaining the best-possible convergence rate? In this paper, we\npropose an asynchronous decentralized stochastic gradient decent algorithm\n(AD-PSGD) satisfying all above expectations.

For example, the query-independent layout (i.e., raw\npage layout) can help identify the page quality, while the query-dependent\nlayout (i.e., page rendered with matched query words) can further tell rich\nstructural information (e.g., size, position and proximity) of the matching\nsignals.

Yet, synthesis of color centers that act as single\nphoton emitters which are suitable for on-chip applications is still beyond\nreach. Here, we report a number of plasma and thermal annealing methods for the\nfabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\ncrystals. A two-step process comprised of Ar plasma etching and subsequent\nannealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields a seven-fold increase in the\nconcentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma etching step generates\nemitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process\nyields emitters that are photostable at room temperature and have an emission\nenergy distribution that is red-shifted relative to that of pristine hBN. An\nanalysis of emitters fabricated by a range of plasma and annealing treatments,\ncombined with a theoretical investigation of point defects in hBN indicates\nthat single photon emitters characterized by a high degree of photostability\nand emission wavelengths greater than ~700 nm are associated with defect\ncomplexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating the\nemitters by annealing hBN in an oxidative atmosphere.

Many of the theoretical models to\nexplain the cosmic acceleration assume modifications to Einsteinian General\nRelativity which accelerate the expansion, but the question of whether such\nmodifications also affect the ability of SNIe to be standardisable candles has\nrarely been addressed. This paper is an attempt to answer this question. For\nthis we adopt a semi-analytical model to calculate SNIe light curves in\nnon-standard gravity. We use this model to show that the average rescaled\nintrinsic peak luminosity -- a quantity that is assumed to be constant with\nredshift in standard analyses of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) cosmology data --\ndepends on the strength of gravity in the supernova's local environment because\nthe latter determines the Chandrasekhar mass -- the mass of the SNIa's white\ndwarf progenitor right before the explosion. This means that SNIe are no longer\nstandardisable candles in scenarios where the strength of gravity evolves over\ntime, and therefore the cosmology implied by the existing SNIa data will be\ndifferent when analysed in the context of such models.

As a feedback of user's taste, rating scores can directly reflect the\npreference of a given user to a given product. Uncovering the latent components\nof user ratings is thus of significant importance for learning user interests.\nIn this paper, a new recommendation approach, called LCR, was proposed by\ninvestigating the latent components of user ratings. The basic idea is to\ndecompose an existing rating into several components via a cost-sensitive\nlearning strategy. Specifically, each rating is assigned to several latent\nfactor models and each model is updated according to its predictive errors.\nAfterwards, these accumulated predictive errors of models are utilized to\ndecompose a rating into several components, each of which is treated as an\nindependent part to retrain the latent factor models. Finally, all latent\nfactor models are combined linearly to estimate predictive ratings for users.\nIn contrast to existing methods, LCR provides an intuitive preference modeling\nstrategy via multiple component analysis at an individual perspective.\nMeanwhile, it is verified by the experimental results on several benchmark\ndatasets that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-art methods in\nterms of recommendation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 10:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

Quarks are massive and described by the Fermi-Dirac statistics, while\ngluons are massless and obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The conservation laws\nfor the baryon number, energy, and momentum lead to two Landau matching\nconditions which specify the coupling between the quark and gluon sectors and\ndetermine the proper-time dependence of the effective temperature and baryon\nchemical potential of the system. The numerical results illustrate how a\nnon-equlibrium mixture of quarks and gluons approaches hydrodynamic regime\ndescribed by the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate forms of the kinetic\ncoefficients. The shear viscosity of a mixture is the sum of the shear\nviscosities of quark and gluon components, while the bulk viscosity is given by\nthe formula known for a gas of quarks, however, with the thermodynamic\nvariables characterising the mixture. Thus, we find that massless gluons\ncontribute in a non-trivial way to the bulk viscosity of a mixture, provided\nquarks are massive. We further observe the hydrodynamization effect which takes\nplace earlier in the shear sector than in the bulk one. The numerical studies\nof the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse pressures show, to a good\napproximation, that it depends on the ratio of the relaxation and proper times\nonly.

However, many important learning problems demand an ability to\ndraw valid inferences from small size datasets, and such problems pose a\nparticular challenge for deep learning. In this regard, various researches on\n\"meta-learning\" are being actively conducted. Recent work has suggested a\nMemory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) for meta-learning. MANN is an\nimplementation of a Neural Turing Machine (NTM) with the ability to rapidly\nassimilate new data in its memory, and use this data to make accurate\npredictions. In models such as MANN, the input data samples and their\nappropriate labels from previous step are bound together in the same memory\nlocations. This often leads to memory interference when performing a task as\nthese models have to retrieve a feature of an input from a certain memory\nlocation and read only the label information bound to that location. In this\npaper, we tried to address this issue by presenting a more robust MANN. We\nrevisited the idea of meta-learning and proposed a new memory augmented neural\nnetwork by explicitly splitting the external memory into feature and label\nmemories. The feature memory is used to store the features of input data\nsamples and the label memory stores their labels. Hence, when predicting the\nlabel of a given input, our model uses its feature memory unit as a reference\nto extract the stored feature of the input, and based on that feature, it\nretrieves the label information of the input from the label memory unit. In\norder for the network to function in this framework, a new memory-writingmodule\nto encode label information into the label memory in accordance with the\nmeta-learning task structure is designed. Here, we demonstrate that our model\noutperforms MANN by a large margin in supervised one-shot classification tasks\nusing Omniglot and MNIST datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

In this work, we build on recent theoretical results on the\ngeneralization performance of supervised manifold learning algorithms.\nMotivated by these performance bounds, we propose a supervised manifold\nlearning method that computes a nonlinear embedding while constructing a smooth\nand regular interpolation function that extends the embedding to the whole data\nspace in order to achieve satisfactory generalization. The embedding and the\ninterpolator are jointly learnt such that the Lipschitz regularity of the\ninterpolator is imposed while ensuring the separation between different\nclasses.

Symmetry-preserving methods are such that the\ndiscretized form of the continuous differential operator exhibits the same\nproperties as the continuous operator itself. The use of symmetry-preserving\ndiscretizations makes it possible to construct discrete models which allow all\nthe manipulations needed to prove stability and (discrete) conservation\nproperties in the same way they were proven in the original continuous model.\nFurthermore, these methods allow a discretization of the continuous adjoint\nwhich is at the same time the discrete adjoint of the discrete forward model.\nSuch adjoint models are not harder to code than the discrete forward model.\n  This paper presents a new symmetry-preserving discretization of arbitrary\norder on curvilinear structured grids.

At 25 degrees C, exposures leading to an accumulated\ndose of up to 600 kGy result in complex dose-dependent drift in Bragg\nwavelength, significantly increasing the uncertainty in temperature\nmeasurements obtained if appreciable dose is delivered over the measurement\ninterval. We note that temperature sensitivity is not severely impacted by the\nintegrated dose, suggesting such devices could be used to measure relative\nchanges in temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 15:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

Therefore, a bug in a distributed protocol may have tremendous\neffects. Accordingly, a lot of effort has been invested in verifying such\nprotocols. However, checking invariants of such protocols is undecidable and\nhard in practice, as it requires reasoning about an unbounded number of nodes\nand messages. Moreover, protocol actions and invariants involve both quantifier\nalternations and higher-order concepts such as set cardinalities and\narithmetic.\n  This paper makes a step towards automatic verification of such protocols. We\naim at a technique that can verify correct protocols and identify bugs in\nincorrect protocols. To this end, we develop a methodology for deductive\nverification based on effectively propositional logic (EPR)---a decidable\nfragment of first-order logic (also known as the Bernays-Sch\\\"onfinkel-Ramsey\nclass). In addition to decidability, EPR also enjoys the finite model property,\nallowing to display violations as finite structures which are intuitive for\nusers. Our methodology involves modeling protocols using general\n(uninterpreted) first-order logic, and then systematically transforming the\nmodel to obtain a model and an inductive invariant that are decidable to check.\nThe steps of the transformations are also mechanically checked, ensuring the\nsoundness of the method. We have used our methodology to verify the safety of\nPaxos, and several of its variants, including Multi-Paxos, Vertical Paxos, Fast\nPaxos, Flexible Paxos and Stoppable Paxos. To the best of our knowledge, this\nwork is the first to verify these protocols using a decidable logic, and the\nfirst formal verification of Vertical Paxos, Fast Paxos and Stoppable Paxos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 15:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

First, the\nmajority of GWAS hits are in the non-coding region and their biological\ninterpretation is still unclear. Second, accumulating evidence from GWAS\nsuggests the polygenicity of complex traits, i.e., a complex trait is often\naffected by many variants with small or moderate effects, whereas a large\nproportion of risk variants with small effects remains unknown. The\navailability of functional annotation data enables us to address the above\nchallenges.

Recent tight-binding orbital models\nfor spin transport in DNA-like molecules, have surmised that the band\nspin-orbit coupling arises from the particular angular relations between\norbitals of neighboring bases on the helical chain. Such arrangement could be\nprobed by inducing deformations in the molecule in a conductive probe AFM type\nsetup, as it was recently reported by Kiran, Cohen and Naaman\\cite{Kiran}. Here\nwe report deformation dependent spin selectivity when a double strand DNA model\nis compressed or stretched. We find that the equilibrium geometry is not\noptimal with respect to the SO coupling strength and thus spin selectivity can\nbe tuned by deformations. The latter can be increased by stretching the helical\nstructure taking into account its elastic properties through the Poisson ratio.\nThe spin filtering gap is also found to be tunable with uniaxial deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 15:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}
