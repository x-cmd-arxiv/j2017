Motivated by\nseveral recent works that extend photometric stereo to more general objects and\nlighting conditions, we study a new robust approach to photometric stereo that\nutilizes dictionary learning. Specifically, we propose and analyze two\napproaches to adaptive dictionary regularization for the photometric stereo\nproblem. First, we propose an image preprocessing step that utilizes an\nadaptive dictionary learning model to remove noise and other non-idealities\nfrom the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. We also propose an\nalternative model where we directly apply the adaptive dictionary\nregularization to the normal vectors themselves during estimation. We study the\npractical performance of both methods through extensive simulations, which\ndemonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of both methods in the presence of\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 17:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

While most of\nthe previous works focused on the determination of magnon diffusion length by\nvarious techniques, herein we demonstrated how to tune magnon diffusion by\nlight excitation. We found that the diffusion length of thermal magnons is\nstrongly dependent on light wavelength when the magnon is generated by exposing\nYIG directly to laser beam. The diffusion length, determined by a nonlocal\ngeometry at room temperature, is ~30 um for the magnons produced by visible\nlight (400-650 nm), and ~136-156 um for the laser between 808 nm and 980 nm.\nThe diffusion distance is much longer than the reported value. In addition to\nthermal gradient, we found that light illumination affected the electron\nconfiguration of the Fe3+ ion in YIG. Long wavelength laser triggers a high\nspin to low spin state transition of the Fe3+ ions in FeO6 octahedron.

There is a\nliterature that studies the complexity of template functions.\n  The present work is concerned with relating template functions to the\nproblems of counting, with respect to various fixed templates, the number of\ntwo particular types of homomorphisms: surjective homomorphisms and what we\nterm condensations.\n  In this article, we explain how any problem of counting surjective\nhomomorphisms to a fixed template is polynomial-time equivalent to computing a\nlinear combination of template functions; we also show this for any problem of\ncounting condensations to a fixed template. Via a theorem that characterizes\nthe complexity of computing such a linear combination, we show how a known\ndichotomy for template functions can be used to infer a dichotomy for counting\nsurjective homomorphisms on fixed templates, and likewise a dichotomy for\ncounting condensations on fixed templates. Our study is strongly inspired by,\nbased on, and can be viewed as a dual of the graph motif framework of\nCurticapean, Dell, and Marx (STOC 2017); that framework is in turn based on\nwork of Lov\\'asz (2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 17:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

Kinodynamic motion planners\nequipped with a dynamic engine acting as state propagator are usually used for\nthat purpose. The difficulties arise in the setting of the adequate forces for\nthe interactions and because these interactions may change the pose of the\nmanipulatable obstacles, thus either facilitating or preventing the finding of\na solution path. The use of knowledge can alleviate the stated difficulties.\nThis paper proposes the use of an enhanced state propagator composed of a\ndynamic engine and a low-level geometric reasoning process that is used to\ndetermine how to interact with the objects, i.e. from where and with which\nforces. The proposal, called \\k{appa}-PMP can be used with any kinodynamic\nplanner, thus giving rise to e.g. \\k{appa}-RRT. The approach also includes a\npreprocessing step that infers from a semantic abstract knowledge described in\nterms of an ontology the manipulation knowledge required by the reasoning\nprocess. The proposed approach has been validated with several examples\ninvolving an holonomic mobile robot, a robot with differential constraints and\na serial manipulator, and benchmarked using several state-of-the art\nkinodynamic planners. The results showed a significant difference in the power\nconsumption with respect to simple physics-based planning, an improvement in\nthe success rate and in the quality of the solution paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 18:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

This paper,\nin what we believe is the first such attempt, looks at the probability\ndistributions on a unit sphere, through the perspective of spherical harmonics,\nanalogous to the Fourier analysis for distributions on a unit circle. Harmonic\nrepresentations of many currently used spherical models are presented and\ndiscussed. A very general family of spherical distributions is then introduced,\nspecial cases of which yield many known spherical models.

The numerical results for the $\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$\nmoments in the above mentioned nuclei are similar to those obtained in other\ntheoretical studies although smaller on averag by $\\sim 40\\%$. We attribute\nthis difference basically to the one-QRPA-method, employed here for the first\ntime, instead of the currently used two-QRPA-method. The difference is\npartially due to the way of carrying out the restoration of the spin-isospin\nsymmetry.

The\nnumerical uncertainties in the $\\beta\\beta$ moments, related with i) their\nstrong dependence on the residual interaction in the p-p channel when evaluated\nwithin the QRPA, and ii) lack of proper knowledge of single-particle energies,\nhave been quantified.

As both bonding and anti-bonding modes are present in the\nvisible spectra of well-known spherical plasmonic heterodimer sets, binding\nforce reversal is commonly believed to occur for all such heterodimers. But our\nwork suggests a very different proposal. We demonstrate that for the symmetry\nbroken heterodimer configurations: reversal of lateral (for on-axis\nheterodimers) and longitudinal (for off-axis heterodimers: end-fire and nearly\nend-fire configurations) near field binding force follow fully distinct\nmechanisms; i.e. later one on relative orientation and constructive\ndipole-quadrupole resonance but the former one on light polarization and the\ninduced electric resonance.

With the increasingly integrated properties of cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS) today, security is a challenge for critical infrastructures.\nThough resilient control and detecting techniques for a specific model of\nattack have been proposed, to analyze and design detection and defense\nmechanisms against multiple types of attacks for CPSs requires new system\nframeworks. Besides security, other requirements such as optimal control cost\nalso need to be considered. The hybrid game model we propose in this work\ncontains physical states that are described by the system dynamics, and a cyber\nstate that represents the detection mode of the system composed by a set of\nsubsystems. A strategy means selecting a subsystem by combining one controller,\none estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at\neach state.

If a homogeneous crystalline\nsuperconductor exhibits sufficiently high uniaxial anisotropy, a similar\n1D$\\rightarrow$3D crossover has been predicted to occur, provided that\nsingle-particle hopping transverse to the 1D axis is absent in the normal\nstate. Here we present magnetic penetration depth and electrical transport data\nin single crystals of q1D Tl$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$, which reveal a 1D$\\rightarrow$3D\nsuperconducting dimensional crossover. Both experimental techniques uncover\nmultiple energy scales within the superconducting transition, which describe a\nsequence of fluctuating regimes. As the temperature is reduced below\n$T_{ons}=$~6.7~K, 1D pairing fluctuations are replaced by 1D phase slips below\n$T_p\\sim$~5.9~K. These give way to 3D phase fluctuations below $T_{ab}=$~4.9~K,\nprior to dimensional crossover at $T_{x2}\\sim$~4.4~K. The electrical\nresistivity below $T_{ab}$ is quantitatively consistent with the establishment\nof phase coherence through gradual binding of Josephson vortex strings to form\n3D loops. An anomalously low superfluid density persist down to $\\sim$3~K\nbefore rising steeply --- in agreement with a theoretical model for crossovers\nin q1D superconductors, and suggesting that a small population of unbound,\nweakly-pinned vortices survives below the crossover. The observation of a\ndimensional crossover within the superconducting state has important\nconsequences for the low-temperature normal state in Tl$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ and\nsimilar q1D metals, which may exhibit one-dimensional behavior over far greater\ntemperature ranges than band structure calculations suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 04:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 15:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

In this problem,\neach job is completed only when all of its tasks are completed, so the delay of\na job is the maximum of the delays of its tasks. Despite the wide attention\nthis problem has received, tight analysis is still largely unknown since\nanalyzing job delay requires characterizing the complicated correlation among\ntask delays, which is hard to do.\n  We first consider an asymptotic regime where the number of servers, $n$, goes\nto infinity, and the number of tasks in a job, $k^{(n)}$, is allowed to\nincrease with $n$. We establish the asymptotic independence of any $k^{(n)}$\nqueues under the condition $k^{(n)} = o(n^{1/4})$. This greatly generalizes the\nasymptotic-independence type of results in the literature where asymptotic\nindependence is shown only for a fixed constant number of queues. As a\nconsequence of our independence result, the job delay converges to the maximum\nof independent task delays.\n  We next consider the non-asymptotic regime.

The proposed approach synthesizes\nsmooth velocity fields, which specify a desired velocity as a function of time\nand position in a decentralized manner i.e., each agent calculates the desired\nvelocity locally by utilizing the number of agents within a prescribed\ncommunication distance. Swarm converges to the desired/commanded density\ndistribution by following the velocity field. The local information consists,\nonly, of agents' positions and it is utilized to estimate the density around\neach agent. Local density estimation is performed by using kernel density\nestimation. Then the local density estimates and the desired density are\nutilized to generate the velocity field, which propagates the swarm probability\ndensity distribution via the well-known heat equation. The key advantage of\nusing smooth velocity fields to control swarm density with respect to our\nearlier Markov chain based probabilistic control methods is that the agents\nmove more smoothly in an organized manner and their relative velocities go to\nzero as they get closer to each other, i.e., they facilitate conflict/collision\navoidance. The desired density distribution, which is commanded to the local\ncontrollers, can be computed by using a Markov chain that propagates the\ndesired density distribution within prescribed requirements. Along with\nconvergence and stability analysis, the effectiveness of the approach is\nillustrated via numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 05:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

The ground state problem for the\nHeisenberg-Zeeman Hamiltonian can be reduced first to the relative ground state\nproblem, and, in a second step, to the absolute ground state problem for pure\nHeisenberg Hamiltonians depending on an additional Lagrange parameter. We\ndistinguish between continuous and discontinuous reduction. Moreover, there are\nvarious general statements about Heisenberg-Zeeman systems that will be proven\nunder most general assumptions. One topic is the connection between the minimal\nenergy functions $E_{min}$ for the Heisenberg energy and $H_{min}$ for the\nHeisenberg-Zeeman energy which turn out to be essentially mutual\nLegendre-Fenchel transforms. This generalization of the traditional Legendre\ntransform is especially suited to cope with situations where the function\n$E_{min}$ is not convex and consequently there is a magnetization jump at a\ncritical field. Another topic is magnetization and the occurrence of threshold\nfields $B_{thr}$ and saturation fields $B_{sat}$, where we provide a general\nformula for the latter. We suggest a distinction between ferromagnetic and\nanti-ferromagnetic systems based on the vanishing of $B_{sat}$ for the former\nones. Parabolic systems are defined in such a way that $E_{min}$ and $H_{min}$\nhave a particularly simple form and studied in detail. For a large class of\nparabolic systems the relative ground states can be constructed from the\nabsolute ground state by means of a so-called umbrella family.

The pure electrostatic oscillations\nundergo phase mixing nonlinearly. However, the presence of the magnetic field\nsignificantly delays the phase-mixing compared to that observed in the\ncorresponding unmagnetized plasma. Using 1D PIC simulations we then analyze the\ndamping of the primary modes of the pure oscillations in detail and infer the\ndependence of the phase-mixing time on the magnetic field and the amplitude of\nthe oscillations. The results are remarkably different from those found for the\nmixed upper-hybrid mode mentioned above.

Our model includes atmospheric\nphotochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations and\ninterior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases we find abiotic\natmospheric O2 buildup around M-stars during the pre-main sequence phase to be\nmuch less than calculated previously, because the planet's magma ocean absorbs\nmost oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis. However, loss of non-condensing\natmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant potential\nroute to abiotic atmospheric O2 subsequently. In all cases, we predict that\nexoplanets that receive lower stellar fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST-1f\nand g, have the lowest probability of abiotic O2 buildup and hence may be the\nmost interesting targets for future searches for biogenic O2.

This question is investigated, in an environment\nwhere the distribution of resources follows seasonal cycles, both analytically\nand experimentally by means of an agent-based model of a foraging task.\nIndividuals can either specialize to foraging only one specific resource type\nor generalize to foraging all resource types at a low success rate.

Whereas links can be used to\nrepresent transmission lines. One way to study complex systems is by using the\nagent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm. An ABM is a way of representing a complex\nsystem of autonomous agents interacting with each other. Previously, a number\nof studies have been presented in the smart grid domain making use of the ABM\nparadigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have\nfocused on the specification aspect of ABM. An ABM specification is important\nnot only for understanding but also for replication of the model. In this\nstudy, we focus on development as well as specification of ABM for smart grid.\nWe propose an ABM by using a combination of agent-based and complex\nnetwork-based approaches. For ABM specification, we use ODD and DREAM\nspecification approaches. We analyze these two specification approaches\nqualitatively as well as quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDREAM is a most useful approach as compared with ODD for modeling as well as\nfor replication of models for smart grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 02:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 18:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

Through the analysis of the resonant field, it has been elucidated that\nthe three negative parameters are induced by dipolar, monopolar and quadrupolar\nresonance respectively. The dipolar and monopolar resonances result into the\nnegative band for longitudinal waves, while the dipolar and quadrupolar\nresonances cause the negative band for transverse waves.
