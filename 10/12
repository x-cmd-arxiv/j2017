A motivation for this review is the widespread observation of\nnuclear shape coexistence and sequences of rotational states in all regions of\nthe nuclear periodic table combined with the recognition that the study of the\nrotational dynamics of quantum fluids has led to significant advances in the\nquantum theory of many-boson systems. Recent experimental investigations of the\nrotational dynamics of a low-temperature $^6$Li gas indicate that its slow\nrotational flows are likewise the irrotational flows of a superfluid. In this\ncontext, the dynamics of rotating nuclei are of fundamental interest because\nthe nucleus is a unique zero-temperature finite many-fermion quantum system. A\npromising approach is provided by algebraic mean-field theory which, as its\nname suggests, is a combination of algebraic and mean-field methods. Static\nmean-field theories play a central role in many-body theory by defining optimal\nindependent-particle and independent quasi-particle basis states for the\nquantum mechanics of many-fermion systems. Their time-dependent extensions also\nlead, in the small-amplitude random-phase approximation, to the quantisation of\nthe classical normal-mode vibrations of many-fermion systems about their static\nequilibrium states. This review shows that mean-field methods become\nsignificantly more powerful when combined with algebraic methods and an\nappropriate coupling scheme for the nuclear shell model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

Specifically, we propose two approaches for cross-task\nknowledge transfer to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios. In\nour first proposal, portfolio adaptation, a set of induction models is\npretrained on a set of related tasks, and the best model is adapted towards the\nnew task using transfer learning. In our second approach, meta program\ninduction, a $k$-shot learning approach is used to make a model generalize to\nnew tasks without additional training. To test the efficacy of our methods, we\nconstructed a new benchmark of programs written in the Karel programming\nlanguage. Using an extensive experimental evaluation on the Karel benchmark, we\ndemonstrate that our proposals dramatically outperform the baseline induction\nmethod that does not use knowledge transfer. We also analyze the relative\nperformance of the two approaches and study conditions in which they perform\nbest. In particular, meta induction outperforms all existing approaches under\nextreme data sparsity (when a very small number of examples are available),\ni.e., fewer than ten. As the number of available I/O examples increase (i.e. a\nthousand or more), portfolio adapted program induction becomes the best\napproach.

For a control sample, we\nassembled contrast curves from several published surveys targeting 277 stars\nwhich do not show infrared excesses. We assumed a double power law distribution\nin mass and semi-major axis of the form f(m,a) = $Cm^{\\alpha}a^{\\beta}$, where\nwe adopted power law values and logarithmically flat values for the mass and\nsemi-major axis of planets.

Any Galois ring contained in the standard Galois\norder is automatically itself a Galois order and we call such rings principal\nGalois orders. We give two applications. First, we obtain a simple sufficient\ncriterion for a Galois ring to be a Galois order and hence for its\nGelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra to be maximal commutative. Second, generalizing a\nrecent result by Early-Mazorchuk-Vishnyakova, we construct canonical simple\nGelfand-Zeitlin modules over any principal Galois order.\n  As an example, we introduce the notion of a rational Galois order, attached\nan arbitrary finite reflection group and a set of rational difference\noperators, and show that they are principal Galois orders. Building on results\nby Futorny-Molev-Ovsienko, we show that parabolic subalgebras of finite\nW-algebras are rational Galois orders. Similarly we show that Mazorchuk's\northogonal Gelfand-Zeitlin algebras of type $A$, and their parabolic\nsubalgebras, are rational Galois orders. Consequently we produce canonical\nsimple Gelfand-Zeitlin modules for these algebras and prove that their\nGelfand-Zeitlin subalgebras are maximal commutative.\n  Lastly, we show that quantum OGZ algebras, previously defined by the author,\nand their parabolic subalgebras, are principal Galois orders. This in\nparticular proves the long-standing Mazorchuk-Turowska conjecture that, if $q$\nis not a root of unity, the Gelfand-Zeitlin subalgebra of\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ is maximal commutative and that its Gelfand-Zeitlin\nfibers are non-empty and (by Futorny-Ovsienko theory) finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 17:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

We begin by\nreviewing the results obtained in the past ten years via a wealth of different\napproaches, and then introduce the Ponzano--Regge model in a self-contained\nway. Thanks to the topological nature of three-dimensional quantum gravity we\ncan solve exactly for the bulk degrees of freedom and identify dual boundary\ntheories which depend on the choice of boundary states, that can also describe\nfinite, non-asymptotic boundaries. This series of papers aims precisely at the\ninvestigation of the role played by the different quantum boundary conditions\nleading to different boundary theories.

More than a decade of effort has\ngone into nailing down the definitions of the ARM and IBM Power memory models,\nand yet there still remain aspects of those models which (perhaps surprisingly)\nremain unresolved to this day. In response to these complexities, there has\nbeen somewhat of a recent trend in the (general-purpose) architecture community\nto limit new memory models to being (multicopy) atomic: where store values can\nbe read by the issuing processor before being advertised to other processors.\nTSO is the most notable example, used in the past by IBM 370 and SPARC-TSO, and\ncurrently used in x86. Recently (in March 2017) ARM has also switched to a\nmulticopy atomic memory model, and the new RISC-V ISA and recent academic\nproposals such as WMM are pushing to do the same.\n  In this paper, we show that when memory models are atomic, it becomes much\neasier to produce axiomatic definitions, operational definitions, and proofs of\nequivalence than doing the same under non-atomic models. The increased ease\nwith which these definitions can be produced in turn allows architects to build\nprocessors much more confidently, and yet the relaxed nature of the models we\npropose still allows most or all of the performance of non-atomic models to be\nretained. In fact, in this paper, we show that atomic memory models can be\ndefined in a way that is parametrized by basic instruction and fence orderings.\nOur operational vs. axiomatic equivalence proofs, which are likewise\nparameterized, show that the operational model is sound with respect to the\naxioms and that the operational model is complete: that it can show any\nbehavior permitted by axiomatic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 19:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 19:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

The project is mainly focusing on the completeness of\nLAMOST ExtraGAlactic Surveys (LEGAS) in the SGC, the deficiencies of source\nselection methods and the basic performance parameters of LAMOST telescope. In\nboth fields, more than 95% of galaxies have been observed. A post-processing\nhas been applied to LAMOST 1D spectrum to remove the majority of remaining sky\nbackground residuals. More than 10,000 spectra have been visually inspected to\nmeasure the redshift by using combinations of different emission/absorption\nfeatures with uncertainty of $\\sigma_{z}/(1+z)<0.001$. In total, there are 1528\nredshifts (623 absorption and 905 emission line galaxies) in Field A and 1570\nredshifts (569 absorption and 1001 emission line galaxies) in Field B have been\nmeasured. The results show that it is possible to derive redshift from low SNR\ngalaxies with our post-processing and visual inspection. Our analysis also\nindicates that up to 1/4 of the input targets for a typical extra-galactic\nspectroscopic survey might be unreliable. The multi-wavelength data analysis\nshows that the majority of mid-infrared-detected absorption (91.3%) and\nemission line galaxies (93.3%) can be well separated by an empirical criterion\nof $W2-W3=2.4$. Meanwhile, a fainter sequence paralleled to the main population\nof galaxies has been witnessed both in $M_r$/$W2-W3$ and $M_*$/$W2-W3$\ndiagrams, which could be the population of luminous dwarf galaxies but\ncontaminated by the edge-on/highly inclined galaxies ($\\sim30\\%$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 21:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

In spiral arms\nmagnetic field strongly coexists with the gas distribution, in the inter-arm\nregion we see filamentary magnetic field structure.

Contrary to what\nit is observed in stripes, in a curved wire the transverse domain wall\noscillates along and rotates around the nanowire with the same frequency. These\nresults open the possibility of new oscillation-based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 21:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

DIC relies on nonlinear optimization method.\nThus an initial guess is quite important due to its influence on the converge\ncharacteristics of the algorithm. In order to obtain a reliable, accurate\ninitial guess, a reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC) method,\nwhich is able to intelligently obtain a reliable initial guess without using\ntime-consuming integer-pixel registration, was proposed. However, the RG-DIC\nand its improved methods are path-dependent and cannot be fully parallelized.\nBesides, it is highly possible that RG-DIC fails in the full-field analysis of\ndeformation without manual intervention if the deformation fields contain large\nareas of discontinuous deformation. Feature-based initial guess is highly\nrobust while it is relatively time-consuming. Recently, path-independent\nalgorithm, fast Fourier transform-based cross correlation (FFT-CC) algorithm,\nwas proposed to estimate the initial guess. Complete parallelizability is the\nmajor advantage of the FFT-CC algorithm, while it is sensitive to small\ndeformation. Wu et al proposed an efficient integer-pixel search scheme, but\nthe parameters of this algorithm are set by the users empirically. In this\ntechnical note, a fully parallelizable DIC method is proposed. Different from\nRG-DIC method, the proposed method divides DIC algorithm into two parts:\nfull-field initial guess estimation and sub-pixel registration. The proposed\nmethod has the following benefits: 1) providing a pre-knowledge of deformation\nfields; 2) saving computational time; 3) reducing error propagation; 4)\nintegratability with well-established DIC algorithms; 5) fully\nparallelizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 05:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 16:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

The\nanomalous Hall effect in the well-ordered Co2TiSn films has been investigated\nboth experimentally and theoretically. The measured Hall conductivity is in\ngood agreement to the calculated Berry curvature. Small deviations between them\nare due to the influence of skew scattering on the Hall effect. From\ntheoretical point of view, the main contribution to the anomalous Hall effect\noriginates from slightly gapped nodal lines, due to a symmetry reduction\ninduced by the magnetization. It has been found that only part of the nodal\nlines contributed near to the anomalous Hall conductivity at a fixed Fermi\nenergy which can be explained from a magnetic symmetry analysis.

This can be achieved by passing each input data point through a\nrepresentation function prior to its use in training or testing. Techniques for\nlearning such representation functions from data have been successful\nempirically, but typically lack theoretical fairness guarantees. We show that\nit is possible to prove that a representation function is fair according to\ncommon measures of both group and individual fairness, as well as useful with\nrespect to a target task.

Conflict-free\nReplicated Data Types (CRDTs) allow the design of predictable multi-master\nreplication and support eventual consistency of replicas that are allowed to\ntransiently diverge. CRDTs come in two flavors: state-based, where a state is\nchanged locally and shipped and merged into other replicas; operation-based,\nwhere operations are issued locally and reliably causal broadcast to all other\nreplicas. However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very\nencompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, and thus imposing storage\nand dissemination overheads as well as blurring the distinction from\nstate-based CRDTs. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send\noperations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based\nones. Data types with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as\npure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery; whereas data types\nhaving non-commutative operations are implemented using a PO-Log, a partially\nordered log of operations, and making use of an extended API, i.e., a Tagged\nCausal Stable Broadcast (TCSB), that provides extra causality information upon\ndelivery and later informs when delivered messages become causally stable,\nallowing further PO-Log compaction. The framework is illustrated by a catalog\nof pure op-based specifications for classic CRDTs, including counters,\nmulti-value registers, add-wins and remove-wins sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 12:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

Pattern\nconstruction and pattern matching are important tasks when dealing with\nproperty graphs. Given a property graph schema S, a property graph G, and a\nquery pattern P, all expressed in language L, pattern matching is the process\nof finding, merging, and annotating subgraphs of G that match P. Expressive\npattern languages support topological constraints, property values constraints,\nnegations, quantifications, aggregations, and path semantics. Calculated\nproperties may be defined for vertices, edges, and subgraphs, and constraints\nmay be imposed on their evaluation result.\n  Query posers would like to construct patterns with minimal effort, minimal\ntrial and error, and in a manner that is coherent with the way they think. The\nability to express patterns in a way that is aligned with their mental\nprocesses is crucial to the flow of their work and to the quality of the\ninsights they can draw.\n  Since the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to pattern\nperception are remarkable, it is a matter of course that query patterns were to\nbe expressed visually. Visual query languages have the potential to be much\nmore 'user-friendly' than their textual counterparts in the sense that patterns\nmay be constructed and understood much more quickly and with much less mental\neffort. A long-standing challenge is to design a visual query language that is\ngeneric, has rich expressive power, and is highly receptive and productive. V1\nattempts to answer this challenge.\n  V1 is a declarative visual pattern query language for schema-based property\ngraphs.

The\nstress relaxation function is computed approximately within a mode-coupling\ntheory---based on the physical picture, that relaxation of shear is dominated\nby slow structural relaxation, as the glass transition is approached. The\ntransient build-up of stress in steady shear is thus traced back to transient\ndensity correlations which are computed self-consistently within mode-coupling\ntheory. The glass transition is signalled by the appearance of a yield stress\nand a divergence of the Newtonian viscosity, characterizing linear response.\nFor shear rates comparable to the structural relaxation time, the stress\nbecomes independent of shear rate and we observe shear thinning, while for the\nlargest shear rates Bagnold scaling, i.e., a quadratic increase of shear stress\nwith shear rate, is recovered. The rheological properties are qualitatively\nsimilar for all values of $\\varepsilon$, the coefficient of restitution;\nhowever, the magnitude of the stress as well as the range of shear thinning and\nthickening show significant dependence on the inelasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 12:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 22:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 19:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Novel analytical braneworld models, {in which the warp factor depends} on\na free parameter $n$, were recently released in the literature.

We connect stellar structure models for He stars\nwith wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models\ncan simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Fixing the\nouter wind law and terminal wind velocity, we obtain unique solutions for the\nmass-loss rates of optically-thick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the\nphase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of\nstellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore,\nwe encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist.\nWhile these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they\nare in conflict with observations in the LMC. While our results confirm in\nparticular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that\nonly part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of\nthe standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core.\nThis means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind\nstructure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have\nto be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of\nWR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in\nbinary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae.\nThe sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to\ninclude optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically\nmotivated form than in current models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 14:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

For the first time, this paper quantifies the\nannual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical\ndynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery\nmodels of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of\neach is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set\n(Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11\\%\nto 5\\% is found by increasing the model accuracy.

In line with this trend, this paper\ninvestigates a fast emerging driving data source that has driver's privacy\nimplications. We first show that such privacy threats can be materialized via\nany mobile device with IMUs (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer). We then\npresent Dri-Fi (Driver Fingerprint), a driving data analytic engine that can\nfingerprint the driver with vehicle turn(s). Dri-Fi achieves this based on IMUs\ndata taken only during the vehicle's turn(s). Such an approach expands the\nattack surface significantly compared to existing driver fingerprinting\nschemes. From this data, Dri-Fi extracts three new features --- acceleration\nalong the end-of-turn axis, its deviation, and the deviation of the yaw rate\n--- and exploits them to identify the driver. Our extensive evaluation shows\nthat an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver\nwithin just one turn with 74.1%, 83.5%, and 90.8% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5\ndrivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle ---\nrespectively.

We show that efficient trade-off between these two measurements for\ninvestment portfolios happens, in general, on a convex curve in the two\ndimensional space of utility and risk. This is a rather general pattern. The\nmodern portfolio theory of Markowitz [H. Markowitz, Portfolio Selection, 1959]\nand its natural generalization, the capital market pricing model, [W. F.\nSharpe, Mutual fund performance , 1966] are special cases of our general\nframework when the risk measure is taken to be the standard deviation and the\nutility function is the identity mapping. Using our general framework, we also\nrecover the results in [R. T. Rockafellar, S. Uryasev and M. Zabarankin, Master\nfunds in portfolio analysis with general deviation measures, 2006] that extends\nthe capital market pricing model to allow for the use of more general deviation\nmeasures. This generalized capital asset pricing model also applies to e.g.\nwhen an approximation of the maximum drawdown is considered as a risk measure.\nFurthermore, the consideration of a general utility function allows to go\nbeyond the \"additive\" performance measure to a \"multiplicative\" one of\ncumulative returns by using the log utility. As a result, the growth optimal\nportfolio theory [J. Lintner, The valuation of risk assets and the selection of\nrisky investments in stock portfolios and capital budgets, 1965] and the\nleverage space portfolio theory [R.

In this series of papers, using the SXS we have\nmeasured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature\nstructure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that\nwhen inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems like\nPerseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. In\nthe Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\\alpha$ line ($w$) - the\nstrongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is\nsuppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions for\nan optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from the\ncenter. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from the\nsame ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distance\ndependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonant\nscattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in optically\nthick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\\beta$, Ly$\\alpha$) lines, and\ncomparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are\nconsistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadening\ndescribed elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statistical\nuncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of\nline emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray\nmissions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the\namplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 03:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

To probe the role of silicon in the UV extinction, we\nexplore the relations between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in\nsilicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom bump or the far-UV extinction\nrise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic\nsightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We\nderive [Si/H]_{dust} either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the\nKramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to\nthe total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar silicon reference\nabundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive\n[Si/H]_{dust} from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of\namorphous silicates and graphitic grains. We find that in all three cases\n[Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the\ncarbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump.\nThis supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the\n2175 Angstrom bump. We also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust}\nalone correlates with the far-UV extinction, suggesting that the far-UV\nextinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 18:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The color sensation can be characterized by three\ncolor-space values, such as XYZ, RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, etc. It is straightforward\nto compute the three values given the illuminant and reflectance curves. The\nconverse process of computing a reflectance curve given the color-space values\nand the illuminant is complicated by the fact that an infinite number of\ndifferent reflectance curves can give rise to a single set of color-space\nvalues (metamerism). This paper presents five algorithms for generating a\nreflectance curve from a specified sRGB triplet, written for a general\naudience. The algorithms are designed to generate reflectance curves that are\nsimilar to those found with naturally occurring colored objects. The computed\nreflectance curves are compared to a database of thousands of reflectance\ncurves measured from paints and pigments available both commercially and in\nnature, and the similarity is quantified. One particularly useful application\nof these algorithms is in the field of computer graphics, where modeling color\ntransformations sometimes requires wavelength-specific information, such as\nwhen modeling subtractive color mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 19:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 12:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 11:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 00:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 16:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}
