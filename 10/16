The prominent amongst them being the collisionless\nWeibel destabilization which spatially separates the forward propagating REB\nand the return shielding currents. This results in the formation of REB current\nfilaments which are typically of the size of electron skin depth during the\nlinear stage of the instability. It has been observed that in the nonlinear\nstage the filaments size increases as they merge with each other. With the help\nof 2D PIC simulations in the plane perpendicular to the REB propagation, it is\nshown that these mergers occur in two distinct nonlinear phases. In the first\nphase, the total magnetic energy increases. Subsequently, however, during the\nsecond phase, one observes a reduction in magnetic energy. It is shown that the\ntransition from one nonlinear regime to another occurs when the typical current\nassociated with individual filaments hits the Alfven threshold. In the second\nnonlinear regime, therefore, the filaments can no longer permit any increase in\ncurrent. Magnetic reconnection events then dissipate the excess current (and\nits associated magnetic energy) that would result from a merger process leading\nto the generation of energetic electrons jets in the perpendicular plane. At\nlater times when there are only few filaments left the individual reconnection\nevents can be clearly identified. It is observed that in between such events\nthe magnetic energy remains constant and shows a sudden drop as and when two\nfilaments merge. The electron jets released in these recon- nection events are\nthus responsible for the transverse heating which has been mentioned in some\nprevious studies [Honda et al. Phys. Plasmas 7, 1302 (2000)].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 16:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 10:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

In the two-dimensional case this implies that the\nconstant term of the expansion contains a non-local term that determines the\nlength of the (circular) cross section and vanishes precisely if this length\nequals $2\\pi$, that is, in the smooth case. We proceed to the study of higher\ndimensions. In the four-dimensional case, the logarithmic term in the expansion\nvanishes precisely when the cross section is a spherical space form, and we\nexpect that the vanishing of a further singular term will imply again\nsmoothness, but this is not yet clear beyond the case of cyclic space forms. In\nhigher dimensions the situation is naturally more difficult. We illustrate this\nin the case of cross sections with constant curvature.

They are in particular\nimportant for the analysis and interpretation of QCD simulations on a finite,\ndiscrete space-time lattice. Most of these effects are closely related to the\nphenomenon of spontaneous breaking of the chiral flavor symmetry and the\nemergence of pions as light Goldstone bosons. These long-range fluctuations are\nstrongly affected by putting the system into a finite box, and an analysis with\ndifferent methods can be organized according to the interplay between pion mass\nand box size. The finite volume also affects critical behavior at the chiral\nphase transition in QCD. In the present review, I will be mainly concerned with\nmodeling such finite volume effects as they affect the thermodynamics of the\nchiral phase transition for two quark flavors.\n  I review recent work on the analysis of finite-volume effects which makes use\nof the quark-meson model for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. To account for\nthe effects of critical long-range fluctuations close to the phase transition,\nmost of the calculations have been performed using non-perturbative\nRenormalization Group (RG) methods.

In this paper, we present the experimental\nobservation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons\ninteracting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP)\neffect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a\nperiodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations\nnear the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We\ndemonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with\nperiodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation\nby low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than\npreviously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence\non the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment\nand theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the\nproduction of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that\nallow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum\neffects for light generation in nanoscale devices.

In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust\nlocally-linear controllable embedding (RCE).

Since\nlarge deformations generally occur in the vicinity of a crack, the numerical\nframework of the chosen SGP theory is developed for allowing large strains and\nrotations. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element\n(FE) code by a user subroutine, and crack-tip fields are evaluated thoroughly\nfor both infinitesimal and finite deformation theories by a boundary-layer\nformulation. An extensive parametric study is conducted and differences in the\nstress distributions ahead of the crack tip, as compared with conventional\nplasticity, are quantified. As a consequence of the strain-gradient\ncontribution to the work hardening of the material, FE results show a\nsignificant increase in the magnitude and the extent of the differences between\nthe stress fields of SGP and conventional plasticity theories when finite\nstrains are considered. Since the distance from the crack tip at which the\nstrain gradient significantly alters the stress field could be one order of\nmagnitude higher when large strains are considered, results reveal that the\nplastic size effect could have important implications in the modelization of\nseveral damage mechanisms where its influence has not yet been considered in\nthe literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 18:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

First, a crucial change of\nvariables highlights the dissipative property of the Jin-Xin system, and allows\nto observe a faster decay of the dissipative variable with respect to the\nconservative one, which is essential in order to close the estimates.

Such a group is called special if the center lies within its\nderived group. Every group of class 2 and exponent $p$ can be uniquely\nexpressed as the direct product of an elementary abelian group and a special\ngroup. This reduces the isomorphism problem to special groups. The special\ngroups having $G'$ cyclic are well known. Groups having $|G'|=p^2$ are known to\nbe generated by two abelian subgroups. As such, they can be described by a pair\nof Scharlau Matrices which we will define. Using these, Vishnevetskii ([1],\n[2]) classified the special groups which are not central products of groups of\nsmaller order. We call these Vishnevetskii indecomposable. All decomposable\ngroups are central products of two or more indecomposable groups. By Theorem 2\nof [2], if $G$ is a special group with derived group of order $p^2$ then the\nindecomposable central factors of $G$, together with their multiplicities, form\na set of invariants for $G$. However these invariants do not determine $G$,\nsince (as we will show below) two nonisomorphic groups can have the same\nindecomposable central factors.

The key idea behind this approach is to use a\nspecific geometry of the silver thermal stabilizer that surrounds the\nsuperconducting tape. More specifically, a very thin layer of silver stabilizer\nis deposited on top of the superconductor layer, typically less than 100 nm,\nwhile the remaining stabilizer (still silver) is deposited on the substrate\nside. Normal zone propagation velocities up to 170 cm/s have been measured\nexperimentally, corresponding to a stabilizer thickness of 20 nm on top of the\nsuperconductor layer. This is one order of magnitude faster than the speed\nmeasured on actual commercial tapes. Our results clearly demonstrate that a\nvery thin stabilizer on top of the superconductor layer leads to high normal\nzone propagation velocities. The experimental values are in good agreement with\npredictions realized by finite element simulations.

The feedback is correct only with\nprobability $p > 1/2$ (and adversarially incorrect with probability $1 - p$),\ni.e., the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise.\nThe algorithm's goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations.\n  Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and\nuser feedback. To be able to learn efficiently, it is sufficient that there be\na graph $G$ whose nodes are the models and (weighted) edges capture the user\nfeedback, with the property that if $s, s^*$ are the proposed and target\nmodels, respectively, then any (correct) user feedback $s'$ must lie on a\nshortest $s$-$s^*$ path in $G$. Under this one assumption, there is a natural\nalgorithm reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, which\nwill efficiently learn $s^*$ even in the presence of noise in the user's\nfeedback.\n  From this general result, we rederive with barely any extra effort classic\nresults on learning of classifiers and a recent result on interactive\nclustering; in addition, we easily obtain new interactive learning algorithms\nfor ordering/ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 00:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Although the growth of the power law can be\nattributed to gravitational contraction leading to the formation of condensed\ncores, it is often debated if an observed lognormal shape is a direct\nconsequence of supersonic turbulence alone, or even if it is really observed in\nmolecular clouds. In this paper we run three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations including ambipolar diffusion with different initial conditions to\nsee the effect of strong magnetic fields and nonlinear initial velocity\nperturbations on the evolution of the column density PDFs. Our simulations show\nthat column density PDFs of clouds with supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, with\neither linear perturbations or nonlinear turbulence, quickly develop a\npower-law tail such that $dN/d \\log \\Sigma \\propto \\Sigma^{-\\alpha}$ with index\n$\\alpha \\simeq 2$.

In this\npaper we present a BOO formulation based on group sparsity that simultaneously\noptimizes non-coplanar beam angles for all fractions, yielding a\nfraction-variant (FV) treatment plan. Beam angles are selected by solving a\nmulti-fraction FMO problem involving 500-700 candidate beams per fraction, with\nan additional group sparsity term that encourages most candidate beams to be\ninactive. The optimization problem is solved using the Fast Iterative\nShrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm. Our FV BOO algorithm is used to create\nnon-coplanar, five-fraction treatment plans for prostate and lung cases, as\nwell as a non-coplanar 30-fraction plan for a head and neck case. A homogeneous\nPTV dose coverage is maintained in all fractions. The treatment plans are\ncompared with fraction-invariant plans that use a fixed set of beam angles for\nall fractions.

Across this same developmental period, time scales of the\nhomeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with\ntime spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from\npolyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based,\nsleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the\ndynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep\nduring this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants.\nPreviously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional\ncircle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model.\nBy tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the\nhomeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a\nborder collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the\nnumber of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by\nbifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated\nperiod-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers\nof sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate\nnon-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic\npatterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior.\nThis analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early\nchildhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior,\nand the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 04:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

To demonstrate the new SLI\nalgorithm, a TFFM is custom-constructed, where a DMD replaces the generic\nblazed grating in the system and simultaneously functions as a diffraction\ngrating and a programmable binary mask, generating arbitrary fringe patterns.\nThe experimental results show promising depth-discrimination capability with an\naxial resolution enhancement factor of 1.25, which matches well with the\ntheoretical estimation, i.e, 1.27.

The convergence analysis of the SQN\nmethods, both full and limited-memory variants, require the objective function\nto be strongly convex. However, this assumption is fairly restrictive and does\nnot hold for applications such as minimizing the logistic regression loss\nfunction.

Eight out of these nine objects are classical novae in which\ninteraction of the ejecta with a tenuous circumbinary material is not expected\nto generate detectable gamma-ray emission. We examine whether particle\nacceleration at internal shocks can account for the gamma-ray emission from\nthese novae. The shocks result from the interaction of a fast wind\nradiatively-driven by nuclear burning on the white dwarf with material ejected\nin the initial runaway stage of the nova outburst. We present a one-dimensional\nmodel for the dynamics of a forward and reverse shock system in a nova ejecta,\nand for the associated time-dependent particle acceleration and high-energy\ngamma-ray emission. Non-thermal proton and electron spectra are calculated by\nsolving a time-dependent transport equation for particle injection,\nacceleration, losses, and escape from the shock region. The predicted emission\nis compared to LAT observations of V407 Cyg, V1324 Sco, V959 Mon, V339 Del,\nV1369 Cen, and V5668 Sgr. The 100MeV gamma-ray emission arises predominantly\nfrom particles accelerated up to ~100GeV at the reverse shock and undergoing\nhadronic interactions in the dense cooling layer downstream of the shock. The\ninternal shock model can account for the gamma-ray emission of the novae\ndetected by Fermi-LAT, including the main features in the observations of the\nrecent gamma-ray nova ASASSN-16ma.

Nowadays, the\nmost popular methods are probabilistic, and the so-called optimal method\nachieves an optimal trade-off between privacy and utility by using linear\noptimization techniques. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of linear\nprogramming, the method is unfeasible for a large number n of locations,\nbecause the constraints are $O(n^3)$. In this paper, we propose a technique to\nreduce the number of constraints to $O(n^2)$, at the price of renouncing to\nperfect optimality. We show however that on practical situations the utility\nloss is quite acceptable, while the gain in performance is significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 06:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Decoy Routers (DRs), placed in\nAutonomous Systems, proxy traffic from users; so the adversary, e.g., a\ncensorious government, attempts to avoid them. It is quite difficult to place\nDRs so the adversary cannot route around them for example, we need the\ncooperation of 850 ASes to contain China alone. In this paper, we consider a\ndifferent approach. We begin by noting that DRs need not intercept all the\nnetwork paths from a country, just those leading to Overt Destinations, i.e.,\nunfiltered websites hosted outside the country (usually popular ones, so that\nclient traffic to the OD does not make the censor suspicious. Our first\nquestion is; How many ASes are required for installing DRs to intercept a large\nfraction of paths from, e.g., China to the top n websites (as per Alexa)? How\ndoes this number grow with n? Few ASes (approx. 30) intercept over 90% of paths\nto the top n sites, for n = 10, 20...200. Our first contribution is to\ndemonstrate with real paths that the number of ASes required for a world-wide\nDR framework is small (approx. 30). Further, censor nations attempts to filter\ntraffic along the paths transiting these 30 ASes will not only block their own\ncitizens, but others residing in foreign ASes. Our second contribution in this\npaper is to consider the details of DR placement: not just in which ASes DRs\nshould be placed to intercept traffic, but exactly where in each AS. We find\nthat even with our small number of ASes, we still need a total of about 11,700\nDRs.We conclude that, even though a DR system involves far fewer ASes than\npreviously thought, it is still a major undertaking. For example, the current\nrouters cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if DR at line speed requires all new\nhardware, the cost alone would make such a project unfeasible for most actors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 06:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Here, we present an observation of the\ncircumstellar envelope in SiO J=1-0 that, when combined with the previous\nobservation in {\\sioii}, provide more stringent constraints on the density of\nthe SiO-emitting gas than hitherto possible. The emission in SiO peaks at a\nradius of $\\sim$2\\arcsec\\ whereas that in SiO J=2-1 emission peaks at a smaller\nradius of $\\sim$1\\arcsec, giving rise to their ring-like appearances. The ratio\nin brightness temperature between SiO J=1-0 and SiO J=2-1 decreases from a\nvalue well above unity at the innermost measurable radius to about unity at\nradius of $\\sim$2\\arcsec, beyond which this ratio remains approximately\nconstant.

A fundamental challenge in actual experiments is how to\nmanipulate the topological behavior of $p$-wave superconductors (PSCs) that\ncould open perspectives for applications. Such a control knob is naturally\nprovided by the spin-triplet character of the PSC order parameter, described by\nthe spin d-vector. Therefore, in this work we investigate the magnetic field\nresponse of one-dimensional (1d) PSCs and demonstrate that the structure of the\nCooper pair spin-configuration is crucial to set topological phases with an\nenhanced number of Majorana fermions per edge, N, ranging from N=0 to 4. The\ntopological phase diagram, consisting of phases with Majorana modes at the\nedge, becomes significantly modified when one tunes the strength of the applied\nfield and allows for long range hopping amplitudes in the 1d PSC. We find\ntransitions between phases with different number of Majorana fermions per edge\nthat can be both induced by a variation of the hopping strength and a spin\nrotation of the d-vector. Hence, the interplay of the applied magnetic field\nand the internal spin degree of freedom of the PSC opens a new promising route\nfor engineering topological phases with large number of Majorana modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 08:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

We use this equation to obtain a simplified\nidentity for the growth of enstrophy for mild solutions that depends only on\nthe strain tensor, not on the nonlocal interaction of the strain tensor with\nthe vorticity. The resulting identity allows us to prove a new family of\nscale-critical, necessary and sufficient conditions for the blow-up of a\nsolution at some finite time $T_{max}<+\\infty$, which depend only on the\nhistory of the positive part of the second eigenvalue of the strain matrix.\nSince this matrix is trace-free, this severely restricts the geometry of any\nfinite-time blow-up.

The compositional scheme is based on the joint\ndissipativity-type properties of discrete-time control subsystems and their\nfinite abstractions. In the first part of the paper, we use a notion of\nso-called storage function as a relation between each subsystem and its finite\nabstraction to construct compositionally a notion of so-called simulation\nfunction as a relation between interconnected finite abstractions and that of\ncontrol systems. The derived simulation function is used to quantify the error\nbetween the output behavior of the overall interconnected concrete system and\nthat of its finite abstraction. In the second part of the paper, we propose a\ntechnique to construct finite abstractions together with their corresponding\nstorage functions for a class of discrete-time control systems under some\nincremental passivity property.

The line profile was deconvolved into\na low velocity component (LVC, < 40 km/s) and a high velocity component (HVC, >\n40 km/s ), originating from slow winds and high velocity jets, respectively.\nThe LVC is by far the most frequent component, with a detection rate of 77%,\nwhile only 30% of sources have a HVC. The [OI]6300 luminosity of both the LVC\nand HVC, when detected, correlates with stellar and accretion parameters of the\ncentral sources (i.e. Lstar , Mstar , Lacc , Macc), with similar slopes for the\ntwo components. The line luminosity correlates better with the accretion\nluminosity than with the stellar luminosity or stellar mass. We suggest that\naccretion is the main drivers for the line excitation and that MHD disc-winds\nare at the origin of both components.

They will consist of an integration of different techniques,\nincluding distributed antenna systems and massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output systems, and the overall performance will highly depend on the\nchannel coding techniques employed. Due to the nature of future wireless\nnetworks, space--time codes are no longer merely an object of choice, but will\noften appear naturally in the communications setting. However, as the involved\ncommunication devices often exhibit a modest computational power, the\ncomplexity of the codes to be utilised should be reasonably low for possible\npractical implementation.\n  Fast-decodable codes enjoy reduced complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML)\ndecoding due to a smart inner structure allowing for parallelisation in the ML\nsearch. The complexity reductions considered in this chapter are entirely owing\nto the algebraic structure of the considered codes, and could be further\nimproved by employing non-ML decoding methods, however yielding suboptimal\nperformance.\n  The aim of this chapter is twofold. First, we provide a tutorial introduction\nto space--time coding and study powerful algebraic tools for their design and\nconstruction. Secondly, we revisit algebraic techniques used for reducing the\nworst-case decoding complexity of both single-user and multiuser space-time\ncodes, alongside with general code families and illustrative examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 10:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

This article gives an\nintroduction to the framework of well-posed BIPs in infinite-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as advocated by Stuart (Acta Numer. 19:451--559, 2010) and\nothers. This framework has the advantage of ensuring uniformly well-posed\ninference problems independently of the finite-dimensional discretisation used\nfor numerical solution. Recently, this framework has been extended to the case\nof a heavy-tailed prior measure in the family of stable distributions, such as\nan infinite-dimensional Cauchy distribution, for which polynomial moments are\ninfinite or undefined.

This paper shows that properly designed\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can substantially reduce the amount of\nrequired block downloads for repair thanks to the sparse nature of their factor\ngraph representation. In particular, with a careful construction of the factor\ngraph, both low repair-bandwidth and high reliability can be achieved for a\ngiven code rate. First, a formula for the average repair bandwidth of LDPC\ncodes is developed. This formula is then used to establish that the minimum\nrepair bandwidth can be achieved by forcing a regular check node degree in the\nfactor graph. Moreover, it is shown that given a fixed code rate, the variable\nnode degree should also be regular to yield minimum repair bandwidth, under\nsome reasonable minimum variable node degree constraint. It is also shown that\nfor a given repair-bandwidth requirement, LDPC codes can yield substantially\nhigher reliability than currently utilized Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Our\nreliability analysis is based on a formulation of the general equation for the\nmean-time-to-data-loss (MTTDL) associated with LDPC codes. The formulation\nreveals that the stopping number is closely related to the MTTDL. It is further\nshown that LDPC codes can be designed such that a small loss of\nrepair-bandwidth optimality may be traded for a large improvement in\nerasure-correction capability and thus the MTTDL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 10:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Existing work on UAV-enabled\nwireless networks overlook the fast UAV deployment for wireless coverage, and\nsuch deployment problems have only been studied recently in sensor networks.\nUnlike sensors, UAVs should be deployed to the air and they are generally\ndifferent in flying speed, operating altitude and wireless coverage radius. By\nconsidering such UAV heterogeneity to cover the whole target area, this paper\nstudies two fast UAV deployment problems: one is to minimize the maximum\ndeployment delay among all UAVs (min-max) for fairness consideration, and the\nother is to minimize the total deployment delay (min-sum) for efficiency\nconsideration. We prove both min-max and min-sum problems are NP-complete in\ngeneral.

This may be used to help explain the\nlarge fractional amplitudes of the observed thermal X-ray pulsations from the\npolar cap, which contradict the almost aligned rotator model of PSR B0943+10.\nWe analyse the properties of drifting subpulses in the Bright mode and report\non the minutes-long variations of the drift period. We searched for the\nperiodic amplitude modulation of drifting subpulses, which is a vital argument\nfor constraining several important system parameters: the degree of aliasing,\nthe orientation of the line-of-sight vector with respect to magnetic and spin\naxes, the angular velocity of the carousel, and thus, the gradient of the\naccelerating potential in the polar gap. The periodic amplitude modulation was\nnot detected, indicating that it may be a rare or narrow-band phenomenon. Based\non our non-detection and review of available literature, we chose to leave the\naliasing order unconstrained and derived the number of sparks under different\nassumptions about the aliasing order and geometry angles. Contrary to the\nprevious findings, we did not find a large (of the order of 10%) gradual\nvariation of the separation between subpulses throughout Bright mode.

This prompts\nthe question as to whether or not other classical schemes may be generalized to\narbitrary groups and whether classical results still apply to those generalized\nschemes. In this thesis, we generalize the Even-Mansour cipher and the Feistel\ncipher. We show that Even and Mansour's original notions of secrecy are\nobtained on a one-key, group variant of the Even-Mansour cipher. We generalize\nthe result by Kilian and Rogaway, that the Even-Mansour cipher is pseudorandom,\nto super pseudorandomness, also in the one-key, group case. Using a Slide\nAttack we match the bound found above. After generalizing the Feistel cipher to\narbitrary groups we resolve an open problem of Patel, Ramzan, and Sundaram by\nshowing that the 3-round Feistel cipher over an arbitrary group is not super\npseudorandom. We generalize a result by Gentry and Ramzan showing that the\nEven-Mansour cipher can be implemented using the Feistel cipher as the public\npermutation. In this result, we also consider the one-key case over a group and\ngeneralize their bound. Finally, we consider Zhandry's result on quantum\npseudorandom permutations, showing that his result may be generalized to hold\nfor arbitrary groups. In this regard, we consider whether certain card shuffles\nmay be generalized as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 12:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

In\nthe first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full\ncounting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the\nlatter part of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The\naverage entropy production is composed of the time integral of the\ninstantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.\nWe define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle\ncurrents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.\nThe excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control\nparameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)\nvector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is\ndescribed by $\\ln \\rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\\rho_0$ where $\\rho_0$ is the\ninstantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME\nwhich is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term.

The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy\nessentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is\nnon-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy\nproduction approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann\nentropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy\nproduction obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our\nresult and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly\nnonequilibrium regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 12:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 14:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Software\nDefined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the\ncontrol plane and data plane. Network monitoring in SDN is lightweight as\noperators only need to install a monitoring module into the controller. Active\nmonitoring techniques usually introduce too many overheads into the network.\nThe state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling method, aggregation flow\nstatistics and passive measurement techniques to reduce overheads. However,\nlittle work in literature has focus on reducing the communication cost of\nnetwork monitoring.

Inspired by the\nvisibility and central control of SDN, we propose FlowCover, a low-cost\nhigh-accuracy monitoring scheme to support various network management tasks.

This absence of gas explains the absence of stellar formation observed in\nthis region contrary to what is observed next to Sgr A* in the Milky Way.\nEither the gas has been swallowed by the black hole, or a feedback mechanism\nhas pushed the gas outside the central 1 pc. Nevertheless, we detect a small\nclump of gas with a very small velocity dispersion at 2.4\" from the black hole.\nIt is probable that this clumpy gas is seen in projection, as it does not\nfollow the rotation of the disk surrounding the black hole, its velocity\ndispersion is ten times smaller than the expected velocity gradient and the\ntidal shear from the black hole requires a gas density for this clump that is\nnot compatible with our observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

Software\nDefined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the\ncontrol plane and data plane. Network monitoring in SDN is relatively\nlight-weight since operators only need to install a monitoring module into the\ncontroller. Active monitoring techniques usually introduce extra overhead into\nthe network. The state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling, aggregation and\npassive measurement techniques to reduce measurement overhead. However, little\nwork has focused on reducing the communication cost of network monitoring.\nMoreover, most of the existing approaches select polling switch nodes by\nsub-optimal local heuristics.Inspired by the visibility and central control of\nSDN, we propose CeMon, a generic low-cost high-accuracy monitoring system that\nsupports various network management tasks. We first propose a Maximum Coverage\nPolling Scheme (MCPS) to optimize the polling cost for all active flows. The\nproblem is formulated as a weighted set cover problem which is proved to be\nNP-hard. Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling scheme efficiently and\nhandle traffic dynamics practically. In order to balance the cost and\nflexibility, an Adaptive Fine-grained Polling Scheme (AFPS) is proposed as a\ncomplementary method to implement flow level measurement tasks. Three sampling\nalgorithms are further proposed to eliminate measurement overhead while\nmaintain high accuracy. Both emulation and simulation results show that MCPS\nreduces more than 50% of the communication cost with negligible loss of\naccuracy for different topologies and traffics. We also use real traces to\ndemonstrate that AFPS reduces the cost by up to 20% with only 1.5% loss in\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

In the Milky Way a single value is used at all\ngalactocentric radii, independently of the observed metallicity gradients. Both\nmodels and extragalactic observations suggest that this quantity increases for\ndecreasing metallicity Z, typical of the outer regions in disks, where fewer\nheavy elements are available to form dust grains.\n  Aims: We aim to investigate the variation of the gas-to-dust ratio as a\nfunction of galactocentric radius and metallicity, to allow a more accurate\ncharacterisation of the quantity of molecular gas across the galactic disk, as\nderived from observations of the dust.\n  Methods: Observations of the optically thin C\\$^{18}\\$O (2-1) transition were\nobtained with the APEX telescope for a sample of 23 massive and dense\nstar-forming regions in the far outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance greater\nthan 14 kpc).

The dust-to-metal ratio,\ndecreases with galactocentric radius, which is the most common situation also\nfor external late-type galaxies. This suggests that grain growth dominates over\ndestruction.

We consider an epidemic model that is\nnetwork based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick,\npairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model,\nwe prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious\nperiod (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any\ngiven subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of\ndistributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with\nrespect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of\nthis relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed\nbasic reproductive ratio (R0), a monotonic relationship between the variability\nof the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the\ninfectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given\nsubset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when R0 is fixed,\nvariability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical\nresults illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker.

In\nanalogy to multi-armed bandit problems, the manager needs to simultaneously\n\"explore\" and \"exploit\" with her inventory decisions, in order to minimize the\ncumulative cost. We make no probabilistic assumptions---importantly,\nindependence or time stationarity---regarding the mechanism that creates the\ndemand sequence. Our goal is to shed light on the hardness of the problem, and\nto develop policies that perform well with respect to the regret criterion,\nthat is, the difference between the cumulative cost of a policy and that of the\nbest fixed action/static inventory decision in hindsight, uniformly over all\nfeasible demand sequences. We show that a simple randomized policy, termed the\nExponentially Weighted Forecaster, combined with a carefully designed cost\nestimator, achieves optimal scaling of the expected regret (up to logarithmic\nfactors) with respect to all three key primitives: the number of time periods,\nthe number of inventory decisions available, and the demand support. Through\nthis result, we derive an important insight: the benefit from \"information\nstalking\" as well as the cost of censoring are both negligible in this dynamic\nlearning problem, at least with respect to the regret criterion. Furthermore,\nwe modify the proposed policy in order to perform well in terms of the tracking\nregret, that is, using as benchmark the best sequence of inventory decisions\nthat switches a limited number of times. Numerical experiments suggest that the\nproposed approach outperforms existing ones (that are tailored to, or\nfacilitated by, time stationarity) on nonstationary demand models. Finally, we\nextend the proposed approach and its analysis to a \"combinatorial\" version of\nthe repeated newsvendor problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Around the neutron dripline, the weak binding of the last bound\nneutron(s) causes the drastic increase of the radius, which is called neutron\nhalo structure.

In spite of this enough binding, the enhancement of\nthe matter radius is observed. In this study, we microscopically describe the\nstructure change of $^{22}$O core in $^{24}$O and explain the observed large\nradius based on the cluster model. Two degrees of freedom for the large radius;\nthe relative distances among four $\\alpha$ clusters and size of each $\\alpha$\ncluster are examined, where Tohsaki interaction, which has finite range\nthree-body terms is employed.

It is most interesting that while the usual considerations of\nthe cosmological dynamics deals heavily in the singularities produced by the\ndiscontinuities of the second kind (a.k.a. the essential discontinuities) of\none (or more) of the physical parameters, almost no research exists to date\nthat would turn to their natural extension/counterpart: the singularities\ninduced by the discontinuities of the first kind (a.k.a. the jump\ndiscontinuities). It is this oversight that this article aims to amend. In\nfact, it demonstrates that the inclusion of such singularities allows one to\nproduce a number of very interesting scenarios of cosmological evolution. For\nexample, it produces the cosmological models with a finite value of the\nequation of state parameter $w=p/\\rho$ even when both the energy density and\nthe pressure diverge, while at the same time keeping the scale factor finite.\nSuch a dynamics is shown to be possible only when the scale factor experiences\na finite jump at some moment of time. Furthermore, if it is the first\nderivative of the scale factor that experiences a jump, then a whole new and\ndifferent type of a sudden future singularity appears. Finally, jump\ndiscontinuities suffered by either a second or third derivatives of a scale\nfactor lead to cosmological models experiencing a sudden dephantomization -- or\navoiding the phantomization altogether. This implies that theoretically there\nshould not be any obstacles for extending the cosmological evolution beyond the\ncorresponding singularities; therefore, such singularities can be considered a\nsort of a cosmological phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 15:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2017 05:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 23:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

In particular,\nwe consider the following problem. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI\nand the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we wish to determine tumor growth\nparameters and a registration map so that if we \"grow a tumor\" (using our tumor\nmodel) in the normal segmented image and then register it to the patient\nsegmented image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. We\ncall this \"the coupled problem\" because it two-way couples the biophysical\ninversion and registration problems. In the image registration step we solve a\nlarge-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an\nEulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate\nparameters in a reaction-diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a\npartial differential equation.\n  In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained\noptimization formulation of the coupled problem, the derivation of the\noptimality conditions, and the derivation of a Picard iterative scheme for the\nsolution of the coupled problem. In addition, we perform several tests to\nexperimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical\ndatasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in\ndifferent usage scenarios. We demonstrate that we can accurately solve the\ncoupled problem in three dimensions ($256^3$ resolution) in a few minutes using\n11 dual-x86 nodes. Also, we demonstrate that, with our coupled approach, we can\nsuccessfully register normal MRI to tumor-bearing MRI while obtaining Dice\ncoefficients that match those achieved when registering of normal-to-normal\nMRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 03:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 14:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}
