We consider fine-grained\nlepidoptera (moth/butterfly) species recognition as the representative problem\nsince it involves repetition of localized patterns and textures that may be\nexploited for discrimination. We evaluate the performance of LOOP against its\npredecessors as well as few other popular descriptors. Besides experiments on\nstandard benchmarks, we also introduce a new small image dataset on NZ\nLepidoptera. Loop performs as well or better on all datasets evaluated compared\nto previous binary descriptors. The new dataset and demo code of the proposed\nmethod are to be made available through the lead author's academic webpage and\nGitHub.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 19:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 21:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

The proposed algorithm is robust in the sense that it is designed to\ncope with the uncertainty arising from a small number of training samples. This\nscenario is highly relevant in wireless networks where training has to be\nperformed on short time scales because of a fast time-varying communication\nenvironment. The first part of this work studies the set of feasible rates and\nshows that this set is compact. We then prove that the mapping relating a\nfeasible rate vector to the unique fixed point of the non-linear cell-load\nmapping is monotone and uniformly continuous. Utilizing these properties, we\napply an approximation framework that achieves the best worst-case performance.\nFurthermore, the approximation preserves the monotonicity and continuity\nproperties. Simulations show that the proposed method exhibits better\nrobustness and accuracy for small training sets in comparison with standard\napproximation techniques for multivariate data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 19:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 17:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:26:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 14:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

After such a\nmerger, a compact remnant is left over whose nature depends primarily on the\nmasses of the inspiralling objects and on the equation of state of nuclear\nmatter. This could be either a black hole or a neutron star (NS), with the\nlatter being either long-lived or too massive for stability implying delayed\ncollapse to a black hole. Here, we present a search for gravitational waves\nfrom the remnant of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 using data from\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We search for short ($\\lesssim1$ s) and\nintermediate-duration ($\\lesssim 500$ s) signals, which includes\ngravitational-wave emission from a hypermassive NS or supramassive NS,\nrespectively. We find no signal from the post-merger remnant. Our derived\nstrain upper limits are more than an order of magnitude larger than those\npredicted by most models. For short signals, our best upper limit on the\nroot-sum-square of the gravitational-wave strain emitted from 1--4 kHz is\n$h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=2.1\\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 50% detection\nefficiency. For intermediate-duration signals, our best upper limit at 50%\ndetection efficiency is $h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=8.4\\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for\na millisecond magnetar model, and $h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=5.9\\times 10^{-22}$\nHz$^{-1/2}$ for a bar-mode model. These results indicate that post-merger\nemission from a similar event may be detectable when advanced detectors reach\ndesign sensitivity or with next-generation detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

Studies with\nmonozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins allow us to estimate heritability by\nfitting an \"ACE\" model which estimates the proportion of trait variance\nexplained by additive genetic (A), common shared environment (C), and unique\nnon-shared environmental (E) latent effects, thus helping us better understand\ndisease risk and etiology. In this paper, we develop a flexible generalized\nestimating equations framework (\"GEE2\") for fitting twin ACE models that\nrequires minimal distributional assumptions, rather only the first two moments\nneed to be correctly specified. We prove that two commonly used methods for\nestimating heritability, the normal ACE model (\"NACE\") and Falconer's method,\ncan both be fit within this unified GEE2 framework, which additionally provides\nrobust standard errors. Although the traditional Falconer's method cannot\ndirectly adjust for covariates, we show that the corresponding GEE2 version\n(\"GEE2-Falconer\") can incorporate covariate effects for both mean and\nvariance-level parameters (e.g. let heritability vary by sex or age). Given\nnon-normal data, we show that the GEE2 models attain significantly better\ncoverage of the true heritability compared to the traditional NACE and\nFalconer's methods. Finally, we demonstrate an important scenario where the\nNACE model produces biased estimates of heritability while Falconer's method\nremains unbiased. Overall, we recommend using the robust and flexible\nGEE2-Falconer model for estimating heritability in twin studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 20:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

We trained the networks with manual brain masks on 250 stacks of\ntraining images, and tested on 17 stacks of normal fetal brain images as well\nas 18 stacks of extremely challenging cases based on extreme motion, noise, and\nseverely abnormal brain shape. Experimental results show that our U-net\napproach outperformed the other methods and achieved average Dice metrics of\n96.52% and 78.83% in the normal and challenging test sets, respectively. With\nan unprecedented performance and a test run time of about 1 second, our network\ncan be used to segment the fetal brain in real-time while fetal MRI slices are\nbeing acquired. This can enable real-time motion tracking, motion detection,\nand 3D reconstruction of fetal brain MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

This energy band is particularly important for prompt emission studies,\nsince it is towards low energies that the observed spectral shape is in\ndisagreement with the synchrotron predictions. Unfortunately, the number of\ncases where XRT started observing the GRB location during the prompt phase is\nvery limited. In this work we collect a sample of 34 GRBs and perform joint\nXRT+BAT spectral analysis of prompt radiation, extending a previous study\nfocused on the 14 brightest cases. Fermi-GBM observations are included in the\nanalysis when available (13 cases), allowing the characterization of prompt\nspectra from soft X-rays to MeV energies.

Quantum Gaussian channels model the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves through optical fibers and free space in\nthe quantum regime, and provide the mathematical model to determine the maximum\nrates achievable by quantum communication devices for communication and quantum\nkey distribution. The first inequality proven in this thesis is the quantum\nEntropy Power Inequality, which provides a lower bound to the output entropy of\nthe beam-splitter or of the squeezing in terms of the entropies of the two\ninputs. The second inequality states that Gaussian states minimize the output\nentropy of the one-mode quantum Gaussian attenuator among all the input states\nwith a given entropy, and was a longstanding conjecture in quantum\ncommunication theory. The generalization of this inequality to the multimode\nattenuator would determine its triple trade-off region and its capacity region\nfor broadcast communication to two receivers.

Because of high data volume, setting the\nthreshold for each detector in such a system is an essential yet underdeveloped\nconfiguration issue that, if slightly mistuned, can leave the system useless,\neither producing a myriad of alerts and flooding downstream systems, or giving\nnone.

However, a\nwell established measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus\nformal understanding of the effect of depth on their ability to correlate data\nthroughout time is limited. Specifically, existing depth efficiency results on\nconvolutional networks do not suffice in order to account for the success of\ndeep RNNs on data of varying lengths. In order to address this, we introduce a\nmeasure of the network's ability to support information flow across time,\nreferred to as the Start-End separation rank, which reflects the distance of\nthe function realized by the recurrent network from modeling no dependency\nbetween the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep\nrecurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are combinatorially\nhigher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish\nthat depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent\nnetworks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of\nquantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN\narchitectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our\nresults by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent\nArithmetic Circuits, which merge the hidden state with the input via the\nMultiplicative Integration operation, and empirically demonstrate the discussed\nphenomena on common RNNs.

Learning a useful feature representation\nfrom graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks\nsuch as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others.\nMany existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or\nestimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task.\nExamples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as\nwell as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk\nused by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This\nhas three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently\ntransductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second,\nthey are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which\nis impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support\nfor attributed graphs.\n  To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for\ninductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed\nrandom walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning\na function $\\Phi : \\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x} \\rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute\nvector $\\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x}$ to a type $w$.

In order to investigate the impact of the radiation field on the\nevolution of the jets, we compare our results with purely hydrodynamical jets.\nComparing among jets driven by RRH, we find that radiation pressure dominated\njets propagate slightly faster than gas pressure dominated ones. Finally, we\nconstruct the luminosity Light Curves (LCs) associated with all these cases.\nThe construction of LCs uses the fluxes of the radiation field which is fully\ncoupled to the hydrodynamics equations during the evolution. The main\nproperties of the jets propagating on the stratified surrounding medium are\nthat the LCs show the same order of magnitude as the gamma-ray luminosity of\ntypical Long Gamma-Ray Bursts $10^{50}-10^{54}$erg/s and the difference between\nthe radiation and gas temperatures is of nearly one order of magnitude. The\nproperties of jets breaking out from the progenitor star model are that the LCs\nare of the order of magnitude of low-luminosity GRBs $10^{46}-10^{49}$ erg/s,\nand in this scenario the difference between the gas and radiation temperature\nis of four orders of magnitude, which is a case far from thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 22:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 21:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Those ensembles are closed under the\nrespective convolutions and, thus, build a semi-group when adding by hand a\nunit element. They even have a semi-group action on the polynomial ensembles.\nMoreover in several works transformations of the bi-orthogonal functions and\nkernels of a given polynomial ensemble were derived when performing an additive\nor multiplicative matrix convolution with particular P\\'olya ensembles. For the\nmultiplicative matrix convolution on the complex square matrices the\ntransformations were even done for general P\\'olya ensembles. In the present\nwork we generalize these results to the additive convolution on Hermitian\nmatrices, on Hermitian anti-symmetric matrices, on Hermitian anti-self-dual\nmatrices and on rectangular complex matrices. For this purpose we derive the\nbi-orthogonal functions and the corresponding kernel for a general P\\'olya\nensemble which was not done before. With the help of these results we find\ntransformation formulas for the convolution with a fixed matrix or a random\nmatrix drawn from a general polynomial ensemble. As an example we consider\nP\\'olya ensembles with an associated weight which is a P\\'olya frequency\nfunction of infinite order. But we also explicitly evaluate the Gaussian\nunitary ensemble as well as the complex Laguerre (aka Wishart, Ginibre or\nchiral Gaussian unitary) ensemble. All results hold for finite matrix\ndimension. Furthermore we derive a recursive relation between Toeplitz\ndeterminants which appears as a by-product of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 22:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

In this paper, we\npropose two discrete-time dynamical systems that explain how an appraisal\nnetwork \\textcolor{blue}{converges to} social balance from an initially\nunbalanced configuration. These two models are based on two different\nsocio-psychological mechanisms respectively: the homophily mechanism and the\ninfluence mechanism. Our main theoretical contribution is a comprehensive\nanalysis for both models in three steps. First, we establish the well-posedness\nand bounded evolution of the interpersonal appraisals. Second, we fully\ncharacterize the set of equilibrium points; for both models, each equilibrium\nnetwork is composed by an arbitrary number of complete subgraphs satisfying\nstructural balance. Third, we establish the equivalence among three distinct\nproperties: non-vanishing appraisals, convergence to all-to-all appraisal\nnetworks, and finite-time achievement of social balance. In addition to\ntheoretical analysis, Monte Carlo validations illustrates how the non-vanishing\nappraisal condition holds for generic initial conditions in both models.\nMoreover, numerical comparison between the two models indicate that the\nhomophily-based model might be a more universal explanation for the formation\nof social balance. Finally, adopting the homophily-based model, we present\nnumerical results on the mediation and globalization of local conflicts, the\ncompetition for allies, and the asymptotic formation of a single versus two\nfactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 00:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 08:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 23:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 18:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 23:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 13:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

Specifically, a large pre-trained teacher network is used to\nobserve samples from the training data.

Even without a load, energy storage systems experience a\nreduction of the stored energy through self-discharge. In some storage\ntechnologies, the rate of self-discharge can exceed 50% of the stored energy\nper day. In this paper, we investigate the self-discharge phenomenon in energy\nstorage using a queueing system model, which we refer to as leakage queue. When\nthe average net charge is positive, we discover that the leakage queue operates\nin one of two regimes: a leakage-dominated regime and a capacity-dominated\nregime. We find that in the leakage-dominated regime, the stored energy\nstabilizes at a point that is below the storage capacity. Under suitable\nindependence assumptions for energy supply and demand, the stored energy in\nthis regime closely follows a normal distribution. We present two methods for\ncomputing probabilities of underflow and overflow at a leakage queue.

The\nmethodology, called soft cost-sensitive classification, is established from a\nmulticriteria optimization problem of the cost and the error rate, and can be\nviewed as regularizing cost-sensitive classification with the error rate. The\nsimple methodology allows immediate improvements of existing cost-sensitive\nclassification algorithms. Experiments on the benchmark and the real-world data\nsets show that our proposed methodology indeed achieves lower test error rates\nand similar (sometimes lower) test costs than existing cost-sensitive\nclassification algorithms. We also demonstrate that the methodology can be\nextended for considering the weighted error rate instead of the original error\nrate. This extension is useful for tackling unbalanced classification problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 02:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}

However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with\nmultiple memory modules introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where\nno computation occurs in memory modules, the physical address space is\ninterleaved at a fine granularity among all memory modules to help improve the\nutilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic.\nHowever, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful\nplacement of data in memory modules such that near-data computations and their\nexclusively used data can be localized in individual memory modules, while\ndistributing shared data among memory modules to reduce hotspots. In order to\naddress this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable\ncollections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among memory\nmodules (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual memory\nmodules (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to\nlocalize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access\npattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is\nlocated.

For this\npurpose, this paper proposes a method to detect the directed links between IUs\nof time multiplexing communication networks from their transmission start and\nend times. It models the response mechanism of commonly used communication\nprotocols using Granger causality: the probability of an IU starting a\ntransmission after another IU's transmission ends increases if the former is a\nreceiver of the latter. This paper proposes a non-parametric test statistic for\ndetecting such behavior. To help differentiate between a response and the\nopportunistic access of available spectrum, the same test statistic is used to\nestimate the response time of each link. The causal structure of the response\nis studied through a discrete time Markov chain that abstracts the IUs' medium\naccess protocol and focuses on the response time and response probability of 2\nIUs.

It is broadly accepted that the 40 ka\nglacial cycles were driven by cyclical changes in obliquity. However, this\nforcing does not explain the ~100 ka glacial cycles. Mechanisms have been\nproposed for ~100 ka cycles, but none are universally accepted. Any proposed\nmechanism for ~100 ka glacial cycles must give the Earth's climate system a\nmemory of tens-of-thousands-of-years. This timescale is difficult to achieve\nfor surface processes, however it is possible for the solid Earth. Recent work\nsuggests volcanic CO2 emissions change in response to glacial cycles and that\nthere could be a ~50 ka delay in that response. Such a lagged response could\ndrive glacial cycles from 40 ka cycles to an integer multiple of the forcing\nperiod. Under what conditions could the climate system admit such a response?\nWe investigate this using a reduced-complexity model to establish the threshold\nvolcanic variations required to induce 100 ka glacial cycles. This threshold is\ncompared to the probable range of volcanic activity over glacial cycles. Our\nmodel is composed of three component models for energy balance, ice sheet\ngrowth and atmospheric CO2. The model is driven by insolation alone, with other\ncomponents varying according to a system of coupled, differential equations.\nThe model replicates modern climate conditions and seasonality, CO2-doubling\nexperiments, and - when forced with ice core CO2 - the late-Pleistocene sea\nlevel record. We obtain a switch from 40 ka to ~100 ka cycles as the mid-ocean\nridge CO2 response to glacial cycles is increased. These ~100 ka cycles are\nphase-locked to obliquity, lasting 80 or 120 ka. The mid-ocean ridge response\nrequired is, at best, just within a 95% confidence interval of MOR CO2\nemissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 04:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 14:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

On the one hand,\ncontext-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong\nprivacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On\nthe other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic\nprivacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data\nholder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by\nintroducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative\nadversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization\nschemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is\nformulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that\nsanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the\nindividuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the\nprivate variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we\ninvestigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the\nbinary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models,\nwe derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that\nthe privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion)\nmatch the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can\nbe easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 05:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 00:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Polygenicity\nof complex diseases, which refers to the phenomenon that a vast number of risk\nvariants collectively contribute to the heritability of complex diseases with\nmodest individual effects, have been widely accepted. This imposes a major\nchallenge towards fully characterizing the genetic bases of complex diseases.\nAn immediate implication of polygenicity is that a much larger sample size is\nrequired to detect risk variants with weak/moderate effects.

Electron. Imaging, 25(2), 2016] that one can\nperform fast non-local means (NLM) denoising of one-dimensional signals using a\nmethod called lifting. The cost of lifting is independent of the patch length,\nwhich dramatically reduces the run-time for large patches. Unfortunately, it is\ndifficult to directly extend lifting for non-local means denoising of images.\nTo bypass this, the authors proposed a separable approximation in which the\nimage rows and columns are filtered using lifting. The overall algorithm is\nsignificantly faster than NLM, and the results are comparable in terms of PSNR.\nHowever, the separable processing often produces vertical and horizontal\nstripes in the image. This problem was previously addressed by using a\nbilateral filter-based post-smoothing, which was effective in removing some of\nthe stripes. In this letter, we demonstrate that stripes can be mitigated in\nthe first place simply by involving the neighboring rows (or columns) in the\nfiltering. In other words, we use a two-dimensional search (similar to NLM),\nwhile still using one-dimensional patches (as in the previous proposal). The\nnovelty is in the observation that one can use lifting for performing\ntwo-dimensional searches. The proposed approach produces artifact-free images,\nwhose quality and PSNR are comparable to NLM, while being significantly faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 06:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to\ncreate a simulated Hubble diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints.\nWe show that Euclid should detect approximately 140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z ~\n3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70 if we lower\nour photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the\nstudy of SLSNe-I at z>1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation\nrates, galaxy populations, the interstellar and intergalactic medium. In\naddition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints on a\ntime-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w(a), when combined with\nlocal SLSNe-I and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. We\nshow that Euclid will observe hundreds of SLSNe-I for free.

The weak nuclear\nactivities of NGC 4993 suggest that it is a low-luminosity active galactic\nnuclear (LLAGN). We build the multi-waveband spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of NGC 4993 from literatures.

At\npresent, one of its biggest challenges is to effectively prove entailments\ncontaining inductive heap predicates. These entailments are usually proof\nobligations generated when verifying programs that manipulate complex data\nstructures like linked lists, trees, or graphs.\n  To assist in proving such entailments, this paper introduces a lemma\nsynthesis framework, which automatically discovers lemmas to serve as eureka\nsteps in the proofs. Mathematical induction and template-based constraint\nsolving are two pillars of our framework. To derive the supporting lemmas for a\ngiven entailment, the framework firstly identifies possible lemma templates\nfrom the entailment's heap structure. It then sets up unknown relations among\neach template's variables and conducts structural induction proof to generate\nconstraints about these relations. Finally, it solves the constraints to find\nout actual definitions of the unknown relations, thus discovers the lemmas. We\nhave integrated this framework into a prototype prover and have experimented it\non various entailment benchmarks. The experimental results show that our\nlemma-synthesis-assisted prover can prove many entailments that could not be\nhandled by existing techniques. This new proposal opens up more opportunities\nto automatically reason with complex inductive heap predicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 10:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 15:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 07:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

Comparing with\nexisting approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is\nknown or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential\noperators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential\noperators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed\nPDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to\neasily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive\nand predictive power of the network.

The valley pseudospin in transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers is a promising degree of freedom for such\ncontrol, with the optical Stark effect allowing for valley-selective\nmanipulation of energy levels in WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ using ultrafast optical\npulses. Despite these advances, understanding of valley-sensitive optical Stark\nshifts in TMDCs has been limited by reflectance-based detection methods where\nthe signal is small and prone to background effects. More sensitive\npolarization-based spectroscopy is required to better probe ultrafast Stark\nshifts for all-optical manipulation of valley energy levels. Here, we show\ntime-resolved Kerr rotation to be a more sensitive probe of the\nvalley-selective optical Stark effect in monolayer TMDCs. Compared to the\nestablished time-resolved reflectance methods, Kerr rotation is less sensitive\nto background effects. Kerr rotation provides a five-fold improvement in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the Stark effect optical signal and a more precise\nestimate of the energy shift. This increased sensitivity allows for observation\nof an optical Stark shift in monolayer MoS$_2$ that exhibits both valley- and\nenergy-selectivity, demonstrating the promise of this method for investigating\nthis effect in other layered materials and heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 14:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

In order to optimize and\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed models, the mean square error (MSE)\nand correlation co-efficient were calculated for each model between the\npredicted and the measured received power for the selected area before and\nafter applying an appropriate correction factor. Based on this, the Extended\nCOST-231 Hata prediction model proved to correlate well with the measured\nvalues since it showed least Mean Square Error (MSE) but with highest\ncorrelation co-efficient. Through comparative analysis of the corrected models,\nthe Extended COST-231 Hata model could be applied for effective planning of the\nradio systems in Ghana and the subregion at large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 19:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

In this paper, the tropospheric\nscintillation of Bangladesh, a subtropical country, is predicted based on\nmeasured climatic parameters, like relative humidity, temperature. In this\nprediction, ITU scintillation model are used. Four major cities, named Dhaka,\nChittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet, of Bangladesh are selected for prediction of\nscintillation. From the simulation result, Rajshahi is found to be the most\nbadly affected region by the scintillation fade depth (SFD), which is followed\nby Chittagong and the SFD is minimum in Dhaka and Sylhet. The difference in\nSFDs among the considered cities does not vary heavily. It is also found that\nthe SFD varies from 3 dB to 13 dB depending on the frequency in used. Moreover,\nhigher scintillation is found in rainy season of Bangladesh. During this\nperiod, the scintillation becomes double of the average figure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 04:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

In part this has lowered the barriers to entry of\nexploring and monitoring larger areas of the earth's oceans. However, these\nadvances have been mostly focused on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) or\nshallow water autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). One of the main drivers\nfor high cost in the deep water domain is the challenge of localizing such\nvehicles using acoustics. A low cost one-way travel time underwater ranging\nsystem is proposed to assist in localizing deep water submersibles. The system\nconsists of location aware anchor buoys at the surface and underwater nodes.\nThis paper presents a comparison of methods together with details on the\nphysical implementation to allow its integration into a deep sea micro AUV\ncurrently in development. Additional simulation results show error reductions\nby a factor of three.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

By the use of the Kirchhoff approximation a closed form mathematical\nexpression for the angular dependence of the mean differential reflection\ncoefficient is derived under the assumption that the surface is illuminated by\na plane incident wave. It is shown that this quantity can be expressed in terms\nof the isotropic, bivariate ($\\alpha$-stable) L\\'evy distribution of a\nstability parameter that is two times the Hurst exponent of the underlying\nsurface. Features of the expression for the mean differential reflection\ncoefficient are discussed, and its predictions compare favorably over large\nregions of parameter space to results obtained from rigorous computer\nsimulations based on equations of scattering theory. It is demonstrated how the\nHurst exponent and the topothesy of the self-affine surface can be inferred\nfrom scattering data it produces.

In this paper, we want to uncover the methodological logic of the\nEinsteinian program, which animated the whole program and its development, and\nas it was revealed in SR, GR, and unified field theory. We aver that the same\nmethodological logic animated all these theories as Einstein's work progressed.\nEach of these theories contributed towards constructing Einstein's ambitious\nprogram. This paper is not a paper in the history of Relativity, but, rather,\nit utilizes our knowledge of this history to uncover the methodological logic\nof the relativity program and its development. This logic is latent in the\nhistorical narrative, but is not identical to it. We hope to show that the\nEinsteinian relativity project is still relevant today as a theoretical scheme,\ndespite its failures and despite quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 06:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}
