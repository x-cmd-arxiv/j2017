It is well known that any triangulation\nof a point set can be reconfigured to any other triangulation by some sequence\nof flips. We explore this question in the setting where each edge of a\ntriangulation has a label, and a flip transfers the label of the removed edge\nto the new edge.\n  It is not true that every labelled triangulation of a point set can be\nreconfigured to every other labelled triangulation via a sequence of flips. We\ncharacterize when this is possible by proving the \\emph{Orbit Conjecture} of\nBose, Lubiw, Pathak and Verdonschot which states that \\emph{all} labels can be\nsimultaneously mapped to their destination if and only if \\emph{each} label\nindividually can be mapped to its destination.\n  Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a sequence of flips\nto reconfigure one labelled triangulation to another, if such a sequence\nexists, and we prove an upper bound of $O(n^7)$ on the length of the flip\nsequence.\n  Our proof uses the topological result that the sets of pairwise non-crossing\nedges on a planar point set form a simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a\nhigh-dimensional ball (this follows from a result of Orden and Santos; we give\na different proof based on a shelling argument). The dual cell complex of this\nsimplicial ball, called the \\emph{flip complex}, has the usual flip graph as\nits $1$-skeleton. We use properties of the $2$-skeleton of the flip complex to\nprove the Orbit Conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 20:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

This decomposition permits the normal parts of the tensor\n(represented by the eigenvalues) to be separated explicitly from the non-normal\neffects. Given the restricted {E}uler approximation to the VGT dynamics is\nwritten in terms of the isotropic part of the pressure Hessian and the\ninvariants of the characteristic equation of the VGT (in turn expressed in\nterms of the eigenvalues), the non-normal terms are related to the non-local\naspects of the dynamics and the anisotropic part of the pressure Hessian. Using\na direct numerical simulation of HIT, we show that the norm of the non-normal\npart of the tensor is of a similar order to the normal part, highlighting the\nimportance of non-local effects. In fact, beneath the discriminant function in\na Q-R plot, all enstrophy arises from the non-normal term, meaning that\nvorticity and intermediate strain eigenvector alignment in this region is an\nimmediate consequence of non-normality.

The CS is found to be associated with a set of peculiar homologous\nflares that exhibit unique X-shaped ribbons and loops occurring in a\nquadrupolar magnetic configuration. This is evidenced by that the field lines\ntraced from the CS to the photosphere form an X shape which nearly precisely\nreproduces the shape of the observed flare ribbons, suggesting that the flare\nis a product of the dissipation of the CS through reconnection. The CS forms in\na hyperbolic flux tube, which is an intersection of two quasi-separatrix\nlayers. The recurrence of the X-shaped flares might be attributed to the\nrepetitive formation and dissipation of the CS, as driven by the photospheric\nfootpoint motions.

However, computing this quantity from atomic-scale simulations is\nfar from trivial. As a consequence, all too often the potential energy of the\nsystem is used as a proxy, overlooking entropic and anharmonic effects. Here we\ndiscuss a combination of different thermodynamic integration routes to obtain\nthe absolute Gibbs free energy of a solid system starting from a harmonic\nreference state. This approach enables the direct comparison between the free\nenergy of different structures, circumventing the need to sample the transition\npaths between them. We showcase this thermodynamic integration scheme by\ncomputing the Gibbs free energy associated with a vacancy in BCC iron, and the\nintrinsic stacking fault free energy of nickel. These examples highlight the\npitfalls of estimating the free energy of crystallographic defects only using\nthe minimum potential energy, which overestimates the vacancy free energy by\n60% and the stacking-fault energy by almost 300% at temperatures close to the\nmelting point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 09:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

To deal with\nthese data quality problems, a class of common employed tools are dependency\nrules, such as Functional Dependencies (FDs), Conditional Functional\nDependencies (CFDs) and Edition Rules (ERs), etc. The stronger expressing\nability a dependency has, data with the better quality can be obtained. To the\nbest of our knowledge, all previous dependencies treat each attribute value as\na non-splittable whole. Actually however, in many applications, part of a value\nmay contains meaningful information, indicating that more powerful dependency\nrules to handle data quality problems are possible. In this paper, we consider\nof discovering such type of dependencies in which the left hand side is part of\na regular-expression-like paradigm, named Paradigm Dependencies (PDs). PDs tell\nthat if a string matches the paradigm, element at the specified position can\ndecides a certain other attribute's value. We propose a framework in which\nstrings with similar coding rules and different lengths are clustered together\nand aligned vertically, from which PDs can be discovered directly. The aligning\nproblem is the key component of this framework and is proved in NP-Complete. A\ngreedy algorithm is introduced in which the clustering and aligning tasks can\nbe accomplished simultaneously. Because of the greedy algorithm's high time\ncomplexity, several pruning strategies are proposed to reduce the running time.\nIn the experimental study, three real datasets as well as several synthetical\ndatasets are employed to verify our methods' effectiveness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 09:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

Large data centers with multiple\nracks/disks or local networks of storage devices (e.g. sensor network) are good\napplications of the suggested clustered model. In realistic scenarios involving\nclustered storage structures, repairing storage nodes using intact nodes\nresiding in other clusters is more bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes\nbased on information from intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to\ndifferentiate between intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair\nbandwidth in modeling distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is\nobtained as a function of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems,\nnamely, node storage capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster\nrepair bandwidth. The capacity is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a\nmonotonic decreasing function of number of clusters, as the number of storage\nnodes increases without bound. Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets\nof required resources which enable reliable storage are obtained in a\nclosed-form solution. Specifically, it is shown that the cross-cluster traffic\ncan be minimized to zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes possible) by\nallowing extra resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster repair\nbandwidth, according to the law specified in the closed-form. The network\ncoding schemes with zero cross-cluster traffic are defined as intra-cluster\nrepairable codes, which are shown to be a class of the previously developed\nlocally repairable codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 11:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 14:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

It admits a $(1-1/e)$-factor approximation\nalgorithm if the influence function is submodular. Otherwise, in the worst\ncase, the problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of\n$N^{1-\\varepsilon}$. This paper studies whether this worst-case hardness result\ncan be circumvented by making assumptions about either the underlying network\ntopology or the cascade model. All of our assumptions are motivated by many\nreal life social network cascades.\n  First, we present strong inapproximability results for a very restricted\nclass of networks called the (stochastic) hierarchical blockmodel, a special\ncase of the well-studied (stochastic) blockmodel in which relationships between\nblocks admit a tree structure. We also provide a dynamic-program based\npolynomial time algorithm which optimally computes a directed variant of the\ninfluence maximization problem on hierarchical blockmodel networks. Our\nalgorithm indicates that the inapproximability result is due to the\nbidirectionality of influence between agent-blocks.\n  Second, we present strong inapproximability results for a class of influence\nfunctions that are \"almost\" submodular, called 2-quasi-submodular. Our\ninapproximability results hold even for any 2-quasi-submodular $f$ fixed in\nadvance. This result also indicates that the \"threshold\" between submodularity\nand nonsubmodularity is sharp, regarding the approximability of influence\nmaximization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 12:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 17:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The secondary explosion may propagate with a speed of up to 1000 m/s\nproducing overpressures of over 8-10 atm. Since detonation is the only\nestablished theory that allows a rapid burning producing a high pressure that\ncan be sustained in open areas, the generally accepted view was that the\nmechanism explaining the high rate of combustion in dust explosions is\ndeflagration to detonation transition. In the present work we propose a\ntheoretical substantiation of the alternative propagation mechanism explaining\norigin of the secondary explosion producing the high speeds of combustion and\nhigh overpressures in unconfined dust explosions. We show that clustering of\ndust particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a significant increase of the\nthermal radiation absorption length ahead of the advancing flame front. This\neffect ensures that clusters of dust particles are exposed to and heated by the\nradiation from hot combustion products of large gaseous explosions sufficiently\nlong time to become multi-point ignition kernels in a large volume ahead of the\nadvancing flame front. The ignition times of fuel-air mixture by the\nradiatively heated clusters of particles is considerably reduced compared to\nthe ignition time by the isolated particle. The radiation-induced multi-point\nignitions of a large volume of fuel-air ahead of the primary flame efficiently\nincrease the total flame area, giving rise to the secondary explosion, which\nresults in high rates of combustion and overpressures required to account for\nthe observed level of overpressures and damages in unconfined dust explosions,\nsuch as e.g. the 2005 Buncefield explosion and several vapor cloud explosions\nof severity similar to that of the Buncefield incident.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 15:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 08:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Additionally, when the input is corrupted with\nnoises, the reconstruction error of the corrupted input also can not be lower\nthan a lower bound. 2) The reconstruction of a hidden representation achieving\nits ideal situation is the necessary condition for the reconstruction of the\ninput to reach the ideal state. 3) Minimizing the Frobenius norm of the\nJacobian matrix of the hidden representation has a deficiency and may result in\na much worse local optimum value. We believe that minimizing the reconstruction\nerror of the hidden representation is more robust than minimizing the Frobenius\nnorm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation.

This paradigm has a variety of concepts\nwith an abstraction level usually high for most beginners, even the ones who\nalready code in an imperative language. Furthermore, transitioning from\nimperative programming to OOP is a complex issue, with various inappropriate\nside effects. A significant effort has been pursued in the search of motivating\nand attractive solutions for such issues. One of those is the use of playful\nenvironments that merge games with learning. In this work, we report our\nexperience with OOP learning workshops by means of games, challenges and\ncompetitions, supported by Greenfoot and Robocode learning environments. A\nworkshop with sophomore students in a Computer Engineering program is presented\nhere. Lessons learning to motive students include: design of motivating\nexamples, use of competitive challenges, and an appropriate ratio between\ntutors and students. Results suggest that the workshop was a practical and\neffective way to introduce OOP and motivate students to learn it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 18:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 00:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

In order to\nunderstand the oxidation states of hydrogen and also the character of chemical\nbond present in AABH we have made charge density, electron localization\nfunction, Born effective charge, Bader effective charge, and density of states\nanalyses using result from the density functional calculations. Our detailed\nanalyses show that hydrogen is in amphoteric behavior with hydrogen closer to\nboron is in negative oxidation state and that closer to nitrogen is in the\npositive oxidation state. Due to the presence of finite covalent bonding\nbetween the consitutents in AABH the oxidation state of hydrogen is\nnon-interger value. The confirmation of the presence of amphtoric behavior of\nhydrogen in AABH has implication in hydrogen storage applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 05:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

This study is meant to provide framework for improved thermal system\nwhere induced automated shear on chemical (fluid) will in- crease velocity of\nfluid and hence enhances the smooth flow. This study will also throw light on\nan important aspect of controlling temperature of thermal system in the context\nof emitting thermal radiation. Exact expressions for velocity field,\ntemperature and mass concentration corresponding to the radiative flow of\nviscous fluid have been calculated. These expressions are obtained by using\nLaplace transform of corresponding fractional differential equations. The\nexpressions of temperature and mass concentration of fluid have been presented\nin series form. However, velocity field is presented in the form of integral\nsolutions. All exact expressions satisfy initial and boundary conditions. Some\nsignificant limiting cases of fluid parameters and of fractional parameters\nhave been discussed. Two special cases of shear stress; shear stress in the\nform of Heaviside function and oscillating shear stress have also been taken\ninto account to compare the behavior of fluid motion graphically. An analysis\nhas also been prepared to compare analytical and numerical solutions for\nconcentration of fluid using numerical algorithm. Validity of analytical\nsolutions up to a certain order of accuracy has been es- tablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 21:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}
