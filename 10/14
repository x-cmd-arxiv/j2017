Using the barrier functions of Fathi and Pageault, we\nobtain for each of these extended notions a dichotomy result that a transitive\nsystem of each type either satisfies the corresponding mixing condition or else\nfactors onto an appropriate type of equicontinuous minimal system. The\nclassical dichotomy result for minimal systems follows when it is shown that a\nminimal system is weak mixing if and only if it is vague mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 16:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

In this study, we search for non-thermal radio emission from the\n55 Cnc system which has 5 known exoplanets. According to theoretical\npredictions 55 Cnc e, the innermost planet, is among the best targets for this\nsearch. We observed for 18 hours with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) Low Band\nAntenna in the frequency range 26-73 MHz with full-polarization and covered 85%\nof the orbital phase of 55 Cnc e. During the observations four digital beams\nwithin the station beam were recorded simultaneously on 55 Cnc, nearby \"empty\"\nsky, a bright radio source, and a pulsar. A pipeline was created to\nautomatically find and mask radio frequency interference, calibrate the\ntime-frequency response of the telescope, and to search for bursty planetary\nradio signals in our data. Extensive tests and verifications were carried out\non the pipeline. Analysis of the first 4 hours of these observations do not\ncontain any exoplanet signal from 55 Cnc but we can confirm that our setup is\nadequate to detect faint astrophysical signals. We find a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit\nfor 55 Cnc of 230 mJy using the pulsar to estimate the sensitivity of the\nobservations and 2.6 Jy using the time-series difference between the target and\nsky beam. The full data set is still under-going analysis. In the near future\nwe will apply our observational technique and pipeline to the most promising\nexoplanet candidates for which LOFAR observations have already been obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 16:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The relation between the coherence and the\npurity of the channel respects a duality relation. It characterizes the allowed\nvalues of coherence when the channel has certain purity. This duality has been\ndepicted via the Coherence-Purity (Co-Pu) diagrams. In particular, we study the\nquantum coherence of the unital and non-unital qubit channels and find out the\nallowed region of coherence for a fixed purity. We also study coherence of\ndifferent incoherent channels, namely, incoherent operation (IO), strictly\nincoherent operation (SIO), physical incoherent operation (PIO) etc.\nInterestingly, we find that the allowed region for different incoherent\noperations maintain the relation $PIO\\subset SIO \\subset IO$. In fact, we find\nthat if PIOs are coherence preserving operations (CPO), its coherence is zero\notherwise it has unit coherence and unit purity. Interestingly, different kinds\nof qubit channels can be distinguished using the Co-Pu diagram. The unital\nchannels generally do not create coherence whereas some nonunital can. All\ncoherence breaking channels are shown to have zero coherence, whereas, this is\nnot usually true for entanglement breaking channels.

It has been suggested that\nPBHs of tens of solar masses could serve as dark matter candidates. Recent\nanalytical studies demonstrated that compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can\nserve as a sensitive test for the PBH dark matter hypothesis, since stars in\nsuch a halo-dominated system would be heated by the more massive PBHs, their\npresent-day distribution can provide strong constraints on PBH mass. In this\nstudy, we further explore this scenario with more detailed calculations, using\na combination of dynamical simulations and Bayesian inference methods. The\njoint evolution of stars and PBH dark matter is followed with a Fokker-Planck\ncode PhaseFlow. We run a large suite of such simulations for different dark\nmatter parameters, then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to constrain\nthe PBH properties with observations of ultra-faint galaxies. We find that\ntwo-body relaxation between the stars and PBH drives up the stellar core size,\nand increases the central stellar velocity dispersion. Using the observed\nhalf-light radius and velocity dispersion of stars in the compact ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxies as joint constraints, we infer that these dwarfs may have a\ncored dark matter halo with the central density in the range of 1-2\n$\\rm{M_{\\odot}/pc^3}$, and that the PBHs may have a mass range of 2-14\n$\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ if they constitute all or a substantial fraction of the dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

We\ninstantiate this concept through mid-depth, underwater navigation. This\nstrategy mitigates dead-reckoning uncertainty of a traditional inertial\nnavigation system by comparing the estimate of local, ambient flow velocity\nwith preloaded ocean current maps. The proposed navigation system is\nimplemented through a marginalized particle filter where the vehicle's states\nare sequentially tracked along with sensor bias and local turbulence that is\nnot resolved by general flow prediction. The performance of the proposed\napproach is first analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations in two artificial\nbackground flow fields, resembling real-world ocean circulation patterns,\nsuperposed with smaller-scale, turbulent components with Kolmogorov energy\nspectrum. The current-aided navigation scheme significantly improves the\ndead-reckoning performance of the vehicle even when unresolved, small-scale\nflow perturbations are present. For a 6-hour navigation with an\nautomotive-grade inertial navigation system, the current-aided navigation\nscheme results in positioning estimates with under 3% uncertainty per distance\ntraveled (UDT) in a turbulent, double-gyre flow field, and under 7.3% UDT in a\nturbulent, meandering jet flow field. Further evaluation with field test data\nand actual ocean simulation analysis demonstrates consistent performance for a\n6-hour mission, positioning result with under 25% UDT for a 24-hour navigation\nwhen provided direct heading measurements, and terminal positioning estimate\nwith 16% UDT at the cost of increased uncertainty at an early stage of the\nnavigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 18:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

We begin with an intuitive reformulation\nof Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and\ndemonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from\nthe use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert\ncoresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an\ninner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert\ncoreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one\nbased on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on\napproximation quality as a function of coreset size.

We contrast the performance of the bidding-aided CSMA\npolicy with other well-known CSMA schemes that do not take into account\n(i)-(iii), demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher spectral efficiency\nin terms of the number of bits transmitted per unit time per unit bandwidth per\nuser. The gain becomes even more visible under randomized configurations and\nrequests rather than more skewed placement configurations and deterministic\ndemand distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

In\ncontrast, monolayer alloys of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M =\nMo, W; X = S, Se) always have negative {\\Delta}H, suggesting atomic ordering,\nwhich is, however, not yet experimentally observed. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we find that the negative {\\Delta}H of cation-mixed TMD alloys\nresults from the charge transfer from weak Mo-X to nearest strong W-X bonds and\nthe negative {\\Delta}H of anion-mixed TMD alloys comes from the larger energy\ngain due to the charge transfer from Se to nearest S atoms than the energy cost\ndue to the lattice mismatch. Consequently, cation-mixed and anion-mixed alloys\nshould energetically prefer to have Mo-X-W and S-M-Se ordering, respectively.\nThe atomic ordering, however, is only locally ordered but disordered in the\nlong range due to the symmetry of TMD monolayers, as demonstrated by many\nenergetically degenerate structures for given alloy compositions. Besides, the\nlocal ordering and disordering effects on the macroscopic properties such as\nbandgaps and optical absorptions are negligible, making the experimental\nobservation of locally ordered TMD alloys challenging. We propose to take the\nadvantage of microscopic properties such as defects which strongly depend on\nlocal atomic configurations for experiments to identify the disordering and\nlocal ordering in TMD alloys. Finally, quaternary TMD alloys by mixing both\ncations and anions are studied to have a wide range of bandgaps for\noptoelectronic applications. Our work is expected to help the formation and\nutilization of TMD alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

We\nused zincoxide (ZnO) based piezoelectric transducers for blood coagulation time\nmeasurements. The method is based on the measurement of amplitude of acoustic\nreflections from a microfluidic channel which is filled with blood. The volume\nof the microfluidic channel could be as low as 1 micro-litre. A low cost\ndisposable cartridge made of glass has been designed to perform the\nmeasurements. The cartridge is composed of two glass substrates and a double\nsided tape layer where the channel is defined. One of the glass substrates has\na micromachined ZnO based transducer that operates at 400 MHz on the outer\nsurface of the cartridge where electrical connections are also provided. The\ntransducer is aligned with the channel to generate acoustic pulses in the fluid\nthat is filling the channel. The reflections coming from the top of the channel\npropagate through the liquid therefore their amplitude and phase are affected\nby the fluid properties. In the experiments whole blood was used without any\nsample preparation. The viscosity of the blood changes during coagulation\ntherefore by monitoring the amplitude of the reflection coming from the top of\nthe channel one can measure the coagulation time. The method which requires\nonly 1 micro-litre of blood has been tested with calcium and activated partial\nthromboplastin (aPTT) reagents. The proposed method has a potential to be used\nin a low cost portable coagulation time measurement system for patient\nself-testing.

Using a three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model for an\nactive-region loop, we investigate how the waves from neighboring flux tubes\ninteract in the chromosphere and corona. For a particular combination of model\nparameters we find that AWT can produce enough heat to maintain a peak\ntemperature of about 2.5 MK, somewhat lower than the temperatures of 3-4 MK\nobserved in the cores of active regions.

For\ndistributed optimization over a cluster of machines, frequent communication and\nsynchronization of all model parameters (optimization variables) can be very\ncostly. A promising solution is to use parameter servers to store different\nsubsets of the model parameters, and update them asynchronously at different\nmachines using local datasets. In this paper, we focus on distributed\noptimization of large linear models with convex loss functions, and propose a\nfamily of randomized primal-dual block coordinate algorithms that are\nespecially suitable for asynchronous distributed implementation with parameter\nservers. In particular, we work with the saddle-point formulation of such\nproblems which allows simultaneous data and model partitioning, and exploit its\nstructure by doubly stochastic coordinate optimization with variance reduction\n(DSCOVR). Compared with other first-order distributed algorithms, we show that\nDSCOVR may require less amount of overall computation and communication, and\nless or no synchronization. We discuss the implementation details of the DSCOVR\nalgorithms, and present numerical experiments on an industrial distributed\ncomputing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 21:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

As\none of the most influential privacy definitions, differential privacy provides\na rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data publishing. Differentially\nprivate interactive publishing achieves good performance in many applications;\nhowever, the curator has to release a large number of queries in a batch or a\nsynthetic dataset in the Big Data era. To provide accurate non-interactive\npublishing results in the constraint of differential privacy, two challenges\nneed to be tackled: one is how to decrease the correlation between large sets\nof queries, while the other is how to predict on fresh queries. Neither is easy\nto solve by the traditional differential privacy mechanism. This paper\ntransfers the data publishing problem to a machine learning problem, in which\nqueries are considered as training samples and a prediction model will be\nreleased rather than query results or synthetic datasets. When the model is\npublished, it can be used to answer current submitted queries and predict\nresults for fresh queries from the public. Compared with the traditional\nmethod, the proposed prediction model enhances the accuracy of query results\nfor non-interactive publishing.

The traditional method of determining conductance\nemploys the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp.\nUsing theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic\nsimulations, here we demonstrate that the traditional method conceptually fails\nto measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction\nbetween the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs\nsubstantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative\nconductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on\nneuronal information processing, we introduce the concept of effective\nconductance and propose a framework to determine it accurately. Our work\nsuggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement\nand provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 23:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The inter-modality\nand intra-modality correlation can be explored simultaneously in generative and\ndiscriminative models. Both of them beat each other to promote cross-modal\ncorrelation learning.

To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is\nimportant to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In\nthe traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the\nexcitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic\ncurrent-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total\nconductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of\nthe space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates\nsubstantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the\ninterpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to\nbe clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized\nball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron\nmodel, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the\nconductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological\ninterpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp\ncurrent and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a\nconsequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of\nconductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative\nconductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on\nneuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework\nto determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional\nimpact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal\ninformation processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic\nneuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by\nproviding a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity\nin neuronal computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

However, a detailed understanding\nof the photothermal heating and its effect on diamond growth, including the\nphase conversion conditions and the temperature-dependence of color center\nformation, has not been reported. In this work, we measure blackbody radiation\nduring LH-DAC synthesis of nanodiamond from carbon aerogel to examine these\ntemperature-dependent effects. Blackbody temperature measurements suggest that\nnanodiamond growth can occur at 16.3 GPa and 1800 K. We use Mie theory and\nanalytical heat transport to develop a predictive photothermal heating model.\nThis model demonstrates that melting the noble gas pressure medium during laser\nheating decreases the local thermal conductivity to drive a high spatial\nresolution of phase conversion to diamond.

To achieve such modular recognition, it is necessary to\nuse the output of one recognition method (which identifies the general object)\nas the input for a second method (which identifies the parts or contents). In\nrecent years, convolutional neural networks have emerged as the dominant method\nfor segmentation and classification of images. This work examines a method for\nserially connecting convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of\nmaterials inside transparent vessels. It applies one fully convolutional neural\nnet to segment the image into vessel and background, and the vessel region is\nused as an input for a second net which recognizes the contents of the glass\nvessel. Transferring the segmentation map generated by the first nets to the\nsecond net was performed using the valve filter attention method that involves\nusing different filters on different segments of the image. This modular\nsemantic segmentation method outperforms a single step method in which both the\nvessel and its contents are identified using a single net.

In the third stage, we switch to a\nmodified shift-and-invert Lanczos method to reduce bisection iterations and\ncompute the $k$-th eigenpair with validation. Numerical results with problem\nsizes up to 1.5 million are reported, and the results demonstrate the accuracy\nand efficiency of the three-stage algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 05:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 10:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Moreover, the prediction\nprocess can also be affected by inter-personal influence, known as behavioral\nmutual infectivity.

Our model is able to predict the fine-grained\ninterest from a user regarding a particular item and corresponding timestamps\nwhen an occurrence of event takes place. The proposed approach is more flexible\nto capture the dynamic characteristic of event sequences by using the temporal\npoint process to model event data and timely update its intensity function by\nRNNs. Furthermore, to improve the interpretability of the model, the attention\nmechanism is introduced to emphasize both intra-personal and inter-personal\nbehavior influence over time.

The boundary value\nproblem consists of a second order parabolic equation defined on a time-varying\nLipschitz domain in a Euclidean space and of a mixed boundary condition\ncomposed of a Robin and the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. It is assumed\nthat the time-varying domain is included in a fixed smooth domain and that a\ncertain part of the boundary of the time-varying domain is also included in the\nboundary of the fixed domain, say the fixed boundary. The Robin condition is\nimposed on a part of the boundary included in the fixed one and the Dirichlet\ncondition on the rest of the boundary. Such a parabolic boundary value problem\nalways has a unique weak solution for given data; however it does not possess a\nclassical or strong solution in general, even in the case of equations with\nconstant coefficients. The stochastic solution to the boundary value problem is\nalso considered and, by showing the equality between both the solutions, it is\nobtained the probabilistic representation for the weak solution.

Basic operations in image processing are\nsimilar, but performed in a two-dimensional structure, and hence, many of the\noptimisations in newer DSP blocks are not exploited when mapping image\nprocessing algorithms to them. We present a detailed study of two-dimensional\nspatial filter implementation on FPGAs, showing how to maximise performance\nthrough exploitation of DSP block capabilities, while also presenting a lean\nborder pixel management policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 09:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 15:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

An analytical\nexpression is derived for the amount of starlight forward-scattered by an\nexponential atmosphere that takes into account the finite angular size of the\nstar.

Note that this is \\emph{different} from\nthe perturbation of the five dimensional gravitational field equations,\nexisting in literature, and possess quantitatively new features. The\ngravitational perturbation has further been decomposed into a purely four\ndimensional part and another piece that depends on extra dimensions. The four\ndimensional gravitational perturbation now admits massive propagating degrees\nof freedom, owing to the existence of higher dimensions. We have also studied\nthe influence of these massive propagating modes on the quasi-normal mode\nfrequencies, signaling the higher dimensional nature of the spacetime, and have\ncontrasted these massive modes with the massless modes in general relativity.\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the massive modes experience much smaller\ndamping compared to the massless modes in general relativity and may even\n\\emph{dominate} over and above the general relativity contribution if one\nobserves the ringdown phase of a black hole merger event at sufficiently late\ntimes.

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm\nnamed \"CARE\" for network embedding that can be used for different types of\nnetworks including weighted, directed and complex.

CARE builds customized\npaths, which are consisted of local and global structure of network nodes, as a\nbasis for network embedding and uses the Skip-gram model to learn\nrepresentation vector of nodes. Subsequently, stochastic gradient descent is\napplied to optimize our objective function and learn the final representation\nof nodes. Our method can be scalable when new nodes are appended to network\nwithout information loss. Parallelize generation of customized random walks is\nalso used for speeding up CARE.

Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the\nanalysis of the homogeneous Erd$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$s-R\\'enyi network. However,\nneuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas.\nIn particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of\nscale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine\nthe questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to\nnetwork topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in\ninhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks.

The neurons in this active core\nhave relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network\nare quiescent.

The dynamics\nof the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with\nthe mean-field assumption.

This\npaper deviates from the traditional Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics\nsince the electromagnetic interactions of Kerr- Newman particles are dictated\nby general relativity. A Gaussian wave function is used to produce the Bohmian\ntrajectories, which are found to be multi-valued. A generalized analytic\ncontinuation (GAN) is introduced which leads to an infinite number of\ntrajectories. These include the entire set of Bohmian trajectories. This leads\nto multiple retarded times which come into play in complex space-time. If one\nweights these trajectories by their natural Bohmian weighting factors, then it\nis found that the particles do not radiate, that they are extended, and that\nthey can have a finite electrostatic self energy, thus avoiding the usual\ndivergence of the charged point particle. This effort does not in any way\ncriticize or downplay the traditional Bohmian interpretation which does not\nassume the standard electromagnetic coupling to charged particles, but it\nsuggests that a hybridization of Kerr-Newman particle theory with Bohmian\nmechanics might lead to interesting new physics, and maybe even the possibility\nof emergent quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 04:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

A crucial\ndifference between his constructivism and orthodox \"space-time realism\" is\nmodal scope. Constructivism applies to all local classical field theories,\nincluding those with multiple geometries.

They serve as the orthodox \"canon.\" Their\nhistorical roles suggest a story of inevitable progress. Physics literature\nafter c. 1920 is relevant to orthodoxy mostly as commentary on the canon, which\nclosed in the 1910s. The orthodox view explains the behavior of matter as the\nmanifestation of the real space-time geometry, which works within the canon.\nThe orthodox view, Whiggish history, and the canon relate symbiotically.\n  If one considers a theory outside the canon, space-time realism sheds little\nlight on matter's behavior.

In our\ndevelopment we propose a solution that combines the data from three different\nmodalities, MRI, MEG, and EEG, together. We propose a new Bayesian spatial\nfinite mixture model that builds on the mesostate-space model developed by\nDaunizeau and Friston (2007). Our new model incorporates two major extensions:\n(i) We combine EEG and MEG data together and formulate a joint model for\ndealing with the two modalities simultaneously; (ii) we incorporate the Potts\nmodel to represent the spatial dependence in an allocation process that\npartitions the cortical surface into a small number of latent states termed\nmesostates. The cortical surface is obtained from MRI.
