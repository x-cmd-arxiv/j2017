Despite\nthirty years worth of research, the mechanism that causes these oscillations\nand the frequencies that characterise them remain unclear. Here we show that a\nthree-dimensional wave-like structure is responsible for the low-frequency\nswitching of the dominant Dean vortex. The present study, performed via direct\nnumerical simulation, focuses on the turbulent flow through a 90 \\degree pipe\nbend preceded and followed by straight pipe segments. A pipe with curvature 0.3\n(defined as ratio between pipe radius and bend radius) is studied for a bulk\nReynolds number Re = 11 700, corresponding to a friction Reynolds number\nRe_\\tau \\approx 360. Synthetic turbulence is generated at the inflow section\nand used instead of the classical recycling method in order to avoid the\ninterference between recycling and swirl-switching frequencies. The flow field\nis analysed by three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which\nfor the first time allows the identification of the source of swirl-switching:\na wave-like structure that originates in the pipe bend. Contrary to some\nprevious studies, the flow in the upstream pipe does not show any direct\ninfluence on the swirl-switching modes. Our analysis further shows that a\nthree- dimensional characterisation of the modes is crucial to understand the\nmechanism, and that reconstructions based on 2D POD modes are incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 16:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Flares are energetic, impulsive events, and\ntheir impact on exoplanetary atmospheres needs to be taken into account when\ninterpreting transit observations. We have developed a model to describe the\nupper atmosphere of Extrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs) orbiting flaring stars. The\nmodel simulates thermal escape from the upper atmospheres of close-in EGPs.\nIonisation by solar radiation and electron impact is included and photochemical\nand diffusive transport processes are simulated. This model is used to study\nthe effect of stellar flares from the solar-like G star HD209458 and the young\nK star HD189733 on their respective planets. A hypothetical HD209458b-like\nplanet orbiting the active M star AU Mic is also simulated. We find that the\nneutral upper atmosphere of EGPs is not significantly affected by typical\nflares. Therefore, stellar flares alone would not cause large enough changes in\nplanetary mass loss to explain the variations in HD189733b transit depth seen\nin previous studies, although we show that it may be possible that an extreme\nstellar proton event could result in the required mass loss. Our simulations do\nhowever reveal an enhancement in electron number density in the ionosphere of\nthese planets, the peak of which is located in the layer where stellar X-rays\nare absorbed. Electron densities are found to reach 2.2 to 3.5 times pre-flare\nlevels and enhanced electron densities last from about 3 to 10 hours after the\nonset of the flare. The strength of the flare and the width of its spectral\nenergy distribution affect the range of altitudes that see enhancements in\nionisation. A large broadband continuum component in the XUV portion of the\nflaring spectrum in very young flare stars, such as AU Mic, results in a broad\nrange of altitudes affected in planets orbiting this star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 16:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

A mechanism is supposed to facilitate trade\nbetween these agents, if such trade is beneficial. It was recently shown that\nthe only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are\nfixed price mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p,\nand trade occurs if and only if the valuation of the buyer is at least p and\nthe valuation of the seller is at most p. The gain from trade is the increase\nin welfare that results from applying a mechanism; here we study the gain from\ntrade achievable by fixed price mechanisms. We explore this question for both\nthe bilateral trade setting, and a double auction setting where there are\nmultiple buyers and sellers. We first identify a fixed price mechanism that\nachieves a gain from trade of at least 2/r times the optimum, where r is the\nprobability that the seller's valuation does not exceed the buyer's valuation.\nThis extends a previous result by McAfee. Subsequently, we improve this\napproximation factor in an asymptotic sense, by showing that a more\nsophisticated rule for setting the fixed price results in an expected gain from\ntrade within a factor O(log(1/r)) of the optimal gain from trade. This is\nasymptotically the best approximation factor possible.

Here we combine\nexperimental data with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shape,\nstructure and stability of an insulin hexamer focusing on the role of water\nmolecules. Both X-Ray analysis and computer simulations show that the core of\nthe hexamer cavity is barrel-shaped, holding, on an average, sixteen water\nmolecules. These encapsulated and constrained molecules impart structural\nstability to the hexamer. Apart from the electrostatic interactions with Zn2+\nions, an intricate hydrogen bond network amongst cavity water and neighboring\nprotein residues stabilizes the hexameric association. These water molecules\nsolvate six glutamate residues inside the cavity decreasing electrostatic\nrepulsions amongst the negatively charged carboxylate groups. They also prevent\nassociation between glutamate residues and Zn2+ ions and maintain the integrity\nof the cavity. Simulations reveal that removal of these waters results in a\ncollapse of the cavity. Subsequent analyses also show that the hydrogen bond\nnetwork among these water molecules and protein residues that face the inner\nside of the cavity is more rigid with a slower relaxation as compared to that\nof the bulk solvent. Dynamics of cavity water reveal certain slow water\nmolecules which form the back bone of the stable hydrogen bond network.

The condensation process is governed by carbon\nchains that first condense into small carbon clusters and finally into more\nstable carbonaceous materials, which structural characteristics are comparable\nto the material formed in gas-phase condensation experiments at very high\ntemperature. We also show that the so-formed fullerene-like carbonaceous\nmaterial is transformed into a more ordered material under VUV processing. The\ncold condensation mechanisms here discussed can give fundamental clues to fully\nunderstand the balance between the timescale for dust injection, destruction\nand re-formation in the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 18:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Unlike other generative models,\nthe data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative\nmodel) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each\nminimize their own cost. GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which\neach player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players'\nparameters. One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a\ndivergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains\nits minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been\nmotivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the\nlearning process and that every step of learning should decrease the\ndivergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During GAN training,\nthe discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of\nthe divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical\ncounterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in\nsituations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would\nfail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence\nminimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in\nwhich the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be\nhelpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may\nbe more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do\nnot necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 18:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 09:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 22:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

We discuss this common misconception and show that, in\nreality, the A ring is confined by the contributions from the group of\nsatellites Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas, whose\ncumulative torques from various resonances gradually decrease the angular\nmomentum flux transported outward through the ring via density and bending\nwaves. We further argue that this decrease in angular momentum flux occurs\nthrough 'flux reversal'.\n  Furthermore, we use the magnitude of the satellites' resonance torques to\nestimate the effective viscosity profile across the A ring, showing that it\ndecreases with radius from ~50 cm2 s-1 to less than ~10 cm2 s-1. The gradual\nestimated decrease of the angular momentum flux and effective viscosity are\nroughly consistent with results obtained by balancing the shepherding torques\nfrom Pan and Daphnis with the viscous torque at the edges of the Encke and\nKeeler gaps, as well as the edge of the A ring.\n  On the other hand, the Mimas 2:1 Lindblad resonance alone seems to be capable\nof confining the edge of the B ring, and contrary to the situation in the A\nring, we show that the effective viscosity across the B ring is relatively\nconstant at ~24-30 cm2 s-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 19:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The latter\nchallenge is the time series version of the cold-start problem seen in\nrecommender systems which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in previous\nwork. A similar problem occurs when a long range forecast is required after\nonly observing a small number of time points --- a warm start forecast. With\nthese aims in mind, we focus on forecasting seasonal profiles---or baseline\ndemand---for periods on the order of a year in three cases: the long range case\nwith multiple previously observed seasonal profiles, the cold start case with\nno previous observed seasonal profiles, and the warm start case with only a\nsingle partially observed profile. Classical time series approaches that\nperform iterated step-ahead forecasts based on previous observations struggle\nto provide accurate long range predictions; in settings with little to no\nobserved data, such approaches are simply not applicable. Instead, we present a\nstraightforward framework which combines ideas from high-dimensional regression\nand matrix factorization on a carefully constructed data matrix. Key to our\nformulation and resulting performance is leveraging (1) repeated patterns over\nfixed periods of time and across series, and (2) metadata associated with the\nindividual series; without this additional data, the cold-start/warm-start\nproblems are nearly impossible to solve.

This paper endeavors to augment these\ngame-theoretic methods with policies that would allow agents to react\non-the-fly to losses of this information. Unfortunately, we show that even if a\nsingle agent loses communication with one other weakly-coupled agent, this can\ncause arbitrarily-bad system states to emerge as various solution concepts of\nan associated game, regardless of how the agent accounts for the communication\nfailure and regardless of how weakly coupled the agents are. Nonetheless, we\nshow that the harm that communication failures can cause is limited by the\nstructure of the problem; when agents' action spaces are richer, problems are\nmore susceptible to these types of pathologies.

Background adjustment is necessary to\nreduce confounding by tissue-dependent changes not related to the disease. When\nmodeling the voxel intensities for the two scans as a bivariate Gaussian\nmixture, background adjustment translates into standardizing the mixture at\neach voxel, while tumor lesions present themselves as outliers to be detected.\nIn this paper, we address the question of how to standardize the mixture to a\nstandard multivariate normal distribution, so that the outliers (i.e., tumor\nlesions) can be detected using a statistical test. We show theoretically and\nnumerically that the tail distribution of the standardized scores is favorably\nclose to standard normal in a wide range of scenarios while being conservative\nat the tails, validating voxelwise hypothesis testing based on standardized\nscores.

The network coding\ntechnique improves the throughput efficiency of multi-hop wireless networks by\ntaking advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, there\nare some scenarios where the coding cannot be exploited due to the stochastic\nnature of the packet arrival process in the network. In these cases, the coding\nnode faces two critical choices: forwarding the packet towards the destination\nwithout coding, thereby sacrificing the advantage of network coding, or,\nwaiting for a while until a coding opportunity arises for the packets. Current\nresearch works have addressed this challenge for the case of a simple and\nrestricted scheme called reverse carpooling where it is assumed that two flows\nwith opposite directions arrive at the coding node. In this paper the issue is\nexplored in a general sense based on the COPE architecture requiring no\nassumption about flows in multi-hop wireless networks.

There are two kinds of hidden symmetries investigated in this\nwork: the first type is associated with dynamics of quantum fields and the\nsecond type is related to integrability of strings on various backgrounds. The\ngoals of this thesis are twofold: extension of hidden symmetries known in\ngeneral relativity to stringy backgrounds in higher dimensions and construction\nof new integrable string theories.\n  In the context of the first goal we study hidden symmetries of stringy\nbackgrounds, with and without supersymmetry. For supersymmetric geometries\nproduced by D--branes we identify the backgrounds with solvable equations for\ngeodesics, which can potentially give rise to integrable string theories.\nRelaxing the requirement of supersymmetry, we also study charged black holes in\nhigher dimensions and identify their hidden symmetries encoded in so--called\nKilling(-Yano) tensors. We construct the explicit form of the Killing(-Yano)\ntensors for the charged rotating black hole in arbitrary number of dimensions,\nstudy behavior of such tensors under string dualities, and use the analysis of\nhidden symmetries to explain why exact solutions for black rings (black holes\nwith non-spherical event horizons) in more than five dimensions remain elusive.\nAs a byproduct we identify the standard parameterization of AdSp x S^q\nbackgrounds with elliptic coordinates on a flat base.\n  The second goal of this work is construction of new integrable string\ntheories by applying continuous deformations of known examples. We use the\nrecent developments called (generalized) lambda-deformation to construct new\nintegrable backgrounds depending on several continuous parameters and study\nanalytical properties of the such deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 22:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 00:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Latest\nadvances in transcriptomics have made it possible to infer basic topologies of\npluripotency governing networks. The inferred network topologies, however, only\nencode boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics\nand molecular noise in gene expression. These features are widely considered\nessential for functional decision making. Herein we developed a framework for\nextending the boolean level networks into models accounting for individual\ngenetic switches and promoter architecture which allows mechanistic\ninterrogation of the roles of molecular noise, external signaling, and network\ntopology. We demonstrate the pluripotent state of the network to be a broad\nattractor which is robust to variations of gene expression. Dynamics of exiting\nthe pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the\nmolecular noise originating from genetic switching events which makes cells\nmore responsive to extracellular signals.

However, their underlying fundamental\nbiological vs. engineering mechanisms are, by definition, dramatically\ndifferent and can even be antithetical. Even our approach to each is\ndiametrically opposite: inductive science for the study of biological systems\nvs. engineering synthesis for the design and construction of robotic systems.\nThe past 20 years have seen several conceptual advances in both fields and the\nquest to unify them. Chief among them is the reluctant recognition that their\nunderlying fundamental mechanisms may actually share limited common ground,\nwhile exhibiting many fundamental differences. This recognition is particularly\nliberating because it allows us to resolve and move beyond multiple paradoxes\nand contradictions that arose from the initial reasonable assumption of a large\ncommon ground. Here, we begin by introducing the perspective of neuromechanics,\nwhich emphasizes that real-world behavior emerges from the intimate\ninteractions among the physical structure of the system, the mechanical\nrequirements of a task, the feasible neural control actions to produce it, and\nthe ability of the neuromuscular system to adapt through interactions with the\nenvironment. This allows us to articulate a succinct overview of a few salient\nconceptual paradoxes and contradictions regarding under-determined vs.\nover-determined mechanics, under- vs. over-actuated control, prescribed vs.\nemergent function, learning vs. implementation vs. adaptation, prescriptive vs.\ndescriptive synergies, and optimal vs. habitual performance.

Thus, the discovery of a high critical temperature (Tc) iron-based\nsuperconductor (IBSC) in 2008 was accepted with surprise in the condensed\nmatter community and rekindled extensive study globally. IBSCs have since grown\nto become a new class of high-Tc superconductors next to the high-Tc cuprates\ndiscovered in 1986.

The initial set of\ncandidate object poses is generated from state-of-the-art object detection and\nglobal point cloud registration techniques. The best-scored pose per object by\nusing these techniques may not be accurate due to overlaps and occlusions.\nNevertheless, experimental indications provided in this work show that object\nposes with lower ranks may be closer to the real poses than ones with high\nranks according to registration techniques. This motivates a global\noptimization process for improving these poses by taking into account\nscene-level physical interactions between objects. It also implies that the\nCartesian product of candidate poses for interacting objects must be searched\nso as to identify the best scene-level hypothesis. To perform the search\nefficiently, the candidate poses for each object are clustered so as to reduce\ntheir number but still keep a sufficient diversity. Then, searching over the\ncombinations of candidate object poses is performed through a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) process that uses the similarity between the observed depth image\nof the scene and a rendering of the scene given the hypothesized pose as a\nscore that guides the search procedure. MCTS handles in a principled way the\ntradeoff between fine-tuning the most promising poses and exploring new ones,\nby using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. Experimental results\nindicate that this process is able to quickly identify in cluttered scenes\nphysically-consistent object poses that are significantly closer to ground\ntruth compared to poses found by point cloud registration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 02:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

In lean\nmanufacturing, the principle of reducing set-up times has the same purpose:\nreduce the transient time and improve production flow. Analogously, the\nanalysis of the transient response of project-driven systems may provide\ncrucial information about how fast these systems react to a change and how that\nchange affects their production output. Although some studies have investigated\nflow variability in projects, few have looked at variability from the\nperspective that the transient state represents the changeovers on\nproject-driven production systems and how the transient state affects the\nprocess' flow variability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the\neffect of changes in project-driven production systems from a conceptual point\nof view, furthermore, measuring and correlating the transient response of five\ncases to their flow variability. Results showed a proportional relationship\nbetween the percentile transient time and flow variability of a process. That\nmeans that the quicker the production system reacts to change; the less the\ndistress in the production output, consequently, lower levels of flow\nvariability. As practical implications, lean practices focusing on reducing\nset-up times (transient time) can have their effects measured on project-driven\nproduction flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 05:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

There is a large literature on graph sampling,\nwhere the goal is to estimate properties (especially the degree distribution)\nof a large graph through a small, random sample. The degree distribution\nestimation poses a significant challenge, due to its heavy-tailed nature and\nthe large variance in degrees.\n  We design a new algorithm, SADDLES, for this problem, using recent\nmathematical techniques from the field of sublinear algorithms. The SADDLES\nalgorithm gives provably accurate outputs for all values of the degree\ndistribution. For the analysis, we define two fatness measures of the degree\ndistribution, called the $h$-index and the $z$-index. We prove that SADDLES is\nsublinear in the graph size when these indices are large. A corollary of this\nresult is a provably sublinear algorithm for any degree distribution bounded\nbelow by a power law.\n  We deploy our new algorithm on a variety of real datasets and demonstrate its\nexcellent empirical behavior. In all instances, we get extremely accurate\napproximations for all values in the degree distribution by observing at most\n$1\\%$ of the vertices. This is a major improvement over the state-of-the-art\nsampling algorithms, which typically sample more than $10\\%$ of the vertices to\ngive comparable results.

Previous studies have stressed the effect of valence\nmixing and degree of spinel inversion on the electric conduction of NiCo2O4\nfilms. In this work, we have studied the effect of microstructure by comparing\nthe NiCo2O4 epitaxial films grown on MgAl2O4 (111) and on Al2O3 (0001)\nsubstrates. Although the optimal growth condition and the magnetic properties\nare similar for the NiCo2O4/MgAl2O4 and the NiCo2O4/Al2O3, they show metallic\nand semiconducting electrical transport respectively.

Post-growth annealing decreases\nthe resistivity of NiCo2O4/Al2O3, but the annealed films are still\nsemiconducting. The correlation between the structural correlation length and\nthe resistivity suggests that the microstructural disorder, generated by the\ndramatic mismatch between the NiCo2O4 and Al2O3 crystal structures, may be the\norigin of the absence of the metallic electrical transport in NiCo2O4.

These data are used to\ncalculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction ($f_{\\rm~gas}$)\nfor these galaxies separately in the central `bulge' regions and outer disks.\nWe find that, for the two galaxies whose global specific star formation rate\n(sSFR) deviates most from the star formation main sequence, the gas fraction in\nthe bulges is significantly lower than that in their disks, supporting an\n`inside-out' model of galaxy quenching. For the two galaxies where SFE can be\nreliably determined in the central regions, the bulges and disks share similar\nSFEs. This suggests that a decline in $f_{\\rm~gas}$ is the main driver of\nlowered sSFR in bulges compared to disks in green valley galaxies.

The retrieval proceeds by first fitting the continuum of\nthe ratio of the two elevation angles to solve for aerosol properties, and then\nfitting the continuum-removed ratio to solve for gas abundances.

In this paper, we\nare interested in showing that the features extracted using deep neural\nnetworks have specific properties which can be used to improve accuracy of\ndownstream nonparametric learning methods.

First, we treat the\nproblem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any\nquantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a\nbinary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to\nbuild a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on\nquantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of\nquantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum\nmeasurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and\nexperimentally-oriented fashion.

Thus wind turbine health is\ncommonly assessed monitoring series of $10$-minute SCADA and high frequency\ndata from sensors. To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models\nare built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal\ndeviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further\ninvestigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the\nidentification of abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic\napproach to reconstruct the $1$ Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was\nmeasured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German\nNorth Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model\nbased on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining\nalgorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the\ndiscussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our\nevaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other\ndifferences, i.e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results\npresent evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in\nthe high frequency domain ($1$ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate\nstep-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach\npredictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the\noriginal signal, remaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our\nstochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted\nfor other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our\nfindings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal\nreconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 09:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The $M_{\\rm oxy}$ is found to correlate with\n$M_{\\star}$, at odds with current observational trends but in agreement with\nother numerical results. The estimated profiles of OVI column density reveal a\nsubstantial shortage of that ion, whereas SiIII, which probes the cool phase,\nis overpredicted. The analysis of the relative contributions of both ions from\nthe hot, warm and cool phases suggests that the warm gas ($ 10^5~{\\rm K} < T <\n10^6~{\\rm K}$) should be more abundant in order to bridge the mismatch with the\nobservations, or alternatively, that more metals should be stored in this\ngas-phase. Adittionally, we find that the X-ray coronae around the simulated\ngalaxies have luminosities and temperatures in decent agreement with the\navailable observational estimates.

In this work, the lithographic\nperformance of two high etch resistance materials was evaluated: ZEP520A\n(Nippon Zeon Co.) and mr-PosEBR (micro resist technology GmbH). Both materials\nare positive tone, polymer-based and non-chemically amplified resists. Two\nexposure techniques were used: electron beam lithography (EBL) and extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These resists were originally designed for EBL\npatterning, where high quality patterning at sub-100 nm resolution was\npreviously demonstrated.

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the\ncapability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different\ntemporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the\nsame as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal\nscales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens\nof kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2\nneeds to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which\nit can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales\ninvolved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally\nunfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine\nmeans that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and\ndepth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represents a\nbetter strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer\nsystems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock\nformations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In\nparticular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic\ngeology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable\nlayers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in\nterms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer\nsystems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations\nfor multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage\nbetween individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a\nstate-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 12:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The constraints give rise to a system of worldlines and worldsheets.\nIntegrating over the factors that are not phases (e.g., radial degrees of\nfreedom or contributions from the Haar measure) generates additional weight\nfactors that together with the constraints implement the full symmetry of the\nconventional formulation, now in the language of worldlines and worldsheets.

In settings with strong confounding, limited so-called\n\"overlap\" in propensity score distributions can undermine the empirical basis\nfor estimating causal effects and yield erratic finite-sample performance of\nexisting estimators. We propose a Bayesian procedure designed to estimate\ncausal effects in settings where there is limited overlap in propensity score\ndistributions. Our method relies on the posterior predictive treatment\nassignment (PPTA), a quantity that is derived from the propensity score but\nserves different role in estimation of causal effects. We use the PPTA to\nestimate causal effects by marginalizing over the uncertainty in whether each\nobservation is a member of an unknown subset for which treatment assignment can\nbe assumed unconfounded.

The localization procedure for\ndecomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller\nis responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on only part\nof the states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local\ncontroller in general has states number no more than that computed by\nconsidering the disablement on all the states.

The trapped molecules\nare prepared into a state which has its electron spin perpendicular to\n$\\hat{\\rm{z}}$, and a magnetic field along $\\hat{\\rm{z}}$ causes precession of\nthis spin. An electron electric dipole moment $d_e$ would affect this\nprecession due to the up to 100~GV/cm effective electric field produced by the\npolar molecule. The large number of polar molecules that can be embedded in a\nmatrix, along with the expected long coherence times for the precession, allows\nfor the possibility of measuring $d_e$ to an accuracy that surpasses current\nmeasurements by many orders of magnitude. Because the matrix can inhibit\nmolecular rotations and lock the orientation of the polar molecules, it may not\nbe necessary to have an electric field present during the precession.

The proposed\nlearning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical\nmessages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic\nmessages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed\nlearning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of\nmemory and computational capabilities.

(In social network analysis,\na call to this oracle corresponds to downloading the profile page of user $v$\nin a social network.) The goal of the algorithm is to either learn something\n(e.g., average degree) about the graph, or to return some random function of\nthe graph (e.g., a uniform-at-random node), while accessing/downloading as few\nnodes of the graph as possible. Motivated by practical applications, we study\nthe complexities of a variety of problems in terms of the graph's mixing time\nand average degree -- two measures that are believed to be quite small in\nreal-world social networks, and that have often been used in the applied\nliterature to bound the performance of online exploration algorithms.

Calculations of thermal transport\nin ternary III-Vs commonly employ the virtual-crystal approximation (VCA),\nwhere the structure is assumed to be a random alloy and all group-III atoms\n(cations) are treated as if they have an effective weighted-average mass.

In particular, it is\nshown that, as for Prawitz, it is possible to use this variant of Seldin's\nstrategy in order to induce a negative translation from classical to\nintuitionistic and minimal logic, which is nothing but a variant of Kuroda's\ntranslation. Through this translation, Glivenko's theorem for intuitionistic\nand minimal logic is proven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 15:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 12:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

The constraint is part of\nwhat is sometimes referred to as the Zel'dovich bound. We investigate in this\npaper the transport of energy by the propagation of waves emanating {\\it\nincoherently} from a regular and infinite lattice of oscillators, each having\nthe same finite amount of energy reserve initially. The model we employ does\nnot involve the expansion of the Universe -- the scales of interest are all\ndeeply sub-horizon -- but the size of regions over which perturbations are\nevaluated far exceed $ct$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the start of\nemission (it is assumed that $t$ greatly exceeds the duration of emission). We\nfind that to lowest order, when only wave fields $\\propto 1/r$ are included,\nthere is exact compensation between the energy loss of the oscillators and the\nenergy emitted into space, which means $P(0)=0$ for the power spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations on the largest scales. This is consistent with the\nZel'dovich bound. To the next order when near fields $\\propto r^{-2}$ are\nincluded, however, $P(0)$ settles at late times to a positive value that\ndepends only on time, as $t^{-2}$ (the same applies to an energy non-conserving\nterm). Even though this effect looks like superluminal energy transport, there\nis no violation of causality because the two-point function vanishes completely\nfor $r>t$ if the emission of each oscillator is truncated beyond some duration.\nThe result calls to question any need of enlisting cosmic inflation to seed\nlarge scale density perturbations. When applied to fast radio bursts --\nuniformly distributed transients (to lowest order) that repeat at other\nlocations -- the result supports Hoyle's hypothesis of constant energy\ninjection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 03:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 15:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

To overcome this question in this paper, an excellent direct\nsearch based local solver, the Nelder-Mead Simplex (NMS) method is adopted in\nBSO. Through combining BSO's exploration ability and NMS's exploitation ability\ntogether, a simplex search based BSO (Simplex-BSO) is developed via a better\nbalance between global exploration and local exploitation. Simplex-BSO is shown\nto be able to eliminate the degenerated L-curve phenomenon on unimodal\nfunctions, and alleviate significantly this phenomenon on multimodal functions.\nLarge number of experimental results show that Simplex-BSO is a promising\nalgorithm for global optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 01:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 02:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 07:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}
