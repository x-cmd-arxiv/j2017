In this formulation, every\nagent seeks to solve a local optimization with its own cost function, physical\nconstraints on its nodal power injection, voltage, and power flow of the lines\nit is connected to, and decision constraints on variables shared with neighbors\nto ensure consistency of the obtained solution. In the scheduled-asynchronous\nalgorithm, every pair of connected nodes in the electrical network update their\nlocal variables in an alternating fashion. This strategy is asynchronous, in\nthe sense that no clock synchronization is required, and relies on an\norientation of the electrical network that prescribes the precise ordering of\nnode updates.

Instead, they quickly get absorbed and re-emitted by at thermal\nwavelengths. As the cloud is typically optically thin to far-IR radiation, it\npromptly escapes, depositing little momentum.

In contrast, glasses and other amorphous solids can be\narbitrarily far away from equilibrium and require a description of the history\nof the conditions under which they formed. In this paper we describe how the\nlocality of interactions intrinsic to finite-dimensional systems affects the\nstability of amorphous solids far off equilibrium. Our analysis encompasses\nboth structural glasses formed by cooling and colloidal assemblies formed by\ncompression. A diagram outlining regions of marginal stability can be adduced\nwhich bears some resemblance to the quasi-equilibrium replica meanfield theory\nphase diagram of hard sphere glasses in high dimensions but is distinct from\nthat construct in that the diagram describes not true phase transitions but\nkinetic transitions that depend on the preparation protocol. The diagram\nexhibits two distinct sectors. One sector corresponds to amorphous states with\nrelatively open structures, the other to high density, more closely-packed\nones. The former transform rapidly owing to there being motions with no free\nenergy barriers; these motions are string-like locally. In the dense region,\namorphous systems age via compact activated reconfigurations. The two regimes\ncorrespond, in equilibrium, to the collisional or uniform liquid and the so\ncalled landscape regime, respectively. These are separated by a spinodal line\nof dynamical crossovers. Owing to the rigidity of the surrounding matrix in the\nlandscape, high-density part of the diagram, a sufficiently rapid pressure\nquench adds compressive energy which also leads to an instability toward\nstring-like motions with near vanishing barriers.

Substationarity is a new concept, which has\nnever been studied in the literature. It means that the distribution of SPPs\ncan only be invariant under location shifts within a linear subspace of the\ndomain. Theoretically, substationarity is a concept between stationariy and\nnonstationarity, but it belongs to nonstationarity. To formally propose the\napproach, the article provides the definition of substationarity and an\nestimation method for the first-order intensity function. As the linear\nsubspace may be unknown, it recommends using a parametric way to estimate the\nlinear subspace and a nonparametric way to estimate the first-order intensity\nfunction, indicating that it is a semiparametric approach. The simulation\nstudies show that both the estimators of the linear subspace and the\nfirst-order intensity function are reliable.

It is an extremely challenging problem which is\nfurther exacerbated due to lack of any publicly available database related to\nthis problem. This is the first research in this direction with a two-fold\ncontribution: (i) introducing the first of its kind skull-face image pair\ndatabase, IdentifyMe, and (ii) presenting a preliminary approach using the\nproposed semi-supervised formulation of transform learning. The experimental\nresults and comparison with existing algorithms showcase the challenging nature\nof the problem. We assert that the availability of the database will inspire\nresearchers to build sophisticated skull-to-face matching algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 18:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

A skew truss consists of a set with a group\noperation and a semigroup operation connected by a modified distributive law\nthat interpolates between that of a ring and a brace. It is shown that a\nparticular action and a cocycle characteristic of skew braces are already\npresent in a skew truss; in fact the interpolating function is a 1-cocycle, the\nbijecitivity of which indicates the existence of an operation that turns a\ntruss into a brace. Furthermore, if the group structure in a two-sided truss is\nAbelian, then there is an associated ring -- another feature characteristic of\na two-sided brace. To characterise a morphism of trusses, a {\\em pith} is\ndefined as a particular subset of the domain consisting of subsets termed {\\em\nchambers}, which contains the kernel of the morphism as a group homomorphism.\nIn the case of both rings and braces piths coincide with kernels.

This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the\nwaveguide-system coupling. Moreover, the integrated discretized equations can\nbe faithfully converted to a continuous-time result by taking the appropriate\nlimit. This approach provides a complete solution to the scattered photon field\nin the waveguide, and can also be used to track system-waveguide entanglement\nduring evolution.

Specifically, we address the\nquestion of whether dynamic feedback controllers perform better than static\n(memoryless) ones when subject to locality constraints. We consider distributed\nlinear consensus and vehicular formation control problems modeled over toric\nlattice networks. For the resulting spatially invariant systems we study the\nlarge-scale asymptotics (in network size) of global performance metrics that\nquantify the level of network coherence. With static feedback from relative\nstate measurements, such metrics are known to scale unfavorably in lattices of\nlow spatial dimensions, preventing, for example, a 1-dimensional string of\nvehicles to move like a rigid object. We show that the same limitations in\ngeneral apply also to dynamic feedback control that is locally of first order.\nThis means that the addition of one local state to the controller gives a\nsimilar asymptotic performance to the memoryless case. This holds unless the\ncontroller can access noiseless measurements of its local state with respect to\nan absolute reference frame, in which case the addition of controller memory\nmay fundamentally improve performance. In simulations of platoons with 20-200\nvehicles we show that the performance limitations we derive manifest as\nunwanted accordion-like motions. Similar behaviors are to be expected in any\nnetwork that is embeddable in a low-dimensional toric lattice, and the same\nfundamental limitations would apply.

In silicon photonics, although dynamic tuning has\nbeen achieved with various mechanisms, even the most effective thermo-optic\neffect offers a refractive index change of only $1.86 \\times 10^{-4} K^{-1}$.\nTo enhance this small change, light recycling based on resonators has been\nemployed in order to realize efficient modulators, phase shifters, and optical\nswitches. However, the resonant enhancement comes at a great cost of optical\nbandwidth, fabrication tolerance and system scalability. Here we demonstrate a\nscalable light recycling approach based on spatial-mode multiplexing. Our\napproach offers a fabrication tolerance of ${\\pm}$ 15 nm, in stark contrast to\nthe non-scalable subnanometer tolerance in typical silicon resonators. We\nexperimentally demonstrate light recycling up to 7 passes with an optical\nbandwidth greater than 100 nm.

Our main goal is to gain a fine understanding of the asymptotics for\nthe log-likelihood ratio process, also known as the free energy, as a function\nof the SNR. Our main results are twofold.

Since the majority of nuclei are deformed, the interplay between\ndeformation and orbital structure near threshold becomes very important and can\nlead to an improved description of exotic nuclei. In this work, the Green's\nfunction (GF) method is applied to solve the coupled-channel Dirac equation\nwith quadrupole-deformed Woods-Saxon potentials for the first time. The\ndetailed formalism for the partial-wave expansion of the Green's function is\npresented.

Clustering adjustments are\ntypically motivated by the concern that unobserved components of outcomes for\nunits within clusters are correlated. However, this motivation does not provide\nguidance about questions such as: (i) Why should we adjust standard errors for\nclustering in some situations but not others? How can we justify the common\npractice of clustering in observational studies but not randomized experiments,\nor clustering by state but not by gender? (ii) Why is conventional clustering a\npotentially conservative \"all-or-nothing\" adjustment, and are there alternative\nmethods that respond to data and are less conservative? (iii) In what settings\ndoes the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address\nthese questions using a framework of sampling and design inference. We argue\nthat clustering can be needed to address sampling issues if sampling follows a\ntwo stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters are sampled\nfrom a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units are sampled from\nthe sampled clusters.

This shared dimension may represent common\nfeatures that are measured for different sample sets (i.e., horizontal\nintegration) or a common set of samples with measurements for different feature\nsets (i.e., vertical integration). In this article we introduce an approach for\nsimultaneous horizontal and vertical integration, termed Linked Matrix\nFactorization (LMF), for the more general situation where some matrices share\nrows (e.g., features) and some share columns (e.g., samples). Our motivating\napplication is a cytotoxicity study with accompanying genomic and molecular\nchemical attribute data. In this data set, the toxicity matrix (cell lines\n$\\times$ chemicals) shares its sample set with a genotype matrix (cell lines\n$\\times$ SNPs), and shares its feature set with a chemical molecular attribute\nmatrix (chemicals $\\times$ attributes). LMF gives a unified low-rank\nfactorization of these three matrices, which allows for the decomposition of\nsystematic variation that is shared among the three matrices and systematic\nvariation that is specific to each matrix. This may be used for efficient\ndimension reduction, exploratory visualization, and the imputation of missing\ndata even when entire rows or columns are missing from a constituent data\nmatrix. We present theoretical results concerning the uniqueness,\nidentifiability, and minimal parametrization of LMF, and evaluate it with\nextensive simulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 04:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

A prime example is the Fermi gas with\nunitarity limited interactions, whose universal properties are relevant to\nsystems ranging from atomic gases at microkelvin temperatures to the inner\ncrust of neutron stars. Here we address the question of whether unitary Bose\nsystems can possess a similar universality. We consider the simplest strongly\ninteracting Bose system, where we have an impurity particle (\"polaron\")\nresonantly interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Focusing on the\nground state of the equal-mass system, we use a variational wave function for\nthe polaron that includes up to three Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC, thus\nallowing us to capture both Efimov trimers and associated tetramers. Unlike the\nFermi case, we find that the length scale associated with Efimov trimers (i.e.,\nthe three-body parameter) can strongly affect the polaron's behaviour, even at\nboson densities where there are no well-defined Efimov states. However, by\ncomparing our results with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we argue\nthat the polaron energy is a \\emph{universal} function of the Efimov three-body\nparameter for sufficiently low boson densities. We further support this\nconclusion by showing that the energies of the deepest bound Efimov trimers and\ntetramers at unitarity are universally related to one another, regardless of\nthe microscopic model. On the other hand, we find that the quasiparticle\nresidue and effective mass sensitively depend on the coherence length $\\xi$ of\nthe BEC, with the residue tending to zero as $\\xi$ diverges, in a manner akin\nto the orthogonality catastrophe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 07:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}

Its\nelementary excitations are anyons such as spinons carrying fractionalized spin\nquantum number and visons carrying emergent Z2 gauge flux. However,\nexperimental detection of these anyons remains elusive. The difficulties lie\nnot only in the fact that there exists few candidates for Z2 quantum spin\nliquids but also in that visons are magnetically inert hence immune to\navailable experimental techniques. Here we have studied the spin excitations\nand specific heats of kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr and\nCu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr, which consists of two-dimensional Cu$^{2+}$ kagome layers\nwith either Cu$^{2+}$ or Zn$^{2+}$ ions in between. By combining the first\nprinciple calculations and inelastic neutron scattering data in the former, we\nshow that the dominate couplings in Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr are between the nearest\nneighbor spins within the kagome planes, and the kagome and interlayer spin\nsystems are essentially decoupled above the antiferromagnetic transition\ntemperature. The intrinsic spin excitations and specific heats of the kagome\nlayers for Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr are thus derived by removing the contributions\nfrom the residual interlayer Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic impurities. Accordingly, the\nkagome spin system exhibits spin continuum with momentum-dependent spin gap and\na large magnetic entropy at low temperature that is insensitive to magnetic\nfield, which can be understood as the evidences of spinons and visons in this\nkagome quantum spin liquid candidate.

In this applicative domain, clustering can play a key role for both\nquantitively estimating kinetics rates via Markov State Models or to give\nqualitatively a human compatible summarization of the underlying chemical\nphenomenon under study. For these reasons, we selected it as a valuable\nreal-world application scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 09:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

This opens up exciting possibilities such as the observation\nof systems exploring their energy landscape through monopole quasiparticle\ncreation, potentially leading to ASI magnetricity, and to directly observe\nunconventional phase transitions. In this work we have measured and analysed\nthe magnetic relaxation of thermally active ASI systems by means of SQUID\nmagnetometry. We have investigated the effect of the interaction strength on\nthe magnetization dynamics at different temperatures in the range where the\nnanomagnets are thermally active and have observed that they follow an\nArrhenius-type N\\'eel-Brown behaviour. An unexpected negative correlation of\nthe average blocking temperature with the interaction strength is also\nobserved, which is supported by Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization\nrelaxation measurements show faster relaxation for more strongly coupled\nnanoelements with similar dimensions. The analysis of the stretching exponents\nobtained from the measurements suggest 1-D chain-like magnetization dynamics.\nThis indicates that the nature of the interactions between nanoelements lowers\nthe dimensionality of the ASI from 2-D to 1-D.

One hypothesis for explaining the gap between the belts is\nthe presence of one or more planets dynamically carving it. This work aims to\ninvestigate this scenario in systems harboring two components debris disks. All\nthe targets in the sample were observed with the SPHERE instrument which\nperforms high-contrast direct imaging. Positions of the inner and outer belts\nwere estimated by SED fitting of the infrared excesses or, when available, from\nresolved images of the disk. Very few planets have been observed so far in\ndebris disks gaps and we intended to test if such non-detections depend on the\nobservational limits of the present instruments. This aim is achieved by\nderiving theoretical predictions of masses, eccentricities and semi-major axes\nof planets able to open the observed gaps and comparing such parameters with\ndetection limits obtained with SPHERE. The relation between the gap and the\nplanet is due to the chaotic zone around the orbit of the planet. The radial\nextent of this zone depends on the mass ratio between the planet and the star,\non the semi-major axis and on the eccentricity of the planet and it can be\nestimated analytically. We apply the formalism to the case of one planet on a\ncircular or eccentric orbit. We then consider multi-planetary systems: 2 and 3\nequal-mass planets on circular orbits and 2 equal-mass planets on eccentric\norbits in a packed configuration. We then compare each couple of values (M,a),\nderived from the dynamical analysis of single and multiple planetary models,\nwith the detection limits obtained with SPHERE. Our results show that the\napparent lack of planets in gaps between double belts could be explained by the\npresence of a system of two or more planets possibly of low mass and on an\neccentric orbits whose sizes are below the present detection limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 10:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Progress on\nthese problems is further hindered by a lack of open benchmarks, since\ncomparisons of different solutions are difficult to make. In this paper we\nintroduce a new benchmark for trajectory optimization and posture generation of\nlegged robots, using a pre-defined scenario, robot and constraints, as well as\nevaluation criteria. We evaluate state-of-the-art trajectory optimization\nalgorithms based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) on the benchmark, as\nwell as new stochastic and incremental optimization methods borrowed from the\nlarge-scale machine learning literature. Interestingly we show that some of\nthese stochastic and incremental methods, which are based on stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD), achieve higher success rates than SQP on tough\ninitializations. Inspired by this observation we also propose a new incremental\nvariant of SQP which updates only a random subset of the costs and constraints\nat each iteration. The algorithm is the best performing in both success rate\nand convergence speed, improving over SQP by up to 30% in both criteria. The\nbenchmark's resources and a solution evaluation script are made openly\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 11:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

Despite numerous studies of the HI content of galaxies, no revision\nhas been made for the most isolated L* galaxies since 1984. In total we have\nmeasurements or constraints on the HI masses of 844 galaxies from the Catalogue\nof Isolated Galaxies (CIG), obtained with our own observations at Arecibo,\nEffelsberg, Nancay and GBT, and spectra from the literature.

Our\nregression model incorporates all the data, including upper limits, and\naccounts for uncertainties in both variables, as well as distance\nuncertainties. The scaling relation of HI mass with optical diameter is in good\nagreement with that of Haynes & Giovanelli 1984, but our relation with\nluminosity is considerably steeper. This is attributed to the large\nuncertainties in the luminosities, which introduce a bias when using OLS\nregression (used previously), and the different morphology distributions of the\nsamples.

It is the first ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) polarization experiment in China and an integral part of China's\nGravitational Waves Program. The main scientific goal of AliCPT project is to\nprobe the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) originated from the very early\nUniverse.\n  The AliCPT project includes two stages. The first stage referred to as\nAliCPT-1, is to build a telescope in the Ali region of Tibet with an altitude\nof 5,250 meters. Once completed, it will be the worldwide highest ground-based\nCMB observatory and open a new window for probing PGWs in northern hemisphere.\nAliCPT-1 telescope is designed to have about 7,000 TES detectors at 90GHz and\n150GHz. The second stage is to have a more sensitive telescope (AliCPT-2) with\nthe number of detectors more than 20,000.\n  Our simulations show that AliCPT will improve the current constraint on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by one order of magnitude with 3 years' observation.\nBesides the PGWs, the AliCPT will also enable a precise measurement on the CMB\nrotation angle and provide a precise test on the CPT symmetry. We show 3 years'\nobservation will improve the current limit by two order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 12:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 01:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

These are found using a novel framework\nwhich permits the computation of such solutions in an arbitrary complex\ngeometry. The periodic orbits arise from a synchronised concatenation of\nconvective and acoustic events which strongly depend on the Mach number. This\nflow-acoustic interaction furnishes the periodic solutions with a remarkable\nstability and it is found to completely dominate the system's dynamics and the\nsound directivity. The periodic orbits, which could be called `exact Rossiter\nmodes', collapse with a family of equilibrium solutions at a subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation, occurring in the quasi-incompressible regime. This shows\ncompressibility has a destabilising effect in cavity flows, which we analyse in\ndetail. By establishing a connection with previous 2D and 3D stability studies\nof cavity flows, we are able to isolate the effect of purely compressible\ntwo-dimensional flow phenomena across Mach number. A linear stability analysis\nof the equilibria provides insight into the compressible flow mechanisms\nresponsible for the instability. A close look at the adjoint modes suggests\nthat an eigenvalue merge occurs at a Mach number between 0.35 and 0.4, which\nboosts the receptivity of the leading mode and determines the onset of the\nunstable character of the system. The effect of the choice of base flow over\nthe transition dynamics is also discussed, where in the present case, the\nfrequencies associated to the leading eigenmodes show a strong connection with\nthe frequencies of the periodic orbits at the same Mach numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 12:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

To deal with the curse of\ndimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been\nmade by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the\nemphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential\ndiversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open\nproblem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population\nof diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the\nmulti-level diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and\nclusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a\nnovel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a\nlarge number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential\nsimilarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large\nset of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from\nthese metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can\nthereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to\nexplore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific\nensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of\nconsensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional\ndatasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech\ndatasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the\nstate-of-the-art.

Various datasets together with assorted methods have been\nproposed in the last few years.

So most previous methods are trained\nwith various features, evaluated on different test sets from the same or\ndifferent datasets, making it difficult to be compared directly. To boost the\nresearch of macro-management in StarCraft, we release a new dataset MSC based\non the platform SC2LE. MSC consists of well-designed feature vectors,\npre-defined high-level actions and final result of each match. We also split\nMSC into training, validation and test set for the convenience of evaluation\nand comparison. Besides the dataset, we propose a baseline model and present\ninitial baseline results for global state evaluation and build order\nprediction, which are two of the key tasks in macro-management.

It does this via a series of waves where at\neach wave an emulator is fitted to a small number of training samples. An\nimplausibility measure is defined which takes into account the closeness of\nsimulated and observed outputs as well as emulator uncertainty. As the waves\nprogress, the emulator becomes more accurate so that training samples are more\nconcentrated on promising regions of the space and poorer parts of the space\nare rejected with more confidence. Whilst history matching has proved to be\nuseful, existing implementations are not fully automated and some ad-hoc\nchoices are made during the process, which involves user intervention and is\ntime consuming. This occurs especially when the non-implausible region becomes\nsmall and it is difficult to sample this space uniformly to generate new\ntraining points. In this article we develop a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nalgorithm for implementing history matching that is semi-automated. Our novel\nSMC approach reveals that the history matching method yields a non-implausible\nregion that can be multi-modal, highly irregular and very difficult to sample\nuniformly.

Here, we model the atmosphere of a core that grows by accreting ice-rich\npebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the\natmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower\naltitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective,\nfollowing a moist adiabat in saturated regions due to water condensation and\nprecipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core\nmass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock)\nbetween 0.08 and 0.16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and\n647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a\nsuper-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk.

The critical mass depends in a complicated\nway on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional\nappearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50\npercent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas\naccretion.

Such behavior results in a\nconstant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. To\ndate, the impact of this behaviour on code security is unknown. We answer this\nhighly important question by quantifying the proliferation of security-related\ncode snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google\nPlay. Access to the rich source of information available on Stack Overflow\nincluding ready-to-use code snippets provides huge benefits for software\ndevelopers. However, when it comes to code security there are some caveats to\nbear in mind: Due to the complex nature of code security, it is very difficult\nto provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Hence,\nintegrating a security-related code snippet from Stack Overflow into production\nsoftware requires caution and expertise. Unsurprisingly, we observed insecure\ncode snippets being copied into Android applications millions of users install\nfrom Google Play every day. To quantitatively evaluate the extent of this\nobservation, we scanned Stack Overflow for code snippets and evaluated their\nsecurity score using a stochastic gradient descent classifier. In order to\nidentify code reuse in Android applications, we applied state-of-the-art static\nanalysis. Our results are alarming: 15.4% of the 1.3 million Android\napplications we analyzed, contained security-related code snippets from Stack\nOverflow.

The\nunderlying radio continuum measurements cover a frequency range of ~325 MHz to\n24.5 GHz (32 GHz in case of M82). It turns out that most of these synchrotron\nspectra are not simple power-laws, but are best represented by a low-frequency\nspectrum with a mean slope alpha_nth = 0.59 +/- 0.20 (S_nu ~ nu^-alpha), and by\na break or an exponential decline in the frequency range of 1 - 12 GHz. Simple\npower-laws or mildly curved synchrotron spectra lead to unrealistically low\nthermal flux densities, and/or to strong deviations from the expected optically\nthin free-free spectra with slope alpha_th = 0.10 in the fits. The break or\ncutoff energies are in the range of 1.5 - 7 GeV. We briefly discuss the\npossible origin of such a cutoff or break. If the low-frequency spectra\nobtained here reflect the injection spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons, they\ncomply with the mean spectral index of Galactic supernova remnants. A\ncomparison of the fitted thermal flux densities with the (foreground-corrected)\nHalpha fluxes yields the extinction, which increases with metallicity. The\nfraction of thermal emission is higher than believed hitherto, especially at\nhigh frequencies, and is highest in the dwarf galaxies of our sample, which we\ninterpret in terms of a lack of containment in these low-mass systems, or a\ntime effect caused by a very young starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 15:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Battery life is a primary concern to many mobile users who often find\ntheir phone has died at most inconvenient times. The heterogeneous multi-core\narchitecture is a solution for energy-efficient processing. However, the\ncurrent mobile web browsers rely on the operating system to exploit the\nunderlying hardware, which has no knowledge of individual web contents and\noften leads to poor energy efficiency. This paper describes an automatic\napproach to render mobile web workloads for performance and energy efficiency.\nIt achieves this by developing a machine learning based approach to predict\nwhich processor to use to run the web rendering engine and at what frequencies\nthe processors should operate. Our predictor learns offline from a set of\ntraining web workloads. The built predictor is then integrated into the browser\nto predict the optimal processor configuration at runtime, taking into account\nthe web workload characteristics and the optimisation goal: whether it is load\ntime, energy consumption or a trade-off between them. We evaluate our approach\non a representative ARM big.LITTLE mobile architecture using the hottest 500\nwebpages. Our approach achieves 80% of the performance delivered by an ideal\npredictor. We obtain, on average, 45%, 63.5% and 81% improvement respectively\nfor load time, energy consumption and the energy delay product, when compared\nto the Linux heterogeneous multi-processing scheduler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 09:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

(Special cases are the Walsh functions.)\nBy a topological argument, we prove that, given $n$ real-valued functions,\n$f_1, \\dots, f_n$, in $L^1[0,1]$, there exists a switch function, $\\sigma$,\nwith at most $n$ sign changes that is simultaneously orthogonal to all of them\nin the sense that $\\int_0^1 \\sigma(t)f_i(t)dt=0$, for all $i = 1, \\dots , n$.\n  Moreover, we prove that, for each $\\lambda \\in (-1,1)$, there exists a unique\nswitch function, $\\sigma$, with $n$ switches such that $\\int_0^1 \\sigma(t) p(t)\ndt = \\lambda \\int_0^1 p(t)dt$ for every real polynomial $p$ of degree at most\n$n-1$. We also prove the same statement holds for every real even polynomial of\ndegree at most $2n-2$.

The\nnodes in the system are non-static and they move arbitrarily and are inclined\nto interface disappointment which makes dependably to discover new routes to\nthe destination. During the forwarding of packets to the destination, various\nintermediate nodes take part in routing, where such node should be an ideal\nnode. An algorithm is proposed here to know the ideal node after studying the\nfeatures of the reactive routing protocols. The malicious node can be\neliminated from the networking function and the overhead on the protocol can be\nreduced. The node chooses the neighbor which can be found in less number of\nbounces and with less time delay and keeping up the QoS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2017 09:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

We analyze the unevenness of European\neconomies with respect to the embedding of export sectors in upstream domestic\nflows, and their dependency on dominant export partners. We use the WIOD data\nset of sectoral flows for the period of 1995-2011 for 24 European countries. We\nfound that East European economies were significantly more likely to experience\nincreasing unevenness and dependency with increasing openness, while core\ncountries of Europe managed to decrease their unevenness while increasing their\nopenness. Nevertheless, by analyzing the trajectories of changes for each\ncountry, we see that East European countries are also experiencing a turning\npoint, either switching to a path similar to the core, or to a retrograde path\nwith decreasing openness. We analyze our data using pooled time series models\nand case studies of country trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Oct 2017 18:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}
