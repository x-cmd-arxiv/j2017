A persistent limitation of prior\nmalware lineage approaches is to consider every input sample a separate malware\nversion. This is problematic since a majority of malware are packed and the\npacking process produces many polymorphic variants (i.e., executables with\ndifferent file hash) of the same malware version. Thus, many samples correspond\nto the same malware version and it is challenging to identify distinct malware\nversions from polymorphic variants. This problem does not manifest in prior\nmalware lineage approaches because they work on synthetic malware, malware that\nare not packed, or packed malware for which unpackers are available. In this\nwork, we propose a novel malware lineage approach that works on malware samples\ncollected in the wild. Given a set of malware executables from the same family,\nfor which no source code is available and which may be packed, our approach\nproduces a lineage graph where nodes are versions of the family and edges\ndescribe the relationships between versions. To enable our malware lineage\napproach, we propose the first technique to identify the versions of a malware\nfamily and a scalable code indexing technique for determining shared functions\nbetween any pair of input samples. We have evaluated the accuracy of our\napproach on 13 open-source programs and have applied it to produce lineage\ngraphs for 10 popular malware families. Our malware lineage graphs achieve on\naverage a 26 times reduction from number of input samples to number of\nversions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 16:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

To describe\npeople's internal and external foraging behavior, various random walk models\nhave been proposed. In particular, internal foraging has been modeled as\nsampling: in order to gather relevant information for making a decision, people\ndraw samples from a mental representation using random-walk algorithms such as\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, two common empirical observations\nargue against simple sampling algorithms such as MCMC. First, the spatial\nstructure is often best described by a L\\'evy flight distribution: the\nprobability of the distance between two successive locations follows a\npower-law on the distances. Second, the temporal structure of the sampling that\nhumans and other animals produce have long-range, slowly decaying serial\ncorrelations characterized as $1/f$-like fluctuations. We propose that mental\nsampling is not done by simple MCMC, but is instead adapted to multimodal\nrepresentations and is implemented by Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MC$^3$), one of the first algorithms developed for sampling from\nmultimodal distributions. MC$^3$ involves running multiple Markov chains in\nparallel but with target distributions of different temperatures, and it swaps\nthe states of the chains whenever a better location is found. Heated chains\nmore readily traverse valleys in the probability landscape to propose moves to\nfar-away peaks, while the colder chains make the local steps that explore the\ncurrent peak or patch.

The modulus of a fluid in nanopores can be\nextracted from ultrasonic experiments or calculated from molecular simulations.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, we calculated\nthe modulus for liquid argon at its normal boiling point (87.3~K) adsorbed in\nmodel silica pores of two different morphologies and various sizes. For\nspherical pores, for all the pore sizes (diameters) exceeding 2~nm, we obtained\na logarithmic dependence of fluid modulus on the vapor pressure. Calculation of\nthe modulus at saturation showed that the modulus of the fluid in spherical\npores is a linear function of the reciprocal pore size. The calculation of the\nmodulus of the fluid in cylindrical pores appeared too scattered to make\nquantitative conclusions. We performed additional simulations at higher\ntemperature (119.6~K), at which Monte Carlo insertions and removals become more\nefficient. The results of the simulations at higher temperature confirmed both\nregularities for cylindrical pores and showed quantitative difference between\nthe fluid moduli in pores of different geometries. Both of the observed\nregularities for the modulus stem from the Tait-Murnaghan equation applied to\nthe confined fluid. Our results, along with the development of the effective\nmedium theories for nanoporous media, set the groundwork for analysis of the\nexperimentally-measured elastic properties of fluid-saturated nanoporous\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 18:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 17:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We intended to derive accurate constraints\nto the intrinsic shape of bulges to provide new clues on their formation\nmechanisms and set new limitations for future simulations.

Analyzing the $i$-band mock images of\nresulting lenticular remnants, we studied the intrinsic shape of their bulges\nat different galaxy inclinations.

We tested the method on simulated lenticular remnants,\nfinding that for galaxies with inclinations $25^{\\circ} < \\theta < 65^{\\circ}$\nwe can safely derive the intrinsic shape of their bulges. We found that our\nCALIFA bulges tend to be nearly oblate systems (66%), with a smaller fraction\nof prolate spheroids (19%) and triaxial ellipsoids (15%). The majority of\ntriaxial bulges are in barred galaxies (75%).

On the contrary, bulges with high S\\'ersic index,\nin early-type galaxies, or in more massive galaxies are mostly oblate systems.\nWe concluded that various evolutionary pathways may coexist in galaxies, with\nmerging events and dissipative collapse being the main mechanisms driving the\nformation of the most massive oblate bulges and bar evolution reshaping the\nless massive triaxial bulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 18:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

However, the dynamic and distributed\nformation of local fog networks is highly challenging due to the unpredictable\narrival and departure of neighboring fog nodes. Therefore, a given fog node\nmust properly select a set of neighboring nodes and intelligently offload its\ncomputational tasks to this set of neighboring fog nodes and the cloud in order\nto achieve low-latency transmission and computation. In this paper, the problem\nof fog network formation and task distribution is jointly investigated while\nconsidering a hybrid fog-cloud architecture. The goal is to minimize the\nmaximum computational latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable\nfog network and optimize the task distribution, under uncertainty on the\narrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this problem, a novel online\noptimization framework is proposed in which the neighboring nodes are selected\nby using a threshold-based online algorithm that uses a target competitive\nratio, defined as the ratio between the latency of the online algorithm and the\noffline optimal latency. The proposed framework repeatedly updates its target\ncompetitive ratio and optimizes the distribution of the fog node's\ncomputational tasks in order to minimize latency.

For CNF constraints, hashing-based approximation techniques have been\ndemonstrated to be highly successful.

Our analysis, however, shows that the proposed\nhashing-based approach to DNF counting provides poor time complexity compared\nto the Monte Carlo-based DNF counting techniques.

We conducted a\nusability study with human subjects and results show that MARS is the easiest\nto use compared with other competing rule-based models, in terms of the correct\nrate and response time. Overall, MARS introduces a new approach to rule-based\nmodels that balance accuracy and interpretability with feature-efficient\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 01:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

A woman ranks the men in order of their distance to her from closest to\nfarthest, breaking ties at random. The men rank the women similarly. An\ninteresting problem is to use these ranking lists and find a stable matching in\nthe sense of Gale and Shapley. This problem formulation naturally models\npreferences in several real world applications; for example, dating sites, room\nrenting/letting, ride hailing and labor markets. Two key questions that arise\nin this setting are: (a) When is the stable matching unique without resorting\nto tie breaks? (b) If $X$ is the distance between a randomly chosen stable\npair, what is the distribution of $X$ and what is $E(X)$?\n  We study dating sites and ride hailing as prototypical examples of stable\nmatchings in discrete and continuous metric spaces, respectively. In the dating\nsite model, each person is assigned to a point on the $k$-dimensional hypercube\nbased on their answers to a set of binary $k$ questions. We consider two\ndifferent metrics on the hypercube: Hamming and Weighted Hamming. Under both\nmetrics, there are exponentially many stable matchings when $k = \\lfloor\\log\nn\\rfloor$. There is a unique stable matching, with high probability, under the\nHamming distance when $k = \\Omega(n^6)$, and under the Weighted Hamming\ndistance when $k > (2+\\epsilon) \\log n$ for some $\\epsilon>0$. In the ride\nhailing model, passengers and cabs are modeled as points on the line and\nmatched based on Euclidean distance. Assuming the locations of the passengers\nand cabs are independent Poisson processes of different intensities, we derive\nbounds on the distribution of $X$ in terms of busy periods at a\nlast-come-first-served preemptive-resume (LCFS-PR) queue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 02:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

However, in complex open-world\nscenarios, designing a representation for prediction is difficult.

The best studied neutron star in\nthis respect is the Crab Pulsar. The first glitch recorded in this pulsar\noccurred in 1969 Sep, at an epoch when timing observations were still in their\ninfancy, the regularity of the observations was relatively poor, and errors on\nthe observations were relatively high. Lyne et al. (1993) analyzed most of the\navailable data using modern techniques, and showed that this was a typical\nglitch of the Crab pulsar, with typical glitch parameters. This work analyses\nall available data, and shows that the 1969 event in the Crab pulsar is\namenable to radically different interpretations. The Crab pulsar was timed by\nfive different groups during this epoch, one at radio and the rest at optical\nfrequencies. These data are available in the public domain, and have been\nanalyzed using the TEMPO2 software. The 1969 event in the Crab pulsar can be\nbetter modeled as a typical glitch that was interrupted by a non-glitch\nspeed-up event.

They occupy their hosts\nfor a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV),\nwhich manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes\n(airborne, via direct contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to\nthe load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and\nvirulence define further pathogenic lifestyles. To survive pathogens must\ninfect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with\na certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be\nmediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network,\nthree parameters/concepts appear to be key: the contact rate and the\ninfectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third\nthe immunity of susceptible hosts. From here, what can be concluded about the\nevolutionary strategies of viral pathogens? This is the biological question\naddressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results (Lange & Ferguson\n2009, PLoS Comput Biol 5 (10): e1000536) and makes explicit connection to\nanother basic work on the evolution of pathogens (Grenfell et al. 2004, Science\n303: 327-332). A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and\ninter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad\nspectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections,\nchildhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn\nout as local maxima of the fitness landscape.

In such problems, knowing only the\nlist of possible locations, the Searcher needs to find all the hidden objects\nby visiting these locations one by one. To study this problem, we formulate new\ngame-theoretic models of discrete search between a Hider and a Searcher. The\nHider hides $k$ balls in $n$ boxes, and the Searcher opens the boxes one by one\nwith the aim of finding all the balls. Every time the Searcher opens a box she\nmust pay its search cost, and she either finds one of the balls it contains or\nlearns that it is empty. If the Hider is an adversary, an appropriate payoff\nfunction may be the expected total search cost paid to find all the balls,\nwhile if the Hider is Nature, a more appropriate payoff function may be the\ndifference between the total amount paid and the amount the Searcher would have\nto pay if she knew the locations of the balls a priori (the regret). We give a\nfull solution to the regret version of this game, and a partial solution to the\nsearch cost version. We also consider variations on these games for which the\nHider can hide at most one ball in each box. The search cost version of this\ngame has already been solved in previous work, and we give a partial solution\nin the regret version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 13:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Our work aims to provide succinct,\ninterpretable, and simple explanations of anomalous behavior in $t$-graphs\n(communications, IP-IP interactions, etc.) while respecting the limited\nattention of human analysts. Specifically, we extract key features from such\ngraphs, and propose to output a few pair (scatter) plots from this feature\nspace which \"best\" explain known anomalies. To this end, our work has four main\ncontributions: (a) problem formulation: we introduce an \"analyst-friendly\"\nproblem formulation for explaining anomalies via pair plots, (b) explanation\nalgorithm: we propose a plot-selection objective and the LookOut algorithm to\napproximate it with optimality guarantees, (c) generality: our explanation\nalgorithm is both domain- and detector-agnostic, and (d) scalability: we show\nthat LookOut scales linearly on the number of edges of the input graph. Our\nexperiments show that LookOut performs near-ideally in terms of maximizing\nexplanation objective on several real datasets including Enron e-mail and DBLP\ncoauthorship.
