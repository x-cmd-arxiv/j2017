It was shown that one can exploit the disparate length scales of\nthe solution-well and biochemical gate to reduce the coupled PDE model to a\nsingle nonlinear integrodifferential equation (IDE) that describes the\nconcentration of reacting species. Although this equation has a convolution\nintegral with a singular kernel, a numerical approximation was constructed by\napplying the method of lines. The need for specialized quadrature techniques\nwas obviated and numerical evidence strongly suggests that this method achieves\nfirst-order accuracy.

With solid tides, they\ntorque these planets, thus contributing to determine their rotation states as\nwell as their climate. Given the complex dynamics of thermal tides, analytical\nmodels are essential to understand its dependence on the structure and rotation\nof planetary atmospheres and the tidal frequency. In this context, the state of\nthe art model proposed in the 60's by Lindzen and Chapman explains well the\nproperties of thermal tides in the asymptotic regime of Earth-like rapid\nrotators but predicts a non-physical diverging tidal torque in the vicinity of\nthe spin-orbit synchronization.

Second, we show\nthat the tidal response is very sensitive to the atmospheric structure,\nparticularly to the stability with respect to convection.

While in the past,\nfocus was on generating graphs which follow general laws, such as the power law\nfor degree distribution, current models have the ability to learn from observed\ngraphs and generate synthetic approximations. The primary emphasis of existing\nmodels has been to closely match different properties of a single observed\ngraph. Such models, though stochastic, tend to generate samples which do not\nhave significant variance in terms of the various graph properties. We argue\nthat in many cases real graphs are sampled drawn from a graph population (e.g.,\nnetworks sampled at various time points, social networks for individual\nschools, healthcare networks for different geographic regions, etc.). Such\npopulations typically exhibit significant variance. However, existing models\nare not designed to model this variance, which could lead to issues such as\noverfitting. We propose a graph generative model that focuses on matching the\nproperties of real graphs and the natural variance expected for the\ncorresponding population. The proposed model adopts a mixture-model strategy to\nexpand the expressiveness of Kronecker product based graph models (KPGM), while\nbuilding upon the two strengths of KPGM, viz., ability to model several key\nproperties of graphs and to scale to massive graph sizes using its elegant\nfractal growth based formulation. The proposed model, called x-Kronecker\nProduct Graph Model, or xKPGM, allows scalable learning from observed graphs\nand generates samples that match the mean and variance of several salient graph\nproperties. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the proposed model\nto capture the inherent variability in real world graphs on a variety of\npublicly available graph data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

Such a switch needs to compute a matching\n(crossbar schedule) between the input ports and output ports during each\nswitching cycle (time slot). A key research challenge in designing large (in\nnumber of input/output ports $N$) input-queued crossbar switches is to develop\ncrossbar scheduling algorithms that can compute \"high quality\" matchings --\ni.e., those that result in high switch throughput (ideally $100\\%$) and low\nqueueing delays for packets -- at line rates. SERENA is one such algorithm: it\noutputs excellent matching decisions that result in $100\\%$ switch throughput\nand reasonably good queueing delays. However, since SERENA is a centralized\nalgorithm with $O(N)$ computational complexity, it cannot support switches that\nboth are large and have a very high line rate per port.

Without explicitly\naddressing the problem of map consistency, recovery from such distortions tends\nto be difficult. We present a novel system for dense 3D mapping which addresses\nthe challenge of building consistent maps while dealing with scalability.\nCentral to our approach is the representation of the environment as a\ncollection of overlapping TSDF subvolumes. These subvolumes are localized\nthrough feature-based camera tracking and bundle adjustment. Our main\ncontribution is a pipeline for identifying stable regions in the map, and to\nfuse the contributing subvolumes. This approach allows us to reduce map growth\nwhile still maintaining consistency. We demonstrate the proposed system on a\npublicly available dataset and simulation engine, and demonstrate the efficacy\nof the proposed approach for building consistent and scalable maps. Finally we\ndemonstrate our approach running in real-time on-board a lightweight MAV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 18:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 10:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

In this article, we construct a very\ngeneral expression for a time dependent current in an\nelectrode-molecule-electrode arrangement. Utilizing a model Hamiltonian, we\npropagate the Schrodinger wave function equation to numerically compute the\ntime dependent population in the individual sub-systems. The current in each\nelectrode (defined in terms of the rate of change of the corresponding\npopulation) has two components, one due to the charges originating from the\nsame electrode and the other due to the charges initially residing at the other\nelectrode. We derive an analytical expression for the first component and\nillustrate that it agrees reasonably with the numerical counterpart at early\ntimes. The structural form reveals that the initial occupancy can be factored\nout of the time dependent segment of the expression. We take this cue to\nconstruct a Landauer style formula and demonstrate that the current obtained\nfrom this simplified formula overlaps with our most general numerical current\nonly after the charge flow settles into a steady state. Thus, we illustrate the\nemergence of Landauer transport from a true first-principles quantum dynamics\ncalculation without any prior assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate the\ningredients in our model that regulate the onset time scale of this Landauer\nregime. We compare the performance of our general current expression with the\nLandauer current for time dependent electronic coupling. Finally, we comment on\nthe applicability of the Landauer formulas to compute hot-electron current\narising upon plasmon decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

The present paper focuses on the analysis of\nthe internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using about 500 000 spectra\nof 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster,\nwe are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and\ndispersion fields using both radial profiles and two-dimensional maps.

This includes scanning tunneling microscopy of atomic\nimpurities at the surface of superconductors, as well as\nsuperconducting-ion-chip spectroscopy of neutral ions and Rydberg states.\nMoreover, atom-like centers close to the surface are currently believed to be\nthe main source of noise and decoherence in qubits based on superconducting\ndevices. The proximity effect is known to dress atomic orbitals in\nCooper-pair-like states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states (YSR), but the impact\nof SC on the measured orbital splittings and optical/noise transitions is not\nknown. Here we study the interplay between orbital degenerescence and particle\nnumber admixture in atomic states, beyond the usual classical spin\napproximation. We model the atom as a generalized Anderson model interacting\nwith a conventional $s$-wave superconductor.

The technique uses a limited time\nseries of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a\n'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear\nregression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output\nweights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified\nautonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time\nseries whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When\nsuccessful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's\n'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can\ncompute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the\nautonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents\nfor the original input generating system.

The free expansion of the wind terminates\nfar from the neutron star where a weakly magnetized pulsar wind nebula forms,\nimplying efficient magnetic dissipation somewhere upstream. The wind current\nsheet that separates the two magnetic polarities is usually considered as the\nmost natural place for magnetic dissipation via relativistic reconnection, but\nits efficiency remains an open question. Here, the goal of this work is to\nrevisit this issue in light of the most recent progress in the understanding of\nreconnection and pulsar electrodynamics. We perform large two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations of the oblique rotator to capture the multi-scale\nevolution of the wind. We find that the current sheet breaks up into a\ndynamical chain of magnetic islands separated by secondary thin current sheets.\nThe sheet thickness increases linearly with radius while the Poynting flux\ndecreases monotonically as reconnection proceeds. The radius of complete\nannihilation of the stripes is given by the plasma multiplicity parameter at\nthe light cylinder. Current starvation within the sheets does not occur before\ncomplete dissipation as long as there is enough charges where the sheets form.\nParticles are efficiently heated up to a characteristic energy set by the\nmagnetization parameter at the light cylinder. Energetic pulsed synchrotron\nemission peaks close to the light cylinder, and presents sub-pulse variability\nassociated with the formation of plasmoids in the sheet. This study suggests\nthat the striped component of the wind dissipates far before reaching the\ntermination shock in isolated pulsars, even in very-high-multiplicity systems\nsuch as the Crab pulsar. Pulsars in binary systems may provide the best\nenvironments to study magnetic dissipation in the wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 19:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Given an input image of a\nperson and a sentence describing a different outfit, our model \"redresses\" the\nperson as desired, while at the same time keeping the wearer and her/his pose\nunchanged. Generating new outfits with precise regions conforming to a language\ndescription while retaining wearer's body structure is a new challenging task.\nExisting generative adversarial networks are not ideal in ensuring global\ncoherence of structure given both the input photograph and language description\nas conditions. We address this challenge by decomposing the complex generative\nprocess into two conditional stages. In the first stage, we generate a\nplausible semantic segmentation map that obeys the wearer's pose as a latent\nspatial arrangement.

A synchronization string is an encoding of the indices of the\nsymbols in a string, and together with an appropriate decoding algorithm it can\ntransform insertion and deletion errors into standard symbol erasures and\ncorruptions. This reduces the problem of constructing insdel codes to the\nproblem of constructing standard error correcting codes, which is much better\nunderstood. Besides this, synchronization strings are also useful in other\napplications such as synchronization sequences and interactive coding schemes.\n  Amazingly, [HS17a] showed that for any error parameter $\\varepsilon>0$,\nsynchronization strings of arbitrary length exist over an alphabet whose size\ndepends only on $\\varepsilon$. Specifically, they obtained an alphabet size of\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$, as well as a randomized construction that runs in\nexpected time $O(n^5)$.

It is shown that SEL accounts for the effects\nof both specimen size and geometry, allowing an accurate identification of the\ninitial fracture energy of the material, Gf, and the effective Fracture Process\nZone (FPZ) length, cf. The obtained fracture properties were verified by the\nnumerical simulations of the investigated specimens using standard Finite\nElement technique with cohesive model. Significant anisotropy was observed in\nthe fracture properties determined in three principal notch orientations:\narrester, divider, and short-transverse. The size effect of the measured\nstructural strength and apparent fracture toughness was discussed. Neither\nstrength-based criterion which neglects size effect, nor classic LEFM which\ndoes not account for the finiteness of the FPZ can predict the reported size\neffect data, and nonlinear fracture mechanics of the quasibrittle type is\ninstead applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 22:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

Due\nto its simple linear subproblems, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm has recently been\nreceived much attention for solving large-scale structured optimization\nproblems arising from many applied areas such as signal processing and machine\nlearning. In this paper we will discuss in detail the convergence analysis of\nthe Frank-Wolfe algorithm in Banach spaces. Two ways of the selections of the\nstepsizes are discussed: the line minimization search method and the open loop\nrule. In both cases, we prove the convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in\nthe case where the objective function $f$ has uniformly continuous (on bounded\nsets) Fr\\'echet derivative $f'$. We introduce the notion of the curvature\nconstant of order $\\sigma\\in (1,2]$ and obtain the rate\n$O(\\frac{1}{k^{\\sigma-1}})$ of convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. In\nparticular, this rate reduces to $O(\\frac{1}{k^{\\nu}})$ if $f'$ is\n$\\nu$-H\\\"older continuous for $\\nu\\in (0,1]$, and to $O(\\frac{1}{k})$ if $f'$\nis Lipschitz continuous.

(b)\nThe data exhibit cores with overvirial values.\n  Finally, in the simulations we reproduce the behavior depicted by the model\nand observational sample: cores evolve towards larger velocity dispersions and\nsmaller sizes as they collapse and increase their column density. However,\ncollapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.\nThe cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of\nthe gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy\nis given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density. This\nexcess disappears when the gravitational energy is correctly calculated from\nthe actual spatial mass distribution, where inhomogeneities, as well as the\npotential due to the mass outside of the core, also contribute to the\ngravitational energy. We conclude that the observed energy budget of cores in\nsurveys is consistent with their non-thermal motions being driven by their\nself-gravity and in a hierarchical and chaotic collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 00:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Recently, there has been concern in the\ncausal inference literature that hazards actually have a built in\nselection-effect that prevents simple causal interpretations. This is even a\nproblem in randomized controlled trials, where hazard ratios have become a\nstandard measure of treatment effects. Modeling on the hazard scale is\nnevertheless convenient, e.g. to adjust for covariates. Using hazards for\nintermediate calculations may therefore be desirable. Here, we provide a\ngeneric method for transforming hazard estimates consistently to other scales\nat which these built in selection effects are avoided. The method is based on\ndifferential equations, and generalize a well known relation between the\nNelson-Aalen and Kaplan-Meier estimators. Using the martingale central limit\ntheorem we also find that covariances can be estimated consistently for a large\nclass of estimators, thus allowing for rapid calculations of confidence\nintervals.

During the early evolution of the post-merger remnant,\nthe state of the torus is determined by a combination of neutrino cooling and\nmagnetically-driven heating processes, so realistic models must include both\neffects. In this paper, we study the post-merger evolution of a magnetized\nblack hole-neutron star binary system using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC)\nfrom an initial post-merger state provided by previous numerical relativity\nsimulations. We use a finite-temperature nuclear equation of state and\nincorporate neutrino effects in a leakage approximation. To achieve the needed\naccuracy, we introduce improvements to SpEC's implementation of\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), including the use of\ncubed-sphere multipatch grids and an improved method for dealing with\nsupersonic accretion flows where primitive variable recovery is difficult. We\nfind that a seed magnetic field triggers a sustained source of heating, but its\nthermal effects are largely cancelled by the accretion and spreading of the\ntorus from MHD-related angular momentum transport. The neutrino luminosity\npeaks at the start of the simulation, and then drops significantly over the\nfirst 20\\,ms but in roughly the same way for magnetized and nonmagnetized\ndisks. The heating rate and disk's luminosity decrease much more slowly\nthereafter. These features of the evolution are insensitive to grid structure\nand resolution, formulation of the MHD equations, and seed field strength,\nalthough turbulent effects are not fully converged\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Yet, as current software\nsystems continue to grow, current static-analysis systems more frequently face\nthe problem of insufficient scalability. We argue that this is mainly due to\nthe fact that current static analyses are implemented fully manually, often in\ngeneral-purpose programming languages such as Java or C, or in declarative\nlanguages such as Datalog. This design choice predefines the way in which the\nstatic analysis evaluates, and limits the optimizations and extensions\nstatic-analysis designers can apply.\n  To boost scalability to a new level, we propose to fuse static-analysis with\njust-in-time-optimization technology, introducing for the first time static\nanalyses that are managed and inherently self-adaptive. Those analyses\nautomatically adapt themselves to yield a performance/precision tradeoff that\nis optimal with respect to the analyzed software system and to the analysis\nitself.\n  Self-adaptivity is enabled by the novel idea of designing a dedicated\nintermediate representation, not for the analyzed program but for the analysis\nitself.

Although cratering processes on planar surfaces in the\nstrength-controlled regime have been studied extensively, the mechanism by\nwhich target curvature affects the cratering processes remains unclear. Herein,\nwe report on a series of impact experiments that used spherical targets with\nvarious diameters. The resultant craters consisted of a deep circular pit and\nan irregular-shaped spall region around the pit, which is consistent with the\nfeatures reported in a number of previous cratering experiments on planar\nsurfaces. However, the volume and radius of the craters increased with the\nnormalized curvature. The results indicate that the increase in the\nspall-region volume and radius mainly contributes to the increase in the whole\ncrater volume and radius, although the volume, depth, and radius of pits remain\nconstant with curvature. The results of our model indicate that the geometric\neffect due to curvature (i.e., whereby the distance from the equivalent center\nto the target free surface is shorter for higher curvature values) contributes\nto increases in the cratering efficiency.

Steady detonation in a\nstraight charge propagates at constant speed but when it enters an annular\nsection, it goes through a transition phase and eventually reaches a new steady\nstate of constant angular velocity. This study examines the speed of the\ndetonation wave along the annular charge during the transition phase and at\nsteady state, as well as its dependence on the dimensions of the annulus. The\nsystem is modeled using a recently proposed diffuse-interface formulation which\nallows for the representation of a two-phase explosive and of an additional\ninert material. The explosive considered is the polymer-bonded TATB-based LX-17\nand is modeled using two JWL equations of state and the Ignition and Growth\nreaction rate law. Results show that steady state speeds are in good agreement\nwith experiment. In the transition phase, the evolution of outer detonation\nspeed deviates from the exponential bounded growth function suggested by\nprevious studies. We propose a new description of the transition phase which\nconsists of two regimes. The first is caused by local effects at the outer edge\nof the annulus and leads to a dependence of outer detonation speed on angular\nposition along the arc. The second regime is induced by effects originating\nfrom the inner edge of the annular charge and leads to the deceleration of the\nouter detonation until steady state is reached. The study concludes with a\nparametric study where the dependence of the steady state and the transition\nphase on the dimensions of the annulus is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 10:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 23:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

NGC3447 and NGC3447A belong to the\nsame halo, NGC3447A being a substructure of the same disk as NGC3447. The halo\ngravitational instability, enhanced by the encounter, fuels a long lived\ninstability in this dark matter dominated disk, driving its morphology. This\nsystem may warn about a new class of \"false pairs\" and the potential danger of\na misunderstanding of such objects in pair surveys that could produce a severe\nunderestimate of the total mass of the system.

Consequently, one of the crucial questions\nin reconciling star-formation in clouds is to understand the factors that\ncontrol this process. While it is widely accepted that the variation in ambient\nconditions can alter significantly the ability of a cloud to spawn stars, the\nobserved variation in the star-formation rate in nearby clouds that experience\nsimilar ambient conditions, presents an interesting question. In this work we\nattempted to reconcile this variation within the paradigm of colliding flows.\nTo this end we develop self-gravitating, hydrodynamic realisations of identical\nflows, but allowed to collide off-centre. Typical observational diagnostics\nsuch as the gas-velocity dispersion, the fraction of dense-gas, the column\ndensity distribution ({\\small N-PDF}), the distribution of gas mass as a\nfunction of $K$-band extinction and the strength of compressional/solenoidal\nmodes in the post-collision cloud were deduced for different choices of the\nimpact parameter of collision. We find that a strongly sheared cloud is\nterribly inefficient in cycling gas into the dense phase and that such a cloud\ncan possibly reconcile the sluggish nature of star-formation reported for some\nclouds. Within the paradigm of cloud-formation via colliding flows this is\npossible in case of flows colliding with a relatively large impact parameter.\nWe conclude that compressional modes - though probably essential - are\ninsufficient to ensure a relatively higher star-formation efficiency in a\ncloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 10:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Our survey, together with other ALMA\nstudies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass\ncompanions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1\nM_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust\ncontent can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much\nshorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we\nsuggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically\nthick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak\n(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA. Our order-of-magnitude\nestimate shows that compact optically-thick disks might be smaller than 1000\nR_jup and only emit ~micro-Jy of flux in the (sub)millimeter, but their average\ntemperature can be higher than that of circumstellar disks.

Finally, the compact disk size might imply that dynamical\nencounters between the companion and the star, or any other scatterers in the\nsystem, play a role in the formation of planetary-mass companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 11:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The\nguiding principle is that randomness is not a property, but a methodological\nchoice of what to ignore in the flow, and that a complete understanding of\nturbulence, including the possibility of control, requires that it be kept to a\nminimum. After briefly reviewing the underlying low-order statistics of flows\nat moderate Reynolds numbers, the article examines what two-point statistics\nimply for the decomposition of the flow into individual eddies. Intense eddies\nare examined next, including their temporal evolution, and shown to satisfy\nmany of the properties required for coherence. In particular, it is shown that\ncoherent structures larger than the Corrsin scale are a natural consequence of\nthe shear. In wall-bounded turbulence, they can be classified into coherent\ndispersive waves and transient bursts. The former are found in the viscous\nlayer near the wall and as very-large structures spanning the boundary layer\nthickness. Although they are shear-driven, these waves have enough internal\nstructure to maintain a uniform advection velocity. Conversely, bursts exist at\nall scales, are characteristic of the logarithmic layer, and interact almost\nlinearly with the shear. While the waves require a wall to determine their\nlength scale, the bursts are essentially independent from it. The article\nconcludes with a brief review of our present theoretical understanding of\nturbulent structures, and with a list of open problems and future perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 11:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 11:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 21:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

Despite the\nextensiveness of the literature regarding the characterization and modeling of\nthe defect, many fundamental questions persist. Among them we have the shaky\nconnection of the EPR data to the electrical measurements, the physical origin\nof the pseudo-Jahn-Teller (pJT) effect, the reasoning for the observed\nsub-lattice dependence of the paramagnetic states, and the severe\ntemperature-dependence of some hyperfine signals which cannot be accounted for\nby a thermally-activated dynamic averaging between equivalent JT-distorted\nstructures. In this work we address these problems by means of semi-local and\nhybrid density functional calculations. We start by inventorying a total of\nfour vacancy structures. Diamagnetic states have well defined low-energy\nstructures, whereas paramagnetic states display metastability. This rich\nstructural variety is traced back to the filling of electronic states which are\nshaped by a crystal-field-dependent pJT effect. From calculated minimum energy\npaths for defect rotation and transformation mechanisms, combined with the\ncalculated formation energies and electrical levels, we arrived at a\nconfiguration-coordinate diagram of the defect. The diagram provides us with a\ndetailed first-principles picture of the defect when subject to optical and\nthermal excitations.

From comparison of\ncalculated and measured $U$-values, and correlating the site-dependent\nformation energies with the relative intensity of the DLTS peaks in as-grown\nmaterial, we assign Z$_{1}$ (EH$_{6}$) and Z$_{2}$ (EH$_{7}$) signals to\nacceptor (donor) transitions of carbon vacancies located on the $h$ and $k$\nsub-lattice sites, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 12:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 09:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Apart from the standard methods, numerous new\nobservables and reconstruction techniques are employed to improve the overall\nprecision and to provide different sensitivities to various systematic\nuncertainties. Recently, the normalised inverse invariant mass distribution of\nthe $t\\bar{t}$ system and the leading extra jet not coming from the top quark\ndecays has been proposed for the $pp \\to t\\bar{t}j$ production process, denoted\nas ${\\cal R}(m_t^{pole},\\rho_s)$.

First, the\nimpact on the extraction of $m_t$ is investigated and afterwards the associated\nuncertainties are quantified. In one approach we include all interferences,\noff-shell effects and non-resonant backgrounds. This is contrasted with a\ndifferent approach with top quark decays in the narrow width approximation. In\nthe latter case, two cases are employed: NLO QCD corrections to the $pp\\to\nt\\bar{t}j$ production process with leading order decays and the more\nsophisticated case with QCD corrections and jet radiation present also in top\nquark decays. The top quark mass sensitivity of ${\\cal R}(m_t^{pole},\\rho_s)$\nis investigated and compared to other observables: the invariant mass of the\ntop anti-top pair, the minimal invariant mass of the $b$-jet and a charged\nlepton as well as the total transverse momentum of the $t\\bar{t}j$ system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 12:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 11:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

The question is formalized using valence automata, an\nabstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid.\nFor each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically\ninfinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to\n(one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage\nmechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph\nmonoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which\nbehave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative\nvalues), and combinations thereof.\n  Hence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence\nautomata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of\nPetri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing\nopen question and we do not answer it here.\n  However, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a\ncharacterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those\nstorage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model\nthat naturally generalizes both pushdown Petri nets and the priority\nmulticounter machines introduced by Reinhardt.\n  The cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new\nextension of Petri nets with decidable reachability. It is finally shown that\nthis model can be combined with another such extension by Atig and Ganty: We\npresent a further decidability result that subsumes both of these Petri net\nextensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 13:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

We perform hydrodynamic and acoustic pressure\nmeasurements in order to characterise the tones as a function of Mach number\nand streamwise edge position. The distribution of spectral peaks observed, as a\nfunction of Mach number, cannot be explained using the usual edge-tone\nscenario, in which resonance is underpinned by coupling between\ndownstream-travelling Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepackets and upstream-travelling\nsound waves. We show, rather, that the strongest tones are due to coupling\nbetween the former and upstream-travelling jet modes recently studied by Towne\net al. (2017) and Schmidt et al. (2017). We also study the band-limited nature\nof the resonance, showing a high-frequency cut-off to be due to the frequency\ndependence of the upstream-travelling waves. At high Mach number these become\nevanescent above a certain frequency, whereas at low Mach number they become\nprogressively trapped with increasing frequency, a consequence of which is\ntheir not being reflected in the nozzle plane. Additionally, a weaker,\nlow-frequency, forced-resonance regime is identified that involves the same\nupstream travelling jet modes but that couple, in this instance, with\ndownstream-travelling sound waves.

In relaxing Simon's\nassumption of a linear growth mechanism, we consider the case of an arbitrary\ngrowth kernel and find the general solution to the resultant PDE. We then\nextend the PDE to multiple spatial dimensions, again determining the general\nsolution. Finally, we apply the model to size and wealth distributions of\nfirms. We obtain power law scaling for both to be concordant with simulations\nas well as observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 15:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 18:30:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

We quantify human\ninformational needs using the signal processing metrics of entropy, noise,\ndimensionality, continuity, latency, and bandwidth. Using these metrics, we\ndefine the trust humans experience as a primitive statistical algorithm\nprocessing finely grained sensorimotor data from neuromechanical interaction.\nThis definition of neuromechanical trust implies that artificial sensorimotor\ninputs and interactions that attract low-level attention through frequent\ndiscontinuities and enhanced coherence will decalibrate a brain's\nrepresentation of its world over the long term by violating the implicit\nstatistical contract for which self-calibration evolved.

Different types of MDPs with uncertain, imprecise or\nbounded transition rates or probabilities and rewards exist in the literature.\n  Commonly, analysis of models with uncertainties amounts to searching for the\nmost robust policy which means that the goal is to generate a policy with the\ngreatest lower bound on performance (or, symmetrically, the lowest upper bound\non costs). However, hedging against an unlikely worst case may lead to losses\nin other situations. In general, one is interested in policies that behave well\nin all situations which results in a multi-objective view on decision making.\n  In this paper, we consider policies for the expected discounted reward\nmeasure of MDPs with uncertain parameters.

This novel approach mainly consists of two steps: the computation of the\nWigner kernel, a multi-dimensional function describing the effects of the\npotential over the system, and the field-less evolution of the particles which\neventually create new signed particles in the process. Although this method has\nproved to be extremely advantageous in terms of computational resources - as a\nmatter of fact it is able to simulate in a time-dependent fashion many- body\nsystems on relatively small machines - the Wigner kernel can represent the\nbottleneck of simulations of certain systems. Moreover, storing the kernel can\nbe another issue as the amount of memory needed is cursed by the dimensionality\nof the system. In this work, we introduce a new technique which drastically\nreduces the computation time and memory requirement to simulate time-dependent\nquantum systems which is based on the use of an appropriately tailored neural\nnetwork combined with the signed particle formalism. In particular, the\nsuggested neural network is able to compute efficiently and reliably the Wigner\nkernel without any training as its entire set of weights and biases is\nspecified by analytical formulas. As a consequence, the amount of memory for\nquantum simulations radically drops since the kernel does not need to be stored\nanymore as it is now computed by the neural network itself, only on the cells\nof the (discretized) phase-space which are occupied by particles. As its is\nclearly shown in the final part of this paper, not only this novel approach\ndrastically reduces the computational time, it also remains accurate.
