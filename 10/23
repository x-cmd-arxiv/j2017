We\nenumerate the possibilities for the Brauer groups of certain families of such\nsurfaces, and show that in contrast to their smooth compactifications, the\nBrauer groups of these affine varieties need not be generated by cyclic (e.g.\nquaternion) algebras. Concrete examples are given of such surfaces over\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ which have solutions in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for all $p$ and solutions\nin $\\mathbb{Q}$, but for which the failure of the integral Hasse principle\ncannot be explained by a Brauer-Manin obstruction. The methods of this paper\nbuild on the ideas of several recent papers in the literature: we study the\nBrauer groups (modulo constant algebras) of affine Ch\\^atelet surfaces with a\nfocus on explicitly representing, by central simple algebras over the function\nfield of $X$, a finite set of classes of the Brauer group which generate the\nquotient. Notably, we develop techniques for constructing explicit\nrepresentatives of non-cyclic Brauer classes on affine surfaces, as well as\nprovide an effective algorithm for the computation of local invariants of these\nBrauer classes via effective lifting of cocycles in Galois cohomology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 16:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Our main objective is to reduce the large\noverhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink (UL) feedback\nneeded to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our\nproposed scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of\na channel vector, also known as the angular scattering function, is a\nfrequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity and has a limited\nangular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to\nobtain the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit\nthe estimated support of the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient\nchannel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes the total spectral\nefficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing\ncompressed-sensing (CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support\ninformation helps reduce the feedback overhead from O(s*log M) in CS techniques\nto O(s) in our proposed method, with $s$ and $M$ being sparsity order of the\nchannel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively.\nFurthermore, in order to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL\ncommon training and UL feedback overhead, we introduce the novel concept of\nactive channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension is less\nthan the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a\npre-beamforming matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel\ndimension of each user to be not larger than the DL pilot dimension, while\nmaximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed angles. We\nprovide numerical experiments to compare our method with the state-of-the-art\nCS technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 18:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Using 9 dark-matter simulations of\nhalos like the Milky Way (MW), we find that the present-day substructures in\neach halo follow a characteristic distribution in the phase space of orbital\nbinding energy and angular momentum, and that this distribution is similar from\nhalo to halo but has an intrinsic dependence on the halo formation history. We\nconstruct this distribution directly from the simulations for a specific halo\nand extend the result to halos of similar formation history but different\nmasses by scaling. The mass of an observed halo can then be estimated by\nmaximizing the likelihood in comparing the measured kinematic parameters of its\nsatellite galaxies with these distributions. We test the validity and accuracy\nof this method with mock samples taken from the simulations. Using the\npositions, radial velocities, and proper motions of 9 tracers and assuming\nobservational uncertainties comparable to those of MW satellite galaxies, we\nfind that the halo mass can be recovered to within $\\sim$40%. The accuracy can\nbe improved to within $\\sim$25% if 30 tracers are used. However, the dependence\nof the phase-space distribution on the halo formation history sets a minimum\nuncertainty of $\\sim$20% that cannot be reduced by using more tracers. We\nbelieve that this minimum uncertainty also applies to any mass determination\nfor a halo when the phase space information of other kinematic tracers is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2017 19:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

Due to the typically complex nature of each\nchallenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large,\nmachine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not\naccount for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization\nproblem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart\n\"Predict, then Optimize\" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization\nproblem structure, i.e., its objective and constraints, for designing better\nprediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function\nwhich measures the decision error induced by a prediction.\n  Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally\nchallenging, and thus we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss\nfunction which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+\nloss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild\nconditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex,\nor even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical\nexperiments on shortest path and portfolio optimization problems show that the\nSPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the\npredict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular when the prediction model being\ntrained is misspecified.

A subspace is formed by choosing a subset\nof features in the original state representation (full-space).

Depending on the number of\ncommunicators, the time for communicator creation can drastically increase the\nrunning time of the algorithm. Furthermore, a new communicator synchronizes all\nprocesses as communicator creation routines are blocking collective operations.\n  We present RBC, a communication library based on MPI, that creates\nrange-based communicators in constant time without communication.

In order to\ndemonstrate the capability of the proposed method for sensitivity analysis,\nseveral simulations are conducted.

The coronal magnetic fields rooted at\nthe location of EUV flare ribbons, derived from the NLFF model, demonstrate the\npre-flare phase to exhibit an \"X-type\" configuration while the magnetic fields\nat the post-flare phase are more or less parallel oriented. The comparisons of\nmulti-wavelength measurements with the magnetic field extrapolations suggest\nthat the jet activity likely triggered the two-ribbon flare by perturbing the\nfield in the interior of the active region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 05:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Studying the relationship between wave time dynamics and the origin\nof UFs requires further investigation of their fine spatial and height\nstructure. We investigated the association between a short time increase in the\nvariations of three-minute extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission at footpoints of\ncoronal magnetic loops and the UF emergence in sunspot umbra. We applied the\npixelized wavelet filtering (PWF) technique to analyse a cube of the images\nobtained by SDO/AIA at 1600A, 304A, and 171A to study the spatio-temporal\noscillation power distribution in individual magnetic loops. Time-distance\nplots were used to obtain the wave front propagation velocity. For the first\ntime, we obtained the 2D images of the fine wave processes in magnetic\nstructures of different spatial scales related to the UFs in sunspot. We\nrevealed two types of the UFs as background and local. The background UFs\nassociated with random increasing of separate parts of wave fronts. These UFs\nare seen as weak and diffuse details that ride the wave fronts without stable\nshapes and localization in space. The local UFs sources mainly localize near to\nthe footpoint of magnetic loops, anchored in an umbra, along which the\npropagation of three-minute waves was observed. It is shown that the maxima of\nthree-minute oscillation trains coincide with the peak intensity of UFs. The\nsunspot three-minute wave dynamics showed a relation between the localization\nof oscillations power peak at the coronal magnetic loop footpoints and the UFs\norigin. The spatial structure of the UFs sources, their power, and lifetime are\ndetermined by the cut-off frequency of the waves for the detected waveguides.\nWe concluded that UFs are a global process of short-time increase of the wave\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 05:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 01:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

It has been the dream of many mathematicians at\nthe end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of\nalgebraic partial differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely\ngenerated differential extensions, in order to be able to add the word\ndifferential in front of any classical statement. The achievement of the\nPicard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known.\nThe purpose of this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential\nextensions and algebraic pseudogroups by means of new methods mixing\ndifferential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. As already\ndiscovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a\nconcept never acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory\n(old and new) is mainly a study of principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for\nalgebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal theory of PD equations\ndevelopped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern\nalgebraic geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However,\nthe combination of these new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the\nanalogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called invariant derivations introduced\nby A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic groups and fields\nwith derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting\ndifferential Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics,\nrevisiting shell theory, chain theory, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the\nintegration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 07:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

However some high-energy solar events\ndo not result in SEPs being detected at Earth, and it is these types of event\nwhich may be termed \"false alarms\".\n  We define two simple SEP forecasting algorithms based upon the occurrence of\na magnetically well-connected CME with a speed in excess of 1500 km/s (\"a fast\nCME\") or a well-connected X-class flare and analyse them with respect to\nhistorical data sets. We compare the parameters of those solar events which\nproduced an enhancement of >40 MeV protons at Earth (\"an SEP event\") and the\nfalse alarms. We find that an SEP forecasting algorithm based solely upon the\noccurrence of a well-connected fast CME produces fewer false alarms (28.8%)\nthan one based solely upon a well-connected X-class flare (50.6%). Both\nalgorithms fail to forecast a relatively high percentage of SEP events (53.2%\nand 50.6% respectively). Our analysis of the historical data sets shows that\nfalse alarm X-class flares were either not associated with any CME, or were\nassociated with a CME slower than 500 km/s; false alarm fast CMEs tended to be\nassociated with flares of class less than M3.\n  A better approach to forecasting would be an algorithm which takes as its\nbase the occurrence of both CMEs and flares. We define a new forecasting\nalgorithm which uses a combination of CME and flare parameters and show that\nthe false alarm ratio is similar to that for the algorithm based upon fast CMEs\n(29.6%), but the percentage of SEP events not forecast is reduced to 32.4%.\nLists of the solar events which gave rise to >40 MeV protons and the false\nalarms have been derived and are made available to aid further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 09:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

In this work, we present the\npossibility of varying this transition temperature into a same giant\nmagnetocaloric material by ion irradiation. We demonstrate that the transition\ntemperature of iron rhodium thin films can be tuned by the bombardment of ions\nof Ne 5+ with varying fluences up to 10 14 ions cm --2 , leading to optimal\nrefrigeration over a large 270--380 K temperature window.

The reason for\nthis lies primarily in the possible \"wild\" behaviour of separatrices of saddle\npoints. Another difference between Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms in dimension 3\nfrom their surface analogues lies in the variety of heteroclinic intersections:\na connected component of such an intersection may be not only a point as in the\ntwo-dimensional case, but also a curve, compact or non-compact. The problem of\na topological classification of Morse-Smale cascades on 3-manifolds either\nwithout heteroclinic points (gradient-like cascades) or without heteroclinic\ncurves was solved in a series of papers from 2000 to 2006 by Ch.

Several\nrecent studies have shown that a planet with a mass of about 10 Earth masses on\na distant eccentric orbit with perihelion far beyond the Kuiper belt could\ncreate and maintain this clustering. The evolutionary path resulting in an\norbit such as the one suggested for Planet Nine is nevertheless not easily\nexplained. Here we investigate whether a planet scattered away from the\ngiant-planet region could be lifted to an orbit similar to the one suggested\nfor Planet Nine through dynamical friction with a cold, distant planetesimal\nbelt. Recent simulations of planetesimal formation via the streaming\ninstability suggest that planetesimals can readily form beyond 100au. We\nexplore this circularisation by dynamical friction with a set of numerical\nsimulations. We find that a planet that is scattered from the region close to\nNeptune onto an eccentric orbit has a 20-30% chance of obtaining an orbit\nsimilar to that of Planet Nine after 4.6Gyr. Our simulations also result in\nstrong or partial clustering of the planetesimals; however, whether or not this\nclustering is observable depends on the location of the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal belt.

Considering that\ntensor subspaces and orthogonal projections onto these subspaces are well\ndefined in the recently proposed transform-based tensor model, which motivates\nus to investigate the problem of matched subspace detection in high dimensional\ncase. In this paper, we propose an approach for tensor matched subspace\ndetection based on the transform-based tensor model with tubal-sampling and\nelementwise-sampling, respectively. First, we construct estimators based on\ntubal-sampling and elementwise-sampling to estimate the energy of a signal\noutside a given subspace of a third-order tensor and then give the probability\nbounds of our estimators, which show that our estimators work effectively when\nthe sample size is greater than a constant. Secondly, the detectors both for\nnoiseless data and noisy data are given, and the corresponding detection\nperformance analyses are also provided.

On the one hand, current methods that produce very high fidelity\nresults, typically require controlled settings, expensive devices, or\nsignificant manual effort. To the other hand, methods that are automatic and\nwork on 'in the wild' Internet images, often extract only low-frequency\nlighting or diffuse materials. In this work, we propose to make use of a set of\nphotographs in order to jointly estimate the non-diffuse materials and sharp\nlighting in an uncontrolled setting. Our key observation is that seeing\nmultiple instances of the same material under different illumination (i.e.,\nenvironment), and different materials under the same illumination provide\nvaluable constraints that can be exploited to yield a high-quality solution\n(i.e., specular materials and environment illumination) for all the observed\nmaterials and environments. Similar constraints also arise when observing\nmultiple materials in a single environment, or a single material across\nmultiple environments.

Many such problems require finding a solution that maximizes the\nnumber of constraints satisfied. Often, these problems are particularly\ndifficult to solve because they belong to the NP-hard class, namely algorithms\nthat always find a solution in polynomial time are not known. Over the past\ndecades, research has focused on developing heuristic approaches that attempt\nto find an approximation to the solution. However, despite numerous research\nefforts, in many cases even approximations to the optimal solution are hard to\nfind, as the computational time for further refining a candidate solution grows\nexponentially with input size. Here, we show a non-combinatorial approach to\nhard optimization problems that achieves an exponential speed-up and finds\nbetter approximations than the current state-of-the-art. First, we map the\noptimization problem into a boolean circuit made of specially designed,\nself-organizing logic gates, which can be built with (non-quantum) electronic\ncomponents; the equilibrium points of the circuit represent the approximation\nto the problem at hand.

Typically, this covariance matrix is approximately low-rank and can be\nused to cluster the volumes or estimate the intrinsic geometry of the\nconformation space. We formulate the estimation of this covariance matrix as a\nlinear inverse problem, yielding a consistent least-squares estimator. For $n$\nimages of size $N$-by-$N$ pixels, we propose an algorithm for calculating this\ncovariance estimator with computational complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(nN^4+\\sqrt{\\kappa}N^6 \\log N)$, where the condition number\n$\\kappa$ is empirically in the range $10$--$200$.

The fact that VO 2 exhibits\nan insulator to metal transition is exploited to modulate and/or amplify heat\nfluxes between the emitter and the collector, by applying a thermal current on\nthe VO 2 base. We study the transistor behavior in 4 typical regimes where the\nemitter-base and base-collector separation distances can be larger or smaller\nthan the thermal wavelength, and in which the VO 2 layer can be opaque or\ntransparent. Thermal currents variations with the base temperatures are\ncalculated and analyzed. An optimum configuration for base thickness and\nseparation distance maximizing the thermal transistor modulation factor is\nfound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 07:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

In this article, two methods for\ntemperature compensation are used to evaluate the temperature of a structure\nmonitored by Piezoceramic Transducers (PZT). The first one consists in a linear\nregression of the static capacity of the PZT (computed with the\nelectromechanical impedance) with the temperature. It allows one to determine\ntemperature of a PZT from any impedance measurement. The second method is based\non the Modes Frequency Shift (MFS) of the frequency response function (FRF)\ncalculated in a pitch-catch mode with an exponential sweep signal. A linear\nregression between the MFS and the temperature is settled for most modes and\nallow the estimation of temperature between two PZT. Experiments on a composite\nplate monitored by 5 PZT patches showed that a $\\pm$2{\\textdegree}C degree\nvariation can easily be identified with both methods. Combined together, those\ntwo methods could replace actual temperature sensors and bring an efficient\nimprovement for temperature compensation in applications where the temperature\nvariation is heterogeneous on a structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 11:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Both harmonic and pulse\nexcitations are considered via Fourier and Laplace transform, respectively. An\nefficient method for the fast computation of the inverse Laplace transform of\nthe magnetic polarization signals is also devised based on the generalized\npencil-of-function (GPOF) method.
