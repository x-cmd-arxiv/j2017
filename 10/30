The X-ray\ndata were obtained from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) and the Russian solar observatory KORONAS-F (IRIS experiment). The EUV\ndata were obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (SDO/AIA). In the first chapter a new technique is presented, which\nallowed to determine at first the photon spectra based on the KORONAS-F/IRIS\nobservations and then to reconstruct the energy spectra of the emitting\nelectrons using the random search method and the Tikhonov regularization\nmethod. In the second chapter the developed technique of simultaneously fitting\nthe model differential emission measure functions (DEM) to RHESSI and SDO/AIA\ndata is introduced, which allowed to infer the electron distribution from X-ray\nand EUV observations. The proposed method allows to reconstruct of both the\nspectra of accelerated/heated electrons and the basic parameters of the flare\nplasma, such as temperature, emission measure, total electron number density,\nand flare energy. In addition, the analytical function suitable for both DEM\nanalysis and mean electron flux spectra in flares has been developed and\napplied, as well as kappa-distribution in the form of differential emission\nmeasure.

The algorithms run\nfaster or have better performance guarantees. Unfortunately, in real\napplications, the data are messy and values are noisy. The distances between\nthe data points are far from satisfying a metric. Indeed, there are a number of\ndifferent algorithms for finding the closest set of distances to the given ones\nthat also satisfy a metric (sometimes with the extra condition of being\nEuclidean). These algorithms can have unintended consequences, they can change\na large number of the original data points, and alter many other features of\nthe data.\n  The goal of sparse metric repair is to make as few changes as possible to the\noriginal data set or underlying distances so as to ensure the resulting\ndistances satisfy the properties of a metric. In other words, we seek to\nminimize the sparsity (or the $\\ell_0$ \"norm\") of the changes we make to the\ndistances subject to the new distances satisfying a metric. We give three\ndifferent combinatorial algorithms to repair a metric sparsely. In one setting\nthe algorithm is guaranteed to return the sparsest solution and in the other\nsettings, the algorithms repair the metric. Without prior information, the\nalgorithms run in time proportional to the cube of the number of input data\npoints and, with prior information we can reduce the running time considerably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 17:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

The high propagation losses in the mmWave bands\nnecessitate beamforming with a large number of antennas. Traditionally each\nantenna is paired with a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which\nresults in high power consumption. A hybrid beamforming architecture and\none-bit resolution ADCs have been proposed to reduce power consumption.\nHowever, analog beamforming and one-bit quantization make channel estimation\nmore challenging. In this paper, we propose a narrowband channel estimation\nalgorithm for mmWave communication systems with one-bit ADCs and hybrid\nbeamforming based on generalized approximate message passing (GAMP). We show\nthrough simulation that 1) GAMP variants with one-bit ADCs have better\nperformance than do least-squares estimation methods without quantization, 2)\nthe proposed one-bit GAMP algorithm achieves the lowest estimation error among\nthe GAMP variants, and 3) exploiting more frames and RF chains enhances the\nchannel estimation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 19:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 02:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

One of the main limitations with\ncurrent CAD approaches is that it is very difficult to gain insight or\nrationale as to how decisions are made, thus limiting their utility to\nclinicians. Methods: In this study, we propose CLEAR-DR, a novel interpretable\nCAD system based on the notion of CLass-Enhanced Attentive Response Discovery\nRadiomics for the purpose of clinical decision support for diabetic\nretinopathy. Results: In addition to disease grading via the discovered deep\nradiomic sequencer, the CLEAR-DR system also produces a visual interpretation\nof the decision-making process to provide better insight and understanding into\nthe decision-making process of the system. Conclusion: We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and utility of the proposed CLEAR-DR system of enhancing the\ninterpretability of diagnostic grading results for the application of diabetic\nretinopathy grading.

The Majorana ZBP-height is predicted to be quantized\nat the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature. Interestingly,\nthis quantization is a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry,\n'particle equals antiparticle'. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization\nagainst disorder, interactions, and variations in the tunnel coupling. Previous\nexperiments, however, have shown ZBPs much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent\nobservation of a peak-height close to 2e2/h.

We distinguish\nthis quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins, by\ninvestigating its robustness on electric and magnetic fields as well as its\ntemperature dependence.

The main difference between\ncomplex and quaternionic operator theory is based on the definition of\nspectrum. In fact, in quaternionic operator theory the classical notion of\nresolvent operator and the one of spectrum need to be replaced by the two\n$S$-resolvent operators and the $S$-spectrum. This is a consequence of the\nnon-commutativity of the quaternionic setting. Indeed, the $S$-spectrum of a\nquaternionic linear operator $T$ is given by the non invertibility of a second\norder operator. This presents new challenges which makes our approach to\nperturbation theory of quaternionic operators different from the classical\ncase. In this paper we study the problem of perturbation of a quaternionic\nnormal operator in a Hilbert space by making use of the concepts of\n$S$-spectrum and of slice hyperholomorphicity of the $S$-resolvent operators.\nFor this new setting we prove results on the perturbation of quaternionic\nnormal operators by operators belonging to a Schatten class and give conditions\nwhich guarantee the existence of a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace of a\nquaternionic linear operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 00:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

The execution cost of\nthese instructions is significant and adds a non-trivial overhead to parallel\nprograms. In a naive architecture implementation, we track the ordering\nconstraints imposed by a fence by its entry in the reorder buffer and its\nexecution overhead entails stalling the processor's pipeline until the store\nbuffer is drained and also conservatively invalidating speculative loads. These\nactions create a cascading effect of increased overhead on the execution of the\nfollowing instructions in the program. We find these actions to be overly\nrestrictive and that they can be further relaxed thereby allowing aggressive\noptimizations.\n  The current work proposes a lightweight mechanism in which we assign ordering\ntags, called versions, to load and store instructions when they reside in the\nload/store queues and the write buffer. The version assigned to a memory access\nallows us to fully exploit the relaxation allowed by the weak consistency model\nand restricts its execution in such a way that the ordering constraints by the\nmodel are satisfied. We utilize the information captured through the assigned\nversions to reduce stalls caused by waiting for the store buffer to drain and\nto avoid unnecessary squashing of speculative loads, thereby minimizing the\nre-execution penalty. This method is particularly effective for the release\nconsistency model that employs uni-directional fence instructions.

In contrast to safety, the parameterized\nverification of liveness is currently still considered extremely challenging\nespecially in the presence of probabilities in the model. One major challenge\nis to provide a sufficiently powerful symbolic framework. One well-known\nsymbolic framework for the parameterized verification of non-probabilistic\nconcurrent systems is regular model checking. Although the framework was\nrecently extended to probabilistic systems, incorporating fairness in the\nframework - often crucial for verifying termination - has been especially\ndifficult due to the presence of an infinite number of fairness constraints\n(one for each process).

Our encoding reduces\ntermination with finitary fairness to verifying parameterized termination\nwithout fairness over probabilistic systems in regular model checking (for\nwhich a verification framework already exists).

Here we\nprovide strong evidence that the replica bands observed in the single-layer\nFeSe/SrTiO$_3$ system and several other cases are largely due to the energy\nloss processes of the escaping photoelectron, resulted from the well-known\nstrong coupling of external propagating electrons to Fuchs-Kliewer (F-K)\nsurface phonons in ionic materials in general. The photoelectron energy loss in\nARPES on single-layer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ is calculated using the demonstrated\nsuccessful semi-classical dielectric theory in describing low energy electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy of ionic insulators. Our result shows that the\nobserved replica bands are mostly a result of extrinsic photoelectron energy\nloss and not a result of the electron phonon interaction of the Fe d electrons\nwith the substrate phonons. The strong enhancement of the superconducting\ntransition temperature in these monolayers remains an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 07:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 18:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Due to a large number of antennas but a much smaller number of\nradio frequency (RF) chains, estimating the high-dimensional mmWave massive\nMIMO channel will bring the large pilot overhead. To overcome this challenge,\nthis paper proposes a super-resolution channel estimation scheme based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) u- nitary ESPRIT algorithm. By exploiting the angular\nsparsity of mmWave channels, the continuously distributed angle of\narrivals/departures (AoAs/AoDs) can be jointly estimated with high accuracy.\nSpecifically, by designing the uplink training signals at both base station\n(BS) and mobile station (MS), we first use low pilot overhead to estimate a\nlow-dimensional effective channel, which has the same shift-invariance of array\nresponse as the high-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel to be estimated. From the\nlow-dimensional effective channel, the super- resolution estimates of AoAs and\nAoDs can be jointly obtained by exploiting the 2D unitary ESPRIT channel\nestimation algorithm. Furthermore, the associated path gains can be acquired\nbased on the least squares (LS) criterion. Finally, we can reconstruct the\nhigh-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel according to the obtained AoAs, AoDs, and\npath gains.

A first order approximation of\nthis equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter\ndependency, the solar modulation potential $\\phi$.

The essential novelty is a new representation of the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator, needed to close the Hamiltonian evolution\nequations. This representation emerges from the treatment of the substrate\nkinematical problem by means of exact semi-separation of variables in the\nirregular fluid domain, established recently by Athanassoulis & Papoutsellis\n(2017) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2017.0017). The HCMT ensures an efficient\ndimensional reduction of the exact NLFP, being able to treat an arbitrary\nbathymetry as simply as the flat-bottom case. A key point for the efficient\nimplementation of HCMT is the fast and accurate evaluation of the space-time\nvarying coefficients appearing in some of its equations. All varying\ncoefficients are calculated analytically, resulting in a refined version of the\ntheory, characterized by improved accuracy at significantly reduced\ncomputational time. This improved version of HCMT is first validated against\nexisting experimental results and other computations, and subsequently applied\nto new solitary wave-bottom interaction problems. The latter include: i) the\ninvestigation of a new type of Bragg scattering effect, appearing when a\nsolitary wave propagates over a seabed with a sinusoidal patch, and ii) the\ndisintegration, focusing and reflection of a solitary wave moving over a\nthree-dimensional bathymetry consisting of parallel banks and troughs, and\nimpinging on a vertical wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 10:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

The mathematical formulations that such\nmodels lead to are opaque, and, due to their complexity, are often considered\nanalytically intractable. As such, a variety of Monte Carlo simulation\nalgorithms have been developed to explore model dynamics empirically. Whilst\nwell-known methods, such as the Gillespie Algorithm, can be implemented to\ninvestigate a given model, the computational demands of traditional simulation\ntechniques remain a significant barrier to modern research.\n  In order to further develop and explore biologically relevant stochastic\nmodels, new and efficient computational methods are required. In this thesis,\nhigh-performance simulation algorithms are developed to estimate summary\nstatistics that characterise a chosen reaction network. The algorithms make use\nof variance reduction techniques, which exploit statistical properties of the\nmodel dynamics, to improve performance.\n  The multi-level method is an example of a variance reduction technique. The\nmethod estimates summary statistics of well-mixed, spatially homogeneous models\nby using estimates from multiple ensembles of sample paths of different\naccuracies. In this thesis, the multi-level method is developed in three\ndirections: firstly, a nuanced implementation framework is described; secondly,\na reformulated method is applied to stiff reaction systems; and, finally,\ndifferent approaches to variance reduction are implemented and compared.\n  The variance reduction methods that underpin the multi-level method are then\nre-purposed to understand how the dynamics of a spatially-extended Markov model\nare affected by changes in its input parameters. By exploiting the inherent\ndynamics of spatially-extended models, an efficient finite difference scheme is\nused to estimate parametric sensitivities robustly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 10:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

Herein, we\ndiscuss a novel phenomenon based on a resonantly-enhanced quantum spin-Hall\ntransport of light observed in a dielectric resonator operating near the\nbound-state-in-continuum (BIC) regime. The BIC mode is characterized by a\ntransverse photonic spin angular momentum density extended on a macroscopic\narea. As such, the experimental excited mode in near-BIC regime generates\nresonant surface waves characterized by spin-momentum locking and that\npropagate along the symmetry axes of the structure. In addition, the generated\nside waves are interpreted as an abrupt nonparaxial redirection of the exciting\nfar field light, which is responsible for the spin-to-orbital angular momentum\nconversion evidenced in the spin-orbit asymmetry measured in the intensity of\nthe side waves. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with a\nmodel that combines geometric parallel transport of light polarization and\nspin-momentum locking. In addition, breaking the excitation symmetry leads to a\ntotal spin-directive coupling.

However, our synthetic population of isolated\nstars host a significant amount of giant planets even at low metallicity, in\ncontradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found around\nhigh metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in\nthe standard pebble accretion framework.

Thus, an\nopen set logo retrieval method is proposed in this work which allows searching\nfor previously unseen logos by a single query sample.

A four-dimensional dynamical stochastic Langevin\nmodel is used to calculate the decay by fission of excited compound nuclei\nproduced in a wide set of heavy-ion collisions. The comparison of the results\nfrom such a calculation and experimental data is discussed, guided by\npredictions of the dynamical deterministic HICOL code for the compound-nucleus\nformation time. While the dependence of the latter on the entrance-channel\nproperties can straigthforwardly explain some observations, a complex interplay\nbetween the various parameters of the reaction can occur in other cases. A\nmulti-dimensional analysis of the respective role of these parameters,\nincluding entrance-channel asymmetry, bombarding energy, compound-nucleus\nfissility, angular momentum and excitation energy, is proposed. It is shown\nthat, depending on the size of the system, apparent unconsistencies may be\ndeduced when projecting onto specific ordering parameters.

Here we introduce\nthe Spectral Approach to TTVs technique that allows expanding the TTVs catalog\ntowards lower TTV amplitude, shorter orbital period, and shallower transit\ndepth. In the Spectral Approach we assume that a sinusoidal TTV exists in the\ndata and then calculate the improvement to $\\chi^2$ this model allows over that\nof linear ephemeris model. This enables detection of TTVs even in cases where\nthe transits are too shallow so individual transits cannot be timed. The\nSpectral Approach is more sensitive due to the reduced number of free\nparameters in its model. Using the Spectral Approach, we: (a) detect 131 new\nperiodic TTVs in Kepler data (an increase of ~2/3 over a previous TTV catalog);\n(b) Constrain the TTV periods of 34 long-period TTVs and reduce amplitude\nerrors of known TTVs; (c) Identify cases of multi-periodic TTVs, for which\nabsolute planetary mass determination may be possible.

The Reynolds number $Re =\nU_b h/\\nu$ is fixed at $20\\,000$ and the rotation number $Ro = 2 \\Omega h/U_b$\nis varied from 0 to 1.2, where $U_b$ is the bulk mean velocity, $h$ the half\nchannel gap width and $\\Omega$ the rotation rate. The scalar value is constant\nbut different at the two walls, leading to steady scalar transport across the\nchannel. The rotation causes an unstable channel side with relatively strong\nturbulence and turbulent scalar transport, and a stable channel side with\nrelatively weak turbulence or laminar-like flow, weak turbulent scalar\ntransport but large scalar fluctuations and steep mean scalar gradients. The\ndistinct turbulent-laminar patterns observed at certain $Ro$ on the stable\nchannel side induce similar patterns in the scalar gradient field. The main\nconclusions of the study are that rotation reduces the similarity between the\nscalar and velocity field and that the Reynolds analogy for scalar-momentum\ntransport does not hold for rotating turbulent channel flow. This is shown by a\nreduced correlation between velocity and scalar fluctuations, and a strongly\nreduced turbulent Prandtl number of less than 0.2 on the unstable channel side\naway from the wall at higher $Ro$. On the unstable channel side, scalar scales\nbecome larger than turbulence scales according to spectra and the turbulent\nscalar flux vector becomes more aligned with the mean scalar gradient owing to\nrotation.

The EDMs of open-shell atomic systems are sensitive\nto the electron EDM and the P,T-odd scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS) semi-leptonic\ninteraction, but the dominant contributions to the EDMs of diamagnetic atoms\ncome from the hadronic and tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) semi-leptonic\ninteractions. Several diamagnetic atoms like $^{129}$Xe, $^{171}$Yb,\n$^{199}$Hg, $^{223}$Rn, and $^{225}$Ra are candidates for the experimental\nsearch for the possible existence of EDMs, and among these $^{199}$Hg has\nyielded the lowest limit till date. The T or CP violating coupling constants of\nthe aforementioned interactions can be extracted from these measurements by\ncombining with atomic and nuclear calculations. In this work, we report the\ncalculations of the EDMs of the above atoms by including both the\nelectromagnetic and P,T-odd violating interactions simultaneously. These\ncalculations are performed by employing relativistic many-body methods based on\nthe random phase approximation (RPA) and the singles and doubles\ncoupled-cluster (CCSD) method starting with the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) wave\nfunction in both cases. The differences in the results from both the methods\nshed light on the importance of the non-core-polarization electron correlation\neffects that are accounted for by the CCSD method. We also determine electric\ndipole polarizabilities of these atoms, which have computational similarities\nwith EDMs and compare them with the available experimental and other\ntheoretical results to assess the accuracy of our calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Lempel-Ziv 77 is one of the most successful and well-known\ntools of this kind, followed by straight-line programs, run-length\nBurrows-Wheeler transform, macro schemes, collage systems, and the compact\ndirected acyclic word graph. In this paper, we show that these techniques are\ndifferent solutions to the same, elegant, combinatorial problem: to find a\nsmall set of positions capturing all text's substrings. We call such a set a\nstring attractor. We first show reductions between dictionary compressors and\nstring attractors. This gives the approximation ratios of dictionary\ncompressors with respect to the smallest string attractor and uncovers new\nrelations between the output sizes of different compressors. We show that the\n$k$-attractor problem: deciding whether a text has a size-$t$ set of positions\ncapturing substrings of length at most $k$, is NP-complete for $k\\geq 3$. We\nprovide several approximation techniques for the smallest $k$-attractor, show\nthat the problem is APX-complete for constant $k$, and give strong\ninapproximability results. To conclude, we provide matching lower and upper\nbounds for the random access problem on string attractors. The upper bound is\nproved by showing a data structure supporting queries in optimal time. Our data\nstructure is universal: by our reductions to string attractors, it supports\nrandom access on any dictionary-compression scheme. In particular, it matches\nthe lower bound also on LZ77, straight-line programs, collage systems, and\nmacro schemes, and therefore closes (at once) the random access problem for all\nthese compressors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2017 14:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 10:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 15:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Previous work in social\nnetwork de-anonymization mostly focuses on designing accurate and efficient\nde-anonymization methods. We study this topic from a different perspective and\nattempt to investigate the intrinsic relation between the attacker's knowledge\nand the expected de-anonymization gain. One common intuition is that the more\nauxiliary information the attacker has, the more accurate de-anonymization\nbecomes. However, their relation is much more sophisticated than that. To\nsimplify the problem, we attempt to quantify background knowledge and\nde-anonymization gain under several assumptions.

Knowing the properties of the\nDM particle would shed light on physics beyond the Standard Model and even\nprovide us with details of the early Universe. In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the\nUniverse after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field\n$\\phi$, in the so-called \"kination\" model. We assume that the $\\phi$ field\ndecays into both radiation and DM particles, which we take to be Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance of WIMPs is then\nfixed during the kination period through either a thermal \"freeze-out\" or\n\"freeze-in\" mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay\nof $\\phi$. We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement\nthat the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget. Requiring\nthat BBN occurs during the standard cosmological scenario sets a limit on the\ntemperature at which the kination period ends.

We extend a\ntheoretical model based on the global interfacial energies for both states to\nstudy the wetting behavior of simple and double reentrant surfaces.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) uses\nlinearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference\ncancellation (SIC) and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some\nusers to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this\npaper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput,\nheterogeneity of Quality-of-Service (QoS), and massive connectivity\nrequirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design\nneeds to depart from SDMA and NOMA. We develop a novel multiple access\nframework, called Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general\nand powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains\nSDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting\nwith SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the\ninterference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference\nand partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two\nextremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise, and\nprovide room for rate and QoS enhancements, and complexity reduction. The three\nmultiple access schemes are compared and extensive numerical results show that\nRSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them\nboth in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and\nuser deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths and\nqualities of Channel State Information at the Transmitter).

We take a modelling-based approach for simulating which\npolicy measures could induce an almost-complete decarbonisation of residential\nheating, the by far largest source of direct emissions in residential\nbuildings. Under which assumptions is it possible, and how long would it take?\nPolicy effectiveness highly depends on behavioural decision- making by\nhouseholds, especially in a context of deep decarbonisation and rapid\ntransformation. We therefore use the non-equilibrium bottom-up model FTT:Heat\nto simulate policies for a transition towards low-carbon heating in a context\nof inertia and bounded rationality, focusing on the uptake of heating\ntechnologies. Results indicate that the near-zero decarbonisation is achievable\nby 2050, but requires substantial policy efforts.

An\nimportant negative aspect in most of NER approaches is the high dependency on\nhand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge, necessary to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. Thus, devising models to deal with such\nlinguistically complex contexts is still challenging. In this paper, we propose\na novel multi-level architecture that does not rely on any specific linguistic\nresource or encoded rule. Unlike traditional approaches, we use features\nextracted from images and text to classify named entities. Experimental tests\nagainst state-of-the-art NER for Twitter on the Ritter dataset present\ncompetitive results (0.59 F-measure), indicating that this approach may lead\ntowards better NER models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

Thanks to the new possibilities\ndue to the IT / wireless revolution, the automotive industry appears to be on\nthe cusp of revolutionary change with potential to dramatically reshape not\njust the competitive landscape but also the way we interact with vehicles, and\nindeed the future design of our roads and cities. Apart from connected personal\nmobility, vehicles are also envisioned to provide Value Added Services (VAS)\nsuch as autonomous driving via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and\nVehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), electric load balancing via Vehicle-to-Grid\n(V2G) solutions, communication solutions using Visible Light Communications\n(VLC) etc. The development and evaluation of vehicular VAS requires a modular\nand scalable multidisciplinary simulation platform. In this paper we propose a\nnovel simulation platform named Cyber-Automotive Simulation \\& Evaluation\nPlatform (CASEP). The purpose of CASEP is to evaluate and visualize the gains\nof various vehicular VAS with special emphasis on commercial vehicle VAS. The\nuse cases are evaluated with respect to the mission-specific performance\nindicators, thereby providing usable metrics for optimization. The\nvisualization platform is being developed using the UNITY 3D engine, thereby\nenabling intuitive interaction as in real physics-based games\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the\nsail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also.\n  We investigate the dynamics of so-called \"photogravimagnetic assists\" of\nsailcraft around $\\alpha$ Centauri A, a potential first destination en route to\nProxima Centauri (the goal of the Breakthrough Starshot program). We find that\na 10m$^2$ sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 $\\mu$C/g or higher will\nneed to take account of magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The\nmagnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and\nallow capture onto closer orbits around a target star.\n  However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change\nresulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic\nfield lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on\nwell-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at\n$\\alpha$ Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the\nfinal destination (Proxima) post-assist.\n  Fortunately for Breakthrough Starshot, nanosails are less prone to charging\nen route than their heavier counterparts, but can still accrue relatively high\ncharge at both the origin and destination, when travelling at low speeds.\nPhotogravimagnetic assists are highly non-trivial, and require careful course\ncorrection to mitigate against unwanted changes in trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 13:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The kinetic energy of the\nparticles of this system is estimated by three methods, and the ratio of the\nkinetic energy to the absolute value of the energy of forces, binding the\nparticles, is determined, which is approximately equal to 0.6 . For simple\nsystems in classical mechanics, this ratio equals 0.5 . The difference between\nthese ratios arises by the consideration of the pressure field and acceleration\nfield inside the bodies, which make additional contribution to the acceleration\nof the particles. It is found that the total time derivative of the system's\nvirial is not equal to zero, as is assumed in classical mechanics for systems\nwith potential fields. This is due to the fact that although the partial time\nderivative of the virial for stationary systems tends to zero, but in real\nbodies the virial also depends on the coordinates and the convective derivative\nof the virial, as part of the total time derivative inside the body, is not\nequal to zero.
