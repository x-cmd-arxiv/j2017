In general, the linear transforms are defined by matrices and\nthe non-linear functions are defined by information channels. These models have\ngained great popularity due to their ability to characterize complex\nprobabilistic relationships arising in a wide variety of inference problems.\nThe contribution of this paper is a new method for analyzing the fundamental\nlimits of statistical inference in settings where the model is known. The\nvalidity of our method can be established in a number of settings and is\nconjectured to hold more generally. A key assumption made throughout is that\nthe matrices are drawn randomly from orthogonally invariant distributions.\n  Our method yields explicit formulas for 1) the mutual information; 2) the\nminimum mean-squared error (MMSE); 3) the existence and locations of certain\nphase-transitions with respect to the problem parameters; and 4) the stationary\npoints for the state evolution of approximate message passing algorithms. When\napplied to the special case of models with multivariate Gaussian channels our\nmethod is rigorous and has close connections to free probability theory for\nrandom matrices. When applied to the general case of non-Gaussian channels, our\nmethod provides a simple alternative to the replica method from statistical\nphysics. A key observation is that the combined effects of the individual\ncomponents in the model (namely the matrices and the channels) are additive\nwhen viewed in a certain transform domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

It has been recently shown that highly-nontrivial currents can be\ngenerated in free-standing samples, notably leading to the generation of even\nharmonics. Since graphene monolayers are centrosymmetric media, for which such\nharmonic generation is deemed inaccessible, this light-driven phenomenon is\nboth startling and promising. More realistically, graphene samples are often\ndeposited on a dielectric substrate, leading to additional intricate\ninteractions. Here, we present a treatment to study this instance by gapping\nthe spectrum and we show this leads to the appearance of a Berry phase in the\ncarrier dynamics. We analyse the role of such a phase in the generated\nnonlinear current and conclude that it suppresses odd-harmonic generation. The\npump energy can be tuned to the energy gap to yield interference among odd\nharmonics mediated by interband transitions, allowing even harmonics to be\ngenerated.

We evaluate these techniques for analyzing customer\nfeedback sentences in four languages, namely English, French, Japanese and\nSpanish. Our empirical analysis shows that our models perform well in all the\nfour languages on the setups of IJCNLP Shared Task on Customer Feedback\nAnalysis. Our model achieved the second rank in French, with an accuracy of\n71.75% and third ranks for all the other languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

We study the formation and water delivery of planets in the habitable\nzone (HZ) around solar-type stars. In particular, we study different dynamical\nenvironments that are defined by the most massive body in the system. Methods.\nFirst of all, a semi-analytical model was used to define the mass of the\nprotoplanetary disks that produce each of the five dynamical scenarios of our\nresearch. Then, we made use of the same semi-analytical model to describe the\nevolution of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase. Finally, we\ncarried out N-body simulations of planetary accretion in order to analyze the\nformation and water delivery of planets in the HZ in the different dynamical\nenvironments. Results. Water worlds are efficiently formed in the HZ in\ndifferent dynamical scenarios. In systems with a giant planet analog to Jupiter\nor Saturn around the snow line, super-Earths tend to migrate into the HZ from\noutside the snow line as a result of interactions with other embryos and\naccrete water only during the gaseous phase. In systems without giant planets,\nEarths and super-Earths with high water by mass contents can either be formed\nin situ in the HZ or migrate into it from outer regions, and water can be\naccreted during the gaseous phase and in collisions with water-rich embryos and\nplanetesimals. Conclusions. The formation of planets in the HZ with very high\nwater by mass contents seems to be a common process around Sun- like stars. Our\nresearch suggests that such planets are still very efficiently produced in\ndifferent dynamical environments.

Systems with topological order turned out to give a natural\nphysical realization of quantum error correcting codes (QECC) in their\ngroundspaces. More recently, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it\nhas been argued that eigenstates of CFTs with a holographic dual should also\nform QECCs. These two examples raise the question of how generally eigenstates\nof many-body models form quantum codes. In this work we establish new\nconnections between quantum chaos and translation-invariance in many-body spin\nsystems, on one hand, and approximate quantum error correcting codes (AQECC),\non the other hand. We first observe that quantum chaotic systems exhibiting the\nEigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) have eigenstates forming approximate\nquantum error-correcting codes. Then we show that AQECC can be obtained\nprobabilistically from translation-invariant energy eigenstates of every\ntranslation-invariant spin chain, including integrable models. Applying this\nresult to 1D classical systems, we describe a method for using local symmetries\nto construct parent Hamiltonians that embed these codes into the low-energy\nsubspace of gapless 1D quantum spin chains. As explicit examples we obtain\nlocal AQECC in the ground space of the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg model and\nthe Motzkin spin chain model with periodic boundary conditions, thereby\nyielding non-stabilizer codes in the ground space and low energy subspace of\nphysically plausible 1D gapless models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 22:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

The latter\nimplies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies\nunwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of\ncooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing\nstrategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as\ncooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show\nthat if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on\nnetwork reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public\ncooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is\nactively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does act\ndetrimental, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are\nrelatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern\nformation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are\nthus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an\nactive layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against\ndefectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is\nsustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via\nthe same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary\noutcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine\nthe stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely\nevolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they\nprovide a rationale for why second-order freeriding is not always an impediment\nto the evolutionary stability of punishment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Numerous\nmethods have been proposed to tackle this problem through mining object\nproposals. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals causes\nambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are\nsensitive to model initialization and often converge to undesirable local\nminimum solutions. In this paper, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by\nprogressive representation adaptation with two main steps: 1) classification\nadaptation and 2) detection adaptation. In classification adaptation, we\ntransfer a pre-trained network to a multi-label classification task for\nrecognizing the presence of a certain object in an image. Through the\nclassification adaptation step, the network learns discriminative\nrepresentations that are specific to object categories of interest. In\ndetection adaptation, we mine class-specific object proposals by exploiting two\nscoring strategies based on the adapted classification network. Class-specific\nproposal mining helps remove substantial noise from the background clutter and\npotential confusion from similar objects. We further refine these proposals\nusing multiple instance learning and segmentation cues. Using these refined\nobject bounding boxes, we fine-tune all the layer of the classification network\nand obtain a fully adapted detection network. We present detailed experimental\nvalidation on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our progressive representation adaptation algorithm performs\nfavorably against the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

We find that the presence of an MBH binary in the remnant makes the\nsystem nearly oblate, aligned with the galaxy merger plane, within a radius\nenclosing 100 MBH masses. We never find binary hosts to be prolate on any\nscale. The decaying MBHs slightly enhance the tangential anisotropy in the\ncentre of the remnant due to angular momentum injection and the slingshot\nejection of stars on nearly radial orbits. This latter effect results in about\n1% of the remnant stars being expelled from the galactic nucleus. Finally, we\ndo not find any strong connection between the remnant morphology and the binary\nhardening rate, which depends only on the inner density slope of the remnant\ngalaxy. Our results suggest that MBH binaries are able to coalesce within a few\nGyr, even if the binary is found to partially erase the merger-induced\ntriaxiality from the remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

We show that the quenching of massive\ncentral galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent\nwith the notion that active supermassive black cause the low specific star\nformation rates observed in massive galaxies.

We construct a dynamically self-consistent, multi-phase\nmodel of the Galaxy with a view to exploring whether the Smith Cloud can be\nunderstood in terms of an infalling, compact HVC that has transited the\nGalactic disc. We show that while a dark-matter (DM) free HVC of sufficient\nmass and density can reach the disc, it does not survive the transit.

In our model, the cloud develops a head-tail\nmorphology within ~10 Myr before and after its first disc crossing; after the\nevent, the tail is left behind and accretes onto the disc within ~400 Myr.

Classically, polarization\nis expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.\nRecently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is\ncaused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the\nwavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short\naxes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been\nshown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL\nTau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL\nTau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870\n$\\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows\na mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.\nThe observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum\npolarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two\ndistinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition\nbetween the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the\ndominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength. In\naddition, if the polarization at 870 $\\mu$m is due to scattering, the lack of\npolarization asymmetry along the minor axis of the inclined disk implies that\nthe large grains responsible for the scattering have already settled into a\ngeometrically thin layer, and the presence of asymmetry along the major axis\nindicates that the HL Tau disk is not completely axisymmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 14:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 20:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Following the\nfrequency estimation approach in which one optimizes the state and sensing time\nof the probes to maximize the sensitivity, we provide a systematic study of the\nattainable precision under the impact of noise originating from independent\nbosonic baths. We invoke an explicit microscopic derivation of the probe\ndynamics using the spin-boson model with weak coupling of arbitrary geometry\nand clarify how the secular approximation leads to a phase-covariant dynamics,\nwhere the noise terms commute with the field Hamiltonian, while the inclusion\nof non-secular terms breaks the phase-covariance. Moreover, unless one\nrestricts to a particular (i.e., Ohmic) spectral density of the bath modes, the\nnoise terms may contain relevant information about the frequency to be\nestimated. Thus, by considering general evolutions of a single probe, we study\nregimes in which these two effects have a non-negligible impact on the\nachievable precision. We then consider baths of Ohmic spectral density yet\nfully accounting for the lack of phase-covariance, in order to characterize the\nultimate attainable scaling of precision when $N$ probes are used in parallel.\nCrucially, we show that beyond the semigroup (Lindbladian) regime the Zeno\nlimit imposing the $1/N^{3/2}$ scaling of the mean squared error, derived\nassuming phase-covariance, generalises to any dynamics of the probes, unless\nthe latter are coupled to the baths in the direction perfectly transversal to\nthe encoding---when a novel scaling of $1/N^{7/4}$ arises.

Understanding the dynamics of the participation in\nQ&A communities is essential to improve the value of crowdsourced knowledge.\n  Objective: In this paper, we investigate how information seekers can increase\nthe chance of eliciting a successful answer to their questions on Stack\nOverflow by focusing on the following actionable factors: affect, presentation\nquality, and time.\n  Method: We develop a conceptual framework of factors potentially influencing\nthe success of questions in Stack Overflow.

In addition to the isolated mode (IM), which usually\npeaks on the outboard mid-plane, the higher order ballooning theory has also\ncaptured other types of less unstable global modes: (a) the weakly asymmetric\nballooning theory (WABT) predicts a mixed mode (MM) that undergoes a small\npoloidal shift away from the outboard mid-plane, (b) a relatively more stable\ngeneral mode (GM) balloons on the top (or bottom) of the tokamak plasma. In\nthis paper, an analytic approach is developed to combine these disconnected\nanalytical limits into a single generalised ballooning theory (GBT). This is\nused to investigate how an IM behaves under the effect of sheared toroidal\nflow. For small values of flow an IM initially converts into a MM where the\nresults of WABT are recaptured, and eventually, as the flow increases, the mode\nasymptotically becomes a GM on the top (or bottom) of the plasma. This may be\nan ingredient in models for understanding why in some experimental scenarios,\ninstead of large edge localised modes (ELMs), small ELMs are observed.

We identify branches of clump solutions of the\naxion-gravity-self-interacting system and study their stability properties. We\nfind that clumps that are (spatially) large are stable, while clumps that are\n(spatially) small are unstable and may collapse. Furthermore, there is a\nmaximum number of particles that can be in a clump. We map out the full space\nof solutions, which includes quasi-stable axitons, and clarify how a recent\nclaim in the literature of a new ultra-dense branch of stable solutions rests\non an invalid use of the non-relativistic approximation. We also consider\nrepulsive self-interactions that may arise from a generic scalar dark matter\ncandidate, finding a single stable branch that extends to arbitrary particle\nnumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 21:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

We give some characterizations of the $V$-modules that can\nbe constructed from such inducings, in particular as regards their singular\nvectors. To illustrate these results, we discuss two examples of $A_1(V)$: when\n$V$ is the vertex operator algebra associated to either the Heisenberg algebra\nor the Virasoro algebra. For these two examples, we show how the structure of\n$A_1(V)$ in relationship to $A_0(V)$ determines what types of indecomposable\n$V$-modules can be induced from a module for the level zero versus level one\nZhu algebras. We construct a family of indecomposable modules for the Virasoro\nvertex operator algebra that are logarithmic modules and are not highest weight\nmodules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 01:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

We\nfocus on a specific structure that consists of layers of Bayesian Networks due\nto the property of capturing inherent and rich dependencies among latent\nvariables. The major difficulty of learning and inference with deep directed\nmodels with many latent variables is the intractable inference due to the\ndependencies among the latent variables and the exponential number of latent\nvariable configurations. Current solutions use variational methods often\nthrough an auxiliary network to approximate the posterior probability\ninference.

Specifically, by exploiting the sparse representation with the\nlatent space, max-max instead of max-sum operation can be used to overcome the\nexponential number of latent configurations. Furthermore, the max-max operation\nand augmented coordinate ascent are applied to both supervised and unsupervised\nlearning as well as to various inference.

With a \"light\" supervised model trained on a small fully annotated\ndataset, we explore semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning on a large\nunannotated dataset and a large weakly annotated dataset, respectively. For the\nunsupervised learning, the light supervised model is applied to the unannotated\ndataset to search for more character training samples, which are further\ncombined with the small annotated dataset to retrain a superior character\ndetection model. For the weakly supervised learning, the character searching is\nguided by high-level annotations of words/text lines that are widely available\nand also much easier to prepare. In addition, we design an unified scene\ncharacter detector by adapting regression based deep networks, which greatly\nrelieves the error accumulation issue that widely exists in most traditional\napproaches. Extensive experiments across different unannotated and weakly\nannotated datasets show that the scene text detection performance can be\nclearly boosted under both scenarios, where the weakly supervised learning can\nachieve the state-of-the-art performance by using only 229 fully annotated\nscene text images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 07:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

Satellite images have been\nwidely utilized for various purposes, such as natural environment monitoring\n(pollution, forest or rivers), transportation improvement and prompt emergency\nresponse to disasters. However, the obscurity caused by clouds makes it\nunstable to monitor the situation on the ground with the visible light camera.\nImages captured by a longer wavelength are introduced to reduce the effects of\nclouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is such an example that improves\nvisibility even the clouds exist. On the other hand, the spatial resolution\ndecreases as the wavelength increases. Furthermore, the images captured by long\nwavelengths differs considerably from those captured by visible light in terms\nof their appearance. Therefore, we propose a network that can remove clouds and\ngenerate visible light images from the multispectral images taken as inputs.\nThis is achieved by extending the input channels of cGANs to be compatible with\nmultispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close\nto the ground truth using the images synthesized with clouds over the ground\ntruth as inputs.

Still, ANNs lack a natural\nnotion of time, and neural units in ANNs exchange analog values in a\nframe-based manner, a computationally and energetically inefficient form of\ncommunication. This contrasts sharply with biological neurons that communicate\nsparingly and efficiently using binary spikes. While artificial Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN with\nspiking neurons, the current performance is far from that of deep ANNs on hard\nbenchmarks and these SNNs use much higher firing rates compared to their\nbiological counterparts, limiting their efficiency. Here we show how spiking\nneurons that employ an efficient form of neural coding can be used to construct\nSNNs that match high-performance ANNs and exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on\nimportant benchmarks, while requiring much lower average firing rates. For\nthis, we use spike-time coding based on the firing rate limiting adaptation\nphenomenon observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can be\ncaptured in adapting spiking neuron models, for which we derive the effective\ntransfer function. Neural units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can\nbe substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the resulting\nAdaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out inference in deep neural networks using up\nto an order of magnitude fewer spikes compared to previous SNNs. Adaptive\nspike-time coding additionally allows for the dynamic control of neural coding\nprecision: we show how a simple model of arousal in AdSNNs further halves the\naverage required firing rate and this notion naturally extends to other forms\nof attention. AdSNNs thus hold promise as a novel and efficient model for\nneural computation that naturally fits to temporally continuous and\nasynchronous applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 08:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

In this context, scarce\nspectrum resources must accommodate a high traffic volume with stringent\nrequirements of low latency, high reliability and energy efficiency.\nConventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these\nrequirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel\ndesign of a robust dynamic edge network architecture (RDNA) for IoT which\nleverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act\nas access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest\nunused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may\ncompromise the availability of terminal access points and channels and, thus,\nnetwork connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at physical,\naccess, networking, application, and business layers to improve network\nrobustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close\nconnectivity which reduces interference and latency, and thus, increases\nreliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of\nmobile devices project smartness onto the edge which is desirable for\nautonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to\nillustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture\nin the context of IoT are outlined.

In the presence of light atoms in\nadsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQE) influence properties of these\nsystems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQE on the dissociation of\nwater wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we\nnote that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures\nare accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether\nharmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the\nrelative stability of the different states. We perform ab initio path integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into\naccount conformational entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We\npropose that when when adsorption is weak and NQE on the substrate are\nnegligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the\nsystem, resulting in considerable computational savings. We calculate the\ncontribution of NQE to the free energies, including anharmonic terms. We find\nthat they result in an increase of up to 20% of the quantum contribution to the\ndissociation free energy compared to harmonic estimates. We also find that the\ndissociation has a negligible contribution from tunneling, but is dominated by\nZPE, which can enhance the rate by three orders of magnitude.

With the recent\ndevelopment of specialized machine learning hardware for mobile devices, a new\nera of distributed learning is about to begin that raises a new research\nquestion: How can we search in distributed machine learning models? Machine\nlearning at the edge of the network has many benefits, such as low-latency\ninference and increased privacy. Such distributed machine learning models can\nalso learn personalized for a human user, a specific context, or application\nscenario. As training data stays on the devices, control over possibly\nsensitive data is preserved as it is not shared with a third party. This new\nform of distributed learning leads to the partitioning of knowledge between\nmany devices which makes access difficult. In this paper we tackle the problem\nof finding specific knowledge by forwarding a search request (query) to a\ndevice that can answer it best. To that end, we use a entropy based quality\nmetric that takes the context of a query and the learning quality of a device\ninto account. We show that our forwarding strategy can achieve over 95%\naccuracy in a urban mobility scenario where we use data from 30 000 people\ncommuting in the city of Trento, Italy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 12:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

When folding in\nthe photometric information we avoid using prior astrophysical knowledge.\nAdditionally, the method allows for the possibility of no counterparts to\nsources as well as the possibility that sources overlap multiple potential\ncounterparts.

These two systems\n(macroscopic and microscopic) are coupled via the source terms in Maxwell's\nequations, which are sums of velocity-space 'moment' integrals of the particle\ndistribution function. This paper considers 'the inverse problem for\ncollisionless equilibria' (IPCE), viz. \"given information regarding the\nreal-space/macroscopic configuration of a specific collisionless plasma\nequilibrium, what self-consistent equilibrium distributions exist?\" We develop\nthe constants of motion approach to IPCE using the assumptions of a 'modified\nMaxwellian' distribution function, and a strictly neutral and spatially\none-dimensional plasma. In such circumstances, IPCE formally reduces to the\ninversion of Weierstrass transformations (Bilodeau, 1962), such as those\ntransformations that feature in the initial value problem for the\nheat/diffusion equation. We discuss the various mathematical conditions that a\ncandidate solution of IPCE must satisfy. One method that can be used to invert\nthe Weierstrass transform is expansions in Hermite polynomials. Building on the\nresults of Allanson et al. (2016), we establish under what circumstances a\nsolution obtained by these means converges, and allows velocity moments of all\norders. Ever since the seminal work by Bernstein et al. (1957), on 'stationary'\nelectrostatic plasma waves, the necessary quality of non-negativity has been\nnoted as a feature that any candidate solution of IPCE will not $\\textit{a\npriori}$ satisfy.

Recent fracture\nepisodes [9] of zirconia hip joint heads were reported, failures related to the\nt-m transformation degradation.

The resolution provided by AFM at the surface of the samples made it\npossible to observe the formation of self accommodated martensite pairs in the\nnear crack areas. The potential for transformation is found to decrease with\nincreasing alloying addition, and is totally suppressed for 16 mol.% CeO2-TZP\nsamples. A statistical analysis of the martensite pair orientation is\nperformed, and the relationship with the applied stress and strain fields is\ndiscussed.

The majority of these\nmodels assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its\nown private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external\nnoise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is\nlimited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large\nnetworks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting\nshared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of\nstochastic network models. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by\nusing deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of uncorrelated noise,\nexploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback. Consequently, even\na single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can serve as a natural\nnoise source for large ensembles of functional networks, each comprising\nthousands of units. We successfully apply the proposed framework to a diverse\nset of binary-unit networks with different dimensionalities and entropies, as\nwell as to a network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined\nfrequencies.

The sample\nhas 22 objects and 100 observations. We use two thermal comptonization\ncomponents to fit the broad-band spectra, one for the warm corona emission and\none for the high-energy continuum. In the optical-UV, we also include the\nreddening, the small blue bump and the Galactic extinction. In the X-rays, we\ninclude a WA and a neutral reflection. The model gives a good fit (reduced\n$\\chi^2 <1.5$) to more than 90% of the sample.

In the absence of strong artefacts the method\nreturns images that differ from the ideal ones by <2% in any pixel. The method\ngives consistent values for both plage and network areas.

Results: We\nconfirm the, previously noted, presence of the low energy (<6 keV) spectral\nrollover and argue that it could be interpreted as thermal emission. The\nspectra are well described by a double thermal model consisting of a \"hot\" (>1\nkeV) and a \"cool\" (<0.7 keV) multicolor black body (MCB). Under the assumption\nthat the \"cool\" MCD emission originates in a disk truncated at the NS\nmagnetosphere, we find that all ULXs in our sample are consistent with\naccretion onto a highly magnetized (B>10^12G) NS. We note a strong correlation\nbetween the strength of the magnetic field, the temperature of the \"hot\"\nthermal component and the total unabsorbed luminosity. Examination of the\nNuSTAR data supported this interpretation and confirmed the presence of a weak,\nhigh energy (>15 keV) tail, most likely the result of modification of the MCB\nemission by inverse Compton scattering. We also note that the apparent high\nenergy tail, may simply be the result of mis-modeling of MCB emission with an\natypical temperature (T) vs radius (r) gradient, using a standard MCD model\nwith a fixed gradient of T~r^-0.75.

This kind of merger could result in the formation of a hyper-massive\nstrangeon star, accompanied by bursts of gravitational waves and\nelectromagnetic radiation (and even strangeon kilonova explained in the paper).\nThe tidal polarizability of binary strangeon stars is different from that of\nbinary neutron stars, because a strangeon star is self-bound on surface by\nfundamental strong force while a neutron star by the gravity, and their\nequations of state are different. Our calculation shows that the tidal\npolarizability of merging binary strangeon stars is favored by GW170817. Three\nkinds of kilonovae (i.e., of neutron, quark and strangeon) are discussed, and\nthe light curve of the kilonova AT 2017gfo following GW170817 could be\nexplained by considering the decaying strangeon nuggets and remnant star\nspin-down.

In this paper, we advance the research by presenting some verifiable\nconditions for the required equi-continuity, namely some growth conditions of\nthe expected utility functions of each player at equilibria.

The\nMRA framework is formulated out of a displacement subspace sequence whose basis\nfunctions are built out of scaling and shifting on the element domain of basic\nfull node shape function. The basic full node shape function is constructed by\nmeans of extending the shape function triangle domain for a split node at the\nzero coordinates to the hexagon area enclosing the zero coordinates. As a\nresult, a new split-full node notion is presented and a novel rational MRA\nconcept together with the resolution level (RL) is constituted for the element.\nVia practical examples, it is found that the traditional triangular plate\nelement and method is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the\nproposed element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element\nmodel is based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution\nis laid on the rigorous mathematical basis. The analysis clarity of a plate\nstructure is actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. Thus, the accuracy\nof a structural analysis is replaced by the clarity, the irrational MRA by the\nrational and the mesh model by the RL that is the discretized model by the\nintegrated. The continuous full node shape function unveils secrets behind\nassembling artificially of node-related items in global matrix formation by the\nconventional FEM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 14:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 11:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 04:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 12:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 12:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}
