The matter content of the Universe is assumed to\nconsist of the inflationary scalar field, which, through its decay, generates\nrelativistic matter, and pressureless dark matter, respectively. At the early\nstages of reheating the inflationary scalar field transfers its energy to the\nnewly created matter particles, with the field energy decreasing to near zero.\nThe general equations governing the irreversible matter creation during\nreheating are obtained by combining the thermodynamics description of the\nmatter creation and the gravitational field equations. A dimensionless form of\nthe general system of the reheating equations is also introduced. The role of\nthe different inflationary scalar field potentials is analyzed by using\nanalytical and numerical methods, and the evolution of the matter and scalar\nfield densities, as well as of the cosmological parameters during reheating,\nare obtained. Typically, the values of the energy densities of relativistic\nmatter and dark matter reach their maximum when the Universe is reheated up to\nthe reheating temperature, which is determined for each case, as a function of\nthe scalar field decay width, the scalar field particle mass, and of the\ncosmological parameters. An interesting result is that particle production\nleads to the acceleration of the Universe during the reheating phase, with the\ndeceleration parameter showing a complex dynamics. Once the energy density of\nthe scalar field becomes negligible with respect to the matter densities, the\nexpansion of the Universe decelerates, and inflation has a graceful exit after\nreheating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 18:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

For any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\ast}$, let\n$K_{N}=\\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\\xi_{N})$ where $\\xi_{N}\\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is\na primitive $N$-th root of unity, and $X_{K_{N},N} = \\mathbb{P}^{1} -\n(\\{0,\\infty\\} \\cup \\mu_{N})\\text{ }/\\text{ }K_{N}$. For $N$ prime to $p$, we\nare used to view the Frobenius of $\\pi_{1}^{\\un,\\crys}(X_{k_{N},N})$ as a\nstructure on $\\pi_{1}^{\\un,\\DR}(X_{K_{N},N})$. In V-1, we show that the\nFrobenius of $\\pi_{1}^{\\un,\\DR}(X_{K_{N},N})$, iterated $\\alpha \\in\n\\mathbb{N}^{\\ast}$ times, can be extended canonically as a structure of\n$\\pi_{1}^{\\un,\\DR}(X_{K_{p^{\\alpha}N},p^{\\alpha}N})$. This allows to define\ngeneralizations of adjoint $p$-adic multiple zeta values associated with roots\nof unity of order $p^{\\alpha}N$, and several related objects. This also gives a\ncanonical framework to relate to each other the direct method of computation of\nthe Frobenius of I-1 and the indirect methods of computation of the Frobenius\nof I-2 and I-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 18:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

We\nconducted compression experiments and investigated the relationship between the\nporosity and the compression using fluffy granular samples. We focused on a\nlow-pressure and high-porosity regime. We used tens of {\\mu}m-sized irregular\nand spherical powders as analogs of porous regolith. The initial porosity of\nthe samples ranged from 0.80 to 0.53. The uniaxial pressure applied to the\nsamples lays in the range from 30 to 4x10^5 Pa. The porosity of the samples\nremained at their initial values below a threshold pressure and then decreased\nwhen the pressure exceeded the threshold. We defined this uniaxial pressure at\nthe threshold as \"yield strength\". The yield strength increased as the initial\nporosity of a sample decreased. The yield strengths of samples consisting of\nirregular particles did not significantly depend on their size distributions\nwhen the samples had the same initial porosity.

In a typical bike sharing\nsystem, riders arrive at a station and take a bike if it is available. After\nretrieving a bike, they ride it for a while, then return it to a station near\ntheir final destinations. Since space is limited in cities, each station has a\nfinite capacity of docks, which cannot hold more bikes than its capacity. In\nthis paper, we study bike sharing systems with stations having a finite\ncapacity. By an appropriate scaling of our stochastic model, we prove a central\nlimit theorem for an empirical process of the number of stations with $k$\nbikes. The central limit theorem provides insight on the variance, and sample\npath dynamics of large scale bike sharing systems. We also leverage our results\nto estimate confidence intervals for various performance measures such as the\nproportion of empty stations, the proportion of full stations, and the number\nof bikes in circulation.

A critical review\nof most previous works in this area has been presented in [2], and few more are\nconsidered here just to set the stage. The main work can be described as this;\ngiven a set of measurements from sensors that represent a normal situation, [1]\nproceeds by first estimating the probability density function (pdf) of the set\nusing a data-split approach, then estimate the entropy of the set using the\narithmetic mean as an approximation for the expectation. The increase in\nentropy that occurs when strange data is recorded is used to detect unusual\nmeasurements in the test set depending on the desired confidence interval or\nfalse alarm rate. The results presented in [1] have been confirmed for\ndifferent test signals such as the Gaussian, Beta, in one dimension and beta in\ntwo dimensions, and a beta and uniform mixture distribution in two dimensions.\nFinally, the method was confirmed on real data and the results are presented.\nThe major drawbacks of [1] were identified, and a method that seeks to mitigate\nthis using the Bhattacharyya distance is presented. This method detects more\nsubtle anomalies, especially the type that would pass as normal in [1].\nFinally, recommendations for future research are presented: the subject of\ninterpretability, especially for subtle measurements, being the most elusive as\nof today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 05:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

An error of approximating the unitary by a\nfinite-depth local circuit is obtained. We connect the defined family of\nunitaries to other results about many-body localization (Kim et al, 2014), in\nparticular Lieb-Robinson bound. Finally we argue that any Hamiltonian can be\ndiagonalized by such a unitary, given it has a slow enough logarithmic\nlightcone in its Lieb-Robinson bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 08:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Accurate modeling of the spatiotemporally varying\ntraffic speed thus plays a crucial role in urban planning and development. This\npaper addresses the problem of efficient fine-grained traffic speed prediction\nusing big traffic data obtained from static sensors. Gaussian processes (GPs)\nhave been previously used to model various traffic phenomena, including flow\nand speed. However, GPs do not scale with big traffic data due to their cubic\ntime complexity. In this work, we address their efficiency issues by proposing\nlocal GPs to learn from and make predictions for correlated subsets of data.\nThe main idea is to quickly group speed variables in both spatial and temporal\ndimensions into a finite number of clusters, so that future and unobserved\ntraffic speed queries can be heuristically mapped to one of such clusters. A\nlocal GP corresponding to that cluster can then be trained on the fly to make\npredictions in real-time. We call this method localization. We use non-negative\nmatrix factorization for localization and propose simple heuristics for cluster\nmapping. We additionally leverage on the expressiveness of GP kernel functions\nto model road network topology and incorporate side information.

Improved\nunderstanding of urban thermodynamics incorporating the interaction of the\nvarious bodies will have implications on energy conservation at the building\nscale, as well as human health and comfort at the urban scale. The platform\npresented is based on longwave hyperspectral imaging of nearly 100 blocks of\nManhattan, and a geospatial radiosity model that describes the collective\nradiative heat exchange between multiple buildings. The close comparison of\ntemperature values derived from measurements and the computed surface\ntemperatures (including streets and roads) implies that this geospatial,\nthermodynamic numerical model applied to urban structures, is promising for\naccurate and high resolution analysis of urban surface temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 13:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Various scenarios for dimerization span interaction of unstructured\nmonomers that form alpha helices in the process of dimerization to preformed\nalpha helical monomers dimerizing.Another suggested possibility, a trigger\nsequence hypothesis (M. O. Steinmetz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.\n2007, 104, 7062-7067), is that a C terminal (CT) part of each monomer is a\ntrigger sequence that is dimerized and, subsequently, the remainder N terminal\n(NT) part of each monomer (that is partially ordered) zips together to form the\ncoiled coil. In this work, methods are developed to computationally explore the\ntrigger sequence hypothesis based on an extension of a previously introduced\n(R. I. Cukier, J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 134, 045104) Hamiltonian Temperature\nReplica Exchange Method Mean Square (HTREM_MS) procedure, which scales the\nHamiltonian in both potential and kinetic energies, to enhance sampling\ngenerically, along with additional restraints to enhance sampling in desired\nregions of conformational space. The method is applied to a 31-residue\ntruncation of the 33-residue leucine zipper (GCN4-p1) of the yeast\ntranscriptional activator GCN4. Using a variety of HTREM_MS simulations, we\nfind that the NT of one monomer of the dimer becomes disordered when the NT\nparts of the monomers are separated. In contrast, when the CT parts of the\nmonomers are separated, both monomers remain alpha helical. These simulations\nsuggest that the CT does act as a trigger sequence and are consistent with a\ndisordered NT. We also investigate whether the disordered NT can be induced to\nre-form the dimerized leucine zipper. It does, but with some lack of recovery\nof alpha helical hydrogen bonding structure in the NT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 15:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}
