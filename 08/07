Both models have been invoked to interpret the photoluminescence\ndetected magnetic resonance (PLDMR) in $\\pi$-conjugated materials. We show that\nresonance lineshapes calculated within the two models differ dramatically in\nseveral regards. First, in the PPR model, the lineshape exhibits unusual\nbehavior upon increasing the microwave power: it evolves from fully positive at\nweak power to fully negative at strong power. In contrast, in the TPQ model,\nthe PLDMR is completely positive, showing a monotonic saturation. Second, the\ntwo models predict different dependencies of the resonance signal on the\nphotoexcitation power, $P_L$. At low $P_L$, the resonance amplitude $\\Delta\nI/I$ is $\\propto P_L$ in the PPR model, while it is $\\propto P_L^2$ crossing\nover to $P_L^3$ in the TPQ model. On the physical level, the differences stem\nfrom different underlying spin dynamics. Most prominently, a negative resonance\nwithin the PPR model has its origin in the microwave-induced spin-Dicke effect,\nleading to the resonant quenching of photoluminescence. The spin-Dicke effect\nresults from the spin-selective recombination, resulting in a highly correlated\nprecession of the on-resonance pair-partners under the strong microwave power.\nThis effect is not relevant to TPQ, where the majority of triplets are\noff-resonance due to the strong zero-field splitting. The analytical evaluation\nof lineshapes for the two models is enabled by expressing these shapes via the\neigenvalues of a complex Hamiltonian. This bypasses the necessity of solving\nthe much larger complex system of stochastic Liouville equations.

This task can be\nachieved by introducing social norms compliance mechanism in the autonomous\nvehicles. This research paper is proposing an artificial society of autonomous\nvehicles as an analogy of human social society. Each AV has been assigned a\nsocial personality having different social influence. Social norms have been\nintroduced which help the AVs in making the decisions, influenced by emotions,\nregarding road collision avoidance. Furthermore, social norms compliance\nmechanism, by artificial social AVs, has been proposed using prospect based\nemotion i.e. fear, which is conceived from OCC model. Fuzzy logic has been\nemployed to compute the emotions quantitatively. Then, using SimConnect\napproach, fuzzy values of fear has been provided to the Netlogo simulation\nenvironment to simulate artificial society of AVs. Extensive testing has been\nperformed using the behavior space tool to find out the performance of the\nproposed approach in terms of the number of collisions.

In the existing research, many rear end collision\navoidance solutions have been proposed.

This is a knot\ninvariant in the sense that if a diagram of the knot under study admits such a\ncoloring, then so does any other diagram of the same knot. This is called\np-colorability. It is also associated to systems of linear homogeneous\nequations over the residues mod p, by regarding the arcs of the diagram as\nvariables and assigning the equation \"twice the over-arc minus the sum of the\nunder-arcs equals zero\" to each crossing. The knot invariant is here the\nexistence or non-existence of non-trivial solutions of these systems of\nequations, when working over the integers modulo p (a non-trivial solution is\nsuch that not all variables take up the same value). Another knot invariant is\nthe minimum number of distinct colors (values) these non-trivial solutions\nrequire, should they exist. This corresponds to finding a basis, supported by a\ndiagram, in which these solutions take up the least number of distinct values.\nThe actual minimum is hard to calculate, in general.

In this work, we propose a method\nto translate phrases in NMT by integrating a phrase memory storing target\nphrases from a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system into\nthe encoder-decoder architecture of NMT. At each decoding step, the phrase\nmemory is first re-written by the SMT model, which dynamically generates\nrelevant target phrases with contextual information provided by the NMT model.\nThen the proposed model reads the phrase memory to make probability estimations\nfor all phrases in the phrase memory. If phrase generation is carried on, the\nNMT decoder selects an appropriate phrase from the memory to perform phrase\ntranslation and updates its decoding state by consuming the words in the\nselected phrase. Otherwise, the NMT decoder generates a word from the\nvocabulary as the general NMT decoder does. Experiment results on the Chinese\nto English translation show that the proposed model achieves significant\nimprovements over the baseline on various test sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 03:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Since its discovery in 2013, it\nhas experienced two outbursts, the second of which started in November 2014 and\nlasted until February 2017. We use high- and low-resolution spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved photometry from the ASAS-SN survey, the LCOGT and the Beacon\nObservatory to study the lightcurve and the dynamical and physical properties\nof the accretion flow. The 2014-2017 outburst lasted for nearly 800 days. A\n4.15d period in the lightcurve likely corresponds to rotational modulation of a\nstar with hot spot(s). The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable\ninverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the\ncontinuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)\nsuggest temperatures of $\\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.\nPhotometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an\nintermediate behavior between EXors and FUors. The accretion rate\n(\\.{M}=1-3$\\times$10$^{-7}$M$_\\odot$/yr), about 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the accretion rate in quiescence, is not significantly different from the\naccretion rate observed in 2013. The absorption features in the spectra suggest\nthat the system is viewed at a high angle and drives a powerful,\nnon-axisymmetric wind, maybe related to magnetic reconnection. The properties\nof ASASSN-13db suggest that temperatures lower than those for solar-type stars\nare needed for modeling accretion in very low-mass systems. Finally, the\nrotational modulation during the outburst reveals that accretion-related\nstructures settled after the begining of the outburst and can be relatively\nstable and long-lived.

Due to the\nvarying reliability of sources, it is common to see conflicts among the\nmulti-source data, making it difficult to determine which data sources to\ntrust. Recently, truth discovery has emerged as a means of addressing this\nchallenging issue by determining data veracity jointly with estimating the\nreliability of data sources. A fundamental issue with current truth discovery\nmethods is that they generally assume only one true value for each object,\nwhile in reality, objects may have multiple true values. In this paper, we\npropose a graph-based approach, called SmartMTD, to unravel the truth discovery\nproblem beyond the single-truth assumption, or the multi-truth discovery\nproblem. SmartMTD models and quantifies two types of source relations to\nestimate source reliability precisely and to detect malicious agreement among\nsources for effective multi-truth discovery. In particular, two graphs are\nconstructed based on the modeled source relations. They are further used to\nderive the two aspects of source reliability (i.e., positive precision and\nnegative precision) via random walk computation. Empirical studies on two large\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 07:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

To select the right truth discovery method for a specific\napplication scenario, it becomes essential to evaluate and compare the\nperformance of different methods. A drawback of current research efforts is\nthat they commonly assume the availability of certain ground truth for the\nevaluation of methods. However, the ground truth may be very limited or even\nout-of-reach in practice, rendering the evaluation biased by the small ground\ntruth or even unfeasible.

Examples include hyperbolic\nequations in networks of gas tubes, water channels and vessel networks for\nblood and lymph in the human circulatory system. A key point in designing\nnumerical methods for such applications is the treatment of junctions, i.e.\npoints at which two or more 1D domains converge and where the flow exhibits\nmultidimensional behaviour. This paper focuses on the design of methods for\nnetworks of water channels. Our methods adopt the finite volume approach to\nmake full use of the two-dimensional shallow water equations on the true\nphysical domain, locally at junctions, while solving the usual one-dimensional\nshallow water equations away from the junctions. In addition to mass\nconservation, our methods enforce conservation of momentum at junctions; the\nlatter seems to be the missing element in methods currently available.

Its conceptual value as a realistic\ntheoretical model of the ocean heat balance has become increasingly unclear\nover the years however, because: 1) the different ways in which upwelling has\nbeen linked to high-latitude deep water formation and downgradient diffusion\nlinked to vertical/diapycnal mixing have remained imprecise and somewhat ad-hoc\nso far; 2) other effects such as isopycnal mixing, density-compensated\ntemperature anomalies, meso-scale eddy-induced advection and the depth-varying\nocean area have all be demonstrated to affect actual ocean heat uptake as well,\nbut their incorporation into existing VUDM frameworks has been problematic. In\nthis paper, a new process-based vertical advection/diffusion theoretical model\nof ocean heat uptake is constructed that resolve all above difficulties.

The Ratio of\nTransmission of Motion (RoToM) is proposed as a novel indicator of what part of\nthe applied force generates motion, and what part is dissipated by the passive\nforces due to mechanical constraints. It depends on the configuration of the\nrobot and on the direction of the force, and is always between 0 and 1.\nExtending this concept, a transmissibility ellipsoid is used to describe the\nbehavior of the robot given a certain configuration, and varying the direction\nof the applied force. Another physical measure that is related to the\ntransmissibility ellipsoid is the transmissibility index: it provides an\nindication on how similarly the system behaves when subject to forces coming\nfrom different directions. The presented analysis aims to provide a deeper\ninsight on the centroidal dynamics of a robot, and on its dependence on the\nconfiguration. It can be beneficial for developing whole-body controllers of\nredundant robots for e.g., reducing the effort in terms of joint torques to\ncompensate for gravity, and more in general for designing interaction control\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 12:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

We discuss\nwhich are the minimal modifications of the spectrum that are required by the\nexisting observations and we obtain a universal cosmic neutrino spectrum, i.e.\nvalid for all neutrino flavors. Our approach to such task can be outlined in\nthree points: 1) we rely on the throughgoing muon analysis above 200 TeV and on\nthe high-energy starting events (HESE) analysis below this energy, requiring\nthe continuity of the spectrum; 2) we assume that cosmic neutrinos are subject\nto three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum; 3) we make no assumption on\nthe astrophysical mechanism of production, except for no tau neutrino component\nat the source. We test our model using the information provided by HESE\nshower-like events and by the lack of double pulses and resonant events. We\nfind that a two power-law spectrum is compatible with all observations.

These excessive energy losses may be explained by the\nexistence of a new sub-keV mass pseudoscalar Nambu--Goldstone boson with tiny\ncouplings to photons, electrons, and nucleons. An attractive possibility is to\nidentify this particle with the axion -- the hypothetical pseudo\nNambu--Goldstone boson predicted by the Peccei--Quinn solution to the strong CP\nproblem. We explore this possibility in terms of a DFSZ-type axion and of a\nKSVZ-type axion/majoron, respectively. Both models allow a good global fit to\nthe data, prefering an axion mass around 10 meV. We show that future axion\nexperiments -- the fifth force experiment ARIADNE and the helioscope IAXO --\ncan attack the preferred mass range from the lower and higher end,\nrespectively. An axion in this mass range can also be the main constituent of\ndark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 13:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

We use the empirical values of some nuclear macroscopic quantities\nto construct model parameter sets by Monte Carlo method for the conventional\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model, the extended Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (eSHF) model,\nthe Gogny-Hartree-Fock (GHF) model, and the momentum-dependent interaction\n(MDI) model. The value of $E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho_0)$ is estimated to be\n$1.02\\pm0.49$ MeV for the SHF model, $1.02\\pm0.50$ MeV for the eSHF model,\n$0.70\\pm0.60$ MeV for the GHF model, and $0.74\\pm0.63$ MeV for the MDI model.\nMoreover, our results indicate that the density dependence of\n$E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho)$ is model dependent, especially at higher densities.\nFurthermore, we find that the $E_{\\text{sym},4}(\\rho_0)$ has strong positive\n(negative) correlation with isoscalar (isovector) nucleon effective mass\n$m_{s,0}^*$ ($m_{v,0}^*$) at $\\rho_0$.

Natural\ndisasters are an important application scenario for DTNs when the cellular\nnetwork is destroyed by natural forces. To assess the performance of such\nnetworks before deployment, we require appropriate knowledge of human mobility.\n  In this paper, we address this problem by designing, implementing, and\nevaluating a novel mobility model for large-scale natural disasters.

Conformal fields arise by the approximation of\nfingerprint OFs given by zero pole models, which are determined by the singular\npoints and a rotation. This approximation is very coarse, e.g. for fingerprints\nwith no singular points (arch type), the zero-pole model's OF has parallel\nlines. Quadratic differential (QD) models, which are obtained from zero-pole\nmodels by adding suitable singularities outside the observation window,\napproximate real fingerprints much better. For example, for arch type\nfingerprints, parallel lines along the distal joint change slowly into circular\nlines around the nail furrow. Still, QD models are not fully realistic because,\nfor example along the central axis of arch type fingerprints, ridge line\ncurvatures usually first increase and then decrease again. It is impossible to\nmodel this with QDs, which, due to complex analyticity, also produce conformal\nfields only. In fact, as one of many applications of the new descriptor, we\nshow, using histograms of curvature and conformality index (log of the absolute\nvalue of the M\\\"obius modulus), that local deviation from conformality in\nfingerprints occurs systematically at high curvature which is not reflected by\nstate of the art fingerprint models as are used, for instance, in the well\nknown synthetic fingerprint generation tool SFinGe and these differences\nrobustely discriminate real prints from SFinGe's synthetic prints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 15:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Following the increasing trend in\nelectricity generation from renewable sources, pushed by the need to meet\nsustainable energy goals in many countries, more sophisticated control\nstrategies are being adopted to regulate the operation of the electric power\nsystem, driving electrical infrastructures towards the so called Smart Grid\nscenario. It is therefore paramount to be assisted by technologies able to\nanalyze the Smart Grid behavior in critical scenarios, e.g. where cyber\nmalfunctions or grid disruptions occur. In this context, stochastic model-based\nanalysis are well suited to assess dependability and quality of service related\nindicators, and continuous improvements in modeling strategies and system\nmodels design are required. Thus, my PhD work addresses this topic by\ncontributing to study new Smart Grid scenarios, concerning the advanced\ninterplay between ICT and electrical infrastructures in presence of cyber\nfaults/attacks, define a new modeling approach, based on modularity and\ncomposition, and start to study how to improve the electrical grid dynamics\nrepresentation.

Midpoint convexity is a well-known\ncharacterization of ordinary convexity under very mild assumptions. For a\nfunction defined on the integer lattice, we consider the analogous notion of\ndiscrete midpoint convexity, a discrete version of midpoint convexity where the\nvalue of the function at the (possibly noninteger) midpoint is replaced by the\naverage of the function values at the integer round-up and round-down of the\nmidpoint. It is known that discrete midpoint convexity on all line segments\nwith integer endpoints characterizes L$^{\\natural}$-convexity, and that it\ncharacterizes submodularity if we restrict the endpoints of the line segments\nto be at $\\ell_\\infty$-distance one. By considering discrete midpoint convexity\nfor all pairs at $\\ell_\\infty$-distance equal to two or not smaller than two,\nwe identify new classes of discrete convex functions, called local and global\ndiscrete midpoint convex functions, which are strictly between the classes of\nL$^{\\natural}$-convex and integrally convex functions, and are shown to be\nstable under scaling and addition. Furthermore, a proximity theorem, with the\nsame small proximity bound as that for L$^{\\natural}$-convex functions, is\nestablished for discrete midpoint convex functions. Relevant examples of\nclasses of local and global discrete midpoint convex functions are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 06:50:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 08:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 06:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 03:19:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 04:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

However, if the same force is\napplied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod,\nthereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rod\nabout its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of mass\nitself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but imparting\nnevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of the\nrod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed and\nsuperimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speed\nabout the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say by\nstrapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin faster\nand faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearly\nwith time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external\n(inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of the\nrod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixed\ndirection. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of the\ncentre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reaching\na final constant value with time.
