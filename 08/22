We show that our general Vecchia approach\ncontains many popular existing GP approximations as special cases, allowing for\ncomparisons among the different methods within a unified framework.\nRepresenting the models by directed acyclic graphs, we determine the sparsity\nof the matrices necessary for inference, which leads to new insights regarding\nthe computational properties. Based on these results, we propose a novel sparse\ngeneral Vecchia approximation, which ensures computational feasibility for\nlarge spatial datasets but can lead to considerable improvements in\napproximation accuracy over Vecchia's original approach.

Since their deployment, different fiber technologies have been used\nto deal with optical fiber impairments such as dispersion-shifted fibers and\ndispersion-compensation fibers. In recent years, thanks to the introduction of\ncoherent detection based systems, fiber impairments can be mitigated using\ndigital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. Coherent systems are used in the\ncurrent 100 Gbps wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) standard technology.\nThey allow the increase of spectral efficiency by using multi-level modulation\nformats, and are combined with DSP techniques to combat the linear fiber\ndistortions. In addition to linear impairments, the next generation 400 Gbps/1\nTbps WDM systems are also more affected by the fiber nonlinearity due to the\nKerr effect.

Thereby obtained a quasi-determinant expression of the quantum\nYang-Baxter map associated with the quantum algebra $U_{q}(gl(n))$. Moreover,\nthe map is identified with products of quasi-Pl\\\"{u}cker coordinates over a\nmatrix composed of the L-operators. We also consider the quasi-classical limit,\nwhere the underlying quantum algebra reduces to a Poisson algebra. The\nquasi-determinant expression of the quantum Yang-Baxter map reduces to ratios\nof determinants, which give a new expression of a classical Yang-Baxter map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 16:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

This is because the Larmor frequency for all\nspins is identically zero at zero field, making it challenging to individually\naddress different spin species. We realize a composite-pulse technique for\narbitrary independent rotations of $^1$H and $^{13}$C spins in a two-spin\nsystem. Quantum-information-inspired randomized benchmarking and state\ntomography are used to evaluate the quality of the control.

Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for\nstudying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these\nproblems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond\npulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating\naccretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while\nforce-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting\ngas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,\nhighly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic\nsimulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric\ngeneral-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the\ninteraction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind\ncan lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This\ntransition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power\ncan greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion\nrate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream.\nMore generally, our simulations produce for the first time the four possible\naccretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed\nmagnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto\nthe stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material enters through the\nlight cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d)\nalmost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the\npulsar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 13:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Upcoming microwave surveys\nwill enable extraction of velocities and temperatures from many individual\nclusters for the first time. We forecast constraints on peculiar velocities,\nelectron temperatures, and optical depths of galaxy clusters obtainable with\nupcoming multi-frequency measurements of the kinematic, thermal, and\nrelativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. The forecasted constraints are compared\nfor different measurement configurations with frequency bands between 90 GHz\nand 1 THz, and for different survey strategies for the 6-meter CCAT-prime\ntelescope. We study methods for improving cluster constraints by removing\nemission from dusty star forming galaxies, and by using X-ray temperature\npriors from eROSITA. Cluster constraints are forecast for several model cluster\nmasses. A sensitivity optimization for seven frequency bands is presented for a\nCCAT-prime first light instrument and a next generation instrument that takes\nadvantage of the large optical throughput of CCAT-prime. We find that\nCCAT-prime observations are expected to enable measurement and separation of\nthe SZ effects to characterize the velocity, temperature, and optical depth of\nindividual massive clusters ($\\sim10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$). Submillimeter\nmeasurements are shown to play an important role in separating these components\nfrom dusty galaxy contamination. Using a modular instrument configuration with\nsimilar optical throughput for each detector array, we develop a rule of thumb\nfor the number of detector arrays desired at each frequency to optimize\nextraction of these signals.

In this work, we determined short magnetic activity\ncycles for 6 active solar-type stars observed by the Kepler telescope. The\nmethod adopted here estimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of\nthe transitlight curves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless\nmodel transit from the light curve, and then integrating over all the residuals\nduring the transit. The presence of long term periodicity is estimated from the\nanalysis of a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the complete time series. Finally, we\ninvestigate the rotation-cycle period relation for the stars analysed here and\nfind that some active stars do not follow the behaviour proposed earlier,\nfalling in the inactive branch.

By capturing traffic traces between\nusers and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this\nmeta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such\nattacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used\nto construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered\nand, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these\ncarefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an\nadversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically\ndeanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We\ncollect a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is\nthe largest dataset of web traffic ever used for website fingerprinting, and\nfind that the performance achieved by our deep learning approaches is\ncomparable to known methods which include various research efforts spanning\nover multiple years.

Furthermore, we show that the\nimplicit features automatically learned by our approach are far more resilient\nto dynamic changes of web content over time.

This work completes the\ndescription of the Kerr-Newman spacetime in the formalism of weakly isolated\nhorizons and is a starting point for the investigation of deformed black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 19:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

To increase the\nefficacy and stealthiness of such threats, a number of extremely challenging,\ncross-layer attacks have been recently unveiled. Although existing research has\nthoroughly addressed many single-layer attacks, the problem of detecting and\nmitigating cross-layer attacks still remains unsolved. For this reason, in this\npaper we propose a novel framework to analyze and address cross-layer attacks\nin wireless networks. Specifically, our framework consists of a detection and a\nmitigation component. The attack detection component is based on a Bayesian\nlearning detection scheme that constructs a model of observed evidence to\nidentify stealthy attack activities. The mitigation component comprises a\nscheme that achieves the desired trade-off between security and performance. We\nspecialize and evaluate the proposed framework by considering a specific\ncross-layer attack that uses jamming as an auxiliary tool to achieve route\nmanipulation. Simulations and experimental results obtained with a test-bed\nmade up by USRP software-defined radios demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 19:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

We evaluated the\naccuracy and data consumption over network and thus show that it is feasible to\nincrease privacy and maintain accuracy while reducing data communication\ndemands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 22:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

To assure both safety and\nefficiency, this paper proposes a state-dependent channel model that captures\nthe interaction between the physical and communication systems. By adopting\nthis channel model, sufficient conditions on the maximum allowable transmission\ninterval are then derived to ensure stochastic safety for a nonlinear physical\nsystem controlled over a state-dependent wireless fading channel.

Each site of the ladder can either host a single\nanyonic charge, or it can be empty. The anyons are able to move around,\ninteract with one another, and exchange positions with other anyons, when\nvacancies exist. Exchange of anyons is a non-trivial process which may\ninfluence the formation of different kinds of new phases of matter. I studied\nthis model using the two prominent species of anyons: Fibonacci and Ising\nanyons, and made a number of interesting discoveries about their phase\ndiagrams. I identified new phases of matter arising from both the interaction\nbetween these anyons and their exchange braid statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 01:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Our objective is to design\nthe UAV trajectory to minimize its mission completion time, while ensuring that\neach GT is able to successfully recover the file with a high probability\nrequired. We consider the use of practical random linear network coding (RLNC)\nfor UAV multicasting, so that each GT is able to recover the file as long as it\nreceives a sufficiently large number of coded packets. However, the formulated\nUAV trajectory optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be directly\nsolved. To tackle this issue, we first derive an analytical lower bound for the\nsuccess probability of each GT's file recovery. Based on this result, we then\nreformulate the problem into a more tractable form, where the UAV trajectory\nonly needs to be designed to meet a set of constraints each on the minimum\nconnection time with a GT, during which their distance is below a designed\nthreshold. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory only needs to constitute\nconnected line segments, thus it can be obtained by determining first the\noptimal set of waypoints and then UAV speed along the lines connecting the\nwaypoints. We propose practical schemes for the waypoints design based on a\nnovel concept of virtual base station (VBS) placement and by applying convex\noptimization techniques. Furthermore, for given set of waypoints, we obtain the\noptimal UAV speed over the resulting path efficiently by solving a linear\nprogramming (LP) problem. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled\nmulticasting with optimized trajectory design achieves significant performance\ngains as compared to benchmark schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 02:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The C-DIIS method requires the explicit storage of the density matrix,\nthe Fock matrix and the commutator matrix. Hence the method can only be used\nfor systems with a relatively small basis set, such as the Gaussian basis set.\nWe develop a new method that enables the C-DIIS method to be efficiently\nemployed in electronic structure calculations with a large basis set such as\nplanewaves for the first time.

When the exactness of convex\nrelaxations is not guaranteed, it is important to recover a feasible solution\nfor the convex relaxation methods. This paper presents an alternative convex\noptimization (ACP) approach that can efficiently recover a feasible solution\nfrom the result of second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxed OPF in mesh\nnetworks. The OPF problem is first formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC)\nprogramming problem, then efficiently solved by a penalty convex concave\nprocedure (CCP).

Methods: We run polarized radiative\ntransfer simulations in a set of warped and non warped clumpy tori to explore\nthe differences induced by distorted dust distributions. We then include warped\ntori in a more complex model representative of an AGN to check, using\npolarimetry and imaging methods, if warps can reproduce the expected\npolarization dichotomy between Seyfert-1 and Seyfert-2 AGN. Results: The main\nresults from our simulations highlight that isolated warped structures imprint\nthe polarization degree and angle with distinctive signatures at Seyfert-1\norientations.

For both\nstackings of the 5d-Fe bilayer on Rh(001) we observe a transition from an\nantiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange interaction upon\n5d band filling. In the sandwich structure 5d/Fe/Rh(001) the nearest neighbor\nexchange is significantly reduced. For FeIr bilayers on Rh(001) we consider\nspin spiral states in order to determine exchange constants beyond nearest\nneighbors. By including spin-orbit coupling we obtain the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI). The magnetic interactions in Fe/Ir/Rh(001) are similar to\nthose of Fe/Ir(001) for which an atomic scale spin lattice has been predicted.\nHowever, small deviations between both systems remain due to the different\nlattice constants and the Rh vs. Ir surface layers. This leads to slightly\ndifferent exchange constants and DMI and the easy magnetization direction\nswitches from out-of-plane for Fe/Ir(001) to in-plane for Fe/Ir/Rh(001).\nTherefore a fine tuning of magnetic interactions is possible by using single 5d\ntransition-metal layers which may allow to tailor antiferromagnetic skyrmions\nin this type of ultrathin films.

However, engineering such\nnext-step hints manually or via an expert model becomes infeasible if the space\nof possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to\ninfer next-step hints automatically, relying on past students' data. In\nparticular, the Hint Factory (Barnes & Stamper, 2008) recommends edits that are\nmost likely to guide students from their current state towards a correct\nsolution, based on what successful students in the past have done in the same\nsituation. Still, the Hint Factory relies on student data being available for\nany state a student might visit while solving the task, which is not the case\nfor some learning tasks, such as open-ended programming tasks. In this\ncontribution we provide a mathematical framework for edit-based hint policies\nand, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints in\nvast and sparsely populated state spaces. In particular, we extend the Hint\nFactory by considering data of past students in all states which are similar to\nthe student's current state and creating hints approximating the weighted\naverage of all these reference states. Because the space of possible weighted\naverages is continuous, we call this approach the Continuous Hint Factory. In\nour experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the Continuous Hint Factory\ncan predict more accurately what capable students would do compared to existing\nprediction schemes on two learning tasks, especially in an open-ended\nprogramming task, and that the Continuous Hint Factory is comparable to\nexisting hint policies at reproducing tutor hints on a simple UML diagram task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 11:33:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 23:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

Motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is a kind of\nmost widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions\nwithout actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent\nyears, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the\nmassive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG\nsignals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between\nEEG signals and certain brain activities.

We provide an overview of\nthe main energetic structure around the p-shell transitions, including the\ninfluence of nearby nominally dark states. Based on the envelope function\napproximation, we treat the four-band Luttinger theory as well as the direct\nand short range exchange Coulomb interactions within a configuration\ninteraction approach. The quantum dot confinement is approximated by an\nanisotropic harmonic potential. We present a detailed investigation of state\nmixing and correlations mediated by the individual interactions. Differences\nand similarities between the differently charged quantum dots are highlighted.\nEspecially large differences between negatively and positively charged quantum\ndots become evident. We present a visualisation of energetic shifts and state\nmixtures due to changes in size, in-plane asymmetry and aspect ratio. Thereby\nwe provide a better understanding of the experimentally hard to access question\nof quantum dot geometry effects in general. Our findings show a new method to\ndetermine the in-plane asymmetry from photoluminescense excitation spectra.\nFurthermore, we supply basic knowledge for tailoring the strength of certain\nstate mixtures or the energetic order of particular excited states via changes\nin the shape of the quantum dot, which is highly interesting e.g. to understand\nrelaxation paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Essentially, the dance encodes the polar coordinates to the resource\nin the field. Unemployed foragers follow the dancer's movements and then search\nfor the advertised spots in the field. Throughout the last decades, biologists\nhave employed different techniques to measure key characteristics of the waggle\ndance and decode the information it conveys. Early techniques involved the use\nof protractors and stopwatches to measure the dance orientation and duration\ndirectly from the observation hive. Recent approaches employ digital video\nrecordings and manual measurements on screen. However, manual approaches are\nvery time-consuming. Most studies, therefore, regard only small numbers of\nanimals in short periods of time. We have developed a system capable of\nautomatically detecting, decoding and mapping communication dances in\nreal-time. In this paper, we describe our recording setup, the image processing\nsteps performed for dance detection and decoding and an algorithm to map dances\nto the field. The proposed system performs with a detection accuracy of\n90.07\\%. The decoded waggle orientation has an average error of -2.92{\\deg}\n($\\pm$ 7.37{\\deg} ), well within the range of human error. To evaluate and\nexemplify the system's performance, a group of bees was trained to an\nartificial feeder, and all dances in the colony were automatically detected,\ndecoded and mapped. The system presented here is the first of this kind made\npublicly available, including source code and hardware specifications. We hope\nthis will foster quantitative analyses of the honey bee waggle dance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 14:38:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 02:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The analysis of the\nmolecular observations reveals the presence of a kinetic temperature and H2\ncolumn density gradients across the molecular clump in which the source is\nembedded, with the hotter and less dense gas in the inner region. The 12CO\nJ=3-2 emission shows evidence of misaligned massive molecular outflows, with\nthe blue lobe in positional coincidence with a jet-like feature seen at 8 um.\nThe radio continuum emission shows a slightly elongated compact radio source in\npositional coincidence with the Red MSX source. The polar-like morphology of\nthis compact radio source perfectly matches the hourglass-like morphology\nexhibited by the source in the Ks-band. The axes of symmetry of the radio\nsource and the near-IR nebula are perfectly aligned. Based on the\nmultiwavelength analysis, we suggest that the analyzed source could be\ntransiting a HC HII region phase, in which the young central star emits winds\nand ionizing radiation through the poles. By the other hand, according to a\ncomparison between the Br-gamma and the radio flux density, the source would be\nin a more evolved evolutionary stage of an optically thin UC HII region in\nphotoionization equilibrium. If this is the case, from the radio continuum\nemission, we can conjecture upon the spectral type of its exciting star which\nwould be a B0.5V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Two of\nthem are empty clathrate hydrates and three of them represent hydrogen ordered\ncounterparts of previously known disordered ice phases. Here, we report on\nhydrogen ordering in ice VI samples upon cooling at pressures up to 1.8 GPa.\nUsing calorimetry, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and\npowder X-ray diffraction we provide evidence for the existence of a second\nhydrogen ordered phase related to ice VI, that we call ice {\\beta}-XV. This\nphase is more ordered than ice XV by 14% and directly transforms to ice XV\nabove 103K and to ice VI above 129K. That is, upon heating an\norder->order->disorder transition is experienced. The new phase is thus\nthermodynamically more stable than ice XV requiring a new stability region in\nthe phase diagram of water. Raman spectroscopy indicates ice XV and ice\n{\\beta}-XV to be different in terms of symmetry and space group. The activation\nenergies for dielectric relaxation are 45 kJ mol-1 in ice {\\beta}-XV compared\nto 18 kJ mol-1 in ice XV. Powder X-ray data show the oxygen network to be the\none of ice VI. The ordering of hydrogen atoms induces a significant peak shift\nto lower d-spacings at d=0.265 nm in ice {\\beta}-XV, whereas for ice XV shifts\nto higher d-spacings are found.

A typical VCS repository of a large project can\ncontain various intertwined branches consisting of a large number of commits.\nIf some kind of unwanted behaviour (e.g. a bug in the code) is found in the\nproject, it is desirable to find the commit that introduced it. Such commit is\ncalled a regression point. There are two main issues regarding the regression\npoints. First, detecting whether the project after a certain commit is correct\ncan be very expensive as it may include large-scale testing and/or some other\nforms of verification. It is thus desirable to minimise the number of such\nqueries. Second, there can be several regression points preceding the actual\ncommit; perhaps a bug was introduced in a certain commit, inadvertently fixed\nseveral commits later, and then reintroduced in a yet later commit. In order to\nfix the actual commit it is usually desirable to find the latest regression\npoint.\n  The currently used distributed VCS contain methods for regression\nidentification, see e.g. the git bisect tool. In this paper, we present a new\nregression identification algorithm that outperforms the current tools by\ndecreasing the number of validity queries. At the same time, our algorithm\ntends to find the latest regression points which is a feature that is missing\nin the state-of-the-art algorithms.

The cooperation is\nperformed at the network level. A collision channel with erasures is\nconsidered. We provide an exact characterization of the stability region of the\nsystem and we also prove that the system with partial cooperation is always\nbetter or at least equal to the system without the flow controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 16:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

However to realize a coded caching\nscheme, each file must be divided into $F$ packets which usually increases the\ncomputation complexity of a coded caching scheme. So we prefer to construct a\ncaching scheme that decreases the order of $F$ for practical implementations.\n  In this paper, we construct four classes of new schemes where two classes can\nsignificantly reduce the value of $F$ by increasing a little $R$ comparing with\nthe well known scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, and $F$ in the other\ntwo classes grows sub-exponentially with $K$ by sacrificing more $R$. It is\nworth noting that a tradeoff between $R$ and $F$, which is a hot topic in the\nfield of caching scheme, is proposed by our constructions. In addition, our\nconstructions include all the results constructed by Yan et al., (IEEE Trans.\nInf.

Seeded from shot noise in the\nparticle distribution, bending waves rapidly form in both models and persist\nfor many billions of years. Waves at intermediate radii manifest as corrugated\nstructures in vertical position and velocity that are tightly wound,\nmorphologically leading, and dominated by the $m=1$ azimuthal Fourier\ncomponent. A spectral analysis of the waves suggests they are a superposition\nof modes from two continuous branches in the Galactocentric radius-rotational\nfrequency plane.

Over time, power in this branch\nmigrates outward, lending credence to an inside-out formation scenario for the\nwarp.

The chromatic number of $G$ is less than or equal to the dimension of\n$P$ and the difference between the two values can be arbitrarily large.\nNevertheless, there are important instances where the two parameters are the\nsame, and we study one of these in this paper.

The radio\nrelic is located at the distance of $\\sim 540$ kpc from the X-ray peak toward\nthe west. We measured the temperature of this cluster for the first time. The\nresultant temperature in the center is $ \\sim 1.3$ keV, which is lower than the\nvalue expected from the X-ray luminosity - temperature and the velocity\ndispersion - temperature relation. Though we did not find a significant\ntemperature jump at the outer edge of the relic, our results suggest that the\ntemperature decreases outward across the relic. Assuming the existence of the\nshock at the relic, its Mach number becomes $M \\simeq 1.4 $. A possible spatial\nvariation of Mach number along the relic is suggested. Additionally, a sharp\nsurface brightness edge is found at the distance of $\\sim 160$ kpc from the\nX-ray peak toward the west in the Chandra image. We performed X-ray spectral\nand surface brightness analyses around the edge with Suzaku and Chandra data,\nrespectively. The obtained surface brightness and temperature profiles suggest\nthat this edge is not a shock but likely a cold front. Alternatively, it cannot\nbe ruled out that thermal pressure is really discontinuous across the edge. In\nthis case, if the pressure across the surface brightness edge is in\nequilibrium, other forms of pressure sources, such as cosmic-rays, are\nnecessary.

This change in design paradigms needs\nadvanced tools to assess the mechanical performance of the product, and\nsimulate the impact on the patient. In this work, we perform a structural\nanalysis on the interface of a cranial PSI under static loading conditions.\nBased on those simulations, we have identified the regions with high stress and\nstrain and checked the failure criteria both in the implant and the skull. We\nevaluate the quality of the design of the implant and determine their response\ngiven different materials, in order to ensure optimality of the final product\nto be manufactured .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 09:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}
