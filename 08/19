The corotation torque in an inviscid,\nisothermal, dead zone ought to saturate, with the libration region becoming\nboth symmetrical and of a uniform vortensity, leading to fast inward migration\ndriven by the Lindblad torques alone. However, in such a low viscosity\nsituation, the material on librating streamlines essentially preserves its\nvortensity.

The\nnormalization of the cosmic BHB merger rate strongly depends on the treatment\nof common envelope and on the distribution of natal kicks. We find that most\nBHBs merging within LIGO's instrumental horizon come from relatively metal-poor\nprogenitors (<0.2 Zsun). The total masses of merging BHBs span a large range of\nvalues, from ~6 to ~82 Msun.

Most GW150914-like\nsystems merging in the local Universe appear to have formed at high redshift,\nwith a long delay time.

To counter such attacks, an IoBT\ndefender attempts to reestablish the IoBT connectivity by either deploying new\nIoBT nodes or by changing the roles of existing nodes. This problem is\nformulated as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that extends\nclassical connectivity games and that explicitly takes into account the\ncharacteristics and requirements of the IoBT network. In particular, the\ndefender's payoff captures the IoBT latency as well as the sum of weights of\ndisconnected nodes at each stage of the game. Due to the dependence of the\nattacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network\nstate, the feedback Stackelberg solution (FSE) is used to solve the IoBT\nconnectivity game. Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will\nremain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically.\nNumerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when\nthe FSE solution is used, decreases up to 62% compared to a baseline scenario\nin which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 57% compared to\na baseline equal probability policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 19:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 00:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

The straightforward approach\ninvolves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the\nclusters. This approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum,\nhowever the number of possible assignments scales quickly with the number of\ndata points and becomes computationally intractable even for very small\ndatasets. In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found\nusing popular local-search based heuristic approaches such as k-means and\nhierarchical clustering.

In this article, we investigate\nwhether a similar strategy allows control of active liquid crystals. We study a\nhydrodynamic model of an extensile active nematic confined in containers, with\ndifferent anchoring conditions that impose different net topological charges on\nthe nematic director. We show that the dynamics are controlled by a complex\ninterplay between topological defects in the director and their induced\nvortical flows. We find three distinct states by varying confinement and the\nstrength of the active stress: a topologically minimal state, a circulating\ndefect state, and a turbulent state. In contrast to equilibrium systems, we\nfind that anchoring conditions are screened by the active flow, preserving\nsystem behavior across different topological constraints. This observation\nidentifies a fundamental difference between active and equilibrium materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 00:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

The present Letter focuses on a new and fundamental\nphysical explanation for the origin of suprathermal electron distribution\nfunction in a highly collisional plasma. This process involves a newly\ndiscovered electrostatic bremsstrahlung emission that is effective in a plasma\nin which binary collisions are present. The steady-state electron velocity\ndistribution function dictated by such a process corresponds to a Maxwellian\ncore plus a quasi-inverse power-law tail, which is a feature commonly observed\nin many space plasma environment. In order to demonstrate this, the system of\nself-consistent particle- and wave- kinetic equations are numerically solved\nwith an initially Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and Langmuir wave\nspectral intensity, which is a state that does not reflect the presence of\nelectrostatic bremsstrahlung process, and hence not in force balance. The\nelectrostatic bremsstrahlung term subsequently drives the system to a new\nforce-balanced steady state. After a long integration period it is demonstrated\nthe initial Langmuir fluctuation spectrum is modified, which in turn distorts\nthe initial Maxwellian electron distribution into a velocity distribution that\nresembles the said core-suprathermal velocity distribution. Such a mechanism\nmay thus be operative at the coronal source region, which is characterized by\nhigh collisionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 13:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

As complexity is increased, so is the need for large amounts of labeled\ndata to train the model. This is associated with a costly human annotation\neffort. To address this concern, with the long-term goal of leveraging the\nabundance of cheap unlabeled data, we explore methods of unsupervised\n\"pre-training.\" In particular, we propose to use self-supervised automatic\nimage colorization.\n  We show that traditional methods for unsupervised learning, such as\nlayer-wise clustering or autoencoders, remain inferior to supervised\npre-training. In search for an alternative, we develop a fully automatic image\ncolorization method. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art in revitalizing old\nblack-and-white photography, without requiring human effort or expertise.\nAdditionally, it gives us a method for self-supervised representation learning.\nIn order for the model to appropriately re-color a grayscale object, it must\nfirst be able to identify it. This ability, learned entirely self-supervised,\ncan be used to improve other visual tasks, such as classification and semantic\nsegmentation. As a future direction for self-supervision, we investigate if\nmultiple proxy tasks can be combined to improve generalization. This turns out\nto be a challenging open problem.

As one of\nthe most well-known examples in turbulent flows, knowledge of the logarithmic\nmean velocity profile (MVP), so called the log law of the wall, plays an\nimportant role everywhere turbulent flow meets the solid wall, such as fluids\nin any kind of channels, skin friction of all types of transportations, the\natmospheric wind on a planetary ground, and the oceanic current on the seabed.\nHowever, the mechanism of how this log-law MVP is formed under the multiscale\nnature of turbulent shears remains one of the greatest interests of turbulence\npuzzles. To untangle the multiscale coupling of turbulent shear stresses, we\nexplore for a known fundamental tool in physics. Here we present how to\nreproduce the log-law MVP with the even harmonic modes of fixed-end standing\nwaves. We find that when these harmonic waves of same magnitude are considered\nas the multiscale turbulent shear stresses, the wave envelope of their\nsuperposition simulates the mean shear stress profile of the wall-bounded flow.\nIt implies that the log-law MVP is not expectedly related to the turbulent\nscales in the inertial subrange associated with the Kolmogorov energy cascade,\nrevealing the dissipative nature of all scales involved. The MVP with reduced\nharmonic modes also shows promising connection to the understanding of flow\ntransition to turbulence.

The recurrent\nneural networks we use in our approach act as a high-dimensional projection of\nthe recent history of a situation on the field. Similar situations, i.e., with\nsimilar histories, are found by clustering of network states. The same networks\nare also used to learn so-called conceptors, that are lower-dimensional\nmanifolds that describe trajectories through a high-dimensional state space\nthat enable situation-specific predictions from the same neural network. With\nthe proposed approach, we can segment games into sequences of situations that\nare learnt in an unsupervised way, and learn conceptors that are useful for the\nprediction of the near future of the respective situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 07:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

The key\nchallenge is the high-dimensional and continuous state-action space that\nprohibits the application of previous IRL algorithms.

We offer support to\nthis claim of association by providing dedicated model predictions for the\nnonthermal photon emission spectrum of $\\gamma^2$ Velorum.\n  We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic modeling (MHD) to investigate\nthe structure and conditions of the wind-collision region (WCR) of $\\gamma^2$\nVelorum including the important effect of radiative braking in the stellar\nwinds. A transport equation is then solved throughout the computational domain\nto study the propagation of relativistic electrons and protons. The resulting\ndistributions of particles are subsequently used to compute nonthermal photon\nemission components.\n  In agreement with observation in X-ray spectroscopy, our simulations yield a\nlarge shock-cone opening angle. We find the nonthermal $\\gamma$-ray emission of\n$\\gamma^2$ Velorum to be of hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation\nfields in the binary system which inhibit the acceleration of electrons to\nenergies sufficiently high for efficient inverse Compton radiation. We also\ndiscuss the strong dependence of a hadronic $\\gamma$-ray component on the\nenergy-dependent diffusion used in the simulations.
