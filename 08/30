The\nstar formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 100 $M_\\odot$ per year,\nrequire large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be delivered to their cores,\ndespite strong feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei. Starburst\ngalaxies are therefore ideal targets to unravel the critical interplay between\nthis feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH$^+$, is a\nmost useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas\nwithout supra-thermal energy input, so its presence highlights dissipation of\nmechanical energy or strong UV irradiation. Here, we report the detection of\nCH$^+$(J=1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed\nstarburst galaxies at redshifts z~2.5. This line has such a high critical\ndensity for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense ($>10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$) gas, and is absorbed in low-density gas. We find that the CH$^+$\nemission lines, which are broader than 1000 km s$^{-1}$, originate in dense\nshock waves powered by hot galactic winds. The CH$^+$ absorption lines reveal\nhighly turbulent reservoirs of cool ($T\\sim 100$K), low-density gas, extending\nfar outside (>10 kpc) the starburst cores (radii <1 kpc). We show that the\ngalactic winds sustain turbulence in the 10 kpc-scale environments of the\nstarburst cores, processing these environments into multi-phase,\ngravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow rates are found to\nbe insufficient to balance the star formation rates. Another mass input is\ntherefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by on-going\nmergers or cold stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic feedback,\ncoupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase instead\nof quenching it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The model grid is\nbased on the paradigm of core accretion theory for massive star formation with\npre-assembled gravitationally-bound cores as initial conditions. In particular,\nfollowing the Turbulent Core Model, initial core properties are set primarily\nby their mass and the pressure of their ambient clump. We then model the\nevolution of the protostar and its surround structures in a self-consistent\nway. The model grid contains about 9000 SEDs with 4 free parameters: initial\ncore mass, the mean surface density of the environment, the protostellar mass,\nand the inclination. The model grid is used to fit observed SEDs via chi^2\nminimization, with the foreground extinction additionally estimated. We\ndemonstrate the fitting process and results using the example of massive\nprotostar G35.20- 0.74. Compared with other SED model grids currently used for\nmassive star formation studies, in our model grid, the properties of the\nprotostar and its surrounding structures are more physically connected, which\nreduces the dimensionality of the parameter spaces and the total number of\nmodels. This excludes possible fitting of models that are physically\nunrealistic or that are not internally self-consistent in the context of the\nTurbulent Core Model. Thus, this model grid serves not only as a fitting tool\nto estimate properties of massive protostars, but also as a test of core\naccretion theory. The SED model grid is publicly released with this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Instances within\na category can be described by a set of these phrases and collectively they\nspan the space of semantic attributes for a category. We collect a large\ndataset of such phrases by asking annotators to describe several visual\ndifferences between a pair of instances within a category. We then learn to\ndescribe and ground these phrases to images in the context of a *reference\ngame* between a speaker and a listener.

One of the results here is a\ntheorem demonstrating that a large class of discrete-time quantum walks have\nrelativistic dynamics in the continuum limit. Additionally, the problem of\nfermion doubling for these models is investigated, and it is seen that the\nproblem can be circumvented in two dimensional space.

The requirement that a condensate wave function be single\nvalued upon once encircling the cylinder means that such a single vortex cannot\nremain stationary. Instead, it acquires one of a series of quantized\ntranslational velocities around the circumference, the simplest being $\\pm\n\\hbar/(2MR)$, with $M$ the mass of the superfluid particles and $R$ the radius\nof the cylinder. A generalization to a finite cylinder automatically includes\nthese quantum-mechanical effects through the pairing of the single vortex and\nits image in either the top or bottom end of the surface. The dynamics of a\nsingle vortex on this surface provides a hydrodynamic analog of Laughlin\npumping. The interaction energy for two vortices on an infinite cylinder is\nproportional to the classical stream function $\\chi({\\bf r}_{12})$, and it\ncrosses over from logarithmic to linear when the intervortex separation ${\\bf\nr}_{12}$ becomes larger than the cylinder radius.

A second Appendix reviews the topologically equivalent\nplanar annulus, where such quantized vortex motion has no offset, but Laughlin\npumping may be more accessible to experimental observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 17:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 10:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

We present Datamaran, an tool that extracts\nstructure from semi-structured log datasets with no human supervision.\nDatamaran automatically identifies field and record endpoints, separates the\nstructured parts from the unstructured noise or formatting, and can tease apart\nmultiple structures from within a dataset, in order to efficiently extract\nstructured relational datasets from semi-structured log datasets, at scale with\nhigh accuracy. Compared to other unsupervised log dataset extraction tools\ndeveloped in prior work, Datamaran does not require the record boundaries to be\nknown beforehand, making it much more applicable to the noisy log files that\nare ubiquitous in data lakes. Datamaran can successfully extract structured\ninformation from all datasets used in prior work, and can achieve 95%\nextraction accuracy on automatically collected log datasets from GitHub - a\nsubstantial 66% increase of accuracy compared to unsupervised schemes from\nprior work. Our user study further demonstrates that the extraction results of\nDatamaran are closer to the desired structure than competing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 17:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 03:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 01:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

As a corollary of the model, the idea that the NS shape is solely\ndetermined by the poloidal magnetic field, or by the centrifugal deformation of\nthe crust, is found to be inconsistent with the tilt angle distribution in\nyoung pulsars. When applied to the Crab pulsar, with $\\chi \\sim 45^\\circ -\n70^\\circ$ and birth spin $\\sim$ 20 ms, our model implies that: (i) the\nmagnetically-induced ellipticity is $\\epsilon_B \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$; (ii)\nthe measured positive $\\dot{\\chi} \\sim 3.6 \\times 10^{-12}$ rad s$^{-1}$\nrequires an additional viscous process, acting on a timescale $\\lesssim 10^4$\nyrs. We interpret the latter as crust-core coupling via mutual friction in the\nsuperfluid NS interior. One critical implication of our model is a GW signal at\n(twice) the spin frequency of the NS, due to $\\epsilon_B \\sim 10^{-6}$.

If this is the case, then systems form fewer\ndetectable ($\\gtrsim1\\mathrm{\\,M}_\\oplus$) planets than systems evolved under\nthe assumption of perfect merging in collisions.

The effects of changing the collision prescription on\nunstable mature systems of super-Earths are less pronounced. Perfect mergers\nonly account for a minority of collision outcomes in such systems, but most\ncollisions resulting in mass loss are grazing impacts in which only a few per\ncent. of mass is lost.

The results of the simulations were\ncompared with the theoretical predictions of the linearized theory. For small\nMach numbers up to $M_s \\sim 0.1$ we find that both results are in good\nagreement. However, for higher Mach numbers, non-linear effects are\nsignificant. In particular, many initial conditions that look stable according\nto the linear analysis are shown to be unstable according to the full\ncalculation.

Motivated by this, we explore a scenario where\nULXs consist of black holes formed by the collapse of high-mass,\nlow-metallicity stars, and that these ULXs become binary black holes (BBHs)\nthat eventually merge. We use empirical relations between the number of ULXs\nand the star formation rate and host galaxy metallicity to estimate the ULX\nformation rate and the BBH merger rate at all redshifts. This assumes the ULX\nrate is directly proportional to the star formation rate for a given\nmetallicity, and that the black hole accretion rate is distributed as a\nlog-normal distribution. We include an enhancement in the ULX formation rate at\nearlier epochs due to lower mean metallicities.

This galaxy\nshows a tail of ionized gas that extends up to 30 kpc from the main body in the\nopposite direction of the cluster center. No gas emission is detected in the\ngalaxy outer disk, suggesting that gas stripping is proceeding outside-in. The\nstellar component is distributed as a regular disk galaxy; the stellar\nkinematics shows a symmetric rotation curve with a maximum radial velocity of\n200km/s out to 20 kpc from the galaxy center. The radial velocity of the gas\ncomponent in the central part of the disk follows the distribution of the\nstellar component; the gas kinematics in the tail retains the rotation of the\ngalaxy disk, indicating that JO204 is moving at high speed in the intracluster\nmedium. Both the emission and radial velocity maps of the gas and stellar\ncomponents indicate ram-pressure as the most likely primary mechanism for gas\nstripping, as expected given that JO204 is close to the cluster center and it\nis likely at the first infall in the cluster. The spatially resolved star\nformation history of JO204 provides evidence that the onset of ram-pressure\nstripping occurred in the last 500 Myr, quenching the star formation activity\nin the outer disk, where the gas has been already completely stripped.

Recent in vitro\nstudies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some\nspecific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a\nbasic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack\nof inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous\navalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches.\nHere we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling\nexponent $\\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a\nneuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality (SOC).

The tradeoff for this approach is reduced\nsensitivity, which, in turn, makes it difficult to attain a high Strehl ratio\nonce the loop has been closed. We propose an algorithm that increases the\ndynamic range of the PyWFS without modulation. The proposed algorithm achieves\nthis in two ways: 1) it allows the PyWFS to be treated with any desired optical\nmodeling algorithms, and 2) it employs Newton's method for nonlinear\noptimization to create an estimator that is more accurate than the\ncorresponding linear estimator. Numerical simulations show that nonlinear\noptimization can make more accurate estimates of the phase of the wavefront\nthan the corresponding linear estimator for Strehl ratios of the input beam\nthat are greater than about 0.2. As the input Strehl ratio increases, so does\nthe advantage of the nonlinear estimator over the linear one. For example, when\nthe input beam had a Strehl ratio of 0.4 (corresponding to a standard deviation\nof the phase of about 0.96 radians), the linear estimator error had a standard\ndeviation of about 0.65 radians, while the nonlinear estimator error had a\nstandard deviation of about 0.27 radians (this depends only weakly on the noise\nlevel, assuming there is enough signal for the PyWFS to work in the linear\nregime). The new algorithm can be implemented in massively parallel modes,\nsince the required calculations have almost no inter-dependencies. It is\nsuggested that the required computations can be performed quickly enough for\nthe purposes of AO on modern computer systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 21:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

There is generally little room for increasing\ndigital investigation capacity in law enforcement digital forensic units and\nthe allocated budgets for these units are often decreasing. In the context of\ndeveloping an efficient investigation process, one of the key challenges\namounts to how to achieve more with less. This paper proposes a workflow\nmanagement automation framework for handling common digital forensic tools. The\nobjective is to streamline the digital investigation workflow - enabling more\nefficient use of limited hardware and software. The proposed automation\nframework reduces the time digital forensic experts waste conducting\ntime-consuming, though necessary, tasks. The evidence processing time is\ndecreased through server-side automation resulting in 24/7 evidence\npreparation. The proposed framework increases efficiency of use of forensic\nsoftware and hardware, reduces the infrastructure costs and license fees, and\nsimplifies the preparation steps for the digital investigator.

The\nobstruction of coronary arteries results in significant loss of myocardium,\ncalled acute myocardial infarction, and the number one cause of death globally.\nHence, quantification of the regional amount of heart muscle subtended by\nobstructed coronary arteries is of critical value in clinical medicine.\nHowever, the conventional methods are inaccurate and frequently disagree with\nclinical practices. This study proposes a novel algorithm to segment regional\nmyocardium-at-risk subtended by any potentially obstructed coronary artery.\nAssuming the geometric triangular mesh models of coronary artery and myocardium\nderived from an individual cardiac computed tomography image, the proposed\nalgorithm performs (i) computation of the medial axis of the coronary artery\nand (ii) segmentation of the coronary artery and myocardium using the medial\naxis. The algorithm provides the fused segmentation of coronary artery and\nmyocardium via the medial axis. The computed result provides a robust\nmathematical linkage between myocardium-at-risk and supplying coronary arteries\nso that ischemic myocardial regions can be accurately identified, and both the\nextent and severity of myocardial ischemia can be quantified effectively and\nefficiently. Furthermore, the correspondence between segmented coronary artery\nand myocardium can be more importantly used for building optimization models of\ncardiac systems for various applications.

Population\ndisaggregation techniques and population projection methods individually\naddress these shortcomings, but also have shortcomings of their own. To jointly\nanswer the questions of \"where do people live\" and \"how many people live\nthere,\" we propose a deep learning model for creating high-resolution\npopulation estimations from satellite imagery.

We also observe\nthat some videos or hashtags suddenly go viral through people's sharing on\nonline social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a\ncommon structure? All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user\ninteractions in networks, which we call \"bursts\" in this work. We uncover that\nthe emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in some\nproperly defined networks. This finding motivates us to propose a new and\nrobust method to detect bursts on OSNs. We first introduce a new measure,\n\"triadic cardinality distribution\", corresponding to the fractions of nodes\nwith different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic cardinalities, in a network.\nWe show that this distribution not only changes when a burst occurs, but it\nalso has a robustness property that it is immunized against common spamming\nsocial-bot attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we\ncan more reliably detect bursts than simply counting interactions on OSNs. To\navoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN users during the triadic\ntracking, we design an efficient \"sample-estimate\" framework to provide maximum\nlikelihood estimate on the triadic cardinality distribution. We propose several\nsampling methods, and provide insights about their performance difference,\nthrough both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on real world\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 02:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

To numerically discretize $L^1$-EOCP, the\nstandard piecewise linear finite element is employed. However, different from\nthe finite dimensional $l^1$-regularization optimization, the resulting\ndiscrete $L^1$-norm does not have a decoupled form. A common approach to\novercome this difficulty is employing a nodal quadrature formula to\napproximately discretize the $L^1$-norm. It is clear that this technique will\nincur an additional error. To avoid the additional error, solving $L^1$-EOCP\nvia its dual, which can be reformulated as a multi-block unconstrained convex\ncomposite minimization problem, is considered. Motivated by the success of the\naccelerated block coordinate descent (ABCD) method for solving large scale\nconvex minimization problems in finite dimensional space, we consider extending\nthis method to $L^1$-EOCP. Hence, an efficient inexact ABCD method is\nintroduced for solving $L^1$-EOCP.

In this paper, a color-depth conditional GAN is proposed to\nconcurrently resolve the problems of depth super-resolution and color\nsuper-resolution in 3D videos. Firstly, given the low-resolution depth image\nand low-resolution color image, a generative network is proposed to leverage\nmutual information of color image and depth image to enhance each other in\nconsideration of the geometry structural dependency of color-depth image in the\nsame scene. Secondly, three loss functions, including data loss, total\nvariation loss, and 8-connected gradient difference loss are introduced to\ntrain this generative network in order to keep generated images close to the\nreal ones, in addition to the adversarial loss. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality color image and\ndepth image from low-quality image pair, and it is superior to several other\nleading methods.

This problem is challenging, in part due to a paucity of\nlabeled facial expression data, making it difficult for algorithms to\ndisambiguate changes due to identity and changes due to expression. In this\npaper, we propose the conditional difference adversarial autoencoder, CDAAE,\nfor facial expression synthesis. The CDAAE takes a facial image of a previously\nunseen person and generates an image of that human face with a target emotion\nor facial action unit label. The CDAAE adds a feedforward path to an\nautoencoder structure connecting low level features at the encoder to features\nat the corresponding level at the decoder. It handles the problem of\ndisambiguating changes due to identity and changes due to facial expression by\nlearning to generate the difference between low-level features of images of the\nsame person but with different facial expressions. The CDAAE structure can be\nused to generate novel expressions by combining and interpolating between\nfacial expressions/action units within the training set. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the CDAAE can preserve identity information when\ngenerating facial expression for unseen subjects more faithfully than previous\napproaches.

These parallel systems\nusually have a large number of servers and hosts, which generate large volumes\nof highly-volatile traffic. Thus, distributed load-balancing routing design\nbecomes critical to achieve high bandwidth utilization, and low-latency packet\ndelivery. Existing distributed designs rely on remote congestion feedbacks to\naddress congestion, which add overheads to collect and react to network-wide\ncongestion information. In contrast, we propose a simple but effective\nload-balancing scheme, called Dynamic Randomized load-Balancing (DRB), to\nachieve network-wide low levels of path collisions through local-link\nadjustment which is free of communications and cooperations between switches.\nFirst, we use D-mod-k path selection scheme to allocate default paths to all\nsource-destination (S-D) pairs in a fat-tree network, guaranteeing low levels\nof path collision over downlinks for any set of active S-D pairs.

One key\nstudied question is how much emergent complexity (or information) arises when a\npopulation of computable systems is networked compared with when this\npopulation is isolated. First, we define a general model for networked\ntheoretical machines, which we call algorithmic networks. Then, we narrow our\nscope to investigate algorithmic networks that optimize the average fitnesses\nof nodes in a scenario in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the\nrandomly generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show\nthat there are graph-topological conditions that cause these algorithmic\nnetworks to have the property of expected emergent open-endedness for large\nenough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic\ncomplexity of a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to\ninfinity. Given a dynamic network, we show that these conditions imply the\nexistence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness.\nMoreover, we show that networks with small diameter compared to the network\nsize meet these conditions.

We used a sample of CG\ngalaxies with IR data from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)\nallowing us to calculate the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) for\neach galaxy. Furthermore, we present new CO(1-0) data for 27 galaxies and\ncollect data from the literature to calculate the molecular gas mass for a\ntotal sample of 130 galaxies.

The molecular gas fraction is higher than that of\nquiescent galaxies, whereas the SFE is similar.

The equation for\nthe eigenmodes is solved, first, perturbatively in the ratio $O(C)/M$ of the\nsupertranslation field to the mass of black hole, and, next, non-perturbatively\nin the near- horizon region.

We show that the total size and overhead\nof evolving scientific datasets is reduced, and typical subsets that\nresearchers use for their analyses can be referenced and retrieved efficiently\nwith optimized precision, persistence, and reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 09:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

However,\nit remains challenging to generate high-quality disparities for the inherently\nill-posed regions. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel cascade CNN\narchitecture composing of two stages. The first stage advances the recently\nproposed DispNet by equipping it with extra up-convolution modules, leading to\ndisparity images with more details. The second stage explicitly rectifies the\ndisparity initialized by the first stage; it couples with the first-stage and\ngenerates residual signals across multiple scales. The summation of the outputs\nfrom the two stages gives the final disparity. As opposed to directly learning\nthe disparity at the second stage, we show that residual learning provides more\neffective refinement. Moreover, it also benefits the training of the overall\ncascade network.

This new mechanism of\nstar formation suppression (or quenching) does not depend so strongly on model\nparameters of disk galaxies, such as bulge-to-disk- ratios and gas mass\nfractions. Such severe suppression of star formation is due largely to the\nsuppression of the gas density enhancing mechanism i.e spiral arm formation in\ndisk galaxies with counter-rotating gas. Our simulations also show that\nmolecular hydrogen and dust can be rather slowly consumed by star formation in\ndisk galaxies with counter-rotating gas disks (i.e., long gas depletion\ntimescale). Based on these results, we suggest that spiral and S0 galaxies with\ncounter-rotation can have rather low star formation rate for their gas\ndensities.

The carrier mobility is, however, degraded from the intrinsic\nlimit mainly due to short-range scattering caused by S vacancies formed during\nCVD growth. If the upper limit for the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 on oxide\nsubstrates is determined by the MoS2/substrate interaction during growth, it\nwill hinder the advantage. In this study, we investigated the interaction\nbetween monolayer MoS2 and a SiO2/Si substrate and the difference in\ncrystallinity between the top and bottom S surfaces due to the MoS2/substrate\ninteraction. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that doping and\nstrain were induced in MoS2 from the substrate, but they could be removed by\ntransferring MoS2 to a new substrate using polymers. The newly developed\npolymer-transfer technique enabled selective transfer of the bottom or top\nsurface of CVD-MoS2 onto a new SiO2/Si substrate. The metal-insulator\ntransition was clearly observed for both the normal and inverse transfers,\nsuggesting that the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 is high and that the\ncrystallinity of the bottom surface interacting with the substrate was similar\nto that of the top free surface. These results provide positive prospects for\nthe further improvement of the crystallinity of MoS2 on oxide substrates by\nreconsidering the growth conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 12:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

However, only for semimajor axes\nlonger than 40 000 au dynamically old comets are completely not present. We\ndemonstrated that the observed $1/a_{\\rm ori}$ distribution exhibits a local\nminimum separating dynamically new from dynamically old comets. Long-term\ndynamical studies reveal a large variety of orbital behaviour. Several\ninteresting examples of action of passing stars are also described, in\nparticular the impact of Gliese 710 which will pass close to the Sun in the\nfuture. However, none of the obtained stellar perturbations is sufficient to\nchange the dynamical status of analysed comets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 13:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Strong evidence is found that removal of\ndeuterons in the $m=0$ ($m=\\pm 1$) state from the beam leads to the formation\nof $^{14}$N states of established positive (negative) parity. As an\napplication, the removal cross-section functions allow to calculate $p_{zz}$\nachievable with carbon targets for initial beam energies $E_{\\rm in}$ between\n18.60 and 9.50\\,MeV and $E_{\\rm out}$ given by the areal target density. Carbon\nlayers in a sandwich technique would enable $p_{zz}$ between -0.4 and +0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 14:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

When this\ncylindrical section is pushed in the other direction, the bending direction can\nsuddenly reverse. This instability is called snap-through buckling and is one\nof the elementary shape transitions in a prestressed thin structure. Combining\nexperiments and theory, we study snap-buckling of an elastic strip with one end\nhinged and the other end clamped. These asymmetric boundary constraints break\nthe intrinsic symmetry of the strip, generating rich exotic mechanical\nbehaviors including largely hysteretic but reproducible force responses and\nswitch-like discontinuous shape changes. We establish the set of exact\nanalytical solutions that fully explain all of our major experimental and\nnumerical findings. Asymmetric boundary conditions arise naturally in diverse\nsituations when a thin object is in contact with a solid surface at one end,\nbut their profound consequences for the buckling mechanics have been largely\noverlooked to date.

Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were\ndiscovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are\nrelatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause white\ndwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially\noccur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single\nand/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions\nhave different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar\nmass explosions. Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic\nchemical signatures. Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected to be\nrarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar\nneighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker\nmetallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution of metalpoor\nsystems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Results. The model predicts a\nbutterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity\nand - at the same time - a decrease of [alpha/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than\nin the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed\nabundances in stars of Ursa Minor. Conclusions. The surprising agreement\nbetween our models and available observations provides a strong indication of\nthe origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia. This outcome requires\nconfirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in stars of other\nsatellite galaxies of ourMilkyWay. It will be vital for this project to measure\nnot the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the\nopposite; the metal-rich end of dwarf spheroidals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 14:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

For this\nreason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are\nnecessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori\nprojection.

The\ninfluence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions\nthat describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in\nthe bulk. These memory functions provide probes of near-steady state dynamics,\nrevealing information not easily accessible otherwise. We illustrate the method\non a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif to show that memory\nfunctions not only simplify the analysis of the subnetwork but also have a\nnatural interpretation. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate\nneural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network\ncomposed of four interacting transcription factors. The memory functions reveal\nthe function of specific links within the neural tube network and identify\nfeatures of the regulatory structure that specifically increase the robustness\nof the network to initial conditions.

In our scheme, imperfect\nnoisy entangled pairs of two qudits, i.e., two discrete-variable $d$-level\nsystems, each of, in principle, arbitrary dimension $d$, are initially shared\nbetween the intermediate stations of the channel. This is achieved via local,\nsufficiently strong light-matter interactions, involving optical coherent\nstates and their transmission after these interactions, and optical\nmeasurements on the transmitted field modes, especially (but not restricted to)\nefficient continuous-variable homodyne detections (\"hybrid\" here refers to the\nsimultaneous exploitation of discrete and continuous variable degrees of\nfreedom for the local processing and storage of entangled states as well as\ntheir non-local distribution, respectively). For qutrits we quantify the\nlight-matter entanglement that can be effectively shared through an elementary\nlossy channel, and for a repeater spacing of up to 10 km we show that the\nrealistic (lossy) qutrit entanglement is even larger than any ideal (loss-free)\nqubit entanglement. After including qudit entanglement purification and\nswapping procedures, we calculate the long-distance entangled-pair distribution\nrates and the final entangled-state fidelities for total communication\ndistances of up to 1280 km. With three rounds of purification, entangled qudit\npairs of near-unit fidelity can be distributed over 1280 km at rates of the\norder of, in principle, 100 Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

These\ndisturbances are found to be localized wave-like packets that originate just\nupstream of the ISW self-induced zone (for large enough $c$) of potentially\nunstable Richardson number, $Ri < 0.25$. They propagate through the base wave\nas coherent packets whose total energy gain increases rapidly with $c$. The\noptimal disturbances are also shown to be relevant to DJL solitary waves that\nhave been modified by viscosity representative of laboratory experiments. The\noptimal disturbances are compared to the local WKB approximation for spatially\ngrowing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves through the $Ri < 0.25$ zone.

The non-normal growth can be a\nsubstantial portion of the total gain, especially for ISWs that are weakly\nunstable to K-H waves. The linear evolution of Gaussian packets of linear free\nwaves with the same carrier frequency as the optimal disturbances is shown to\nresult in less energy gain than found for either the optimal perturbations or\nthe WKB approximation due to non-normal effects that cause absorption of\ndisturbance energy into the leading face of the wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

A\nduo is any two consecutive characters in a string and it is preserved in the\nmapping if its two consecutive characters in $s_1$ are mapped to same two\nconsecutive characters in $s_2$. The MDSM problem is known to be NP-hard and\nthere are approximation algorithms for this problem [3, 5, 13], but all of them\nconsider only the \"unweighted\" version of the problem in the sense that a duo\nfrom $s_1$ is preserved by mapping to any same duo in $s_2$ regardless of their\npositions in the respective strings. However, it is well-desired in comparative\ngenomics to find mappings that consider preserving duos that are \"closer\" to\neach other under some distance measure [19].

Invariant set theory is built on geometric properties of a compact\nfractal-like subset $I_U$ of cosmological state space on which the universe is\nassumed to evolve and from which the laws of physics are assumed to derive.\nConsistent with the primacy of $I_U$, a non-Euclidean (and hence non-classical)\nstate-space metric $g_p$ is defined, related to the $p$-adic metric of number\ntheory where $p$ is a large but finite Pythagorean prime. Uncertain states on\n$I_U$ are described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared\namplitudes are rational and corresponding complex phase angles are rational\nmultiples of $2 \\pi$. Such Hilbert states are necessarily $g_p$-distant from\nstates with either irrational squared amplitudes or irrational phase angles.\nThe gappy fractal nature of $I_U$ accounts for quantum complementarity and is\ncharacterised numerically by a generic number-theoretic incommensurateness\nbetween rational angles and rational cosines of angles. The Bell inequality,\nwhose violation would be inconsistent with local realism, is shown to be\n$g_p$-distant from all forms of the inequality that are violated in any\nfinite-precision experiment. The delayed-choice paradox is resolved through the\ncomputational irreducibility of $I_U$. The Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac equations\ndescribe evolution on $I_U$ in the singular limit at $p=\\infty$. By contrast,\nan extension of the Einstein field equations on $I_U$ is proposed which reduces\nsmoothly to general relativity as $p \\rightarrow \\infty$.

The electrons interact with the\natoms in the sample, which emit secondary electrons that contain information\nabout the surface topography and composition. The sample is scanned by the\nelectron beam point by point, until an image of the surface is formed. Since\nits invention in 1942, SEMs have become paramount in the discovery and\nunderstanding of the nanometer world, and today it is extensively used for both\nresearch and in industry. In principle, SEMs can achieve resolution better than\none nanometer. However, for many applications, working at sub-nanometer\nresolution implies an exceedingly large number of scanning points. For exactly\nthis reason, the SEM diagnostics of microelectronic chips is performed either\nat high resolution (HR) over a small area or at low resolution (LR) while\ncapturing a larger portion of the chip. Here, we employ sparse coding and\ndictionary learning to algorithmically enhance LR SEM images of microelectronic\nchips up to the level of the HR images acquired by slow SEM scans, while\nconsiderably reducing the noise. Our methodology consists of two steps: an\noffline stage of learning a joint dictionary from a sequence of LR and HR\nimages of the same region in the chip, followed by a fast-online\nsuper-resolution step where the resolution of a new LR image is enhanced. We\nprovide several examples with typical chips used in the microelectronics\nindustry, as well as a statistical study on arbitrary images with\ncharacteristic structural features.
