Capital flow constraint is different from traditional capacity\nconstraints: when a manufacturer launches production, its present capital\nshould not be less than its present total production cost; otherwise, it must\ndecrease production quantity or suspend production. Unsatisfied demand in one\nperiod may cause customer's demand to shrink in the next period considering\nloss of goodwill. Fixed loan can be adopted in the starting period for\nproduction. A mixed integer model for a deterministic single-item problem is\nconstructed. Based on the analysis about the structure of optimal solutions, we\napproximate it to a traveling salesman problem, and divide it into sub-linear\nprogramming problems without integer variables. A forward recursive algorithm\nwith heuristic adjustments is proposed to solve it. When unit variable\nproduction costs are equal and goodwill loss rate is zero, the algorithm can\nobtain optimal solutions. Under other situations, numerical comparisons with\nCPLEX 12.6.2 show our algorithm can reach optimal in most cases and has\ncomputation time advantage for large-size problems.

Analog to the weak variable-length source coding problem studied\nby Han (IEEE TIT, 2000, 46, 1217-1226), almost lossless source coding aims at\nrelaxing the lossless block-wise assumption to allow an average per-letter\ndistortion that vanishes asymptotically as the block-length tends to infinity.\nIn this setup, we show on one hand that Shannon entropy characterizes the\nminimum achievable rate (similarly to the case of finite alphabet sources)\nwhile on the other that almost lossless universal source coding becomes\nfeasible for the family of finite-entropy stationary memoryless sources with\ninfinite alphabets. Furthermore, we study a stronger notion of almost lossless\nuniversality that demands uniform convergence of the average per-letter\ndistortion to zero, where we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe so-called family of envelope distributions to achieve it. Remarkably, this\ncondition is the same necessary and sufficient condition needed for the\nexistence of a strongly minimax (lossless) universal source code for the family\nof envelope distributions. Finally, we show that an almost lossless coding\nscheme offers faster rate of convergence for the (minimax) redundancy compared\nto the well-known information radius developed for the lossless case at the\nexpense of tolerating a non-zero distortion that vanishes to zero as the\nblock-length grows. This shows that even when lossless universality is\nfeasible, an almost lossless scheme can offer different regimes on the rates of\nconvergence of the (worst case) redundancy versus the (worst case) distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 16:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 21:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

These flows are\nrarefied, within the slip and transitional flow regimes, which are beyond many\ntraditional computational fluid dynamic simulation schemes, such as those based\non the continuum flow assumption. The flows are very slow and thus many\ntraditional particle simulation methods suffer large statistical noises. The\nadopted method is a combination of particle and gas kinetic methods and it can\nsimulate micro-flows properly. The simulation results of mass flow rates have\nexcellent agreement with experimental measurements. In another case of 2D\nchannel, the DSBGK comparisons with the DSMC result and the solution of Shakhov\nequation are also in very good agreement. Another finding from this study is\nthat numerical simulations by including two reservoirs at the channel ends lead\nto appreciable differences in simulation results of velocity and pressure\ndistributions within the micro-channel. This is due to the inhaling and\nexhaling effects of reservoirs at the channel ends. Even though excluding those\nreservoirs may accelerate the simulations significantly by using a single\nchannel in simulations, special attentions are needed because this treatment\nmay over-simplify the problem, and some procedures and results may be\nquestionable.

Too\nthick and wide specimens cannot be processed all at once and must be cut into\nsmaller pieces. This dramatically increases the complexity of the problem,\nsince each piece should be individually and manually pre-aligned. To the best\nof our knowledge, no automatic method can reliably locate such piece of tissue\nwithin its respective whole in the MRI slice, and align it without any prior\ninformation. We propose here a novel automatic approach to the joint problem of\nmultimodal registration between histology and MRI, when only a fraction of\ntissue is available from histology. The approach relies on the representation\nof images using their level lines so as to reach contrast invariance. Shape\nelements obtained via the extraction of bitangents are encoded in a\nprojective-invariant manner, which permits the identification of common pieces\nof curves between two images. We evaluated the approach on human brain\nhistology and compared resulting alignments against manually annotated ground\ntruths. Considering the complexity of the brain folding patterns, preliminary\nresults are promising and suggest the use of characteristic and meaningful\nshape elements for improved robustness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 18:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

These include the strong coupling problem, the back reaction problem\nand also strong constraints due to Schwinger effect. We propose a model which\nresolves all these issues. In our model, the coupling function, $f$, grows\nduring inflation and transits to a decaying phase post inflation. This\nevolutionary behaviour is chosen so as to avoid the problem of strong coupling.\nBy assuming a suitable power law form of the coupling function, we can also\nneglect back reaction effects during inflation. To avoid back reaction\npost-inflation, we find that the reheating temperature is restricted to be\nbelow $ \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^4$ GeV. The magnetic energy spectrum is predicted\nto be non-helical and generically blue. The estimated present day magnetic\nfield strength and the corresponding coherence length taking reheating at the\nQCD epoch(150 MeV) are $ 1.4 \\times 10^{-12}$ G and $6.1 \\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc,\nrespectively.

By\ncombining a scaling analysis with numerical simulations, we confirm the\nexistence of a scaling law for the density of specular reflection points,\n$n_{spec}$, in two dimensions, given by $n_{spec}\\propto\\ell^{-1}$ in the limit\nof thin fluctuating interfaces with the interfacial thickness $\\ell\\ll\\xi_I$.\nThe density of specular reflections thus diverges for fluctuating interfaces in\nthe limit of vanishing thickness and shows no dependance on the interfacial\ncapillary-gravity correlation length $\\xi_I$. Although fluid membranes under\ntension also exhibit a divergence in\n$n_{spec}\\propto\\left(\\xi_M\\ell\\right)^{-1/2}$, the number of specular\nreflections in this case can grow by decreasing the membrane correlation length\n$\\xi_{M}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 23:56:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 15:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Recently it was demonstrated that the Bessel beam\n(BB) focused inside sapphire produced the cylindrical void being two orders of\nmagnitude larger than that generated by the GB [6-8]. Analysis of the\nexperimental data presented below allows making the remarkable conclusions\nbased solely on the void size measurements without any ad hoc assumptions about\nthe interaction process. First, the void size is direct evidence of strong\n(>40%) absorption of the pulse energy. Second, it is a direct experimental\nevidence of the high-energy concentration in the central spike of the focus.\nThe unique features of the intense Bessel beam interaction then allow\nunderstanding the experimental observation. This interaction generates early in\nthe pulse time the spatial distribution of excited permittivity changing from\npositive to negative values. Then the light interacts with\nzero-real-permittivity surface, separating plasma and dielectric areas, which\nleads to high energy concentration near the axis of cylindrical focus up to\nseveral MJ/cm3 (pressure range of 4-8 TPa). The effect depends on the angle\nbetween the permittivity gradient and the field polarisation. High pressure\ngenerates intense cylindrical shock/ rarefaction waves, which led to formation\nof void and compressed shell. We demonstrate that the Bessel beam proves to be\nan effective tool for producing extreme pressure/temperature conditions on the\nlaboratory tabletop. It appears that adjusting polarisation and permittivity\ngradient might be a novel way for increasing the maximum pressure.

However, the unbiased estimation of these network-specific\nspillover effects requires an often-violated assumption that researchers\nobserve all relevant networks. We show that, unlike conventional omitted\nvariable bias, bias due to unobserved networks remains even when treatment\nassignment is randomized and when unobserved networks and a network of interest\nare independently generated. We then develop parametric and nonparametric\nsensitivity analysis methods, with which researchers can assess the potential\ninfluence of unobserved networks on causal findings. We illustrate the proposed\nmethods with a simulation study based on a real-world Twitter network and an\nempirical application based on a network field experiment in China.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 03:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 02:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 06:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 04:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Deep learning based BIQA methods\nhave been attracting increasing attention in recent years, yet it remains a\ndifficult task to train a robust deep BIQA model because of the very limited\nnumber of training samples with human subjective scores. Most existing methods\nlearn a regression network to minimize the prediction error of a scalar image\nquality score. However, such a scheme ignores the fact that an image will\nreceive divergent subjective scores from different subjects, which cannot be\nadequately represented by a single scalar number. This is particularly true on\ncomplex, real-world distorted images. Moreover, images may broadly differ in\ntheir distributions of assigned subjective scores. Recognizing this, we propose\na new representation of perceptual image quality, called probabilistic quality\nrepresentation (PQR), to describe the image subjective score distribution,\nwhereby a more robust loss function can be employed to train a deep BIQA model.\nThe proposed PQR method is shown to not only speed up the convergence of deep\nmodel training, but to also greatly improve the achievable level of quality\nprediction accuracy relative to scalar quality score regression methods.

It is well known that when the potential\nis analytic, such systems have an approximate slow manifold that is defined up\nto terms that are exponentially small with respect to the scale separation\nparameter. The method of optimal balance relies on the observation that the\napproximate slow manifold remains an adiabatic invariant under slow\ndeformations of the nonlinear interactions. The method is formulated as a\nboundary value problem for a homotopic deformation of the system from a linear\nregime, where the slow-fast splitting is known exactly, to the full nonlinear\nregime. We show that, providing the ramp function which defines the homotopy is\nof Gevrey class 2 and satisfies vanishing conditions to all orders at the\ntemporal end points, the solution of the optimal balance boundary value problem\nyields a point on the approximate slow manifold that is exponentially close to\nthe approximation to the slow manifold via exponential asymptotics, albeit with\na smaller power of the small parameter in the exponent. In general, the order\nof accuracy of optimal balance is limited by the order of vanishing derivatives\nof the ramp function at the temporal end points.

This was obtained by Cantrell et al. (2010), as an\naverage of independent fits to $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band light curves. In this\nwork we perform an independent check on the value of $i$ by re-analyzing\nexisting YALO/SMARTS $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band photometry, using different\nmodeling software and fitting strategy. Performing a fit to the three light\ncurves simultaneously, we obtain a value for $i$ of $54.1\\pm1.1$ degrees,\nresulting in a black hole mass of $5.86\\pm0.24\\,$M$_{\\odot}$.

We conclude that the mass\ndetermination of this black hole may still be subject to systematic effects\nexceeding the statistical uncertainty. Obtaining more accurate masses would be\ngreatly helped by continuous phase-resolved spectroscopic observations\nsimultaneous with photometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 06:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

Here we investigate the volatility of\nSOA formed from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene upon ozone- and\nOH-induced oxidation, and the effect of OH-induced ageing on the initially\nproduced SOA. For all three terpenes, the ozone-induced SOA was less volatile\nthan the OH-induced SOA. The thermal properties of the SOA were described using\nthree parameters extracted from the volatility measurements: the temperature at\nwhich 50 per cent of the volume has evaporated (TVFR0.5), which is used as a\ngeneral volatility indicator; a slope factor (SVFR), which describes the\nvolatility distribution; and TVFR0.1, which measures the volatility of the\nleast volatile particle fraction. Limonene-derived SOA generally had higher\nTVFR0.5 values and shallower slopes than SOA derived from alpha- and\nbeta-pinene. This was especially true for the ozone-induced SOA, partially\nbecause the ozonolysis of limonene has a strong tendency to cause SOA formation\nand to produce extremely low volatility VOCs (ELVOCs). Ageing by OH exposure\ndid not reduce TVFR0.5 for any of the studied terpenes but did increase the\nbreadth of the volatility distribution by increasing the aerosols heterogeneity\nand contents of substances with different vapour pressures, also leading to\nincreases in TVFR0.1. This stands in contrast to previously reported results\nfrom smog chamber experiments, in which TVFR0.5 always increased with ageing.\nThese results demonstrate that there are two opposing processes that influence\nthe evolution of SOAs thermal properties as they age, and that results from\nboth flow reactors and static chambers are needed to fully understand the\ntemporal evolution of atmospheric SOA thermal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

As a result, the\nsurrounding gas is enriched in molecular ions, such as HCO$^{+}$ and\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly understood for\nClass 0 objects. Recently, based on Herschel observations taken as part of the\nkey program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS), a very\nlow HCO$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio of about 3-4, has been reported\ntoward the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. This finding suggests a cosmic-ray\nionization rate in excess of 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, much higher than the\ncanonical value of $\\zeta$ = 3$\\times$10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ (value expected in\nquiescent dense clouds). To assess the specificity of OMC-2 FIR4, we have\nextended this study to a sample of sources in low- and intermediate mass. More\nspecifically, we seek to measure the HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio\nfrom high energy lines (J $\\ge$ 6) toward this source sample in order to infer\nthe flux of energetic particles in the warm and dense gas surrounding the\nprotostars. We use observations performed with the Heterodyne Instrument for\nthe FarInfrared spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory toward a\nsample of 9 protostars. We report HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratios in\nthe range of 5 up to 73 toward our source sample. The large error bars do not\nallow us to conclude whether OMC-2~FIR4 is a peculiar source. Nonetheless, an\nimportant result is that the measured HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ ratio does not\nvary with the source luminosity. At the present time, OMC-2 FIR4 remains the\nonly source where a high flux of energetic particles is clearly evident. More\nsensitive and higher angular resolution observations are required to further\ninvestigate this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 09:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The underlying origin of such a\ngiant magnetoresistance is still under debate. Utilizing laser-based\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with high energy and momentum\nresolutions, we reveal the complete electronic structure of WTe2. This makes it\npossible to determine accurately the electron and hole concentrations and their\ntemperature dependence. We find that, with increasing the temperature, the\noverall electron concentration increases while the total hole concentration\ndecreases. It indicates that the electron-hole compensation, if it exists, can\nonly occur in a narrow temperature range, and in most of the temperature range\nthere is an electron-hole imbalance. Our results are not consistent with the\nperfect electron-hole compensation picture that is commonly considered to be\nthe cause of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2. We identified a flat band\nnear the Brillouin zone center that is close to the Fermi level and exhibits a\npronounced temperature dependence. Such a flat band can play an important role\nin dictating the transport properties of WTe2. Our results provide new insight\non understanding the origin of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 10:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

We study the optimal assignment of mobile users and tasks (with data\nreuse) systematically, under both information symmetry and asymmetry, depending\non whether the user cost and the task valuation are public information.

With the availability of very large networks in recent years,\nperformance and scalability of community detection algorithms become crucial,\ni.e. if time complexity of an algorithm is high, it can not run on large\nnetworks. In this paper, we propose a new community detection algorithm, which\nhas a local approach and is able to run on large networks.

This spurious trend reduces the fidelity to initial conditions and\nhas a great influence on the equilibrium climate after long simulation times.\nUseful insight on the nature of the climate drift can be obtained using two\nglobal metrics, i.e. the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and at\nthe ocean surface. The former is an indicator of the limitations within a given\nclimate model, at the level of both numerical implementation and physical\nparameterisations, while the latter is an indicator of the goodness of the\ntuning procedure. Using the MIT general circulation model, we construct\ndifferent configurations with various degree of complexity (i.e. different\nparameterisations for the bulk cloud albedo, inclusion or not of friction\nheating, different bathymetry configurations) to which we apply the same tuning\nprocedure in order to obtain control runs for fixed external forcing where the\nclimate drift is minimised. We find that the interplay between tuning procedure\nand different configurations of the same climate model provides crucial\ninformation on the stability of the control runs and on the goodness of a given\nparameterisation. This approach is particularly relevant for constructing\ngood-quality control runs of the geological past where huge uncertainties are\nfound in both initial and boundary conditions. We will focus on robust results\nthat can be generally applied to other climate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 15:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

A multi-module arrangement can be implemented by\nusing up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision measurements of\nbiomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are\nmagnetorelaxometry and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR),\nwhere pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are typically applied. The system is\noperated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped with 18\nmagnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) wire-wound pick-up coils. A total of\n16 small pick-up coils with 17.1 mm diameter form a regular grid with\nindividual channels arranged to ensure system sensitivity covers all three\northogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal pick-up coils with an\nequivalent diameter of 74.5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at\ntwo different heights and are suitable for the detection of deep sources. Each\ncoil is connected to the input of a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a\ndetachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped with integrated\ninput current limiters. Feedback into the pick-up coils minimizes crosstalk\nbetween channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting\nshield of Nb. The field distortion of the prototype and a multi-module\narrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured noise of the\nsmall magnetometers was between 0.6 and 1.5 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$, and well below 1\nfT/Hz$^{1/2}$ for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a\nminimum noise level of 0.54 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. We performed ULF NMR experiments,\nverifying the system's robustness against pulsed fields, and\nmagnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The\nlow noise performance of our 18-channel prototype enabled the detection of\nhigh-frequency components at around 1 kHz by MEG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 15:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Exploiting the ability of\nSpherical Harmonics (SH) to model spherical functions, we propose a new\nreconstruction model for DMRI data which is able to estimate both the fiber\nOrientation Distribution Function (fODF) and the relative volume fractions of\nthe neurites in each voxel, which is robust to multiple fiber crossings. We\nconsider a Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) inspired\nsingle fiber diffusion signal to be derived from three compartments:\nintracellular, extracellular, and cerebrospinal fluid. The model, called\nNODDI-SH, is derived by convolving the single fiber response with the fODF in\neach voxel. NODDI-SH embeds the calculation of the fODF and the neurite density\nin a unified mathematical model providing efficient, robust and accurate\nresults. Results were validated on simulated data and tested on\n\\textit{in-vivo} data of human brain, and compared to and Constrained Spherical\nDeconvolution (CSD) for benchmarking.
