The models differ in their assumptions and the\ninterpretation of the results. The model choice depends on the objective of the\nanalysis and knowledge of the included studies. Fixed effect models are often\nused because there are too few studies with which to estimate the between-study\nstandard deviation from the data alone. Objectives: The aim is to propose a\nframework for eliciting an informative prior distribution for the between-study\nstandard deviation in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis model to\ngenuinely represent heterogeneity when data are sparse. Methods: We developed\nan elicitation method using external information such as empirical evidence and\nexperts' beliefs on the 'range' of treatment effects in order to infer the\nprior distribution for the between-study standard deviation. We also developed\nthe method to be implemented in R. Results: The three-stage elicitation\napproach allows uncertainty to be represented by a genuine prior distribution\nto avoid making misleading inferences. It is flexible to what judgments an\nexpert can provide, and is applicable to all types of outcome measure for which\na treatment effect can be constructed on an additive scale. Conclusions: The\nchoice between using a fixed effect or random effects meta-analysis model\ndepends on the inferences required and not on the number of available studies.\nOur elicitation framework captures external evidence about heterogeneity and\novercomes the often implausible assumption that studies are estimating the same\ntreatment effect, thereby improving the quality of inferences in decision\nmaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 16:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

We perform\natomistic molecular dynamics simulations on three protein-water systems namely,\nLysozyme, Myoglobin and sweet protein Monellin. In these experiments we mutate\nthe charges of the neighbouring amino acid side chains of certain natural\nprobes (Tryptophan) and also freeze the side chain motions. In order to\ndistinguish between different contributions, we decompose the total solvation\nenergy response in terms of various components present in the system. This\nallows us to capture the interplay among different self and cross-energy\ncorrelation terms. Freezing the protein motions removes the slowest component\nthat results from side chain fluctuations, but a part of slowness remains. This\nleads to the conclusion that the slow component in the ~20-80 ps range arises\nfrom slow water molecules present in the hydration layer. While the more than\n100 ps component may arise from various sources namely, adjacent charges in\namino acid side chains, the water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to them\nand a dynamically coupled motion between side chain and water. The charges, in\naddition, enforce a structural ordering of nearby water molecules and helps to\nform local long-lived hydrogen bonded network. Further separation of the\nspatial and temporal responses in solvation dynamics reveals different roles of\nhydration and bulk water.

Quantifying the level of\nassortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with\ndifferent attributes) can shed light on the factors involved in the formation\nof links and contagion processes in complex networks. It is common practice to\nmeasure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient,\nor modularity in the case of discrete-valued metadata.

However, these analyses may be sensitive to\nsampling biases in both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and\ninteractions (the links between nodes). These issues may affect the accuracy of\nempirically constructed ecological networks. We explore the properties of\nsampled ecological networks by simulating large-scale ecological networks with\npredetermined topologies, and sampling them with different mathematical\nprocedures. Several types of modular networks were generated, intended to\nrepresent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of\necological interactions. We sampled these networks with different sampling\ndesigns that may be encountered in field experiments. The observed networks\ngenerated by each sampling process were analyzed with respect to number and\nsize of components. We show that the sampling effort needed to estimate\nunderlying network properties depends both on the sampling design and on\nnetwork topology. Networks with random or scale-free modules require more\ncomplete sampling compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite.\nOverall, the structure of nested modules was the easiest to detect, regardless\nof sampling design. Sampling according to species degree was consistently found\nto be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure. Conversely,\nsampling according to module results in an accurate view of certain modules,\nbut fails to provide a global picture of the underlying network.

Once in a STEM field,\nacademic and social integration has been long thought to be important for\nstudents' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the\nrelative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open\nissue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall\nin the \"middle of the pack,\" the out-of-class network is the most significant\npredictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with\nAkaike's information criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades,\nand other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and bottom), final\ngrade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence---these students\nare likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they\npersist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class\ncloseness---a measure of one's immersion in the network---helps predict\npersistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it\nsuggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient\nin-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or\nbecome committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through\nattrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students'\npersistence in STEM majors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 20:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 16:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

We hypothesize that\nthese planets formed early and consider the problem of matching planet\nformation theory to the current observations. Two scenarios, disk migration and\nin-situ formation, have been proposed to explain their origin. In the migration\nscenario planets migrate inward due to planet-disk interaction, whereas in the\nin-situ scenario planets assemble locally. Therefore, planets formed by\nmigration are expected to end up in resonances, whereas those formed in-situ\nare expected to stay in short period ratios and in non-resonant orbits. Both\npredictions are at odds with observations. Aims. We investigate whether a\npreferred formation scenario can be identified through a comparison between the\nmagnetospheric rebound model and the Kepler data. Methods. We conduct N-body\nsimulations of two-planet systems during the disk dispersal phase, and make a\nstatistical comparison between the simulations and the Kepler observations.\nResults. Comparing the two scenarios, we find that magnetospheric rebound tends\nto erase the difference in the orbital configuration that was initially\npresented. After disk dispersal, not all planets are in resonance in the\nmigration scenario, whereas planets do not remain in compact configurations in\nthe in-situ scenario. In both scenarios, the orbits of planets increase with\nthe cavity expansion, and their period ratios have a wider distribution.\nConclusions. From a statistical perspective, the magnetospheric rebound model\nreproduces several observed properties of Kepler planets, such as the\nsignificant number of planets are not in resonances and planet pairs can end up\nat large period ratios. The disparity in orbital configuration between the two\nformation scenarios is substantially reduced after disk dispersal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 18:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

While the gravitational effects of baryon\nfluctuations are compensated by those of DM, leaving no observable impacts on\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) at first order, they modulate the sound\nhorizon at recombination, thereby correlating CMB anisotropies at different\nmultipoles. As a result, CIPs can be reconstructed using quadratic estimators\nsimilarly to CMB detection of gravitational lensing. Because of these\nsimilarities, however, the CIP estimators are biased with lensing contributions\nthat must be subtracted. These lensing contributions for CMB polarization\nmeasurement of CIPs are found to roughly triple the noise power of the total\nCIP estimator on large scales. In addition, the cross power with temperature\nand $E$-mode polarization are contaminated by lensing-ISW (integrated\nSachs-Wolfe) correlations and reionization-lensing correlations respectively.\nFor a cosmic-variance-limited (CVL) temperature and polarization experiment\nmeasuring out to multipoles $l_{\\max} = 2500$, the lensing noise raises the\ndetection threshold by a factor of 1.5, leaving a $2.7\\sigma$ detection\npossible for the maximal CIP signal in the curvaton model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 18:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

First, the network stays secure. In particular, the fraction of\nidentities in the system that are controlled by an attacker is always less than\n1/2. Second, our protocol's computational cost is commensurate with the cost of\nan attacker.

We find that when optimizing for the True Skill\nScore (TSS), photospheric vector magnetic field data combined with flaring\nhistory yields the best performance, and when optimizing for the area under the\nprecision-recall curve, all the data are helpful. Our model performance yields\na TSS of $0.84 \\pm 0.03$ and $0.81 \\pm 0.03$ in the $T$ = 2 and 24 hour cases,\nrespectively, and a value of $0.13 \\pm 0.07$ and $0.43 \\pm 0.08$ for the area\nunder the precision-recall curve in the $T$ = 2 and 24 hour cases,\nrespectively.

Different sublattice rotation and structure are allowed. Linear\nFloquet bands are constructed for intricate sublattice rotation patterns such\nas counter rotation, phase offset rotation, as well as different lattice sizes\nand frequencies. An asymptotic analysis of the edge modes, valid in a\nrapid-spiraling regime, reveals linear and nonlinear envelopes which are\ngoverned by linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, respectively. Nonlinear\nstates, referred to as topologically protected edge solitons are unidirectional\nedge modes. Direct numerical simulations for both the linear and nonlinear edge\nstates agree with the asymptotic theory. Topologically protected modes are\nfound; they possess unidirectionality and do not scatter at lattice defect\nboundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 23:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

We study the\neffect of deformability of the bubbles on the overall drag induced by the\ncarrier fluid in the two-phase system. We find that an increase in\ndeformability of the bubbles results in enhanced drag reduction due to a more\npronounced accumulation of the deformed bubbles near the driving inner wall.\nThis preferential accumulation is induced by an increase in the resistance on\nthe motion of the bubbles in the wall-normal direction. The increased\nresistance is linked to the strong deformation of the bubbles near the wall\nwhich makes them prolate (stretched along one axes) and orient along the\nstream-wise direction. A larger concentration of the bubbles near the driving\nwall implies that they are more effective in weakening the plume ejections\nwhich results in stronger drag reduction effects.

Geometric methods divide a grid by using a location of a cell\nwhile topological methods work with connectivity of cells, which is generally\ndescribed as a graph. This paper introduces a Hilbert space-filling curve\nmethod. A space-filling curve is a continuous curve and defines a map between a\none-dimensional space and a multi-dimensional space. A Hilbert space-filling\ncurve is one special space-filling curve discovered by Hilbert and has many\nuseful characteristics, such as good locality, which means that two objects\nthat are close to each other in a multi-dimensional space are also close to\neach other in a one dimensional space. This property can model communications\nin grid-based parallel applications. The idea of the Hilbert space-filling\ncurve method is to map a computational domain into a one-dimensional space,\npartition the one-dimensional space to certain intervals, and assign all cells\nin a same interval to a MPI. To implement a load balancing method, a mapping\nkernel is required to convert high-dimensional coordinates to a scalar value\nand an efficient one-dimensional partitioning module that divides a\none-dimensional space and makes sure that all intervals have a similar\nworkload.\n  The Hilbert space-filling curve method is compared with ParMETIS, a famous\ngraph partitioning package.

To obtain this important location parameter many other\nindirect methods have been developed based on different assumptions. Here we\npresent a scanning method to derive the paleo-longitude from the usual\npaleo-magnetic measurements. This method takes into account the contributions\nto the Earth's magnetic potential from additional dipoles with their axes in\nthe equatorial plane, which were omitted by the traditional paleo-magnetism. In\nthis method, firstly we assume that $\\theta_p$ and $\\lambda_p$ are accurate (or\ndetermined well enough), and define a cost function; And secondly we minimize\nthis function by systematically searching through all longitudes and latitudes\nin their domain; Finally when a local minima of this cost function reaches, the\ncorresponding longitude is the paleo-longitude that we look for. Simultaneously\nthe paleo-latitude is obtained. Synthetic experiments show that this method\nworks very well when there are no errors in the geomagntic measurements\n(Components of magnetic field: $B_x, B_y, B_z$, or declination $D$ and\ninclination $I$).

To rationalise these\nfindings, we study here the triad truncations of polynomial and Gaussian GNS\nmodels focusing on modes lying in the energy injection range. Identifying a\npreviously unknown cubic invariant, we show that the asymptotic triad dynamics\nreduces to that of a forced rigid body coupled to a particle moving in a\nmagnetic field. This analogy allows us to classify triadic interactions by\ntheir asymptotic stability: unstable triads correspond to rigid-body forcing\nalong the largest and smallest principal axes, whereas stable triads arise from\nforcing along the middle axis. Analysis of the polynomial GNS model reveals\nthat unstable triads induce exponential growth of energy and helicity, whereas\nstable triads develop a limit cycle of bounded energy and helicity. This\nsuggests that the unstable triads dominate the initial relaxation stage of the\nfull hydrodynamic equations, whereas the stable triads determine the\nstatistically stationary state. To test this hypothesis, we introduce and\ninvestigate the Gaussian active turbulence model, which develops a\nKolmogorov-type $-5/3$ energy spectrum at large wavelengths. Similar to the\npolynomial case, the steady-state chaotic flows spontaneously accumulate\nnon-zero mean helicity while exhibiting Beltrami statistics and upward energy\ntransport. Our results suggest that self-sustained Beltrami-type flows and an\ninverse energy cascade may be generic features of 3D active turbulence models\nwith flow-dependent spectral forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 06:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

The cognitive\ncapability of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is close to the human\nvisual level because of hierarchical coding directly from raw image. Owing to\nits superiority in feature representation, DCNN has exhibited remarkable\nperformance in scene recognition of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS)\nimages and classification of hyper-spectral remote sensing images. In-depth\ninvestigation is still essential for understanding why DCNN can accurately\nidentify diverse ground objects via its effective feature representation. Thus,\nwe train the deep neural network called AlexNet on our large scale remote\nsensing image recognition benchmark. At the neuron level in each convolution\nlayer, we analyze the general properties of DCNN in HRRS image recognition by\nuse of a framework of visual stimulation-characteristic response combined with\nfeature coding-classification decoding. Specifically, we use histogram\nstatistics, representational dissimilarity matrix, and class activation mapping\nto observe the selective and invariance representations of DCNN in HRRS image\nrecognition. We argue that selective and invariance representations play\nimportant roles in remote sensing images tasks, such as classification,\ndetection, and segment.

This inequality is proven via a contradiction argument\nand thus not explicitly. An explicit method of proof, however, is provided for\na specific application modelling a reversible enzyme reaction by exploiting the\nspecific structure of the conservation laws.\n  Our approach is also useful to study the trend to equilibrium for systems\npossessing boundary equilibria. More precisely, to show the convergence to\nequilibrium for systems with boundary equilibria, we establish a sufficient\ncondition in terms of a modified finite dimensional inequality along\ntrajectories of the system. By assuming this condition, which roughly means\nthat the system produces too much entropy to stay close to a boundary\nequilibrium for infinite time, the entropy method shows exponential convergence\nto equilibrium for renormalised solutions to complex balanced systems with\nboundary equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 09:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The Wigner distribution function (WDF) is determined\nfrom the single particle density matrix in the ballistic regime, i.e.,\ncollision effects are excluded. The single particle transport equation is\nestablished with the electric field described in the vector potential gauge,\nand the magnetic field is treated in the symmetric gauge.\n  The general approach is to employ the accelerated Bloch state representation\n(ABR) as a basis so that the dependence upon the electric field, including\nmultiband Zener tunneling, is treated exactly. In the formulation of the WDF,\nwe transform to a new set of variables so that the final WDF is gauge invariant\nand is expressed explicitly in terms of the position, kinetic momentum, and\ntime.\n  The methodology for developing the WDF is illustrated by deriving the exact\nWDF equation for free electrons in homogeneous electric and magnetic fields.\nThe methodology is then extended to the case of electrons described by an\neffective Hamiltonian corresponding to an arbitrary energy band function. In\ntreating the problem of Bloch electrons in a periodic potential, the\nmethodology for deriving the WDF reveals a multiband character due to the\ninherent nature of the Bloch states. In examining the single-band WDF, it is\nfound that the collisionless WDF equation matches the equivalent Boltzmann\ntransport equation to first order in the magnetic field. These results are\nnecessarily extended to second order in the magnetic field by employing a\nunitary transformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian using the ABR to\nsecond order.

To find such a\ngrouping, it is useful to evaluate to what extent the units of the system are\nseparable. Separability or inseparability can be evaluated by quantifying how\nmuch information would be lost if the system were partitioned into subsystems,\nand the interactions between the subsystems were hypothetically removed. A\nsystem of two independent subsystems are completely separable without any loss\nof information while a system of strongly interacted subsystems cannot be\nseparated without a large loss of information. Among all the possible\npartitions of a system, the partition that minimizes the loss of information,\ncalled the Minimum Information Partition (MIP), can be considered as the\noptimal partition for characterizing the underlying structures of the system.\nAlthough the MIP would reveal novel characteristics of the neural system, an\nexhaustive search for the MIP is numerically intractable due to the\ncombinatorial explosion of possible partitions.

Here, rutile is studied by using first-principles calculations, in\norder to unravel the microscopic origins of the diverse diffusion behaviors for\ndifferent doping elements. Anomalous diffusion behavior in the open channel\nalong [001] direction is found: larger atoms include Sc and Zr have lower\nenergy barrier for diffusion via interstitial mechanism, apparently\ncontradicting their known slow diffusion rate. To resolve this, we present an\nalternate model for the overall diffusion rate of the large-size dopants in\nrutile, showing that parallel to the [001] channel, it is limited by the\nformation of the interstitial states, whereas in the direction perpendicular to\n[001], it proceeds via a kick-out mechanism. By contrast, Co and Ni, prefer to\nstay in the interstitial site of rutile, and have conventional diffusion with a\nvery small migration barrier in the [001] channel.

This splitting allows a decomposition of the pathwise rate\nfunction into three terms, which have physical interpretations in terms of\ndissipation and convergence to equilibrium. Similar decompositions hold for\nrate functions at level 2 and level 2.5. These results clarify how bounds on\nentropy production and fluctuation theorems emerge from the underlying\ndynamical rules. We discuss how these results for Markov chains are related to\nsimilar structures within Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, which describes\nhydrodynamic limits of such microscopic models.c Fluctuation Theory, which\ndescribes hydrodynamic limits of such microscopic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 11:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 13:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to\noutperform traditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensional\nrepresentations and high computational complexity may seriously limit their\napplicability in practice. For multi-modal feature fusion, here we develop a\nMulti-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently and\neffectively combine multi-modal features, which results in superior performance\nfor VQA compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. For fine-grained image\nand question representation, we develop a co-attention mechanism using an\nend-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image and\nquestion attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attention\nlearning in a new network architecture provides a unified model for VQA. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the single MFB with co-attention model\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on the real-world VQA dataset.

However, state-of-the-art solvers for CHCs\n(CHC solvers) based on predicate abstraction are sometimes unable to verify\nsatisfiability because they look for models that are definable in a given class\nA of constraints, called A-definable models. We introduce a transformation\ntechnique, called Predicate Pairing (PP), which is able, in many interesting\ncases, to transform a set of clauses into an equisatisfiable set whose\nsatisfiability can be proved by finding an A-definable model, and hence can be\neffectively verified by CHC solvers. We prove that, under very general\nconditions on A, the unfold/fold transformation rules preserve the existence of\nan A-definable model, i.e., if the original clauses have an A-definable model,\nthen the transformed clauses have an A-definable model. The converse does not\nhold in general, and we provide suitable conditions under which the transformed\nclauses have an A-definable model iff the original ones have an A-definable\nmodel. Then, we present the PP strategy which guides the application of the\ntransformation rules with the objective of deriving a set of clauses whose\nsatisfiability can be proved by looking for A-definable models. PP introduces a\nnew predicate defined by the conjunction of two predicates together with some\nconstraints. We show through some examples that an A-definable model may exist\nfor the new predicate even if it does not exist for its defining atomic\nconjuncts. We also present some case studies showing that PP plays a crucial\nrole in the verification of relational properties of programs (e.g., program\nequivalence and non-interference). Finally, we perform an experimental\nevaluation to assess the effectiveness of PP in increasing the power of CHC\nsolving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 12:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

Due\nto the development of more realistic models of galaxy formation, viable\nscenarios are emerging to explain cosmic magnetism, thanks to both deeper\nobservations and more efficient and accurate computer simulations. We present\nhere a new cosmological high-resolution zoom-in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation, using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, of a dwarf\ngalaxy with an initially weak and uniform magnetic seed field that is amplified\nby a small-scale dynamo driven by supernova-induced turbulence. As first\nstructures form from the gravitational collapse of small density fluctuations,\nthe frozen-in magnetic field separates from the cosmic expansion and grows\nthrough compression. In a second step, star formation sets in and establishes a\nstrong galactic fountain, self-regulated by supernova explosions. Inside the\ngalaxy, the interstellar medium becomes highly turbulent, dominated by strong\nsupersonic shocks, as demonstrated by the spectral analysis of the gas kinetic\nenergy. In this turbulent environment, the magnetic field is quickly amplified\nvia a small-scale dynamo process and is finally carried out into the\ncircumgalactic medium by a galactic wind. This realistic cosmological\nsimulation explains how initially weak magnetic seed fields can be amplified\nquickly in early, feedback-dominated galaxies, and predicts, as a consequence\nof the small scale dynamo process, that high-redshift magnetic fields are\nlikely to be dominated by their small scale components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 13:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

When a\nnew individual is born, with a small probability a mutation occurs, i.e. the\noffspring has different genotype as the parent. The novel aspect of the models\nwe study is that an individual with a given genotype may express a certain set\nof different phenotypes, and during its lifetime it may switch between\ndifferent phenotypes, with rates that are much larger then the mutation rates\nand that, moreover, may depend on the state of the entire population.

The Bayesian Photometric\nRedshift (BPZ) code is used to assign galaxies to four redshift bins between\nz=0.2 and 1.3, and to produce initial estimates of the lensing-weighted\nredshift distributions $n^i_{PZ}(z)$ for bin i. Accurate determination of\ncosmological parameters depends critically on knowledge of $n^i$ but is\ninsensitive to bin assignments or redshift errors for individual galaxies. The\ncosmological analyses allow for shifts $n^i(z)=n^i_{PZ}(z-\\Delta z^i)$ to\ncorrect the mean redshift of $n^i(z)$ for biases in $n^i_{\\rm PZ}$. The $\\Delta\nz^i$ are constrained by comparison of independently estimated 30-band\nphotometric redshifts of galaxies in the COSMOS field to BPZ estimates made\nfrom the DES griz fluxes, for a sample matched in fluxes, pre-seeing size, and\nlensing weight to the DES weak-lensing sources.

By using aspects of\nboth methods, our algorithm is robust towards noise variables and is capable of\nperforming outlier detection in multi-group situations. We are further not\nreliant on a specific underlying data distribution.\n  For each observation of a dataset, we identify a local group of dense nearby\nobservations, which we call a core, based on a modification of the k-nearest\nneighbours algorithm. By projecting the dataset onto the space spanned by those\nobservations, two aspects are revealed.

Second, we consider the distance of the observation to the\nprojection space in order to assess the suitability of the core for describing\nthe outlyingness of the observation.

Based on the analysis of both structure and energy of the system, it is\nfound that fullerene formation occurs in two stages. Firstly, fast\ntransformation of the initial amorphous structure into a hollow sp$^2$ shell\nwith a few chains attached occurs with a considerable decrease of the potential\nenergy and the number of atoms belonging to chains and to the amorphous domain.\nThen, insertion of remaining carbon chains into the sp$^2$ network takes place\nat the same time with the fullerene shell formation. Two types of defects\nremaining after the formation of the fullerene shell are revealed: 7-membered\nrings and single one-coordinated atoms. One of the fullerene structures\nobtained contains no defects at all, which demonstrates that defect-free carbon\ncages can be occasionally formed from amorphous precursors directly without\ndefect healing. No structural changes are observed after the fullerene\nformation, suggesting that defect healing is a slow process in comparison with\nthe fullerene shell formation.

As Czech\nresearchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the\nancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys\nwere made by means of magnetic compasses, we can find the axes of the complexes\ndeviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic\ndeclination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this\nidea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of\nmagnetic compasses, concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the\nMing dynasty, a method based on the magnetic compasses. The architects of the\nantecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 14:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

In particular, it could be used to\ncreate an elastic wave cloak, shielding an interior region against elastic\nwaves while simultaneously preventing scattering in the outside domain.\nHowever, as a true elastic wave cloak would generally require nonphysical\nmaterials with stiffness tensors lacking the minor symmetry (implying\nasymmetric stress), the utility of such an elastic wave cloak has thus far been\nlimited. Here we develop a means of overcoming this limitation via the\ndevelopment of a symmetrized elastic cloak, sacrificing some of the performance\nof the perfect cloak for the sake of restoring the minor symmetry. We test the\nperformance of the symmetrized elastic cloak for shielding a tunnel against\nseismic waves, showing that it can be used to reduce the average displacement\nwithin the tunnel by an order of magnitude (and reduce energy by two orders of\nmagnitude) for waves above a critical frequency of the cloak. This critical\nfrequency, which corresponds to the generation of surface waves at the\ncloak-interior interface, can be used to develop a simple heuristic model of\nthe symmetrized elastic cloak's performance for a generic problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 20:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 00:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}
