The first trend is the development of self-driving vehicles.\nThis highly-anticipated shift from human- to autonomous-drivers is expected to\noffer substantial benefits for traffic throughput by streamlining large-scale\ncollective behavior. The second trend is the widespread hacking of\nInternet-connected devices, which as of 2015, includes vehicles. While the\nfirst proof-of-concept automobile hack was done at the single-vehicle scale,\nundesirable collective effects can easily arise if this activity becomes more\ncommon. Motivated by these two trends, we explore the phenomena that arise in\nan active matter model with lanes and lane-changing behavior. Our model\nincorporates a simplified minimal description of essential differences between\nhuman- and autonomous-drivers. We study the emergent collective behavior as the\npopulation of vehicles shifts from all-human to all-autonomous. Within the\ncontext of our model, we explore a worst-case scenario where Internet-connected\nautonomous vehicles are disabled simultaneously and \\textit{en masse}. Our\napproach reveals a model-independent role for percolation in interpreting the\nresults. A broad lesson our work highlights is that seemingly minor malicious\nactivity can ultimately have major impacts when magnified through the action of\ncollective behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 16:01:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 07:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

The objective of the evacuation problem is to\ndesign an algorithm which minimizes the evacuation time of both the robots. For\nthe wireless communication model, we propose a generic algorithm for two robots\nmoving to two points on the perimeter with an initial separation of $\\zeta \\leq\nd$.

This represents a nascent research topic in computer vision. The\ntechnical contributions of this work are three-fold. First, the model is\nlearned and evaluated on real human driving videos that are time-synchronized\nwith other vehicle sensors. This differs from many prior models trained from\nsynthetic data in racing games. Second, state-of-the-art models, such as\nPilotNet, mostly predict the wheel angles independently on each video frame,\nwhich contradicts common understanding of driving as a stateful process.\nInstead, our proposed model strikes a combination of spatial and temporal cues,\njointly investigating instantaneous monocular camera observations and vehicle's\nhistorical states. This is in practice accomplished by inserting\ncarefully-designed recurrent units (e.g., LSTM and Conv-LSTM) at proper network\nlayers. Third, to facilitate the interpretability of the learned model, we\nutilize a visual back-propagation scheme for discovering and visualizing image\nregions crucially influencing the final steering prediction. Our experimental\nstudy is based on about 6 hours of human driving data provided by Udacity.\nComprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our model, even under scenarios like drastic lighting changes and\nabrupt turning. The comparison with other state-of-the-art models clearly\nreveals its superior performance in predicting the due wheel angle for a\nself-driving car.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 17:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

Finite dimensional systems have\nhistorically been an issue. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 180401 and\nPhys. Rev.

In doing so we complete the phase-space\nformulation of quantum mechanics -- extending work by Wigner, Weyl, Moyal, and\nothers to any quantum system. This work is structured in three parts. Firstly\nwe provide a brief modernized discussion of the general framework of\nphase-space quantum mechanics. We extend previous work and show how this leads\nto a framework that can describe any system in phase space -- putting it for\nthe first time on a truly equal footing to Schr\\\"odinger's and Heisenberg's\nformulation of quantum mechanics. Importantly, we do this in a way that\nrespects the unifying principles of \"parity\" and \"displacement\" in a natural\nbroadening of previously developed phase space concepts and methods. Secondly\nwe consider how this framework is realized for different quantum systems; in\nparticular we consider the proper construction of Weyl functions for some\nexample finite dimensional systems.

Using algebraic relationships between regression\nparameters in different dimensions, we specify a set of moment equations for\nestimating parameters of a maximal model through information available from\nsets of parameter estimates from a series of reduced models available from the\ndifferent studies. The specification of the equations requires a reference\ndataset to estimate the joint distribution of the covariates.

Here, we analyze how motion of individuals affects constant\nselection in structured populations. Motion is relevant because it leads to\nchanges in the distribution of types as mutations march toward fixation or\nextinction. We describe motion as the swapping of individuals on graphs, and\nmore generally as the shuffling of individuals between reproductive updates.\nBeginning with a one-dimensional graph, the cycle, we prove that motion\nsuppresses natural selection for death-birth updating or for any process that\ncombines birth-death and death-birth updating. If the rule is purely\nbirth-death updating, no change in fixation probability appears in the presence\nof motion. We further investigate how motion affects evolution on the square\nlattice and weighted graphs. In the case of weighted graphs we find that motion\ncan be either an amplifier or a suppressor of natural selection. In some cases,\nwhether it is one or the other can be a function of the relative reproductive\nrate, indicating that motion is a subtle and complex attribute of evolving\npopulations. As a first step towards understanding less restricted types of\nmotion in evolutionary graph theory, we consider a similar rule on dynamic\ngraphs induced by a spatial flow and find qualitatively similar results\nindicating that continuous motion also suppresses natural selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 20:32:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 17:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

However, the definition of multivariate measures of redundancy that\ncomply with nonnegativity and conform to certain axioms that capture\nconceptually desirable properties of redundancy has proven to be elusive. We\nhere present a procedure to determine nonnegative multivariate redundancy\nmeasures, within the maximum entropy framework. In particular, we generalize\nexisting bivariate maximum entropy measures of redundancy and unique\ninformation, defining measures of the redundant information that a group of\nvariables has about a target, and of the unique redundant information that a\ngroup of variables has about a target that is not redundant with information\nfrom another group. The two key ingredients for this approach are: First, the\nidentification of a type of constraints on entropy maximization that allows\nisolating components of redundancy and unique redundancy by mirroring them to\nsynergy components. Second, the construction of rooted tree-based\ndecompositions of the mutual information, which conform to the axioms of the\nredundancy lattice by the local implementation at each tree node of binary\nunfoldings of the information using hierarchically related maximum entropy\nconstraints.

Modeling the network\nbased on stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic\nspectral efficiency as a function of the system parameters. Leveraging the\nobtained expressions, we formulate feedback partition problems and obtain\nsolutions to improve the ergodic spectral efficiency. Simulations show the\nspectral efficiency improvement by using the obtained feedback partitions. Our\nmajor findings are as follows: 1) In the non-cooperative case, the feedback is\nonly useful in a particular tier if the mean interference is small enough. 2)\nIn the cooperative case, allocating more feedback to stronger intra-cluster BSs\nis efficient. 3) In both cases, the obtained solutions do not change depending\non instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 06:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 06:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

We set up a discrete wave equation with plastic strain rate as a\nsource term and include the Rayleigh-dissipation function to represent\ndissipation accompanying acoustic emission. We devise a method of bridging the\nwidely separated time scales of plastic deformation and elastic degrees of\nfreedom. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated by considering three\ndistinct cases of plastic deformation. The first one is the acoustic emission\nduring a typical continuous yield exhibiting a smooth stress-strain curve. We\nfirst construct an appropriate set of evolution equations for two types of\ndislocation densities and then show that the shape of the model stress-strain\ncurve and accompanying acoustic emission spectrum match very well with\nexperimental results. The second and the third are the more complex cases of\nthe Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and the L\\\"uders band. These two cases are\ndealt with in the context of the Ananthakrishna model since the model predicts\nthe three types of the Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and also L\\\"uders-like\nbands. Our results show that for the type-C bands where the serration amplitude\nis large, the acoustic emission spectrum consists of well-separated bursts of\nacoustic emission. At higher strain rates of hopping type-B bands, the\nburst-type acoustic emission spectrum tends to overlap, forming a nearly\ncontinuous background with some sharp acoustic emission bursts. The latter can\nbe identified with the nucleation of new bands. The acoustic emission spectrum\nassociated with the continuously propagating type-A band is continuous. These\npredictions are consistent with experimental results. The acoustic emission\nspectrum of the L\\\"uders-like band matches with recent experiments as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 06:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

In the context of an in-depth understanding of GRBs and their\npossible use in cosmology, some important correlations between the parameters\nthat describe their emission have been discovered, among which the \"Ep,i-Eiso\"\ncorrelation is the most studied. Because of this, it is fundamental to shed\nlight on the peculiar behaviour of a few events, namely GRB 980425 and GRB\n031203, that appear to be important outliers of the Ep,i-Eiso correlation.\nAims. In this paper we investigate if the locations of GRB 980425 and GRB\n031203, the two (apparent) outliers of the correlation, may be due to an\nobservational bias caused by the lacking detection of the soft X-ray emissions\nassociated with these GRBs, from respectively the BATSE detector on-board the\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observer and INTEGRAL, that were operating at the epoch of\nthe observations. We analyse the observed emission of other similar\nsub-energetic bursts (GRBs 060218, 100316D and 161219B) observed by Swift and\nwhose integrated emissions match the Ep,i-Eiso relation. We simulate their\nintegrated and time-resolved emissions as would have been observed by the same\ndetectors that observed GRB 980425 and GRB 031203, aimed at reconstructing the\nlight curve and spectra of these bursts. Results. If observed by old generation\ninstruments, GRB 060218, 100316D and 161219B would appear as outliers of the\nEp,i-Eiso relation, while if observed with Swift or WFM GRB 060218 would\nperfectly match the correlation. We also note that the instrument BAT alone\n(15-150 keV) actually measured 060218 as an outlier. Conclusions. We suggest\nthat if GRB 980425 and GRB 031203 would have been observed by Swift and by eXTP\nthey may have matched the Ep,i-Eiso relation. This provides strong support to\nthe idea that instrumental biases can make some events in the lower-left corner\nof the Ep,i-Eiso plane appearing as outliers of the \"Amati relation\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 08:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

In this paper, in view of the fact that most widely deployed deep\nlearning models are susceptible to various image distortions, the distorted\nimages are involved for data augmentation in the deep neural network training\nprocess to learn a reliable model for practical applications. In particular, an\nimage quality assessment based label smoothing method, which aims at\nregularizing the label distribution of training images, is further proposed to\ntune the objective functions in learning the neural network.

In this paper, we treat AOR as a Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and find near-optimal policies on\ntraining data using Belief Tree Search (BTS) on the corresponding belief Markov\nDecision Process (MDP).

Formal modelers of opinion\ndynamics try to explain how intergroup polarization can arise from simple first\nprinciples of interactions within and between groups. Models have been proposed\nin which intergroup attitudes affect social influence in the form of homophily\nor xenophobia, elaborated as fixed tendencies of individuals to interact more\nwith in-group members, be more open to influence from in-group members and\nperhaps even distance oneself from attitudes of outgroup members.

However, unlike person re-identification, the visual differences\nbetween pairs of vehicle images are usually subtle and even challenging for\nhumans to distinguish. Incorporating additional spatio-temporal information is\nvital for solving the challenging re-identification task. Existing vehicle\nre-identification methods ignored or used over-simplified models for the\nspatio-temporal relations between vehicle images. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage framework that incorporates complex spatio-temporal information for\neffectively regularizing the re-identification results. Given a pair of vehicle\nimages with their spatio-temporal information, a candidate\nvisual-spatio-temporal path is first generated by a chain MRF model with a\ndeeply learned potential function, where each visual-spatio-temporal state\ncorresponds to an actual vehicle image with its spatio-temporal information. A\nSiamese-CNN+Path-LSTM model takes the candidate path as well as the pairwise\nqueries to generate their similarity score.

We find contrasting\ninfluences of viscoelastic contribution in different regions of tape mass,\nroller inertia, and pull velocity. As the model acoustic energy dissipated\ndepends on the nature of the peel front and its dynamical evolution, the\ncombined effect of the roller inertia and pull velocity makes the acoustic\nenergy noisier for small tape mass and low-pull velocity while it is burstlike\nfor low-tape mass, intermediate values of the roller inertia and high-pull\nvelocity.

On the one hand, it is costly, time-consuming, and\nineffective to perform trial-and-error manual deployment of wireless nodes. On\nthe other hand, the existing wireless planning tools only focus on office\nenvironments such that it is hard to plan IWLANs due to the larger problem size\nand the deployed IWLANs are vulnerable to prevalent shadowing effects in harsh\nindustrial indoor environments. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an\noverdimensioning model and a genetic algorithm based over-dimensioning (GAOD)\nalgorithm for deploying large-scale robust IWLANs. As a progress beyond the\nstate-of-the-art wireless planning, two full coverage layers are created. The\nsecond coverage layer serves as redundancy in case of shadowing. Meanwhile, the\ndeployment cost is reduced by minimizing the number of access points (APs); the\nhard constraint of minimal inter-AP spatial paration avoids multiple APs\ncovering the same area to be simultaneously shadowed by the same obstacle. The\ncomputation time and occupied memory are dedicatedly considered in the design\nof GAOD for large-scale optimization. A greedy heuristic based\nover-dimensioning (GHOD) algorithm and a random OD algorithm are taken as\nbenchmarks.

The sensor is designed using two\ncoupled asymmetric strip waveguides with a top-loaded grating structure in one\nof the waveguides. Maximum light couples from one waveguide to the other at the\nresonance wavelength, and the change in resonance wavelength with the change in\nrefractive index of the medium in the cover region is a measure of the\nsensitivity. The proposed sensor would be an on-chip device with a high\nrefractive index sensitivity of ~ 104 nm/RIU, and negligible temperature\nsensitivity (< 1nm/0C). The sensor configuration offers a low propagation loss,\nthereby enhancing the sensitivity. Variation of the sensitivity with the\nwaveguide parameters of the proposed sensor have been studied to optimize the\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 06:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

Accepted in Materials","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"q-bio.QM","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Manuka honey (MH) is used as an antibacterial agent in bioactive wound\ndressings via direct impregnation onto a suitable substrate. MH provides unique\nantibacterial activity when compared with conventional honeys, owing partly to\none of its constituents, methylglyoxal (MGO). Aiming to investigate an\nantibiotic-free antimicrobial strategy, we studied the antibacterial activity\nof both MH and MGO (at equivalent MGO concentrations) when applied as a\nphysical coating to a nonwoven fabric wound dressing. When physically coated on\nto a cellulosic hydroentangled nonwoven fabric, it was found that\nconcentrations of 0.0054 mg cm-2 of MGO in the form of MH and MGO was\nsufficient to achieve 100 CFU% bacteria reduction against gram-positive\nStaphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on BS EN\nISO 20743:2007. A 3- to 20- fold increase in MGO concentration (0.0170 - 0.1 mg\ncm-2) was required to facilitate a good antibacterial effect (based on BS EN\nISO 20645:2004) in terms of zone of inhibition and lack of growth under the\nsample. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal\nconcentration (MBC) was also assessed for MGO in liquid form against three\nprevalent wound and healthcare-associated pathogens, i.e. Staphylococcus\naureus, gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive Enterococcus\nfaecalis. Other than the case of MGO-containing fabrics, solutions with much\nhigher MGO concentrations (128 mg L-1 - 1024 mg L-1) were required to provide\neither a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. The results presented in this\nstudy therefore demonstrate the relevance of MGO-based coating as an\nenvironment-friendly strategy for the design of functional dressings with\nantibiotic-free antimicrobial chemistries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 11:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}
