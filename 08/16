Such statement corresponds to the\nrecent numerical simulation by Khomenko et al. [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{91},\n180504 (2015)]. The authors reported about a sophisticated behavior of the\nvortex line density (VLD) $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{r},t)$, different from $%\n\\mathcal{L}\\propto V_{ns}^{x}(y)^{2}$, which follows from the naive,\nstraightforward application of the conventional Vinen theory. It is clear, that\nVinen theory should be refined by taking into account transverse effects and\nthe way it ought to be done is the subject of active discussion in the\nliterature. In the work we discuss several possible mechanisms of the\ntransverse flux of VLD $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ which should be incorporated\nin the standard Vinen equation to describe adequately the inhomogeneous quantum\nturbulence (QT). It is shown that the most effective among these mechanisms is\nthe one that is related to the phase slippage phenomenon. The use of this flux\nin the modernized Vinen equation corrects the situation with an unusual\ndistribution of the vortex line density, and satisfactory describes the\nbehavior $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ both in stationary and nonstationary\nsituations. The general problem of the phenomenological Vinen theory in the\ncase of nonuniform and nonstationary quantum turbulence is thoroughly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 16:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 16:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

In the present work, linear response is addressed. In the\nSchr\\\"odinger representation, projection onto the hydrodynamic subspace leads\nto the conventional Braginskii fluid equations, while the orthogonal projection\nleads to an alternative derivation of the Braginskii correction equations for\nthe nonhydrodynamic part of the distribution function f. Although ultimately\nmathematically equivalent to Braginskii's calculations, the projection-operator\napproach provides a usefully intuitive way of discussing the derivation of\ntransport equations and interpreting the significance of the various parts of\nthe perturbed distribution function; it is also technically more concise. A\nspecial case of the Weinhold metric is used to provide a covariant\nrepresentation of the formalism; this allows a succinct demonstration of the\nOnsager symmetries for classical transport. The Heisenberg representation is\nused to derive a generalized Langevin system whose mean recovers the Braginskii\nequations but that also includes fluctuating forces.

DWF uses ~20 telescopes from radio to\ngamma-rays to perform simultaneous and rapid-response follow-up searches for\nfast transient events on millisecond-to-hours timescales. DWF search demands\nhave a set of constraints that is becoming common amongst large collaborations.\nHere, we focus on the rapid optical data component of DWF led by the Dark\nEnergy Camera (DECam) at CTIO. Each DECam image has 70 total CCDs saved as a\n~1.2 gigabyte FITS file. Near real-time data processing and fast transient\ncandidate identifications -- in minutes for rapid follow-up triggers on other\ntelescopes -- requires computational power exceeding what is currently\navailable on-site at CTIO. In this context, data files need to be transmitted\nrapidly to a foreign location for supercomputing post-processing, source\nfinding, visualization and analysis. This step in the search process poses a\nmajor bottleneck, and reducing the data size helps accommodate faster data\ntransmission. To maximise our gain in transfer time and still achieve our\nscience goals, we opt for lossy data compression -- keeping in mind that raw\ndata is archived and can be evaluated at a later time.

We select a\nprominence observed on 15 July 2014 from space (IRIS, Hinode, SDO) and from the\nground (THEMIS). We perform a robust co-alignment of the data sets using a 2D\ncross-correlation technique.

To\nobtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding space\nwhere region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use\nthese embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron\nposition. We incorporate such masks in CNNs and replace the convolution\noperation with a \"segmentation-aware\" variant that allows a neuron to\nselectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting\nnetwork a segmentation-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image\npoint according to local segmentation cues.

To explain this phenomenon, it is commonly assumed that the mean free\npaths of heat carriers are bound by the crystal size and that thermal\nconductivity is reduced in a manner proportional to such mean free paths. We\nshow here that these conclusions rely on simplifying assumptions and\napproximated transport models. Instead, starting from the linearized Boltzmann\ntransport equation in the relaxon basis, we show how the problem can be reduced\nto a set of decoupled linear differential equations. Then, the heat flow can be\ninterpreted as a hydrodynamic phenomenon, with the relaxon gas being slowed\ndown in proximity of a surface by friction effects, similar to the flux of a\nviscous fluid in a pipe. As an example, we study a ribbon and a trench of\nmonolayer molybdenum disulphide, describing the procedure to reconstruct the\ntemperature and thermal conductivity profile in the sample interior and showing\nhow to estimate the effect of nanostructuring. The approach is general and\ncould be extended to other transport carriers, such as electrons, or extended\nto materials of higher dimensionality and to different geometries, such as thin\nfilms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

Aims: How NH$_2$CHO\nis formed has been a puzzle for decades: our goal is to contribute to the hotly\ndebated question of whether formamide is mostly formed via gas-phase or grain\nsurface chemistry. Methods: We used the NOEMA interferometer to image NH$_2$CHO\ntowards the L1157-B1 blue-shifted shock, a well known interstellar laboratory,\nto study how the components of dust mantles and cores released into the gas\nphase triggers the formation of formamide. Results: We report the first\nspatially resolved image (size $\\sim$ 9\", $\\sim$ 2300 AU) of formamide emission\nin a shocked region around a Sun-like protostar: the line profiles are\nblueshifted and have a FWHM $\\simeq$ 5 km s$^{-1}$.

The core idea is\nto maintain a distribution over a set of experts and update this distribution\nin an online fashion based on the parameters of the underlying optimization\nproblem. In this report, we study the behavior of a special MWU algorithm used\nfor generating a global coin flip in the presence of an adversary that tampers\nthe experts' advice. Specifically, we focus our attention on two adversarial\nstrategies: (1) non-adaptive, in which the adversary chooses a fixed set of\nexperts a priori and corrupts their advice in each round; and (2) adaptive, in\nwhich this set is chosen as the rounds of the algorithm progress. We formulate\nthese adversarial strategies as being greedy in terms of trying to maximize the\nshare of the corrupted experts in the final weighted advice the MWU computes\nand provide the underlying optimization problem that needs to be solved to\nachieve this goal. We provide empirical results to show that in the presence of\neither of the above adversaries, the MWU algorithm takes $\\mathcal{O}(n)$\nrounds in expectation to produce the desired output. This result compares well\nwith the current state of the art of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for the general\nByzantine consensus problem.

The 10 nm thick YBCO nanowires without the\nAu capping present hysteretic current voltage characteristics, characterized by\na voltage switch which drives the nanowires directly from the superconducting\nto the normal state. Such bistability is associated in NbN nanowires to the\npresence of localized normal domains within the superconductor. The presence of\nthe voltage switch, in ultrathin nanostructures characterized by high sheet\nresistance values, though preserving high quality superconducting properties,\nmake our nanowires very attractive devices to engineer single photon detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 23:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

In many practical applications such as\ncritical infrastructure monitoring and modeling of disease spread, a useful\nchange propagation model is one where change eventually happens at all sensors,\nbut where not all sensors witness change at the same time instant. While prior\nwork considered the case of known change propagation dynamics, this paper\nstudies a more general setting of unknown change propagation pattern\n(trajectory). A Bayesian formulation of the problem in both centralized and\ndecentralized settings is studied with the goal of detecting the first time\ninstant at which any sensor witnesses a change. Using the dynamic programming\n(DP) framework, the optimal solution structure is derived and in the rare\nchange regime, several more practical change detection algorithms are proposed.\nUnder certain conditions, the first-order asymptotic optimality of a proposed\nalgorithm called multichart test is shown as the false alarm probability\nvanishes. To further reduce the computational complexity, change detection\nalgorithms are proposed based on online estimation of the unknown change\npropagation pattern. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed detection\ntechniques offer near-optimal performance. Further, in the decentralized\nsetting, it is shown that if an event-triggered sampling scheme called\nlevel-crossing sampling with hysteresis (LCSH) is used for sampling and\ntransmission of local statistics, the detection performance can be\nsignificantly improved using the same amount of communication resources\ncompared to the conventional uniform-in-time sampling (US) scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 23:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 06:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 03:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 05:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

We consider two OED formulations\nthat allow reducing the experimental costs by minimizing the number of\nmeasurements. The first formulation assumes a fine discretization of the design\nparameter space and uses sparsity promoting regularization to obtain an\nefficient design. The second formulation parameterizes the design and seeks\noptimal placement for these measurements by solving a small-dimensional\noptimization problem. We consider both problems in a Bayes risk as well as an\nempirical Bayes risk minimization framework. For the unconstrained inverse\nstate problem, we exploit the closed form solution for the inner problem to\nefficiently compute derivatives for the outer OED problem. The empirical\nformulation does not require an explicit solution of the inverse problem and\ntherefore allows to integrate constraints efficiently. A key contribution is an\nefficient optimization method for solving the resulting, typically\nhigh-dimensional, bilevel optimization problem using derivative-based methods.\nTo overcome the lack of non-differentiability in active set methods for\ninequality constraints problems, we use a relaxed interior point method. To\naddress the growing computational complexity of empirical Bayes OED, we\nparallelize the computation over the training models. Numerical examples and\nillustrations from tomographic reconstruction, for various data sets and under\ndifferent constraints, demonstrate the impact of constraints on the optimal\ndesign and highlight the importance of OED for constrained problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 01:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

First, we develop a\nflexible and scalable joint model based upon sparse multiple-output Gaussian\nprocesses. Unlike state-of-the-art joint models, the proposed model can explain\nhighly challenging structure including non-Gaussian noise while scaling to\nlarge data. Second, we derive an optimal policy for predicting events using the\ndistribution of the event occurrence estimated by the joint model. The derived\npolicy trades-off the cost of a delayed detection versus incorrect assessments\nand abstains from making decisions when the estimated event probability does\nnot satisfy the derived confidence criteria. Experiments on a large dataset\nshow that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in event prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 03:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

This notion of noncontextuality is not applicable to\nexperimental measurements because these are never free of noise and thus never\ntruly projective. For nonprojective measurements, therefore, one must drop the\nrequirement that an outcome is assigned deterministically in the model and\nmerely require that it is assigned a distribution over outcomes in a manner\nthat is context-independent. By demanding context-independence in the\nrepresentation of preparations as well, one obtains a generalized principle of\nnoncontextuality that also supports a quantum no-go theorem. Several recent\nworks have shown how to derive inequalities on experimental data which, if\nviolated, demonstrate the impossibility of finding a generalized-noncontextual\nmodel of this data.

The paradigm of the Lambda architecture features key\ncharacteristics (such as robustness, fault tolerance, scalability,\ngeneralization, extensibility, ad-hoc queries, minimal maintenance, and\nlow-latency reads and updates) to cope with this complexity. The paper at hand\nsuggest a basic set of strategies to handle the arising challenges regarding\nthe volatility, heterogeneity, and desired low latency execution by reducing\nthe overall system timing (scheduling, execution, monitoring, and faults\nrecovery) as well as possible faults (churn, no answers to executions). The\nproposed strategies make use of services such as migration, replication,\nMapReduce simulation, and combined processing methods (batch- and\nstreaming-based). Via these services, a distribution of tasks for the best\nbalance of computational resources is achieved, while monitoring and management\ncan be performed asynchronously in the background. %An application of batch and\nstream-based methods are proposed to reduce the latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

Most of this data\nis high dimensional and sparse, for e.g., the bag-of-words representation used\nfor representing text. Often, an efficient search for similar data points needs\nto be performed in many applications like clustering, nearest neighbour search,\nranking and indexing. Even though there have been significant increases in\ncomputational power, a simple brute-force similarity-search on such datasets is\ninefficient and at times impossible. Thus, it is desirable to get a compressed\nrepresentation which preserves the similarity between data points. In this\nwork, we consider the data points as sets and use Jaccard similarity as the\nsimilarity measure. Compression techniques are generally evaluated on the\nfollowing parameters --1) Randomness required for compression, 2) Time required\nfor compression, 3) Dimension of the data after compression, and 4) Space\nrequired to store the compressed data. Ideally, the compressed representation\nof the data should be such, that the similarity between each pair of data\npoints is preserved, while keeping the time and the randomness required for\ncompression as low as possible.\n  We show that the compression technique suggested by Pratap and Kulkarni also\nworks well for Jaccard similarity.

Most of these costs results from chemical equilibrium\ncalculations that are performed at least once in every mesh cell and at every\ntime step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative\nprocess, where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that\neven if every calculation converged in a single iteration, the resulting\nspeedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than proposing a fast-converging\nnumerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we present a\nmachine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and\naccurately estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar\ninput conditions has been performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart\nchemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport modeling example and show\nthat, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium\ncalculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the\nmachine-learning-accelerated chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly\nperform all subsequent equilibrium calculations, resulting in speedups of\nalmost two orders of magnitude.

The coupling between the\nmagnetic field and an irradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from\nthe accretor can yield a strong magnetic braking, which could give rise to a\nrelatively high mass transfer rate. According to the observed orbital period,\nthe mass transfer rate, the mass ratio, and the donor star spectral type, the\nprogenitor of Sco X-1 should be an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including a\n1.6 $-$ 1.8 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ Ap/Bp donor star in a 1.3 $-$ 1.5 day orbit.\nTherefore, we propose that anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars provides\nan alternative evolutionary channel to a part of luminous X-ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 10:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 16:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

At millimetre wavelengths, the\nstellar winds and the colliding-wind region emit more thermal free-free\nradiation, and it is expected that any non-thermal contribution will be\ndifficult or impossible to detect. We aim to determine if the material in the\ncolliding-wind region contributes substantially to the observed millimetre\nfluxes of a colliding-wind binary. We also try to distinguish the synchrotron\nemission from the free-free emission. We monitored the massive binary Cyg OB2\n#8A at 3 mm with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer\nof the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM). The data were\ncollected in 14 separate observing runs (in 2014 and 2016), and provide good\ncoverage of the orbital period. The observed millimetre fluxes range between\n1.1 and 2.3 mJy, and show phase-locked variability, clearly indicating that a\nlarge part of the emission is due to the colliding-wind region. A simple\nsynchrotron model gives fluxes with the correct order of magnitude, but with a\nmaximum that is phase-shifted with respect to the observations. Qualitatively\nthis phase shift can be explained by our neglect of orbital motion on the shape\nof the colliding-wind region. A model using only free-free emission results in\nonly a slightly worse explanation of the observations. Additionally, on the map\nof our observations we also detect the O6.5 III star Cyg OB2 #8B, for which we\ndetermine a 3 mm flux of 0.21 +- 0.033 mJy. The question of whether synchrotron\nradiation or free-free emission dominates the millimetre fluxes of Cyg OB2 #8A\nremains open.

The design of the fallback\npath can have a profound impact on performance. If the fallback path is allowed\nto run concurrently with hardware transactions, then hardware transactions must\nbe instrumented, adding significant overhead. Otherwise, hardware transactions\nmust wait for any processes on the fallback path, causing concurrency\nbottlenecks, or move to the fallback path. We introduce an approach that\ncombines the best of both worlds. The key idea is to use three execution paths:\nan HTM fast path, an HTM middle path, and a software fallback path, such that\nthe middle path can run concurrently with each of the other two. The fast path\nand fallback path do not run concurrently, so the fast path incurs no\ninstrumentation overhead. Furthermore, fast path transactions can move to the\nmiddle path instead of waiting or moving to the software path. We demonstrate\nour approach by producing an accelerated version of the tree update template of\nBrown et al., which can be used to implement fast lock-free data structures\nbased on down-trees. We used the accelerated template to implement two\nlock-free trees: a binary search tree (BST), and an (a,b)-tree (a\ngeneralization of a B-tree).

We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on\nlikelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation\nbetween market activity and exploit deployment.

Due to the heterogeneous compute requirements of different\napplications, there is a growing need to share the GPU across multiple\napplications in large-scale computing environments. However, while CPUs offer\nrelatively seamless multi-application concurrency, and are an excellent fit for\nmultitasking and for virtualized environments, GPUs currently offer only\nprimitive support for multi-application concurrency. Much of the problem in a\ncontemporary GPU lies within the memory system, where multi-application\nexecution requires virtual memory support to manage the address spaces of each\napplication and to provide memory protection. In this work, we perform a\ndetailed analysis of the major problems in state-of-the-art GPU virtual memory\nmanagement that hinders multi-application execution. Existing GPUs are designed\nto share memory between the CPU and GPU, but do not handle multi-application\nsupport within the GPU well. We find that when multiple applications spatially\nshare the GPU, there is a significant amount of inter-core thrashing on the\nshared TLB within the GPU. The TLB contention is high enough to prevent the GPU\nfrom successfully hiding stall latencies, thus becoming a first-order\nperformance concern. We introduce MASK, a memory hierarchy design that provides\nlow-overhead virtual memory support for the concurrent execution of multiple\napplications.

Furthermore, it is found that stimulated Stokes\nscattering and its reverse process will dominate alternately on the whole\nduring the three-wave coupling, but the eventual net energy flow must be from\nthe pump wave to the Stokes wave as a result of the finite lifetime of\nacoustical phonons.

Combining cosmological\nzoom simulations of galaxies with SIGAME (SImulator of GAlaxy\nMillimeter/submillimeter Emission) we have modeled the multi-phased\ninterstellar medium (ISM) and its emission in [CII], [OI] and [OIII], from 30\nmain sequence galaxies at z~6 with star formation rates ~3-23Msun/yr, stellar\nmasses ~(0.7-8)x10^9Msun, and metallicities ~(0.1-0.4)xZsun.

We find that the [CII] emission is dominated by the\ndiffuse ionized gas phase and molecular clouds, which on average contribute\n~66% and ~27%, respectively. The molecular gas, which constitutes only ~10% of\nthe total gas mass is thus a more efficient emitter of [CII] than the ionized\ngas making up ~85% of the total gas mass.

The\naim is to provide the necessary data and numerical procedures for its\nimplementation in a stellar code. A technical problem is the discrepancy\nbetween the sets of thermodynamic quantities provided by the SAHA-S equation of\nstate and those necessary in the CESAM2k computations. Moreover, the\nindependent variables in a practical equation of state (like SAHA-S) are\ntemperature and density, whereas for modelling calculations the variables\ntemperature and pressure are preferable. Specifically for the CESAM2k code,\nsome additional quantities and their derivatives must be provided. To provide\nthe bridge between the equation of state and stellar modelling, we prepare\nauxiliary tables of the quantities that are demanded in CESAM2k. Then we use\ncubic spline interpolation to provide both smoothness and a good approximation\nof the necessary derivatives. Using the B-form of spline representation\nprovides us with an efficient algorithm for three-dimensional interpolation.\nThe table of B-spline coefficients provided can be directly used during stellar\nmodel calculations together with the module of cubic spline interpolation. This\nimplementation of the SAHA-S equation of state in the CESAM2k stellar structure\nand evolution code has been tested on a solar model evolved to the present.

For locally quadratic loss functions, the risk of\nstandard procedures has the usual scaling of $1/n$. However, it has been\nnoticed that for fidelity based metrics such as the Bures distance, the risk of\nconventional (non-adaptive) qubit tomography schemes scales as $1/\\sqrt{n}$ for\nstates close to the boundary of the Bloch sphere. Several proposed estimators\nappear to improve this scaling, and our goal is to analyse the problem from the\nperspective of the maximum risk over all states.\n  We propose qubit estimation strategies based on separate and adaptive\nmeasurements, that achieve $1/n$ scalings for the maximum Bures risk. The\nestimator involving local measurements uses a fixed fraction of the available\nresource $n$ to estimate the Bloch vector direction; the length of the Bloch\nvector is then estimated from the remaining copies by measuring in the\nestimator eigenbasis. The estimator based on collective measurements uses local\nasymptotic normality techniques which allows us derive upper and lower bounds\nto its maximum Bures risk. We also discuss how to construct a minimax optimal\nestimator in this setup. Finally, we consider quantum relative entropy and show\nthat the risk of the estimator based on collective measurements achieves a rate\n$O(n^{-1}\\log n)$ under this loss function.

Here we show how to\nsynthesize the absolute frequency of a lightwave signal, using integrated\nphotonics to implement lasers, system interconnects, and nonlinear frequency\ncomb generation. The laser frequency output of our synthesizer is programmed by\na microwave clock across 4 THz near 1550 nm with 1 Hz resolution and\ntraceability to the SI second. This is accomplished with a heterogeneously\nintegrated III/V-Si tunable laser, which is guided by dual\ndissipative-Kerr-soliton frequency combs fabricated on silicon chips. Through\nout-of-loop measurements of the phase-coherent, microwave-to-optical link, we\nverify that the fractional-frequency instability of the integrated photonics\nsynthesizer matches the $7.0*10^{-13}$ reference-clock instability for a 1\nsecond acquisition, and constrain any synthesis error to $7.7*10^{-15}$ while\nstepping the synthesizer across the telecommunication C band.

In this\nthesis, I study the N=1* and N=2* theories from which an elliptic curve is\nknown to emerge, alongside an elliptic function called the generalized\nresolvent into which the physics is encoded. This is indicative of the common\norigin of the two theories in N=4 SYM. The N=1* Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model is\nintrinsically holomorphic with parameter space corresponding to the upper-half\nplane. The Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model 't Hooft coupling S has been previously\nshown to be holomorphic on the upper-half plane and quasi-modular with respect\nto SL(2,Z). The allowed N=2* coupling is constrained to a Hermitian slice\nthrough the enlarged moduli space of the holomorphic N=1* model. After\nexplicitly constructing the map from the elliptic curve to the eigenvalue\nplane, I argue that the N=1* coupling S encodes data reminiscent of N=2*. A\ncollection of extrema (saddle-points) of S behave curiously like the quantum\ncritical points of N=2* theory. For the first critical point, the match is\nexact. This collection of points lie on the line of degeneration which behaves\nin a sense, like a boundary at infinity. I also show explicitly that the\nemergent elliptic curve along with the generalized resolvent allow one to\nrecover exact eigenvalue densities. At weak coupling, my method reproduces the\ninverse square root of N=2* as well as the Wigner semi-circle in N=1*. At\nstrong coupling in N=1*, I provide encouraging evidence of the parabolic\ndensity arising in the neighborhood of the line of degeneration. To my\nknowledge, the parabolic density has only been observed asymptotically. It is\ninteresting to see evidence that it may be exactly encoded in the other form of\nemergent geometry: the elliptic curve with the generalized resolvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 19:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

This paper presents a novel\ndriving style analysis framework using the primitive driving patterns learned\nfrom naturalistic driving data. In order to achieve this, first, a Bayesian\nnonparametric learning method based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is\nintroduced to extract primitive driving patterns from time series driving data\nwithout prior knowledge of the number of these patterns. In the Bayesian\nnonparametric approach, we utilize a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)\ninstead of learning the unknown number of smooth dynamical modes of HSMM, thus\ngenerating the primitive driving patterns. Each primitive pattern is clustered\nand then labeled using behavioral semantics according to drivers' physical and\npsychological perception thresholds. For each driver, 75 primitive driving\npatterns in car-following scenarios are learned and semantically labeled. In\norder to show the HDP-HSMM's utility to learn primitive driving patterns, other\ntwo Bayesian nonparametric approaches, HDP-HMM and sticky HDP-HMM, are\ncompared. The naturalistic driving data of 18 drivers were collected from the\nUniversity of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPDM) database. The\nindividual driving styles are discussed according to distribution\ncharacteristics of the learned primitive driving patterns and also the\ndifference in driving styles among drivers are evaluated using the\nKullback-Leibler divergence. The experiment results demonstrate that the\nproposed primitive pattern-based method can allow one to semantically\nunderstand driver behaviors and driving styles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 03:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

MAP tau is a key protein in stabilizing the microtubule architecture\nthat regulates neuron morphology and synaptic strength. The precise role of\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tauopathic disease process, however, is\npoorly understood. It is known that the production of ROS by mitochondria can\nresult in ultraweak photon emission (UPE) within cells. One likely absorber of\nthese photons is the microtubule cytoskeleton, as it forms a vast network\nspanning neurons, is highly co-localized with mitochondria, and shows a high\ndensity of aromatic amino acids. Functional microtubule networks may traffic\nthis ROS-generated endogenous photon energy for cellular signaling, or they may\nserve as dissipaters/conduits of such energy. Experimentally, after in vitro\nexposure to exogenous photons, microtubules have been shown to reorient and\nreorganize in a dose-dependent manner with the greatest effect being observed\naround 280 nm, in the tryptophan and tyrosine absorption range. In this paper,\nrecent modeling efforts based on ambient temperature experiment are presented,\nshowing that tubulin polymers can feasibly absorb and channel these\nphotoexcitations via resonance energy transfer, on the order of dendritic\nlength scales. Since microtubule networks are compromised in tauopathic\ndiseases, patients with these illnesses would be unable to support effective\nchanneling of these photons for signaling or dissipation. Consequent emission\nsurplus due to increased UPE production or decreased ability to absorb and\ntransfer may lead to increased cellular oxidative damage, thus hastening the\nneurodegenerative process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 21:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The mobile\napplication of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) is a promising approach to\nmeasure field soil moisture non-invasively by surveying large regions with a\nground-based vehicle. Recently, concerns have been raised about a potentially\nbiasing influence of local structures and roads. We employed neutron transport\nsimulations and dedicated experiments to quantify the influence of different\nroad types on the CRNS measurement. We found that the presence of roads\nintroduces a bias in the CRNS estimation of field soil moisture compared to\nnon-road scenarios. However, this effect becomes insignificant at distances\nbeyond a few meters from the road. Measurements from the road could\noverestimate the field value by up to 40 % depending on road material, width,\nand the surrounding field water content. The bias could be successfully removed\nwith an analytical correction function that accounts for these parameters.\nAdditionally, an empirical approach is proposed that can be used on-the-fly\nwithout prior knowledge of field soil moisture. Tests at different study sites\ndemonstrated good agreement between road-effect corrected measurements and\nfield soil moisture observations. However, if knowledge about the road\ncharacteristics is missing, any measurements on the road could substantially\nreduce the accuracy of this method. Our results constitute a practical\nadvancement of the mobile CRNS methodology, which is important for providing\nunbiased estimates of field-scale soil moisture to support applications in\nhydrology, remote sensing, and agriculture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 00:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}
