However, in the case of\nsubcontracting the transportation of pupils, unbalanced tours can increase the\ncosts significantly as the lengths of some tours can exceed the daily fixed\ndriving goal and will result in over-hour charges. This paper proposes a Mixed\nInteger Programming (MIP) model and a matching-based heuristic algorithm to\nsolve the balanced school bus scheduling problem in a multi-school setting. The\nheuristic is guaranteed to find the minimum number of buses. The effectiveness\nof the heuristic algorithm is tested by comparing its solutions with the\nsolutions obtained from the MIP whenever the MIP could find a good solution.\nFor larger cases where the MIP cannot find a good solution, we illustrate the\nperformance of the heuristic by showing how it affects the durations of the\ntours. To illustrate the performance of the MIP and heuristic, we examine 12\ndifferent problems with different numbers of trips which are all based on two\nreal-world problems. A California case study with 54 trips and the Howard\nCounty Public School System (HCPSS) with 994 trips. The numerical results of\ntesting our approach indicate that the proposed algorithm can find reasonable\nsolutions in a significantly shorter time. The balanced solutions of our\nalgorithm can save up to 16% of school bus operation costs compared to the best\nsolution found from the MIP model after 40 hours. The balancing stage of the\nheuristic decreases the Standard Deviation of the tour durations by up to 47%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 16:09:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 03:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 16:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Space and stochasticity therefore play an\nessential role in biochemical networks. Spatial-stochastic simulations have\nbecome a prominent tool for understanding how stochasticity at the microscopic\nlevel influences the macroscopic behavior of such systems. However, while\nparticle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately\ndescribe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used\nto simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency\nand accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact\nalgorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system\ninto M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical\nsolutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven\nparticle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and\nspace while retaining access to their state variables at any moment.

The theory has been strongly\nverified at 395.1K, a bit above melting. Our goal here is to test this theory\nfor its ability to explain the temperature ($T$) dependence of the mean square\ndisplacement (MSD) at $T\\leq395.1$K.

This makes them excellent laboratories\nfor investigating the process of star-formation (SF) at galactic scales and the\neffects of massive stellar feedback on the interstellar (and intergalactic)\nmedium.\n  We analyzed the BCG Tololo 1937-423 using optical integral field spectroscopy\nwith VIMOS at the Very Large Telescope to probe its morphology, stellar\ncontent, nebular excitation and ionization properties, and the kinematics of\nits warm ionized gas.\n  We found that Tololo 1937-423 is currently undergoing an extended starburst,\nwith nine major $H\\alpha$ clumps. The galaxy presents a single continuum peak\nthat is not cospatial with any knot in emission lines, indicating at least two\nrelatively recent episodes of SF. The inhomogeneous dust distribution reaches\nits maximum roughly at the position of the continuum peak. We found shocked\nregions in the galaxy outer regions and at the edges of the SF knots. The\noxygen abundance is similar in all the SF regions, suggesting a chemically\nhomogeneous ionized interstellar medium over spatial scales of several kpc. The\nionized gas kinematics displays an overall regular rotation around a\nnorthwest-southeast axis.\n  The morphology of the galaxy and the two different episodes of SF suggest a\nscenario of triggered (induced by supernova shock waves) SF acting in Tololo\n1937-423. The inferred ages for the different SF episodes (~13-80 Myr for the\ncentral post-starburst and 5-7 Myr for the ongoing SF) are consistent with\ntriggered SF, with the most recent SF episode caused by the collective effect\nof stellar winds and supernova explosions from the central post-starburst. The\nvelocity dispersion pattern, with higher velocity dispersions found at the\nedges of the SF regions, and shocked regions in the galaxy, also favor this\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

For this\npurpose we use a model of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy formed in a numerical\nsimulation of a major merger of two disky dwarfs. The shape of the stellar\ncomponent of the merger remnant is axisymmetric and prolate which allows us to\nidentify and measure the bias caused by observing the spheroidal galaxy along\ndifferent directions, especially the longest and shortest principal axis. The\nmodelling is based on mock data generated from the remnant that are\nobservationally available for dwarfs: projected positions and line-of-sight\nvelocities of the stars. In order to obtain a reliable tool while keeping the\nnumber of parameters low we parametrize the total mass distribution as a\nradius-dependent mass-to-light ratio with just two free parameters we aim to\nconstrain. Our study shows that if the total density profile is known, the\ntrue, radially increasing anisotropy profile can be well recovered for the\nobservations along the longest axis whereas the data along the shortest axis\nlead to the inference an incorrect, isotropic model.

To cope with this problem, directional beamforming both\nat the Base Station (BS) side and at the user side is necessary in order to\nestablish a strong path conveying enough signal power. Finding such beamforming\ndirections is referred to as the Beam Alignment (BA) and is known to be a\nchallenging problem. This paper presents a new scheme for efficient BA, based\non the estimated second order channel statistics. As a result, our proposed\nalgorithm is highly robust to variations of the channel time-dynamics compared\nwith other proposed approaches based on the estimation of the channel\ncoefficients, rather than of their second-order statistics. In the proposed\nscheme, the BS probes the channel in the Downlink (DL) letting each user to\nestimate its own path direction. All the users within the BS coverage are\ntrained simultaneously, without requiring \"beam refinement\" with multiple\ninteractive rounds of Downlink/Uplink (DL/UL) transmissions, as done in other\nschemes. Thus, the training overhead of the proposed BA scheme is independent\nof the number of users in the system. We pose the channel estimation at the\nuser side as a Compressed Sensing (CS) of a non-negative signal and use the\nrecently developed Non-Negative Least Squares(NNLS) technique to solve it\nefficiently. The performance of our proposed algorithm is assessed via computer\nsimulation in a relevant mm-Wave scenario. The results illustrate that our\napproach is superior to the state-of-the-art BA schemes proposed in the\nliterature in terms of training overhead in multi-user scenarios and robustness\nto variations in the channel dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 19:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 15:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

Several studies have used phylogenetics to investigate Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission among Men who have Sex with Men\n(MSMs) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, revealing many transmission clusters. The\nQuebec HIV genotyping program sequence database now includes viral sequences\nfrom close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as MSMs. In this paper,\nwe investigate clustering in those data by comparing results from several\nmethods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods,\nand two more recent algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces\na measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast\ndistance-based approach. We estimate cluster growth by focusing on recent cases\nin the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage. Results. The analyses reveal\nconsiderable overlap between cluster estimates obtained from conventional\nmethods. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus rely on different cluster definitions\nand as a result, suggest moderately different partitions. All estimates lead to\nsimilar conclusions about cluster expansion: several large clusters have\nexperienced sizeable growth, and a few new transmission clusters are likely\nemerging. Conclusions. The lack of a gold standard measure for clustering\nquality makes picking a best estimate among those proposed difficult. Work\naiming to refine clustering criteria would be required to improve estimates.\nNevertheless, the results unanimously stress the role that clusters play in\npromoting HIV incidence among MSMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 19:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

The deterministic model requires us to analyze asymptotic\nstability of two distinct steady states, disease-free and endemic equilibria.\nPrevious results have focused on investigating the global asymptotic stability\nof the trivial steady state using an implicit finite-difference method which\ngenerates a system of difference equations. We, instead, provide analytic\nsolutions and long term attractive behavior for the endemic steady state using\nthe theory of difference equations. The dynamics of estimated model is\nappropriately determined by a certain quantity threshold maintaining the immune\nresponse to a sufficient level. The result also indicates that a forward\nbifurcation in the model happens when the disease-free equilibrium loses its\nstability and a stable endemic equilibrium appears as the basic reproduction\nnumber exceeds unity. In this scenario, the classical requirement of the\nreproduction number being less than unity becomes a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for disease mitigation. When the associated reproduction number is in\nexcess of unity, a stable endemic equilibrium emerges with an unstable\ndisease-free equilibrium (leading to the persistence and existence of HIV\nwithin the infected individuals). The attractivity of the model reveals that\nthe disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under certain\nassumptions.

Telemetry\ndata provide a way to observe geographic position of animals over time, but not\nnecessarily changes in the dynamics of the movement process. Continuous-time\nmodels allow for statistical predictions of the trajectory in the presence of\nmeasurement error and during periods when the telemetry device did not record\nthe animal's position. However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking\nrealistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging\nto fit to large data sets and basic models lack realism in their ability to\ncapture nonstationary dynamics. We present a unified class of animal movement\nmodels that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for\naccommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and\ninteractions among individuals. We show how to nest convolution models to\nincorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for\nnonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks.

The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy\nGL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply\nthresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of\nsign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is\nshown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the\nthresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and\ninverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the\nsmallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too\nsmall. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method---as a\nconic optimization problem---has an explicit closed-form solution if the\nthresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is\nthen generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found\nto obtain an approximate solution of GL.

For these reasons, influenza\nforecasts are consequential. Producing timely and accurate influenza forecasts,\nhowever, have proven challenging due to noisy and limited data, an incomplete\nunderstanding of the disease transmission process, and the mismatch between the\ndisease transmission process and the data-generating process. In this paper, we\nintroduce a dynamic Bayesian (DB) flu forecasting model that exploits model\ndiscrepancy through a hierarchical model. The DB model allows forecasts of\npartially observed flu seasons to borrow discrepancy information from\npreviously observed flu seasons. We compare the DB model to all models that\ncompeted in the CDC's 2015--2016 flu forecasting challenge. The DB model\noutperformed all models, indicating the DB model is a leading influenza\nforecasting model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

The outflows are mapped on scales\nof 0.7-1.6 kpc, show typical outflow velocities of 300-500 km/s, and appear to\noriginate from the nuclear region. The outflows comprise hot molecular gas\nmasses of ~6-8x10$^3$ M(sun). Assuming a hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio\nof 6x10$^{-5}$, as found in nearby luminous IR galaxies, the total (hot+cold)\nmolecular gas mass in these outflows is expected to be ~1x10$^{8}$ M(sun). This\ntranslates into molecular mass outflow rates of ~30-85 M(sun)/yr, which is a\nfactor of a few lower than the star formation rate in these ULIRGs. In\naddition, most of the outflowing molecular gas does not reach the escape\nvelocity of these merger systems, which implies that the bulk of the outflowing\nmolecular gas is re-distributed within the system and thus remains available\nfor future star formation.

Because data can often be\nunseen, and because traditional machine learning algorithms are trained in a\nsupervised manner, unsupervised adaptation techniques must be used to adapt the\nmodel to the unseen data conditions. However, unsupervised adaptation is often\nchallenging, as one must generate some hypothesis given a model and then use\nthat hypothesis to bootstrap the model to the unseen data conditions.\nUnfortunately, reliability of such hypotheses is often poor, given the mismatch\nbetween the training and testing datasets. In such cases, a model hypothesis\nconfidence measure enables performing data selection for the model adaptation.\nUnderlying this approach is the fact that for unseen data conditions, data\nvariability is introduced to the model, which the model propagates to its\noutput decision, impacting decision reliability. In a fully connected network,\nthis data variability is propagated as distortions from one layer to the next.\nThis work aims to estimate the propagation of such distortion in the form of\nnetwork activation entropy, which is measured over a short- time running window\non the activation from each neuron of a given hidden layer, and these\nmeasurements are then used to compute summary entropy. This work demonstrates\nthat such an entropy measure can help to select data for unsupervised model\nadaptation, resulting in performance gains in speech recognition tasks. Results\nfrom standard benchmark speech recognition tasks show that the proposed\napproach can alleviate the performance degradation experienced under unseen\ndata conditions by iteratively adapting the model to the unseen datas acoustic\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 01:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

For such acquisition, fetal ECG (fECG) is required, rather than the\nultrasound to derive FHR. We tested one recently developed algorithm, SAVER,\nand two widely applied algorithms to extract fECG from a single channel\nmaternal ECG signal recorded over the xyphoid process rather than the routine\nabdominal signal. Approach: At 126dG, ECG was attached to near-term ewe and\nfetal shoulders, manubrium and xyphoid processes (n=12).

Recently, the h-index, which is utilized to measure both the\nproductivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar,\nhas been introduced to the network world to evaluate a node's spreading\nability. However, this method assigns too many nodes with the same value, which\nleads to a resolution limit problem in distinguishing the real influence of\nthese nodes. In this paper, we propose a local h-index centrality (LH-index)\nmethod for identifying and ranking influential nodes in networks. The LH-index\nmethod simultaneously takes into account of h-index values of the node itself\nand its neighbors, which is based on the idea that a node connects to more\ninfluential nodes will also be influential.

While energy dissipation\nand quantum effects at the barrier top can potentially affect the transmission\ncoefficient entering the rate preexponential factor, much stronger dynamical\neffects on the reaction barrier are caused by the breakdown of ergodicity for\npopulating the reaction barrier (violation of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics).\nWhen the spectrum of medium modes coupled to the reaction coordinate includes\nfluctuations slower than the reaction rate, such nuclear motions dynamically\nfreeze on the reaction time-scale and do not contribute to the activation\nbarrier. Here we consider the consequences of this scenario for electrode\nreactions in slowly relaxing media. Changing electrode overpotential speeds\nelectrode electron transfer up, potentially cutting through the spectrum of\nnuclear modes coupled to the reaction coordinate. The reorganization energy of\nelectrochemical electron transfer becomes a function of the electrode\noverpotential, switching between the thermodynamic value at low rates to the\nnonergodic limit at higher rates. The sharpness of this transition depends of\nthe relaxation spectrum of the medium. The reorganization energy experiences a\nsudden drop with increasing overpotential for a medium with a Debye relaxation,\nbut becomes a much shallower function of the overpotential for media with\nstretched exponential dynamics.

Anagram-free graph colouring was\nindependently introduced by Kam\\v{c}ev, {\\L}uczak and Sudakov and ourselves. In\nthis paper we introduce the study of anagram-free colourings of graph\nsubdivisions. We show that every graph has an anagram-free $8$-colourable\nsubdivision. The number of division vertices per edge is exponential in the\nnumber of edges. For trees, we construct anagram-free $10$-colourable\nsubdivisions with fewer division vertices per edge. Conversely, we prove lower\nbounds, in terms of division vertices per edge, on the anagram-free chromatic\nnumber for subdivisions of the complete graph and subdivisions of complete\ntrees of bounded degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 05:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

First, we define a new observable, the\n`modified mass function', that can be calculated for each binary in the sample.\nWe show that the distribution of the modified mass function follows the shape\nof the underlying MRD, turning it more advantageous than the previously used\nmass function, reduced mass function or reduced mass function logarithm.\nSecond, we derive the likelihood of the sample of modified mass functions to be\nobserved given an assumed MRD. An MCMC search enables the algorithm to find the\nparameters that best fit the observations. Third, we suggest to express the\nunknown MRD by a linear combination of a basis of functions that spans the\npossible MRDs. We suggest two such bases. Fourth, we show how to account for\nthe undetected systems that have an RV amplitude below a certain threshold.\nWithout the correction, this observational bias suppresses the derived MRD for\nlow mass ratios. Numerous simulations show that the algorithm works well with\neither of the two suggested bases. The four parts of the algorithm are\nindependent, but the combination of the four turn the algorithm to be highly\neffective in deriving the MRD of the binary population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 06:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

The high masses of\nthese red-giant planet hosts, derived using spectroscopic information and\nstellar evolution models, have been called into question.

The images were reconstructed with an abdomen\nfilter (B30) using filtered back projection (FBP) and a low, medium, and high\nlevel of SAFIRE or ADMIRE.

Results: At full dose, the median values of the NPS curves were\nsimilar for both scanners at all IR levels.

Its\noperating band (820-850 MHz) is now partly allocated to mobile phone\ncommunications, making radio astronomy challenging. We describe how the\ndeployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA) based filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs\n(Graphics Processing Units) has transformed MOST into a versatile new\ninstrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky on millisecond\ntimescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The\nfilterbanks, servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a\nhybrid solution to the observatory's signal processing requirements. The\nemphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware has enabled rapid\ndeployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal\nprocessing. The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST\nand double the sampling of the line feed, which doubles the field of view. The\nUTMOST can simultaneously excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse\npulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams for dispersed\nsingle pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar\ntiming and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have\nbeen made.

Boundary anomalies can\nsignificantly influence global diagnostics of core convection when the Rayleigh\nnumber, $Ra$, is weakly supercritical; however, little is known about the\nstrongly supercritical regime appropriate for planets. We perform numerical\nsimulations of rapidly rotating convection in a spherical shell geometry and\nimpose two patterns of boundary heat flow heterogeneity: a hemispherical\n$Y_1^1$ spherical harmonic pattern; and one derived from seismic tomography of\nEarth's lower mantle. We consider Ekman numbers $10^{-4} \\le E \\le 10^{-6}$,\nflux-based Rayleigh numbers up to $\\sim800$ times critical, and Prandtl number\nunity. The amplitude of the lateral variation in heat flux is characterised by\n$q_{\\rm L}^*=0, 2.3, 5.0$, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the outer boundary\nheat flux divided by its mean. We find that the Nusselt number, $Nu$, can be\nincreased by up to $\\sim25$\\% relative to the equivalent homogeneous case due\nto boundary-induced correlations between the radial velocity and temperature\nanomalies near the top of the shell. The $Nu$ enhancement tends to become\ngreater as the amplitude and length scale of the boundary heterogeneity are\nincreased and as the system becomes more supercritical. This $Ra$ dependence\ncan steepen the $Nu \\propto Ra^\\gamma$ scaling in the rotationally dominated\nregime, with $\\gamma$ for our most extreme case approximately $20\\%$ greater\nthan the equivalent homogeneous scaling. Therefore, it may be important to\nconsider boundary heterogeneity when extrapolating numerical results to\nplanetary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 09:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

The reduced\nrank estimator, which gives the best approximation of the observation with a\nfixed rank, is an example of a discontinuous estimator for which Stein's lemma\nactually applies. This was observed by Mukherjee et al. (2015), but the proof\nwas incomplete. This brief note gives a sufficient condition for Stein's lemma\nto hold for estimators with discontinuities, which is then shown to be\nfulfilled for a class of spectral function estimators including the reduced\nrank estimator. Singular value hard thresholding does, however, not satisfy the\ncondition, and Stein's lemma does not apply to this estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 10:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

Compared to pre-defined topics, the mined multimodal topics are more\nsemantically and visually coherent and can reflect the topic distribution of\nvideos better. We formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task\nlearning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in\naddition to the caption task.

However, boosting methods are yet to be\nsatisfactorily immune to class imbalance, especially for multi-class problems.\nThis is because most of the existing solutions for handling class imbalance\nrely on expensive cost set tuning for determining the proper level of\ncompensation. We show that the assignment of weights to the component\nclassifiers of a boosted ensemble can be thought of as a game of Tug of War\nbetween the classes in the margin space. We then demonstrate how this insight\ncan be used to attain a good compromise between the rare and abundant classes\nwithout having to resort to cost set tuning, which has long been the norm for\nimbalanced classification. The solution is based on a lexicographic linear\nprogramming framework which requires two stages. Initially, class-specific\ncomponent weight combinations are found so as to minimize a hinge loss\nindividually for each of the classes. Subsequently, the final component weights\nare assigned so that the maximum deviation from the class-specific minimum loss\nvalues (obtained in the previous stage) is minimized. Hence, the proposal is\nnot only restricted to two-class situations, but is also readily applicable to\nmulti-class problems.

In this paper, we take the first step in this direction by\nproposing a consistent estimator of asymptotic variance of the M-estimators\nbased on randomly censored data without any assumption on the form of the\ncensoring scheme. We then describe and study a class of robust Wald-type tests\nfor parametric statistical hypothesis, both simple as well as composite, under\nsuch set-up, along with their general asymptotic and robustness properties.\nRobust tests for comparing two independent randomly censored samples and robust\ntests against one sided alternatives are also discussed. Their advantages and\nusefulness are demonstrated for the tests based on the minimum density power\ndivergence estimators with specific attention to clinical trial analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 13:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 18:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Otherwise,\nfor typical parameter choices, it is safe to assume that the inflaton does not\ndecay during inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 14:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 17:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

In this contribution to the focus collection on \"What would\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this\ntarget, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such\nas generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of\nthe popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also\nhighlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like\nstatistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus\non hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key\nchallenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the\nquantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum\ndevices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of\nusing quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the\nQAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of\ndata, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the\ntraining of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this\nconcept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well\nfrom this hybrid quantum-classical framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 14:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 16:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

To examine the\ncorrelation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity, for every\nmultiplicity case considered (1<M<7), we computed the weighted average\neccentricities instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The\naverage eccentricities were calculated using the inverse of the uncertainty on\nthe eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic state of the\nexosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), a\ndiagnostic parameter used in the study of solar system and recently applied to\nexosystems.

Due to this\nseparation, crucial information about the cosmology and phenomenology of these\nmodels may be lost. In a recent study it has been shown that one can unify the\ntwo regions with a coupling function which depends on the dark energy equation\nof state. In this work we introduce a new coupling function which also unifies\nthe two regions of the parameter space and generalises the previous proposal.\nWe analyse this scenario considering the equation of state of DE to be either\nconstant or dynamical. We study the cosmology of such models and constrain both\nscenarios with the use of latest astronomical data from both background\nevolution as well as large scale structures. Our analysis shows that a non-zero\nvalue of the coupling parameter $\\xi$ as well as the dark energy equation of\nstate other than `$-1$' are allowed. However, within $1\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel, $\\xi = 0$, and the dark energy equation of state equal to `$-1$' are\ncompatible with the current data. In other words, the observational data allow\na very small but nonzero deviation from the $\\Lambda$-cosmology, however,\nwithin $1\\sigma$ confidence-region the interacting models can mimick the\n$\\Lambda$-cosmology. In fact we observe that the models both at background and\nperturbative levels are very hard to distinguish form each other and from\n$\\Lambda$-cosmology as well. Finally, we offer a rigorous analysis on the\ncurrent tension on $H_0$ allowing different regions of the dark energy equation\nof state which shows that interacting dark energy models reasonably solve the\ncurrent tension on $H_0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 13:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 09:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 04:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

In this\npaper we extract the linear dynamics of tensor perturbations in two classes of\ncosmologies with anisotropic spatial curvature. Two difficulties arise in\ncomparison to the same computation in isotropic cosmologies. First, the two\ntensor polarizations do not behave as a spin-2 field, but rather as the spin-0\nand spin-1 irreducible components of a symmetric, traceless and transverse\ntensor field, each with its own dynamics. Second, because metric perturbations\nare algebraically coupled, one cannot ignore scalar and vector modes and focus\njust on tensors --- even if one is only interested in the latter --- under the\npenalty of obtaining the wrong equations of motion. We illustrate our results\nby finding analytical solutions and evaluating the power-spectra of tensor\npolarizations in a radiation dominated universe.

Resilience,\nhere, pertains to a CI's ability to adapt or rapidly recover from disruptive\nevents. In this paper, the problem of optimizing and managing the resilience of\nCIs is studied. In particular, a comprehensive two-fold framework is proposed\nto improve CI resilience by considering both the individual CIs and their\ncollective contribution to an entire system of multiple CIs. To this end, a\nnovel analytical resilience index is proposed to measure the effect of each\nCI's physical components on its probability of failure. In particular, a Markov\nchain defining each CI's performance state and a Bayesian network modeling the\nprobability of failure are introduced to infer each CI's resilience index.\nThen, to maximize the resilience of a system of CIs, a novel approach for\nallocating resources, such as drones or maintenance personnel, is proposed. In\nparticular, a comprehensive resource allocation framework, based on the tools\nof contract theory, is proposed enabling the system operator to optimally\nallocate resources, such as, redundant components or monitoring devices to each\nindividual CI based on its economic contribution to the entire system. The\noptimal solution of the contract-based resilience resource allocation problem\nis analytically derived using dynamic programming. The proposed framework is\nthen evaluated using a case study pertaining to hydropower dams and their\ninterdependence to the power grid. Simulation results, within the case study,\nshow that the system operator can economically benefit from allocating the\nresources while dams have a 60% average improvement over their initial\nresilience indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 22:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

In extending SAC to Lie groups, the associated\nmode insertion gradient is derived and the switching time optimization on Lie\ngroups is studied. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach\nin the 2D kinematic car on SE(2) and the 3D quadrotor on SE(3). We also\nimplement iLQG on a quadrator model and compare to SAC, demonstrating that SAC\nis both faster to compute and has a larger basin of attraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

A\ncrucial first step is to answer the question: who observes what? Recently,\nseveral distributed algorithms have been proposed, which frame the\nsignal/object labelling problem in terms of cluster analysis after extracting\nsource-specific features, however, the number of clusters is assumed to be\nknown. We propose a new method called Gravitational Clustering (GC) to\nadaptively estimate the time-varying number of clusters based on a set of\nfeature vectors. The key idea is to exploit the physical principle of\ngravitational force between mass units: streaming-in feature vectors are\nconsidered as mass units of fixed position in the feature space, around which\nmobile mass units are injected at each time instant. The cluster enumeration\nexploits the fact that the highest attraction on the mobile mass units is\nexerted by regions with a high density of feature vectors, i.e., gravitational\nclusters. By sharing estimates among neighboring nodes via a\ndiffusion-adaptation scheme, cooperative and distributed cluster enumeration is\nachieved. Numerical experiments concerning robustness against outliers,\nconvergence and computational complexity are conducted. The application in a\ndistributed cooperative multi-view camera network illustrates the applicability\nto real-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

We make the application of localised\nadaptations efficient through incremental synchronisation, whereby the\nspecifier can strategically suspend specific parts of the system, whenever this\nis strictly required for ensuring that adaptations are effectively applied. We\nalso study static analysis techniques to determine whether the specified\nincremental synchronisation is in some sense adequate for local adaptations to\nbe carried out.\n  We thus identify a number of generic adaptations that can be applied to any\nactor system, regardless of its design and the code that it executes. We\nimplement the identified adaptations as an extension of an existing Runtime\nVerification tool for actor-systems, thereby creating a RA framework for\nmonitoring and mitigating actor systems. In parallel to our implementation we\nalso develop a formal model of our RA framework that further serves to guide\nour implementation. This model also enables us to better understand the subtle\nerrors that erroneously specified adaptation scripts may introduce. We thus\ndevelop a static type system for detecting and rejecting erroneous adaptation\nscripts prior to deployment, thereby providing the specifier with assistance\nfor writing valid scripts. Although the static typesystem analyses scripts with\nrespect to certain assumptions, we do not assume that the monitored system\nabides by these assumptions. We therefore augment our RA framework with dynamic\nchecks for halting monitoring whenever the system deviates from our assumption.\nBased on this dynamically checked model of our RA framework, we prove type\nsoundness for our static type system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 13:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}
