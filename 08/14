If $B$ decreases, the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment\ngives rise to pressure anisotropies with $p_{||,j} > p_{\\perp,j}$ ($p_{||,j}$\nand $p_{\\perp,j}$ represent the pressure of species $j$ ($=i$ or $e$) parallel\nand perpendicular to the magnetic field). Linear theory indicates that, for\nsufficiently large anisotropies, different velocity-space instabilities can be\ntriggered. These instabilities, which grow on scales comparable to the electron\nand ion Larmor radii, in principle have the ability to pitch-angle scatter the\nparticles, limiting the growth of the anisotropies. Our PIC simulations focus\non the nonlinear, saturated regime of the instabilities. This is done through\nthe permanent decrease of the magnetic field by an imposed shear in the plasma.\nOur results show that, in the regime $2 \\lesssim \\beta_j \\lesssim 20$ ($\\beta_j\n\\equiv 8\\pi p_j/B^2$), the saturated ion and electron pressure anisotropies are\ncontrolled by the combined effect of the oblique ion firehose (OIF) and the\nfast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) instabilities. These instabilities grow\npreferentially on the ion Larmor radius scale, and make the ion and electron\npressure anisotropies nearly equal: $\\Delta p_e/p_{||,e} \\approx \\Delta\np_i/p_{||,i}$ (where $\\Delta p_j=p_{\\perp,j} - p_{||,j}$). We also quantify the\nthermal conduction of the plasma by directly calculating the mean free path of\nelectrons along the mean magnetic field, which we find strongly depends on\nwhether $B$ decreases or increases. Our results can be applied in studies of\nlow collisionality plasmas such as the solar wind, the intracluster medium, and\nsome accretion disks around black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 16:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Deauthentication is crucial for mitigating so called Lunchtime\nAttacks, whereby an insider adversary takes over (before any inactivity timeout\nkicks in) authenticated state of a careless user who walks away from her\ncomputer. Motivated primarily by the need for an unobtrusive and continuous\nbiometric to support effective deauthentication, we introduce PoPa, a new\nhybrid biometric based on a human user's seated posture pattern. PoPa captures\na unique combination of physiological and behavioral traits. We describe a low\ncost fully functioning prototype that involves an office chair instrumented\nwith 16 tiny pressure sensors. We also explore (via user experiments) how PoPa\ncan be used in a typical workplace to provide continuous authentication (and\ndeauthentication) of users. We experimentally assess viability of PoPa in terms\nof uniqueness by collecting and evaluating posture patterns of a cohort of\nusers. Results show that PoPa exhibits very low false positive, and even lower\nfalse negative, rates. In particular, users can be identified with, on average,\n91.0% accuracy. Finally, we compare pros and cons of PoPa with those of several\nprominent biometric based deauthentication techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 01:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

We simultaneously detect\nfaces with different scales in a single forward pass of the network, but from\ndifferent layers. These properties make SSH fast and light-weight.\nSurprisingly, with a headless VGG-16, SSH beats the ResNet-101-based\nstate-of-the-art on the WIDER dataset. Even though, unlike the current\nstate-of-the-art, SSH does not use an image pyramid and is 5X faster. Moreover,\nif an image pyramid is deployed, our light-weight network achieves\nstate-of-the-art on all subsets of the WIDER dataset, improving the AP by 2.5%.\nSSH also reaches state-of-the-art results on the FDDB and Pascal-Faces datasets\nwhile using a small input size, leading to a runtime of 50 ms/image on a GPU.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/SSH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 01:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 20:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 00:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

Determination of the oxide structure,\nhowever, is often elusive through the use of indirect diffraction methods or\ntechniques that probe only the outer most layer. As a result, surface oxides\nforming on widely used materials, such as group III-nitrides, have not been\nunambiguously resolved, even though critical properties can depend sensitively\non their presence. In this work, aberration corrected scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy reveals directly, and with depth dependence, the structure\nof native two--dimensional oxides that form on AlN and GaN surfaces. Through\natomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy, we show that the oxide layers are\ncomprised of tetrahedra--octahedra cation--oxygen units, similar to bulk\n$\\theta$--Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\\beta$--Ga$_2$O$_3$. By applying density functional\ntheory, we show that the observed structures are more stable than previously\nproposed surface oxide models. We place the impact of these observations in the\ncontext of key III-nitride growth, device issues, and the recent discovery of\ntwo-dimnesional nitrides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 03:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

To solve this problem, this paper is devoted to\nderiving structural fractals of central place models from the textural\nfractals. The method is theoretical deduction based on the dimension rules of\nfractal sets. The textural fractals of central place models are reconstructed,\nthe structural dimensions are derived from the textural dimensions, and the\ncentral place fractals are formulated by the k numbers and g numbers. Three\nstructural fractal models are constructed for central place systems according\nto the corresponding fractal dimensions.

The conclusion can be reached that the\ntextural fractal dimensions can be converted into the structural fractal\ndimensions.

In fashion recommendation, the\nability to find items that goes well with a few other items based on style is\nmore important than picking a single item based on the user's entire purchase\nhistory. Since the same user may have purchased dress suits in one month and\ncasual denims in another, it is impossible to learn the latent style features\nof those items using only the user ratings. If we were able to represent the\nstyle features of fashion items in a reasonable way, we will be able to\nrecommend new items that conform to some small subset of pre-purchased items\nthat make up a coherent style set. We propose Style2Vec, a vector\nrepresentation model for fashion items. Based on the intuition of\ndistributional semantics used in word embeddings, Style2Vec learns the\nrepresentation of a fashion item using other items in matching outfits as\ncontext. Two different convolutional neural networks are trained to maximize\nthe probability of item co-occurrences. For evaluation, a fashion analogy test\nis conducted to show that the resulting representation connotes diverse fashion\nrelated semantics like shapes, colors, patterns and even latent styles.

We develop a pseudo-spectral velocity formulation of\nthe turbulence equations that smoothly interpolates between the highly\nefficient but lower resolution 3D gyrofluid representation and the conventional\nbut more expensive 5D gyrokinetic representation. Our formulation is a\nprojection of the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation onto a Laguerre-Hermite\nvelocity-space basis. We discuss issues related to collisions, closures, and\nentropy. While any collision operator can be used in the formulation, we\nhighlight a model operator that has a particularly sparse Laguerre-Hermite\nrepresentation, while satisfying conservation laws and the H theorem. Free\nstreaming, magnetic drifts, and nonlinear phase mixing each give rise to\nclosure problems, which we discuss in relation to the instabilities of interest\nand to free energy conservation. We show that the model is capable of\nreproducing gyrokinetic results for linear instabilities and zonal flow\ndynamics. Thus the final model is appropriate for the study of instabilities,\nturbulence, and transport in a wide range of geometries, including tokamaks and\nstellarators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 08:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The social\nconnections between people using these OSNs are formed as virtual links (e.g.,\nfriendship and following connections) that connect people. These links are the\nheart of today's OSNs as they facilitate all of the activities that the members\nof a social network can do. However, many of these networks suffer from noisy\nlinks, i.e., links that do not reflect a real relationship or links that have a\nlow intensity, that change the structure of the network and prevent accurate\nanalysis of these networks. Hence, a process for assessing and ranking the\nlinks in a social network is crucial in order to sustain a healthy and real\nnetwork. Here, we define link assessment as the process of identifying noisy\nand non-noisy links in a network. In this paper, we address the problem of link\nassessment and link ranking in social networks using external interaction\nnetworks. In addition to a friendship social network, additional exogenous\ninteraction networks are utilized to make the assessment process more\nmeaningful. We employed machine learning classifiers for assessing and ranking\nthe links in the social network of interest using the data from exogenous\ninteraction networks. The method was tested with two different datasets, each\ncontaining the social network of interest, with the ground truth, along with\nthe exogenous interaction networks. The results show that it is possible to\neffectively assess the links of a social network using only the structure of a\nsingle network of the exogenous interaction networks, and also using the\nstructure of the whole set of exogenous interaction networks. The experiments\nshowed that some classifiers do better than others regarding both link\nclassification and link ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 08:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

The geometry of the bubbles is systematically\nvaried from spherical to very non-spherical by decreasing their distance to a\nfree or rigid surface or by modulating the gravity-induced pressure gradient\naboard parabolic flights. The non-spherical collapse produces multiple shocks\nthat are clearly associated with different processes, such as the jet impact\nand the individual collapses of the distinct bubble segments. For bubbles\ncollapsing near a free surface, the energy and timing of each shock are\nmeasured separately as a function of the anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, which\nrepresents the dimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. For a given\nsource of bubble deformation (free surface, rigid surface or gravity), the\nnormalized shock energy depends only on $\\zeta$, irrespective of the bubble\nradius $R_{0}$ and driving pressure $\\Delta p$. Based on this finding, we\ndevelop a predictive framework for the peak pressure and energy of shock waves\nfrom non-spherical bubble collapses. Combining statistical analysis of the\nexperimental data with theoretical derivations, we find that the shock peak\npressures can be estimated as jet impact-induced hammer pressures, expressed as\n$p_{h} = 0.45\\left(\\rho c^{2}\\Delta p\\right)^{1/2} \\zeta^{-1}$ at $\\zeta >\n10^{-3}$.

This paper investigates a slow fading scenario, where a transmitter\n(Alice) sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver (Bob) while a\npassive eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to decode the message from its received\nsignal. It is assumed that Alice is equipped with multiple antennas while Bob\nand Eve each have a single antenna (i.e., a MISOSE system). In a MISOSE system,\nhigh correlation results in nearly collinear main and wiretap channel vectors,\nwhich help Eve to see and intercept confidential information. Unfortunately,\nthe signal processing techniques at Alice, such as beamforming and artificial\nnoise (AN), are helpless, especially in the extreme case of completely\ncollinear main and wiretap channel vectors. On this background, we first\ninvestigate the achievable secrecy outage probability via beamforming and AN at\nAlice with the optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal\nand AN. Then, an ingenious model, in which a cooperative jamming relay (Relay)\nis introduced, is proposed to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high\ncorrelation. Based on the proposed model, the power allocation between the\ninformation-bearing signal at Alice and the AN at Relay is also studied to\nmaximize secrecy. Finally, to validate our proposed schemes, numerical\nsimulations are conducted, and the results show that a significant performance\ngain with respect to secrecy is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 09:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Our main point is that the time sequence of the\neruptions did not go with these parameters. It is argued that an additional\nfactor, in the form of stabilizing force, should operate to determine the onset\nof the first eruption and temporal behaviors of subsequent eruptions. As\nsupporting evidence, we report that the heating and fast plasma flow continuing\nfor a timescale of an hour was the direct cause for the first eruption, and\nthat the unidirectional propagation of the disturbance determined the timing of\nsubsequent eruptions.

The active region had the positive polarity magnetic fields in the center\nsurrounded by the negative polarity fields around. Since such a distribution of\nmagnetic polarity tends to form a dome-like magnetic fan structure confined\nover the active region, the multiple eruptions was puzzling. Our investigation\nreveals that this event exhibits several properties distinct from other\neruptions associated with magnetic fan structures: (i) a long filament\nencircling the active region was present before the eruptions; (ii) expansion\nof the open-closed boundary of the field lines after each eruption suggestive\nof the growing fan-dome structure, and (iii) the ribbons inside the closed\nmagnetic polarity inversion line evolving in response to the expanding\nopen-closed boundary. It thus appears that in spite of multiple eruptions the\nfan-dome structure remained undamaged, and the closing back field lines after\neach eruption rather reinforced the fan-dome structure. We argue that the\nmultiple eruptions could occur in this active region in spite of its confined\nmagnetic structure because the filament encircling the active region was\nadequate for slipping through the magnetic separatrix to minimize the damage to\nits overlying fan-dome structure.

Online Social Networks (OSNs) are increasingly used for social\ninteractions in the modern digital era, which bring new challenges and concerns\nin terms of privacy. Most social networks today offer very limited mechanisms\nto express the desires of users in terms of how information that affects their\nprivacy is shared. In particular, most current privacy policy formalisms allow\nonly static policies, which are not rich enough to express timed properties\nlike \"my location after work should not be disclosed to my boss\". The logic we\npresent in this paper enables to express rich properties and policies in terms\nof the knowledge available to the different users and the precise time of\nactions and deductions. Our framework can be instantiated for different OSNs,\nby specifying the effect of the actions in the evolution of the social network\nand in the knowledge disclosed to each agent.\n  We present an algorithm for deducing knowledge, which can also be\ninstantiated with different variants of how the epistemic information is\npreserved through time.

We introduce a new embedding technique based on low-depth\ndecompositions of a graph via shortest paths. The notion of Shortest Path\nDecomposition depth is inductively defined: A (weighed) path graph has shortest\npath decomposition (SPD) depth $1$. General graph has an SPD of depth $k$ if it\ncontains a shortest path whose deletion leads to a graph, each of whose\ncomponents has SPD depth at most $k-1$. In this paper we give an\n$O(k^{\\min\\{\\frac{1}{p},\\frac{1}{2}\\}})$-distortion embedding for graphs of SPD\ndepth at most $k$. This result is asymptotically tight for any fixed $p>1$,\nwhile for $p=1$ it is tight up to second order terms.\n  As a corollary of this result, we show that graphs having pathwidth $k$ embed\ninto $\\ell_p$ with distortion $O(k^{\\min\\{\\frac{1}{p},\\frac{1}{2}\\}})$. For\n$p=1$, this improves over the best previous bound of Lee and Sidiropoulos that\nwas exponential in $k$; moreover, for other values of $p$ it gives the first\nembeddings whose distortion is independent of the graph size $n$.

We\nobserved with XMM-Newton a sample of 5 bow shock runaways, which constitutes a\nsignificant improvement of the sample of bow shock runaways studied in X-rays\nso far. A careful analysis of the data did not reveal any X-ray emission\nrelated to the bow shocks. However, X-ray emission from the stars is detected,\nin agreement with the expected thermal emission from stellar winds. On the\nbasis of background measurements we derive conservative upper limits between\n0.3 and 10 keV on the bow shocks emission. Using a simple radiation model,\nthese limits together with radio upper limits allow us to constrain some of the\nmain physical quantities involved in the non-thermal emission processes, such\nas the magnetic field strength and the amount of incident infrared photons. The\nreasons likely responsible for the non-detection of non-thermal radiation are\ndiscussed.

Originally invented as a concept in field theory for\nnuclear interactions, skyrmions are central to a wide range of phenomena in\ncondensed matter. Their realization at room temperature (RT) in magnetic\nmultilayers has generated considerable interest, fueled by technological\nprospects and the access granted to fundamental questions. The interaction of\nskyrmions with charge carriers gives rise to exotic electrodynamics, such as\nthe topological Hall effect (THE), the Hall response to an emergent magnetic\nfield, a manifestation of the skyrmion Berry-phase. The proposal that THE can\nbe used to detect skyrmions needs to be tested quantitatively. For that it is\nimperative to develop comprehensive understanding of skyrmions and other chiral\ntextures, and their electrical fingerprint. Here, using Hall transport and\nmagnetic imaging, we track the evolution of magnetic textures and their THE\nsignature in a technologically viable multilayer film as a function of\ntemperature ($T$) and out-of-plane applied magnetic field ($H$).

The recurrence depth is extended by several\nintermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in\ndetermining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the\npaper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and\nimproving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1)\nDetermining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different\ntasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally\nwasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and\nhigh latency. Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with\nthe use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing\nfunction taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the\nproposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each\ninput. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate\nhidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is\nachieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate\nlayer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all\nintermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an\nexpansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the\neffectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments:\nregression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling\non the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance\nthan other state-of-the-art recurrent networks in all three experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 13:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

In the form used in this paper, which we call `process\nterminality', it states that when the output of a process is discarded, then\nthe process itself may as well be discarded. While causal structure and process\nterminality at first seem to be entirely different notions, they become\nequivalent when making explicit what the partial order actually encodes, that\nis, that an event in the past can influence one in its future, but not\nvice-versa. The framework in which we establish this equivalence is that of\nprocess theories. We show how several previous results are instances of this\nresult and comment on how this framework could provide an ideal, minimal canvas\nfor crafting theories of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 13:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The method arises from the specialisation of established variational\ntechniques to the unstable periodic orbits of the system.

The adjoint\nsolution remains bounded in time and does not exhibit the typical unbounded\nexponential growth observed using traditional methods over unstable\nnon-periodic trajectories (Lea et al., Tellus 52 (2000)). This enables the\nsensitivity of period averaged quantities to be calculated exactly, regardless\nof the orbit period, because the stability of the tangent dynamics is decoupled\neffectively from the sensitivity calculations. We demonstrate the method on two\nprototypical systems, the Lorenz equations at standard parameters and the\nKuramoto-Sivashinky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation\nwith chaotic behaviour.

Methods: We modelled a fundamental standing kink mode in a\nstraight, density-enhanced magnetic flux tube using the magnetohydrodynamics\ncode, Lare3d. In order to evaluate the impact of an azimuthal component of the\nmagnetic field, various degrees of twist were included within the flux tube's\nmagnetic field. Results: The process of resonant absorption is only weakly\naffected by the presence of a twisted magnetic field. However, the subsequent\nevolution of the KHI is sensitive to the strength of the azimuthal component of\nthe field. Increased twist values inhibit the deformation of the loop's density\nprofile, which is associated with the growth of the instability. Despite this,\nmuch smaller scales in the magnetic field are generated when there is a\nnon-zero azimuthal component present. Hence, the instability is more energetic\nin cases with (even weakly) twisted fields. Field aligned flows at the loop\napex are established in a twisted regime once the instability has formed.\nConclusions: The KHI may have implications for wave heating in the solar\natmosphere due to the creation of small length scales and the generation of a\nturbulent regime. Whilst magnetic twist does suppress the development of the\nvortices associated with the instability, the formation of the KHI in a twisted\nregime will be accompanied by greater Ohmic dissipation due to the larger\ncurrents that are produced, even if only weak twist is present. The presence of\nmagnetic twist will likely make the instability more difficult to detect in the\ncorona, but will enhance its contribution to heating the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 14:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The interaction of the homogenised stochastic flow\n$\\dd g$ with the slow flow of the big whorl is obtained by going into its\nnon-inertial moving reference frame, via the composition of maps $(\\dd g)l_{\\ep\nt}$.

As the coupling strength passes a\nthreshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal\npopulation has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic\nburst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold\nneurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise\nintensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying\nthe noise intensity $D$ in the Barab\\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for\nthe case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a\npower-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a\nfew \"hubs\" (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a \"Matthew\" effect in\nsynaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good\nburst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic\nstrengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression\n(LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing\n$D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In\nthe presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network\narchitecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic\nstrengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the\ndistributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the\npost-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the\npost-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a\nmultiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in\ncomparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 04:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 07:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}
