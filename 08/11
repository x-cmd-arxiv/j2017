Though\na variety of methods have been proposed, it still remains an open question how\nto predict the temporal boundaries of action segments precisely. Most works use\nsegment-level classifiers to select video segments pre-determined by action\nproposal or dense sliding windows. However, in order to achieve more precise\naction boundaries, a temporal localization system should make dense predictions\nat a fine granularity. A newly proposed work exploits\nConvolutional-Deconvolutional-Convolutional (CDC) filters to upsample the\npredictions of 3D ConvNets, making it possible to perform per-frame action\npredictions and achieving promising performance in terms of temporal action\nlocalization. However, CDC network loses temporal information partially due to\nthe temporal downsampling operation. In this paper, we propose an elegant and\npowerful Temporal Preservation Convolutional (TPC) Network that equips 3D\nConvNets with TPC filters. TPC network can fully preserve temporal resolution\nand downsample the spatial resolution simultaneously, enabling frame-level\ngranularity action localization.

In\nthe latter case we obtain a spectrum of hybrid homodyne-heterodyne character,\nwith motional sidebands of combined amplitudes comparable to homodyne. We term\nsuch recovery of lost heterodyne correlations with filter functions\nr-heterodyning: although investigated here in a thermal regime, its robustness\nand generality represents a promising new approach to sensing of quantum-scale\ndisplacements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 16:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 11:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Cell detection methods have evolved\nfrom employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The\nessential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are\ntrained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In\nthis paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output\npixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely\nlabeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections\nto encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN\nregresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is\npossible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from\nthe predicted compressed vector using $L_1$-norm optimization. In the past,\noutput space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in\nconjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space\nencoding.

The results achieved are on par\nwith the character embedding-based models, and close to the state-of-the-art\nword embedding-based models, with 90% smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and\n80% fewer parameters than the character embedding-based models and word\nembedding-based models respectively. The results suggest that the radical\nembedding-based approach is cost-effective for machine learning on Chinese and\nJapanese.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 17:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-11"}

We employed a novel deposition technique, i.e.\nbiased target ion beam deposition technique (BTIBD) to prepare Nb thin films\nwith controlled crystallinity and surface morphology. We found that the target\ncurrent (ITarget) and the target bias (VTarget) were critical to the\ncrystallinity and surface morphology of Nb films. The high target current\n(ITarget >500 mA and VTarget = 400 V bias) during the deposition degraded the\nNb crystallinity, and subsequently reduced the critical temperature for\nsuperconductivity (Tc). VTarget was critical to the surface morphology, i.e.\ngrain size and shape and the surface roughness. The optimized growth condition\nyielded very smooth film with RMS roughness of 0.4 nm that was an order of\nmagnitude smoother than that of Nb films by sputtering process. The critical\ntemperature for superconductivity was also close to the value of the bulk Nb.\nThe quality of Nb film was evident in the presence of a very thin proximity\nlayer (~ 0.8 nm).

Specifically, we first\ntrain two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part\nFCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part\npotential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are\nfused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel\nsegment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial\nconsistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose\nand the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the\nskeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part\nsegments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human\ndetection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty\ntimes faster.\n  Since there's no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we\nextend the PASCAL VOC part dataset with human pose joints and perform extensive\nexperiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies.

One approach to achieve anonymity is to relay messages\nthrough multiple routers, where each router shuffles messages independently. To\nachieve anonymity, at least one router needs to be honest. In the presence of\nan adversary that is controlling a subset of the routers unbiased routing is\nimportant for guaranteeing anonymity. However, the routing strategy also\ninfluenced other factors such as the scalability and the performance of the\nsystem. One solution is to use a fixed route for relaying all messages with\nmany routers. If the route is not fixed the routing decision can either be made\nby the communication initiator or the intermediate routers. However, the\nexisting routing types each have limitations. For example, one faces\nscalability issues when increasing the throughput of systems with fixed routes.\nMoreover, when the routing decision is left to the initiator, the initiator\nneeds to maintain an up-to-date view of the system at all times, which also\ndoes not scale. If the routing decision is left to intermediate routers the\nrouting of the communication can be influenced by an adversary.

Focusing on the early stages of\ntumor evolution, we enunciate the principles involved in cell dynamics and\nhighlight their implications in understanding similar behavior in seemingly\nunrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of\nCD8$^{+}$ T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal\nthree dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell\ninteractions as well as cell birth and death to establish that cell growth\nrate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological\nniches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the\ntumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The\nmean square displacement, $\\Delta(t)$, of cells exhibits glassy behavior at\ntimes comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive\nbehavior, $\\Delta (t) \\approx t^{\\alpha}$ ($\\alpha > 1$), at longer times. We\nderive the value of $\\alpha \\approx 1.33$ using a field theoretic approach\nbased on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality\nof super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems.\nSuper diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell\nbirth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also\nsuggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative\nagreement with {\\it in vitro} experiments. Although set in the context of tumor\ninvasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in\ngrowing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of\nparticles play a role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 22:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 00:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Efficiency is then achieved by minimizing the storage overhead\nand the amount of data transmission required for data reconstruction and\nrepair, provided by coding solutions such as regenerating codes [1]. Common\nexplicit regenerating code constructions enable efficient repair through\naccessing a predefined number, $d$, of arbitrary chosen available nodes, namely\nhelpers. In practice, however, the state of the system dynamically changes\nbased on the request load, the link traffic, etc., and the parameters which\noptimize system's performance vary accordingly. It is then desirable to have\ncoding schemes which are able to operate optimally under a range of different\nparameters simultaneously. Specifically, adaptivity in the number of helper\nnodes for repair is of interest. While robustness requires capability of\nperforming repair with small number of helpers, it is desirable to use as many\nhelpers as available to reduce the transmission delay and total repair traffic.\n  In this work we focus on the minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, where\neach node is supposed to store $\\alpha$ information units, and the source data\nof size $k\\alpha$ could be recovered from any arbitrary set of $k$ nodes.

In this paper we propose a Pose\nguided structured Region Ensemble Network (Pose-REN) to boost the performance\nof hand pose estimation. The proposed method extracts regions from the feature\nmaps of convolutional neural network under the guide of an initially estimated\npose, generating more optimal and representative features for hand pose\nestimation. The extracted feature regions are then integrated hierarchically\naccording to the topology of hand joints by employing tree-structured fully\nconnections. A refined estimation of hand pose is directly regressed by the\nproposed network and the final hand pose is obtained by utilizing an iterative\ncascaded method. Comprehensive experiments on public hand pose datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 00:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 02:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Optical flow can be used for kernel estimation since it predicts\nmotion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex\nscenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this\npaper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the\nscene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide\noptical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the\nblur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this\nassumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is\ndifferent from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship\nbetween motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise\nnon-linear kernel model to account for motion blur.

A popular strategy is to represent\noriginal data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of\nmachine learning methods have been utilized, but they often lack expressiveness\nand flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent\nadvances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its\ncapability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex\ndata. Especially, deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness\nof probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural\nnetworks, which is very suitable for text modeling. However, little work has\nleveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing.\n  In this paper, we propose a series of novel deep document generative models\nfor text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one\nis supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model\nfurther considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of\nwords. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides\na principled framework for model extension, uncertainty estimation, simulation,\nand interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization,\nthe proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks\nand thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed\nrepresentations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of\nexperiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 05:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

Our preliminary results show that the features\ngenerated and selected are capable of improving the classification results to\ndistinguish between anomalies and normal BGP update messages. Furthermore, the\nclustering results demonstrate the effectiveness of formed models to detect the\nsimilar types of BGP anomalies. In a more general context, an interdisciplinary\nresearch is performed between network security and data mining to deal with\nreal-world problems and the achieved results are promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

We showed previously that in the solar case it induces RV variations\nwith an amplitude over the cycle on the order of 8 m/s, with signals on short\nand long timescales. The major component is the inhibition of the convective\nblueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major\ncomponent of stellar radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars. The\nconvective blueshift depends on line depths; we use this property to develop a\nmethod that will characterize the amplitude of this effect and to correct for\nthis RV component. We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs\ncomputed using different sets of lines, including lines in different depth\nranges. We characterize the performance of the method used to reconstruct the\nsignal without the convective component and the detection limits derived from\nthe residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set\nof lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good\nprecision and to correct for it. For the full temporal sampling, the power in\nthe range 100-500~d significantly decreased, by a factor of 100 for a RV noise\nbelow 30 cm/s. We also studied the impact of noise contributions other than the\nphoton noise, which lead to uncertainties on the RV computation, as well as the\nimpact of the temporal sampling. We found that these other sources of noise do\nnot greatly alter the quality of the correction, although they need a better\nnoise level to reach a similar performance level. A very good correction of the\nconvective component can be achieved providing very good RV noise levels\ncombined with a very good instrumental stability and realistic granulation\nnoise. Under the conditions considered in this paper, detection limits at 480~d\nlower than 1 MEarth could be achieved for RV noise below 15 cm/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

A disjoining pressure model is introduced to simulate the\npartial wetting process near moving contact line. The fingering number in high\n$Bo$ coating flow is focused on from a linear perspective.

We investigate a two-locus model in which two diallelic, recombining\nloci are subject to selection caused by an abrupt environmental change. The\nhabitat is one-dimensional and unbounded, selection at each locus is modeled by\nstep functions such that in one region one allele at each locus is advantageous\nand in the other deleterious. We admit an environmentally independent,\nintermediate degree of dominance at both loci, including complete dominance.\nFirst, we derive an explicit expression for the single-locus cline with\ndominance, thus generalizing classical results by Haldane (1948). We show that\nthe slope of the cline in the center (at the step) or, equivalently, the width\nof the cline, is independent of the degree of dominance. Second, under the\nassumption of strong recombination relative to selection and migration, the\nfirst-order approximations of the allele-frequency clines at each of the loci\nand of the linkage disequilibrium are derived. This may be interpreted as the\nquasi-linkage-equilibrium approximation of the two-locus cline. Explicit\nasymptotic expressions for the clines are deduced as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$. For\nequivalent loci, explicit expressions for the whole clines are derived. The\ninfluence of dominance and of linkage on the slope of the cline in the center\nand on a global measure of steepness are investigated. This global measure\nreflects the influence of dominance. Finally, the accuracy of the\napproximations and the dependence of the shape of the two-locus cline on the\nfull range of recombination rates is explored by numerical integration of the\nunderlying system of partial differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 10:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Optical polarization measurements showed dramatic\nchanges during the flare, with a strong anti-correlation between optical flux\nand degree of polarization (which rose from ~ 3% to ~ 20%) during the declining\nphase of the flare. The flare was accompanied by large rapid swings in\npolarization angle of ~ 170 degree. This combination of behaviors appear to be\nunique. We have cm-band radio data during the same period but they show no\ncorrelation with variations at higher frequencies.

Smartphone users trade\naccess to this data by permitting apps to use it, and in return obtain\nfunctionality provided by the apps. In many cases, however, users fail to\nappreciate the scale or sensitivity of the data that they share with\nthird-parties when they use apps. To this end, prior work has looked at the\nthreat to privacy posed by apps and the third-party libraries that they embed.\nPrior work, however, fails to paint a realistic picture of the full threat to\nsmartphone users, as it has typically examined apps and third-party libraries\nin isolation.\n  In this paper, we describe a novel and potentially devastating privilege\nescalation attack that can be performed by third-party libraries. This attack,\nwhich we call intra-library collusion, occurs when a single library embedded in\nmore than one app on a device leverages the combined set of permissions\navailable to it to pilfer sensitive user data. The possibility for\nintra-library collusion exists because libraries obtain the same privileges as\ntheir host app and popular libraries will likely be used by more than one app\non a device.\n  Using a real-world dataset of over 30,000 smartphones, we find that many\npopular third-party libraries have the potential to aggregate significant\nsensitive data from devices by using intra-library collusion. We demonstrate\nthat several popular libraries already collect enough data to facilitate this\nattack. Using historical data, we show that risks from intra-library collusion\nhave increased significantly over the last two-and-a-half years. We conclude\nwith recommendations for mitigating the aforementioned problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 12:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

We explore the\ngeneral problem of characterizing how and when the transition from near-laminar\nstates to sustained turbulence occurs; a model of the interchange instability\nbeing used as a concrete example. These questions are fundamentally nonlinear,\nand the answers must go beyond the linear transient amplification of small\nperturbations. Two methods that account for nonlinear interactions are\ntherefore explored here. The first method explored is edge tracking, which\nidentifies the boundary between the basins of attraction of the laminar and\nturbulent states. Here, the edge is found to be structured around an exact,\nlocalized, traveling wave solution; a solution that is qualitatively similar to\navalanche-like bursts seen in the turbulent regime. The second method is an\napplication of nonlinear, non-modal stability theory which allows us to\nidentify the smallest disturbances which can trigger turbulence (the minimal\nseed for the problem) and hence to quantify how stable the laminar regime is.\nThe results obtained from these fully nonlinear methods provides confidence in\nthe derivation of a semi-analytic approximation for the minimal seed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 14:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 15:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

It is either found or predicted, usually at\nextreme conditions, for a broad group of very different substances, including\nhelium, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur,tellurium, cerium, hydrogen and\ntin tetraiodide. This phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply\nsupercooled water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental\nlimit of homogeneous ice formation. We present a generic phenomenological\napproach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component fluid, which is\ncompletely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. We show that\nfluid polyamorphism may occur either in the presence or the absence of fluid\nphase separation depending on the symmetry of the order parameter. In the\nlatter case, it is associated with a second-order transition, such as in liquid\nhelium or liquid sulfur. To specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with\nthermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct interconvertible states or\nmolecular structures. A fundamental signature of this concept is the\nidentification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules involved in each of\nthese alternative states. However, the existence of the alternative structures\nmay result in polyamorphic fluid phase separation only if mixing of these\nstructures is not ideal. The two-state thermodynamics unifies all the debated\nscenarios of fluid polyamorphism in different areas of condensed-matter\nphysics, with or without phase separation, and even goes beyond the phenomenon\nof polyamorphism by generically describing the anomalous properties of fluids\nexhibiting interconversion of alternative molecular states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 15:27:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 08:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We\npresent the Structural Signature (SS) vector, which is composed of a 1st\nsignature value, two symmetry marks, and a group mark. As a necessary condition\nfor NPN Boolean matching, the structural signature is more effective than is\nthe traditional signature. Two Boolean functions, f and g, may be equivalent\nwhen they have the same SS vector. The symmetry mark can distinguish symmetric\nvariables and asymmetric variables and search multiple variable mappings in a\nsingle variable-mapping search operation, which reduces the search space\nsignificantly. Updating the SS vector using Shannon decomposition provides\nbenefits in distinguishing unidentified variables, and the group mark and the\nphase collision check discover incorrect variable mappings quickly, which also\nspeeds up the NPN Boolean matching process.

Game theory\nhas widespread application in economic, social and biological sciences. In\nrecent years quantum versions of classical games have been proposed and\nstudied. In this paper, we consider a quantum version of the classical\nBarro-Gordon game which captures the problem of time inconsistency in monetary\neconomics. Such time inconsistency refers to the temptation of weak policy\nmaker to implement high inflation when the public expects low inflation. The\ninconsistency arises when the public punishes the weak policy maker in the next\ncycle. We first present a quantum version of the Barro-Gordon game. Next, we\nshow that in a particular case of the quantum game, time-consistent Nash\nequilibrium could be achieved when public expects low inflation, thus resolving\nthe game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 19:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

With increasing pumping energy, exciton-photon coupling strength\nis weakened due to carrier screening effect, leading to occurrence of photonic\nlasing instead of polartion lasing. The demonstrated strong coupling between\nphotons and excitons in perovskite microcavities would be helpful for\ndevelopment of high performance polariton-based incoherent and coherent light\nsources, nonlinear optics, and slow light applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 03:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}
