Besides relying in the\nconventional way on ratios of masses, we elaborate on a form introduced by\nAllton, which incorporates asymptotic scaling behavior. Ultimately we find\nthat, though still small, our systematic errors are considerably larger than\nour statistical errors. ~\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 16:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

However, they fail to\nidentify which Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack.\nClearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic,\nisolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme,\ncalled Viden (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the\nattacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The\nfirst phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the\nmeasured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter.\nViden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the\ntransmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the\nvoltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since Viden adapts its profiles\nto changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU\nunder various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with\nmodern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily\ndeployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype\nand two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs\nbased solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a\nlow false identification rate of 0.2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 16:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

We describe experimental results on observed single-mode and multimode\nspectra, thermal tuning, and polarization characteristics of such microlasers.\nUsing a simple analysis of spherical microresonator modes and including\nconsiderations of pump and laser mode overlap we provide guidelines for\noptimized microlaser design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 17:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

However, evolving the full Boltzmann\nequations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the\nimplementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation\nhydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's\nequation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based\non a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum\ndensity of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in\nmissing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the\nradiation. Instead of the approximate analytical closure currently used in\ncore-collapse and merger simulations, we complement the two-moment scheme with\na low-accuracy Monte-Carlo evolution. The Monte-Carlo results can provide any\nor all of the missing information in the evolution of the moments, as desired\nby the user.

After adding the orientifolds, it is known that the gauge\ngroup of the ABJ theory becomes O(N_1)xUSp(2N_2) while the background of the\nstring theory is replaced by AdS_4 x CP^3/Z_2, and the supersymmetries in the\nboth theories reduce to N=5.

Time and space complexity classes for reversible\nmachines match conventional ones, but we conjecture that the joint space-time\ncomplexity classes are different, and that a particular reduction by Bennett\nminimizes the space-time product complexity of general reversible computations.\nWe provide an oracle-relativized proof of the separation, and of a lower bound\non space for linear-time reversible simulations. A non-oracle proof applies\nwhen a read-only input is omitted from the space accounting. Both constructions\nmodel one-way function iteration, conjectured to be a problem for which\nBennett's algorithm is optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

In 2016 Carnielli and\nConiglio introduced a class of multialgebras called swap structures, as a\nsemantic framework for dealing with several logics of formal inconsistency (or\nLFIs) which cannot be semantically characterized by a single finite matrix. In\nparticular, these LFIs are not algebraizable by the standard tools of abstract\nalgebraic logic. In this paper, the first steps towards a theory of\nnon-deterministic algebraization of logics by swap structures are given.\nSpecifically, a formal study of swap structures for LFIs is developed, by\nadapting concepts of universal algebra to multialgebras in a suitable way. A\ndecomposition theorem similar to Birkhoff's representation theorem is obtained\nfor each class of swap structures. Moreover, when applied to the 3-valued\nalgebraizable logic J3 the usual class of algebraic models is recovered, and\nthe swap structures semantics became twist-structures semantics (as introduced\nby Fidel-Vakarelov). This fact, together with the existence of a functor from\nthe category of Boolean algebras to the category of swap structures for each\nLFI, which is closely connected with Kalman's functor, suggests that swap\nstructures can be considered as non-deterministic twist structures, opening so\ninteresting possibilities for dealing with non-algebraizable logics by means of\nmultialgebraic semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 19:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

To assess its process\ncomponents, a large variety of non-compartmental parameters (i.e., composite\nmeasures of substance concentrations at different points in time) like the area\nunder the concentration-time curve (AUC) are utilized. However, a systematic\nevaluation and validation of these parameters based on a physiologically\nplausible model of cortisol secretion has not been performed so far. Thus, a\npopulation pharmacokinetic (mixed-effects SDE) model was developed and fitted\nto densely sampled salivary cortisol data of 10 males from Montreal, Canada,\nand sparsely sampled data of 200 mixed-sex participants from Dresden, Germany,\nwho completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Besides the two major\nprocess components representing (1) stress-related cortisol secretion\n(reactivity) and (2) cortisol elimination (recovery), the model incorporates\ntwo additional, often disregarded components: (3) the secretory delay after\nstress onset, and (4) deviations from the projected steady-state concentration.\nThe fitted model (R2 = 99%) was thereafter used to investigate the correlation\nstructure of the four individually varying, and readily interpretable model\nparameters and eleven popular non-compartmental parameters. Based on these\nanalyses, we recommend to use the minimum-maximum cortisol difference and the\nminimum concentration as proxy measures of reactivity and recovery,\nrespectively.

Many of these features\nbenefit users by enabling new types of web applications. However, some features\nalso bring risk to users' privacy and security, whether through implementation\nerror, unexpected composition, or unintended use.

Restricting access to only\nthe features which are necessary for delivering desired functionality on a\ngiven website would allow users to enforce the principle of lease privilege on\nuse of the myriad APIs present in the modern web browser.\n  However, security benefits gained by increasing restrictions must be balanced\nagainst the risk of breaking existing websites. This work addresses this\nproblem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving\nwebsites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the\nnumber of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and\nthe cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to\nthe functionality.

When social influence takes place in experiments on a\npopulation of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect\nthe outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis\ndevelops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where\ninterference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference).\nIn this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and\nflexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of\nprimary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are\nestimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on\nthe unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights\nthe importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential\noutcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced\ncovariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the\ncausal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model\nmis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in\nreal-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and\nconfounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based\nimputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate\nthis principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes\nduring the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying\nnetwork topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis\nasserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an\nopportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 20:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Parker's\nconjecture that spontaneous current singularities lead to nanoflares that heat\nthe corona has been controversial. In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), can\ngenuine current singularities emerge from a smooth 3D line-tied magnetic field?\nTo numerically resolve this issue, the schemes employed must preserve magnetic\ntopology exactly to avoid artificial reconnection in the presence of singular\ncurrent densities. Structure-preserving numerical methods are favorable for\nmitigating numerical dissipation, and variational integration is a powerful\nmachinery for deriving them. In this thesis, we develop variational integrators\nfor ideal MHD in Lagrangian labeling by discretizing Newcomb's Lagrangian on a\nmoving mesh using discretized exterior calculus. With the built-in frozen-in\nequation, the schemes are free of artificial reconnection, hence optimal for\nstudying current singularity formation.\n  Using this method, we first study a fundamental prototype problem in 2D, the\nHahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem. It considers the effect of boundary\nperturbations on a 2D plasma magnetized by a sheared field, and its linear\nsolution is singular. We find that with increasing resolution, the nonlinear\nsolution converges to one with a current singularity. We then extend the HKT\nproblem to 3D line-tied geometry, which models the solar corona by anchoring\nthe field lines in the boundaries. The linear solution, which is singular in\n2D, is found to be smooth. The nonlinear solution turns out smooth for short\nsystems. Nonetheless, the scaling of peak current density vs. system length\nsuggests that the nonlinear solution may become singular at a finite length.\nWith the results in hand, we cannot confirm or rule out this possibility\nconclusively, since we cannot obtain solutions with system lengths near the\nextrapolated critical value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 20:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

For this reason, accurately predicting flow and\ntransport in fractured systems is vital for improving the performance of\nsubsurface applications. Fracture sizes in these systems can range from\nmillimeters to kilometers. Although, modeling flow and transport using the\ndiscrete fracture network (DFN) approach is known to be more accurate due to\nincorporation of the detailed fracture network structure over continuum-based\nmethods, capturing the flow and transport in such a wide range of scales is\nstill computationally intractable. Furthermore, if one has to quantify\nuncertainty, hundreds of realizations of these DFN models have to be run. To\nreduce the computational burden, we solve flow and transport on a graph\nrepresentation of a DFN. We study the accuracy of the graph approach by\ncomparing breakthrough times and tracer particle statistical data between the\ngraph-based and the high-fidelity DFN approaches, for fracture networks with\nvarying number of fractures and degree of heterogeneity. We show that the graph\napproach shows a consistent bias with up to an order of magnitude slower\nbreakthrough when compared to the DFN approach. We show that this is due to\ngraph algorithm's under-prediction of the pressure gradients across\nintersections on a given fracture, leading to slower tracer particle speeds\nbetween intersections and longer travel times. We present a bias correction\nmethodology to the graph algorithm that reduces the discrepancy between the DFN\nand graph predictions. We show that with this bias correction, the graph\nalgorithm predictions significantly improve and the results are very accurate.\nThe good accuracy and the low computational cost, with $O(10^4)$ times lower\ntimes than the DFN, makes the graph algorithm, an ideal technique to\nincorporate in uncertainty quantification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 23:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 20:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The surface is fabricated using\nphotolithography and high-speed visualization is employed to record the\ntime-varying droplet shapes in transverse as well as longitudinal direction.\nThe effect of the pitch of the grooved surface and Weber number on droplet\ndynamics and impact outcome are studied. At low pitch and Weber number, the\nmaximum droplet spreading is found to be greater in the longitudinal direction\nthan the transverse direction to the grooves. The preferential spreading\ninversely scales with the pitch at a given Weber number. In this case, the\noutcome is no bouncing (NB); however, this changes at larger pitch or Weber\nnumber. Under these conditions, the following outcomes are obtained as function\nof the pitch and Weber number - droplet completely bounces off the surface\n(CB), bouncing occurs with droplet breakup (BDB) or no bouncing due to Cassie\nto Wenzel wetting transition (NBW). In BDB and NBW, the liquid penetrates the\ngrooves partially or completely beneath the droplet due to the wetting\ntransition.

These outcomes are demarcated on Weber number -\ndimensionless pitch plane and the proposed regime map suggests the existence of\na critical Weber number or pitch for the transition from one regime to the\nother.

The critical Weber number needed for the transition from CB to\nBDB is estimated using an existing mathematical model and is compared with the\nmeasurements.

Above the X-point, two sets of non-coplanar coronal loops approach\nlaterally and reconnect at the separator. The IRIS slit was located close to\nthe X-point, cutting across some of the flare ribbons and loops.

Both of them have their own advantages and\nlimitations. For instance, although classification algorithms are more powerful\nthan clustering methods in predicting class labels of objects, they do not\nperform well when there is a lack of sufficient manually labeled reliable data.\nOn the other hand, although clustering algorithms do not produce label\ninformation for objects, they provide supplementary constraints (e.g., if two\nobjects are clustered together, it is more likely that the same label is\nassigned to both of them) that one can leverage for label prediction of a set\nof unknown objects. Therefore, systematic utilization of both these types of\nalgorithms together can lead to better prediction performance. In this paper,\nWe propose a novel algorithm, called EC3 that merges classification and\nclustering together in order to support both binary and multi-class\nclassification. EC3 is based on a principled combination of multiple\nclassification and multiple clustering methods using an optimization function.\nWe theoretically show the convexity and optimality of the problem and solve it\nby block coordinate descent method.

Combining Gaia astrometry with radial velocities of around 320\n000 stars drawn from various catalogues, I integrate orbits in a Galactic\npotential to identify those stars which pass within a few parsecs. Such\nencounters could influence the solar system, for example through gravitational\nperturbations of the Oort cloud. 16 stars are found to come within 2 pc\n(although a few of these have dubious data). This is fewer than were found in a\nsimilar study based on Hipparcos data, even though the present study has many\nmore candidates. This is partly because I reject stars with large radial\nvelocity uncertainties (>10 km/s), and partly because of missing stars in GDR1\n(especially at the bright end). The closest encounter found is Gl 710, a K\ndwarf long-known to come close to the Sun in about 1.3 Myr. The Gaia astrometry\npredict a much closer passage than pre-Gaia estimates, however: just 16 000 AU\n(90% confidence interval: 10 000 to 21 000 AU), which will bring this star well\nwithin the Oort cloud. Using a simple model for the spatial, velocity, and\nluminosity distributions of stars, together with an approximation of the\nobservational selection function, I model the incompleteness of this Gaia-based\nsearch as a function of the time and distance of closest approach. Applying\nthis to a subset of the observed encounters (excluding duplicates and stars\nwith implausibly large velocities), I estimate the rate of stellar encounters\nwithin 5 pc averaged over the past and future 5 Myr to be 545 +/- 59 per Myr.\nAssuming a quadratic scaling of the rate within some encounter distance (which\nmy model predicts), this corresponds to 87 +/- 9 per My within 2 pc.

Designing an accurate and efficient CMTF method has\nbecome more crucial as the size and dimension of real-world data are growing\nexplosively. However, existing methods for CMTF suffer from lack of accuracy,\nslow running time, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose S3CMTF, a\nfast, accurate, and scalable CMTF method.

The power-law decay index is between 1.3\nand 2.1 and similar to that for the 37-bursts sample. There are individual\nbursters with a narrower range. The Gaussian is detected in half of all bursts,\nwith a typical standard deviation of 50~s and a fluence ranging up to 60% of\nthe total fluence. The Gaussian appears consistent with being due to the rp\nprocess. The Gaussian fluence fraction suggests that the layer where the rp\nprocess is active is underabundant in H by a factor of at least five with\nrespect to cosmic abundances. Ninety-four percent of all bursts from\nultracompact X-ray binaries lack the Gaussian component, and the remaining 6%\nare marginal detections.

Negative effects, such as\ninfertility, overpopulation and inbreeding, can easily cause the crew to either\nbe wiped out or genetically unhealthy, if the population is not under a strict\nbirth control. In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo code named HERITAGE that\nsimulates the evolution of a kin-based crew. This computer model, the first of\nits kind, accounts for a large number of free human-based parameters to be\ninvestigated proactively in order to ensure a viable mission. We show the\nreliability of HERITAGE by examining three types of population based on\npreviously published computations. The first is a generic model where no\nbirth/population control has been set up, quickly leading to fatal\novercrowding. The second is the model presented by Moore (2003), that succeeds\nto bring settlers to another Earth under a 200 year-long flight, but the final\ncrew is largely diminished (about a third of the initial crew) and about 20% of\nthem show inbreeding of various levels.

We find that both the Moore and Smith scenario would\ngreatly benefit from coupling a kin-based crew together with a cryogenic bank\nof sperm/eggs/embryos to ensure a genetically healthy first generation of\nsettlers. We also demonstrate that if initial social engineering constraints\nare indeed needed to maintain an healthy crew alive for centuries-long\njourneys, it is necessary to reevaluate those principles after each generation\nto compensate for unbalanced births and deaths, weighted by the inbreeding\ncoefficient and a need for maximizing genetic diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 09:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

This exposes learning\nalgorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which\na fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated\nto subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only\nagainst a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent\ncomplexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning\npoints (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we rst extend the\nde nition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel\npoisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to\ncompute the gradient of interest through automatic di erentiation, while also\nreversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity.\nCompared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a\nwider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient- based procedures,\nincluding neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically\nevaluate its e ectiveness on several application examples, including spam\nltering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition. We nally show\nthat, similarly to adversarial test examples, adversarial training examples can\nalso be transferred across di erent learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

The lesson drawn\nby the theorems proved in the thesis is that surprisingly small compromise is\nnecessary on the efficacy of the solutions to make the approach work. The\nproblems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical\napplications.\n  The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A\nsharp extremal bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most\n8-vertex polygons using established techniques in the field of art gallery\nproblems. This fills in the gap between already known results for partitioning\ninto at most 6- and 10-vertex orthogonal polygons.\n  Next, these techniques are further developed to prove a new type of extremal\nart gallery result. The novelty provided by this approach is that it\nestablishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem has\nstrong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an\n$\\frac83$-approximation algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with\nrectangular vision.\n  In the second part, the graph theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is\nstudied in complete and complete grid graphs. Once again, the extremal approach\nis conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem.\n  In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the\nmaximum degree of realizable demand graphs is 4 times higher than previous best\nresults. The techniques developed are then used to solve the classical extremal\nedge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete base\ngraphs.\n  The complete grid base graph lies on the other end of the spectrum in terms\ndensity amongst path-pairable graphs. It is shown that complete grid graphs are\nrelatively efficient in routing edge-disjoint paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 21:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

In this work, a global Lyapunov function is\nconstructed by combining known local Lyapunov functions for simpler, local\nsub-problems via an explicit formula that depends on the problem parameters.\nSpecifically, we consider the scenario where one set consists of the union of\ntwo lines and the other set is a line, so that the two sets intersect in two\ndistinct points. Locally, near each intersection point, the problem reduces to\nthe intersection of just two lines, but globally the geometry is non-convex and\nthe Douglas-Rachford operator multi-valued.

Under this framework,\nthe computation of the forward pass in a CNN is equivalent to a pursuit\nalgorithm aiming to estimate the nested sparse representation vectors -- or\nfeature maps -- from a given input signal. Despite having served as a pivotal\nconnection between CNNs and sparse modeling, a deeper understanding of the\nML-CSC is still lacking: there are no pursuit algorithms that can serve this\nmodel exactly, nor are there conditions to guarantee a non-empty model. While\none can easily obtain signals that approximately satisfy the ML-CSC\nconstraints, it remains unclear how to simply sample from the model and, more\nimportantly, how one can train the convolutional filters from real data.\n  In this work, we propose a sound pursuit algorithm for the ML-CSC model by\nadopting a projection approach. We provide new and improved bounds on the\nstability of the solution of such pursuit and we analyze different practical\nalternatives to implement this in practice. We show that the training of the\nfilters is essential to allow for non-trivial signals in the model, and we\nderive an online algorithm to learn the dictionaries from real data,\neffectively resulting in cascaded sparse convolutional layers.

This work presents a valve filter\napproach for focusing the attention of the net on a region of interest (ROI).\nIn this approach, the ROI is inserted into the net as a binary map. The net\nuses a different set of convolution filters for the ROI and background image\nregions, resulting in a different set of features being extracted from each\nregion. More accurately, for each filter used on the image, a corresponding\nvalve filter exists that acts on the ROI map and determines the regions in\nwhich the corresponding image filter will be used.

We further show that every outer $k$-planar graph has a\nbalanced separator of size $O(k)$. This implies that every outer $k$-planar\ngraph has treewidth $O(k)$. For fixed $k$, these small balanced separators\nallow us to obtain a simple quasi-polynomial time algorithm to test whether a\ngiven graph is outer $k$-planar, i.e., none of these recognition problems are\nNP-complete unless ETH fails. For the outer $k$-quasi-planar graphs we prove\nthat, unlike other beyond-planar graph classes, every edge-maximal $n$-vertex\nouter $k$-quasi planar graph has the same number of edges, namely $2(k-1)n -\n\\binom{2k-1}{2}$. We also construct planar 3-trees that are not outer\n$3$-quasi-planar. Finally, we restrict outer $k$-planar and outer\n$k$-quasi-planar drawings to \\emph{closed} drawings, where the vertex sequence\non the boundary is a cycle in the graph. For each $k$, we express closed outer\n$k$-planarity and \\emph{closed outer $k$-quasi-planarity} in extended monadic\nsecond-order logic. Thus, closed outer $k$-planarity is linear-time testable by\nCourcelle's Theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 12:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

The Bayesian framework offers an\nalternative remedy against overfitting through priors. Roughly speaking, a good\nprior charges smaller trees where overfitting does not occur.

Such a scheme could be\nappealing in practice since a single coherent communication system can be used\nfor multiple purposes. However, previous studies show that the SQCC protocol\ncan only tolerate very small phase noise. This makes it incompatible with the\ncoherent communication scheme using a true local oscillator (LO), which\npresents a relatively high phase noise due to the fact that the signal and the\nLO are generated from two independent lasers. In this paper, we improve the\nphase noise tolerance of the SQCC scheme using a true LO by adopting a refined\nnoise model where phase noises originated from different sources are treated\ndifferently: on one hand, phase noise associated with the coherent receiver may\nbe regarded as \\emph{trusted} noise, since the detector can be calibrated\nlocally and the photon statistics of the detected signals can be determined\nfrom the measurement results; on the other hand, phase noise due to the\ninstability of fiber interferometers may be regarded as \\emph{untrusted} noise,\nsince its randomness (from the adversary's point to view) is hard to justify.\nSimulation results show the tolerable phase noise in this refined noise model\nis significantly higher than that in the previous study where all the phase\nnoises are assumed to be untrusted.

In this Review, we demonstrate that\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is emerging as an alternative\nmethod for the direct assembly of nanostructures, with possible applications in\nplasmonics, quantum technologies, and materials science. Atomically precise\nmanipulation with STEM relies on recent advances in instrumentation that have\nenabled non-destructive atomic-resolution imaging at lower electron energies.\nWhile momentum transfer from highly energetic electrons often leads to atom\nejection, interesting dynamics can be induced when the transferable kinetic\nenergies are comparable to bond strengths in the material. Operating in this\nregime, very recent experiments have revealed the potential for single-atom\nmanipulation using the Angstrom-sized electron beam. To truly enable control,\nhowever, it is vital to understand the relevant atomic-scale phenomena through\naccurate dynamical simulations. Although excellent agreement between experiment\nand theory for the specific case of atomic displacements from graphene has been\nrecently achieved using density functional theory molecular dynamics, in many\nother cases quantitative accuracy remains a challenge. We provide a\ncomprehensive reanalysis of available experimental data on beam-driven dynamics\nin light of the state-of-the-art in simulations, and identify important targets\nfor improvement.

To isolate effects of non-stationarity\nfrom effects due to nonlinearity (and the non-Gaussianity it causes), a new\ndoubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model (DSADM) is proposed. The\nmodel is hierarchical: it is a linear stochastic partial differential equation\nwhose coefficients are random fields defined through their own stochastic\npartial differential equations. DSADM generates conditionally Gaussian\nspatiotemporal random fields with a tunable degree of non-stationarity in space\nand time. DSADM allows the use of the exact Kalman filter as a baseline\nbenchmark.\n  In numerical experiments with DSADM as the \"model of truth\", the relative\nimportance of the three kinds of covariance blending is studied: with static,\ntime-smoothed, and space-smoothed covariances. It is shown that the stronger\nthe non-stationarity, the less useful the static covariance matrix becomes and\nthe more beneficial the time-smoothed covariances are. Time-smoothing of\nbackground-error covariances proved to be systematically more useful than their\nspace-smoothing.

We have\nsucceeded in constructing a modified projection method that is consistent with\nboth the periodic boundary conditions and the general structure of the CF\ntheory. This method is valid for a large class of states of composite fermions,\ncalled \"proper states,\" which includes the incompressible ground states at\nelectron filling factors $\\nu=\\frac{n}{2pn+ 1}$, their charged and neutral\nexcitations, and also the quasidegenerate ground states at arbitrary filling\nfactors of the form $\\nu=\\frac{\\nu^*}{2p\\nu^*+ 1}$, where $n$ and $p$ are\nintegers and $\\nu^*$ is the CF filling factor. Comparison with exact results\nknown for small systems for the ground and excited states at filling factors\n$\\nu=1/3$, 2/5 and 3/7 demonstrates our LLL-projected wave functions to be\nextremely accurate representations of the actual Coulomb eigenstates. Our\nconstruction enables the study of large systems of composite fermions on the\ntorus, thereby opening the possibility of investigating numerous interesting\nquestions and phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 16:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

To improve\nreproducibility, lon-gitudinal segmentation (4D) approaches have been\ninvestigated to reconcile tem-poral variations with traditional 3D approaches.\nIn the past decade, multi-atlas la-bel fusion has become a state-of-the-art\nsegmentation technique for 3D image and many efforts have been made to adapt it\nto a 4D longitudinal fashion. However, the previous methods were either limited\nby using application specified energy function (e.g., surface fusion and multi\nmodel fusion) or only considered tem-poral smoothness on two consecutive time\npoints (t and t+1) under sparsity as-sumption. Therefore, a 4D multi-atlas\nlabel fusion theory for general label fusion purpose and simultaneously\nconsidering temporal consistency on all time points is appealing. Herein, we\npropose a novel longitudinal label fusion algorithm, called 4D joint label\nfusion (4DJLF), to incorporate the temporal consistency modeling via non-local\npatch-intensity covariance models. The advantages of 4DJLF include: (1) 4DJLF\nis under the general label fusion framework by simul-taneously incorporating\nthe spatial and temporal covariance on all longitudinal time points. (2) The\nproposed algorithm is a longitudinal generalization of a lead-ing joint label\nfusion method (JLF) that has proven adaptable to a wide variety of\napplications. (3) The spatial temporal consistency of atlases is modeled in a\nprob-abilistic model inspired from both voting based and statistical fusion.\nThe pro-posed approach improves the consistency of the longitudinal\nsegmentation while retaining sensitivity compared with original JLF approach\nusing the same set of atlases.

In this work, we present two approaches\nto develop high-fidelity, near-deterministic controlled-sign-shift gates based\non the techniques of quantum gate teleportation. On the one hand, teleportation\nin a discrete-variable setting, i.e., for qubits, offers unit-fidelity\noperations but suffers from low success probabilities. Here, we apply recent\nresults on advanced linear optical Bell measurements to reach a\nnear-deterministic regime. On the other hand, in the setting of continuous\nvariables, associated with coherent states, squeezing, and, typically, Gaussian\nstates, teleportation can be performed in a deterministic fashion, but the\nfinite amount of squeezing implies an inevitable deformation of a teleported\nsingle-mode state. Using a new generalized form of the nonlinear-sign-shift\ngate for gate teleportation, we are able to achieve fidelities of the resulting\nCSIGN gate above 90%. A special focus is also put on a comparison of the two\napproaches, not only with respect to fidelity and success probability, but also\nin terms of resource consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

As the size of DNNs continues to grow, it is critical to improve the\nenergy efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy. For DNNs, the\nmodel size is an important factor affecting performance, scalability and energy\nefficiency. Weight pruning achieves good compression ratios but suffers from\nthree drawbacks: 1) the irregular network structure after pruning; 2) the\nincreased training complexity; and 3) the lack of rigorous guarantee of\ncompression ratio and inference accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this\npaper proposes CirCNN, a principled approach to represent weights and process\nneural networks using block-circulant matrices. CirCNN utilizes the Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT)-based fast multiplication, simultaneously reducing the\ncomputational complexity (both in inference and training) from O(n2) to\nO(nlogn) and the storage complexity from O(n2) to O(n), with negligible\naccuracy loss.

VASS provide a fundamental model\nfor analysis of concurrent processes, parametrized systems, and they are also\nused as abstract models for programs for bounds analysis. While termination is\nthe basic liveness property that asks the qualitative question of whether a\ngiven model always terminates or not, the more general quantitative question\nasks for bounds on the number of steps to termination. In the realm of\nquantitative bounds a fundamental problem is to obtain asymptotic bounds on\ntermination time. Large asymptotic bounds such as exponential or higher already\nsuggest that either there is some error in modeling, or the model is not useful\nin practice. Hence we focus on polynomial asymptotic bounds for VASS. While\nsome well-known approaches (e.g., lexicographic ranking functions) are neither\nsound nor complete with respect to polynomial bounds, other approaches only\npresent sound methods for upper bounds. In this work our main contributions are\nas follows: First, for linear asymptotic bounds we present a sound and complete\nmethod for VASS, and moreover, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Acoustic modeling yields the probabilities of HMM sub-word\nstates for a short temporal window of speech acoustic features. We cast ASR as\na communication channel where the input sub-word probabilities convey the\ninformation about the output HMM state sequence. The quality of the acoustic\nmodel is thus quantified in terms of the information transmitted through this\nchannel. The process of inferring the most likely HMM state sequence from the\nsub-word probabilities is known as decoding. HMM based decoding assumes that an\nacoustic model yields accurate state-level probabilities and the data\ndistribution given the underlying hidden state is independent of any other\nstate in the sequence. We quantify 1) the acoustic model accuracy and 2) its\nrobustness to mismatch between data and the HMM conditional independence\nassumption in terms of some mutual information quantities. In this context,\nexploiting deep neural network (DNN) posterior probabilities leads to a simple\nand straightforward analysis framework to assess shortcomings of the acoustic\nmodel for HMM based decoding. This analysis enables us to evaluate the Gaussian\nmixture acoustic model (GMM) and the importance of many hidden layers in DNNs\nwithout any need of explicit speech recognition. In addition, it sheds light on\nthe contribution of low-dimensional models to enhance acoustic modeling for\nbetter compliance with the HMM based decoding requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 15:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

In this paper, we have proposed a new method to determine the\ndiffusion coefficient by using the radial laser rays formed by cylindrical\nrefractive system (cylindrical glass rod) and CCD camera. The cylindrical glass\nrod is placed in front of laser device and then, the laser rays spread\nradially. The slant curve with normal distribution profile is observed by\nilluminating these rays to the diffusion layer boundary. This curve is recorded\non PC by CCD (charge coupled device) camera and the shape of this curve varies\nwith time. The variation of maximum value with time in the curve determines\ndiffusion coefficient. The measured diffusivity value is in good agreement with\nthe previous experimental result in the tendency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 02:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

However, very few types\nof direct coupling between polarization and magnetization are known, and it is\nunclear whether they can be useful to the design of novel spintronic devices\nexploiting the control of magnetization by electric fields. For instance, the\ntypical bi-quadratic coupling only allows to change the magnitude of the\nmagnetization by an electric field, but it does not permit an\nelectric-field-induced switching of the magnetization. Similarly, the so-called\nLifshitz invariants allow an electric-field control of complicated magnetic\norderings, but not of the magnetization. Here, we report the discovery of novel\ndirect couplings between polarization and magnetization in epitaxial perovskite\nfilms, via the use of first-principles methods and the development of an\noriginal Landau-type phenomenological theory. Our results feature penta-linear\ninteractions involving the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic vectors as well\nas the polar distortions and oxygen octahedral tilting, and permit a number of\nstriking effects. Examples include a continuous electric-field control of the\nmagnetization magnitude and sign, and the discrete switching of the\nmagnetization magnitude. Thus, the high-order, penta-linear couplings\ndemonstrated in this work may open new paths towards novel magneto-electric\neffects, as well as, spintronic and magnonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 14:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

If $G$ is a closed subgroup in the orthogonal group\nsuch that the orbit of a single Euclidean unit vector does not cover the\n(Euclidean) unit sphere centered at the origin then there always exists a\nnon-Euclidean Minkowski functional such that the elements of $G$ preserve the\nMinkowskian length of vectors. In other words the Minkowski geometry is an\nalternative of the Euclidean geometry for the subgroup $G$. It is rich of\nisometries if $G$ is \"close enough\" to the orthogonal group or at least to one\nof its transitive subgroups. The measure of non-transitivity is related to the\nHausdorff distances of the orbits under the elements of $G$ to the Euclidean\nsphere. Its maximum/minimum belongs to the so-called lazy/busy orbits, i.e.\nthey are the solutions of an optimization problem on the Euclidean sphere. The\nextremal distances allow us to characterize the reducible/irreducible\nsubgroups. We also formulate an upper and a lower bound for the ratio of the\nextremal distances.\n  As another application of the analytic tools we introduce the rank of a\nclosed non-transitive group $G$. We shall see that if $G$ is of maximal rank\nthen it is finite or reducible. Since the reducible and the finite subgroups\nform two natural prototypes of non-transitive subgroups, the rank seems to be a\nfundamental notion in their characterization. Closed, non-transitive groups of\nrank $n-1$ will be also characterized. Using the general results we classify\nall their possible types in lower dimensional cases $n=2, 3$ and $4$.\n  Finally we present some applications of the results to the holonomy group of\na metric linear connection on a connected Riemannian manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}
