To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually\nrendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Creating realistic 3D\ncontent is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In\nthis work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic\ndata for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models.\nExploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for\nthis task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the\ntarget category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap,\nand directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating\ncomplex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to\naugment real images with virtual objects. This allows us to create realistic\ncomposite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance and a large\nnumber of complex object arrangements. In contrast to modeling complete 3D\nenvironments, our augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions\nin combination with 3D shapes of the target object. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented\ndata which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation\nmodels. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on training\nstandard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of\ncars in outdoor driving scenes. We test the models trained on our augmented\ndata on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate\nground truth, and on Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that\nmodels trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on\nsynthetic data or models trained on limited amount of annotated real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 16:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-07"}

This high angular momentum may alter the surface\nrotation pattern.\n  Aims: The single rapidly rotating K-giant V1192 Ori is revisited to determine\nits surface differential rotation, lithium abundance, and basic stellar\nproperties such as a precise rotation period. The aim is to independently\nverify the antisolar differential rotation of the star and possibly find a\nconnection to the surface lithium abundance.\n  Methods: We applied time-series Doppler imaging to a new multi-epoch data\nset. Altogether we reconstructed 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data\ncollected with the STELLA robotic telescope between 2007--2016. We used our\ninversion code iMap to reconstruct all stellar surface maps. We extracted the\ndifferential rotation from these images by tracing systematic spot migration as\na function of stellar latitude from consecutive image cross-correlations.\n  Results: The position of V1192 Ori in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nsuggests that the star is in the helium core-burning phase just leaving the RGB\nbump.

We can associate L-functions to a wide\narray of objects, and in general, the zeroes of these L-functions give\ninformation about those objects. For arbitrary L-functions, the order of\nvanishing at the central point is of particular important. For example, the\nBirch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture states that the order of vanishing at the\ncentral point of an elliptic curve L-function is the rank of the Mordell-Weil\ngroup of that elliptic curve.\n  The Katz-Sarnak Density Conjecture states that this order vanishing and other\nbehavior are well-modeled by random matrices drawn from the classical compact\ngroups.

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar\nsystem mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by\nup to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the\ngas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the\nprotostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of\nthe protostar alone. The enhanced radial pressure gradient expected in young\ndiscs may lead to an increased rate of dust depletion due to gas drag, and\ntherefore to a reduced dust-to-gas ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 18:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Creating believable movements for CAs is challenging, since the\nmovements have to be meaningful and natural, reflecting the coupling between\ngestures and speech. Studies in the past have mainly relied on rule-based or\ndata-driven approaches. Rule-based methods focus on creating meaningful\nbehaviors conveying the underlying message, but the gestures cannot be easily\nsynchronized with speech. Data-driven approaches, especially speech-driven\nmodels, can capture the relationship between speech and gestures. However, they\ncreate behaviors disregarding the meaning of the message. This study proposes\nto bridge the gap between these two approaches overcoming their limitations.\nThe approach builds a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), where a discrete variable\nis added to constrain the behaviors on the underlying constraint. The study\nimplements and evaluates the approach with two constraints: discourse functions\nand prototypical behaviors. By constraining on the discourse functions (e.g.,\nquestions), the model learns the characteristic behaviors associated with a\ngiven discourse class learning the rules from the data. By constraining on\nprototypical behaviors (e.g., head nods), the approach can be embedded in a\nrule-based system as a behavior realizer creating trajectories that are timely\nsynchronized with speech. The study proposes a DBN structure and a training\napproach that (1) models the cause-effect relationship between the constraint\nand the gestures, (2) initializes the state configuration models increasing the\nrange of the generated behaviors, and (3) captures the differences in the\nbehaviors across constraints by enforcing sparse transitions between shared and\nexclusive states per constraint.

Among\nthe potentialist conceptions we consider are: rank potentialism (true in all\nlarger $V_\\beta$); Grothendieck-Zermelo potentialism (true in all larger\n$V_\\kappa$ for inaccessible cardinals $\\kappa$); transitive-set potentialism\n(true in all larger transitive sets); forcing potentialism (true in all forcing\nextensions); countable-transitive-model potentialism (true in all larger\ncountable transitive models of ZFC); countable-model potentialism (true in all\nlarger countable models of ZFC); and others. In each case, we identify lower\nbounds for the modal validities, which are generally either S4.2 or S4.3, and\nan upper bound of S5, proving in each case that these bounds are optimal. The\nvalidity of S5 in a world is a potentialist maximality principle, an\ninteresting set-theoretic principle of its own. The results can be viewed as\nproviding an analysis of the modal commitments of the various set-theoretic\nmultiverse conceptions corresponding to each potentialist account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2017 19:15:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 13:44:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 18:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

Despite\nthe presence of these features, support to parallel software development is\noften limited. SCM systems can only address a subset of the conflicts that\nmight be introduced by developers when concurrently working on multiple\nparallel branches. In fact, SCM systems can detect textual conflicts, which are\ngenerated by the concurrent modification of the same program locations, but\nthey are unable to detect higher-order conflicts, which are generated by the\nconcurrent modification of different program locations that generate program\nmisbehaviors once merged. Higher-order conflicts are painful to detect and\nexpensive to fix because they might be originated by the interference of\napparently unrelated changes. In this paper we present Behavioral Driven\nConflict Identification (BDCI), a novel approach to conflict detection. BDCI\nmoves the analysis of conflicts from the source code level to the level of\nprogram behavior by generating and comparing behavioral models. The analysis\nbased on behavioral models can reveal interfering changes as soon as they are\nintroduced in the SCM system, even if they do not introduce any textual\nconflict. To evaluate the effectiveness and the cost of the proposed approach,\nwe developed BDCIf , a specific instance of BDCI dedicated to the detection of\nhigher-order conflicts related to the functional behavior of a program.

We find that for a small density of particles having diameters of\ntwo coherence lengths, the vortex lattice preserves its structure and the\ncritical current $j_c$ decays with the magnetic field following a power-law\n$B^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\approx 0.66$, which is consistent with predictions\nof strong-pinning theory. For a higher density of particles and/or larger\ninclusions, the lattice becomes progressively more disordered and the exponent\nsmoothly decreases down to $\\alpha \\approx 0.3$. At high magnetic fields, all\ninclusions capture a vortex and the critical current decays faster than\n$B^{-1}$ as would be expected by theory. In the case of larger inclusions with\na diameter of four coherence length, the magnetic-field dependence of the\ncritical current is strongly affected by the ability of inclusions to capture\nmultiple vortex lines. We found that at small densities, the fraction of\ninclusions trapping two vortex lines rapidly grows within narrow field range\nleading to a peak in $j_c(B)$-dependence within this range.

While deformation by slip mechanisms is\nreasonably well understood, less remains known about deformation by twinning.\nIndeed, the identification of relevant twinning modes remains an art. In this\npaper, we develop an universal framework combining fundamental kinematic\ndefinition of twins with large scale atomistic calculations to predict twinning\nmodes of crystalline materials.

A fundamental question for these systems is whether the cache space\nshould be pooled together or divided to serve multiple flows of data item\nrequests in order to minimize the miss probabilities. In this paper, we show\nthat there is no straight yes or no answer to this question, depending on\ncomplex combinations of critical factors, including, e.g., request rates,\noverlapped data items across different request flows, data item popularities\nand their sizes. Specifically, we characterize the asymptotic miss\nprobabilities for multiple competing request flows under resource pooling and\nseparation for LRU caching when the cache size is large.\n  Analytically, we show that it is asymptotically optimal to jointly serve\nmultiple flows if their data item sizes and popularity distributions are\nsimilar and their arrival rates do not differ significantly; the\nself-organizing property of LRU caching automatically optimizes the resource\nallocation among them asymptotically. Otherwise, separating these flows could\nbe better, e.g., when data sizes vary significantly. We also quantify critical\npoints beyond which resource pooling is better than separation for each of the\nflows when the overlapped data items exceed certain levels. Technically, we\ngeneralize existing results on the asymptotic miss probability of LRU caching\nfor a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions and extend them to multiple\ncompeting flows with varying data item sizes, which also validates the Che\napproximation under certain conditions.

Treating the source code as a collection of\ntokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers.

The second notion of context is defined based on the flow of data\nbetween identifiers to represent a module as a dependency graph where the nodes\ncorrespond to identifiers and the edges represent the data dependencies between\npairs of identifiers. We have applied our approach to 10 medium-sized open\nsource Java projects, and show that by introducing contexts for identifiers,\nthe quality of the modularization of the software systems is improved. Both of\nthe context models give results that are superior to the plain vector\nrepresentation of documents. In some cases, the authoritativeness of\ndecompositions is improved by 67%.

Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution\nprocess by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account\nfor motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels\nto handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be\nestimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this\npaper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input\nframes using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D\nkernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method\ndevelops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames\nand estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our\nmethod is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at\nonce, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural\nnetwork to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is\ntrained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human\nannotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method\nprovides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 00:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Thus, the SCR to be used in power supply is selected from\nits I2t derating factor. Three different experiments were performed using SCR\nof different manufacturers, to estimate the value of I2t derating factors. In\nthese experiments, the SCR was subjected to maximum thermal stress till SCR\nstarted showing degradation. The forward blocking voltage and the leakage\ncurrent are the parameters used for characterizing the SCR before and after the\nstress. The results of these experiments are presented and discussed.

However, the collected positive regions are either low\nin precision or lack of diversity, and the strategy of collecting negative\nregions is not carefully designed, neither. Moreover, training is often slow\nbecause region selection and object detector training are processed separately.\nIn this context, the primary contribution of this work is to improve weakly\nsupervised detection with an optimized region selection strategy. The proposed\nmethod collects purified positive training regions by progressively removing\neasy background clutters, and selects discriminative negative regions by mining\nclass-specific hard samples. This region selection procedure is further\nintegrated into a CNN-based weakly supervised detection (WSD) framework, and\ncan be performed in each stochastic gradient descent mini-batch during\ntraining.

During brief time periods users often use a single communication\nchannel, but then communication channel alteration (CCA) occurs. This means\nthat we must refine our understanding of the dynamics of social contagions. We\npropose a non-Markovian behavior spreading model in multiplex networks that\ntakes into account the CCA mechanism, and we develop a generalized edge-based\ncompartmental method to describe the spreading dynamics. Through extensive\nnumerical simulations and theoretical analyses we find that the time delays\ninduced by CCA slow the behavior spreading but do not affect the final adoption\nsize. We also find that the CCA suppresses behavior spreading. On two coupled\nrandom regular networks, the adoption size exhibits hybrid growth, i.e., it\ngrows first continuously and then discontinuously with the information\ntransmission probability. CCA in ER-SF multiplex networks in which two\nsubnetworks are Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) introduces a\ncrossover from continuous to hybrid growth in adoption size versus information\ntransmission probability.

In this paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can be used\nto determine a range of relevant magnetic field statistics, including the\nmagnetic-energy spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the properties of an\nanalytic relation between a stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux\ndistribution created upon imaging that field. We conclude that features of the\nbeam's final image-flux distribution often display a universal character\ndetermined by a single, field-scale dependent parameter - the contrast\nparameter - which quantifies the relative size of the correlation length of the\nstochastic field, proton displacements due to magnetic deflections, and the\nimage magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we establish the existence\nof four contrast regimes - linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive -\nunder which proton-flux images relate to their parent fields in a qualitatively\ndistinct manner. As a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear or\nnonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated magnetic field experienced by\nthe beam can be extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy spectrum under a\nfurther statistical assumption of isotropy.

The samples were prepared by the conventional ball\nmilling technique and sintering at 1200{\\deg} C. The effect of the choices of\nMe and T ions on the structural and magnetic properties of the hexaferrites\nwere investigated. XRD patterns, magnetic parameters, and M\\\"ossbauer spectra\nof the Co2Y were consistent with a single phase Y-type hexaferrite. However,\nthe CoCr-Y sample was found to be dominated by the Y-type hexaferrite, and\nM-type and BaCrO4 minority phases were observed in the XRD pattern of the\nsample. The small increase in saturation magnetization from about 34 emu/g up\nto 37.5 emu/g was therefore attributed to the development of the M-type phase.\nOn the other hand, XRD pattern of the Cr2Y sample indicated the dominance of\nthe M-type phase in this sample. The high coercivity (1445 Oe) of this sample\nis evidence of the transformation of the material from a typically soft\nmagnetic material (Y-type) to a hard magnet (M-type). The Ga-substitution for\nFe in Co2Y did not affect the saturation magnetization significantly, but the\ncoercivity was reduced. However, the sample Ba2CoMgFe11GaO22 exhibited a\nsignificant reduction of the saturation magnetization down to a value 26.6\nemu/g, which could be due to the attenuation of the super-exchange interactions\ninduced by the Mg2+ substitution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 13:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Especially\nthe Euler characteristic is a ring homomorphism. Also Wu characteristic\nproduces a ring homomorphism. The Kuenneth correspondence between cohomology\ngroups is explicit as a basis for the product can be obtained from a basis of\nthe factors. The product in R produces the strong product for the connection\ngraphs and leads to tensor products of connection Laplacians. The strong ring R\nis also a subring of the full Stanley-Reisner ring S Every element G can be\nvisualized by its Barycentric refinement graph G1 and its connection graph G'.\nGauss-Bonnet, Poincare-Hopf or the Brouwer-Lefschetz extend to the strong ring.\nThe isomorphism of R with a subring of the strong Sabidussi ring shows that the\nmultiplicative primes in R are the simplicial complexes and that every\nconnected element in the strong ring has a unique prime factorization. The\nSabidussi ring is dual to the Zykov ring, in which the Zykov join is the\naddition. The connection Laplacian of the d-dimensional lattice remains\ninvertible in the infinite volume limit: there is a mass gap in any dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 15:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

The neurons alternating between\nthe two modules define a candidate region of functional plasticity for\ncircadian modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 05:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 09:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

In addition, the existence of\nnontrivial limit points of the SEM algorithm is guaranteed under some mild\nassumptions of the mesh quality. Numerical experiments indicate that the\nefficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed SEM algorithm outperform\nother state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications of the SEM on surface remeshing\nand surface registration for simply connected open surfaces are demonstrated\nthereafter. Thanks to the SEM algorithm, the computations for these\napplications can be carried out efficiently and robustly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 09:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

First, we provide statistical evidence for the rising congestion\nlevels on the roads of New Delhi from taxi GPS traces. Then, we estimate the\neconomic costs of congestion in New Delhi. In particular, we estimate the\nmarginal and the total costs of congestion. In calculating the marginal costs,\nwe consider the following factors: (i) productivity loss, (ii) air pollution\ncosts, and (iii) costs due to accidents. In calculating the total costs, in\naddition to the above factors, we also estimate the costs due to the wastage of\nfuel. We also project the associated costs due to productivity loss and air\npollution till 2030. The projected traffic congestion costs for New Delhi comes\naround 14658 million US$/yr for the year 2030. The key takeaway from our\ncurrent study is that costs due to productivity loss, particularly from buses,\ndominates the overall economic costs. Additionally, the expected increase in\nfuel wastage makes a strong case for intelligent traffic management systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 09:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

Most of the\nontologically based learning management systems are in the proposed phase and\nthose which are developed do not provide the necessary path guidance for proper\nlearning. The systems available are not as adaptive from the viewpoint of the\nlearner as required. Ontology engineering has become an important pillar for\nknowledge management and representation in recent years. The design, approach,\nand implementation of ontology in e-learning and m-learning systems have made\nthem more effective. In this paper, we have proposed a system for the\nbetterment of knowledge management and representation of associated data as\ncompared to the previously available learning management systems. Here, we have\npresented the application and implementation of ontological engineering\nmethodology in the Computer Science domain. For knowledge management, we have\ncreated a domain associated ontology which represents knowledge of a single\ndomain. Subsequently, ontology has been created to manage a learner profile so\nthat a learner may be aligned to a proper path of learning. The learner\nontology will use the VARK learning model which classifies what kind of\nlearning does the learner requires so that necessary resources could be\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 14:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}
