The allocation strategy is based on the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and aims at maximizing the average network\ncapacity according to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). As the\ntransmit power at source and relay is constrained separately, we can thus\nformulate an optimization problem by allocating power to active subcarriers.\nCompared to the conventional uniform power allocation strategy, the proposed\ndynamic strategy can lead to a higher average network capacity, especially in\nthe low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The analysis is also verified by\nnumerical results produced by Monte Carlo simulations. By applying the proposed\npower allocation strategy, the efficiency of adaptive OFDM IM can be enhanced\nin practice, which paves the way for its implementation in the future,\nespecially for cell-edge communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

By means of micromagnetic simulations, here we show that in\nsystems with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the free layer,\ntwo propagating spin wave modes with different frequency and spatial\ndistribution can be excited simultaneously. Our results indicate that in-plane\nmagnetized spin transfer nano-contacts in PMA materials do not host a solitonic\nself-localized spin-wave bullet, which is different from previous studies for\nsystems with in plane magnetic anisotropy. This feature renders them\ninteresting for nano-scale magnonic waveguides and crystals since magnon\ntransport can be configured by tuning the applied current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 19:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Currently, these masses are usually calculated using\nfinite-difference estimation of density functional theory (DFT) electronic band\ncurvatures. However, finite differences require an additional convergence study\nand are prone to numerical noise. Moreover, the concept of effective mass\nbreaks down at degenerate band extrema. We assess the former limitation by\ndeveloping a method that allows to obtain the Hessian of DFT bands directly,\nusing density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Then, we solve the latter\nissue by adapting the concept of `transport equivalent effective mass' to the\n$\\vec{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{p}}$ framework. The numerical noise inherent to\nfinite-difference methods is thus eliminated, along with the associated\nconvergence study. The resulting method is therefore more general, more robust\nand simpler to use, which makes it especially appropriate for high-throughput\ncomputing. After validating the developed techniques, we apply them to the\nstudy of silicon, graphane, and arsenic.

Crolard showed\nthat combining these two categories into the same category results in it\ndegenerating to a poset. However, this degeneration does not occur when both\nlogics are linear. We propose that IL and coIL need to be separated, and then\nmixed in a controlled way using the modalities from linear logic. This\nseparation can be ultimately achieved by an adjoint formalization of\nbi-intuitionistic logic. This formalization consists of three worlds instead of\ntwo: the first is intuitionistic logic, the second is linear bi-intuitionistic\n(Bi-ILL), and the third is cointuitionistic logic. They are then related via\ntwo adjunctions. The adjunction between IL and ILL is known as a\nLinear/Non-linear model (LNL model) of ILL, and is due to Benton. However, the\ndual to LNL models which would amount to the adjunction between coILL and coIL\nhas yet to appear in the literature.

When the graph G is planar, this\nproblem is known to be polynomial-time solvable if k=O(1), but cannot be FPT\nwith respect to k under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.\n  In this paper, we show that, if G is planar and in addition all sources and\nsinks lie on the outer face, then this problem does admit an FPT algorithm when\nparameterized by k (although it remains APX-hard when k is part of the input,\neven in stars). To do this, we provide a new characterization of optimal\nsolutions in this case, and then use it to design a \"divide-and-conquer\"\napproach: namely, some edges that are part of any such solution actually define\nan optimal solution for a polynomial-time solvable multiterminal variant of the\nproblem on some of the sources and sinks (which can be identified thanks to a\nreduced enumeration phase).

Hyperpolarisation offers enormous gains in signal\nand spatial resolution which may ultimately lead to the development of\nmolecular MRI and NMR. At present, techniques used to polarise nuclear spins\ngenerally require low temperatures and/or high magnetic fields, radio-frequency\ncontrol fields, or the introduction of catalysts or free-radical mediators. The\nemergence of room temperature solid-state spin qubits has opened exciting new\npathways to circumvent these requirements to achieve direct nuclear spin\nhyperpolarisation using quantum control. Employing a novel cross-relaxation\ninduced polarisation (CRIP) protocol using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncentre in diamond, we demonstrate the first external nuclear spin\nhyperpolarisation achieved by a quantum probe, in this case of $^1$H molecular\nspins in poly(methyl methacrylate).

The game is a\ndecentralized, multi-agent, cooperative problem that can be modeled as a serial\nsupply chain network in which agents cooperatively attempt to minimize the\ntotal cost of the network even though each agent can only observe its own local\ninformation. Each agent chooses order quantities to replenish its stock. Under\nsome conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is known to be optimal.\nHowever, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents (stages) may act\nirrationally (as they do in the beer game), there is no known optimal policy\nfor an agent wishing to act optimally.\n  We propose a machine learning algorithm, based on deep Q-networks, to\noptimize the replenishment decisions at a given stage. When playing alongside\nagents who follow a base-stock policy, our algorithm obtains near-optimal order\nquantities. It performs much better than a base-stock policy when the other\nagents use a more realistic model of human ordering behavior.

Studies\nwithin other models indicate that a good description of neutron-proton pairing\nis essential for accurate calculations of those matrix elements. The usual\ninteracting boson model is based only on like-particle pairs, however, and the\nextent to which it captures neutron-proton pairing is not clear.\n  Purpose: To determine whether neutron-proton pairing should be explicitly\nincluded as neutron-proton bosons in IBM calculations of neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay matrix elements.\n  Method: An isospin-invariant version of the nucleon-pair shell model is\napplied to carry out shell-model calculations in a large space and in a\ncollective subspace, and to define effective operators in the latter. A\ndemocratic mapping is then used to define corresponding boson operators for the\nIBM, with and without an isoscalar neutron-proton pair boson.\n  Results: IBM calculations with and without the isoscalar boson are carried\nout for nuclei near the beginning of the $pf$ shell, with a realistic\nshell-model Hamiltonian and neutrinoless double-beta-decay operator as the\nstarting point. Energy spectra and double-beta matrix elements are compared to\nthose obtained in the underlying shell model.\n  Conclusions: The isoscalar boson does not improve energy spectra but does\nimprove double-beta matrix elements. To be useful at the level of precision we\nneed, the mapping procedure must be further developed to better determine the\ndependence of the boson Hamiltonian and decay operator on particle number and\nisospin. But the benefits provided by the isoscalar boson suggest that through\nan appropriate combination of mappings and fitting, it would make IBM matrix\nelements more accurate for the heavier nuclei used in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 03:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Based on this phenomenon, RRHs only need to detect the\nrelatively strong signals from nearby users and ignore the weak signals from\nfar users, which is helpful to develop low-complexity detection algorithms\nwithout causing much performance loss. However, before detection, RRHs require\nto obtain the realtime user activity information by the dynamic grant\nprocedure, which causes the enormous latency. To address this issue, in this\npaper, we consider a grant-free C-RAN system and propose a low-complexity\nBernoulli-Gaussian message passing (BGMP) algorithm based on the sparsified\nchannel, which jointly detects the user activity and signal. Since active users\nare assumed to transmit Gaussian signals at any time, the user activity can be\nregarded as a Bernoulli variable and the signals from all users obey a\nBernoulli-Gaussian distribution. In the BGMP, the detection functions for\nsignals are designed with respect to the Bernoulli-Gaussian variable. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the robustness and effectivity of the BGMP. That is, for\ndifferent sparsified channels, the BGMP can approach the mean-square error\n(MSE) of the genie-aided sparse minimum mean-square error (GA-SMMSE) which\nexactly knows the user activity information. Meanwhile, the fast convergence\nand strong recovery capability for user activity of the BGMP are also verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 08:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

In this paper, we propose to use the well-known Kirchhoff index as\nthe measure of edge centrality in weighted networks, called $\\theta$-Kirchhoff\nedge centrality. The Kirchhoff index of a network is defined as the sum of\neffective resistances over all vertex pairs. The centrality of an edge $e$ is\nreflected in the increase of Kirchhoff index of the network when the edge $e$\nis partially deactivated, characterized by a parameter $\\theta$. We define two\nequivalent measures for $\\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. Both are global\nmetrics and have a better discriminating power than commonly used measures,\nbased on local or partial structural information of networks, e.g. edge\nbetweenness and spanning edge centrality.\n  Despite the strong advantages of Kirchhoff index as a centrality measure and\nits wide applications, computing the exact value of Kirchhoff edge centrality\nfor each edge in a graph is computationally demanding. To solve this problem,\nfor each of the $\\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality metrics, we present an\nefficient algorithm to compute its $\\epsilon$-approximation for all the $m$\nedges in nearly linear time in $m$.

This\noptimization model abstracts a number of important applications in artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, such as fused Lasso, fused logistic\nregression, and a class of graph-guided regularized minimization. The\ncomputational challenges of this model are in two folds.
