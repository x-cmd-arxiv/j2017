One simply casts the problem as a gambler that repeatedly pulls one\nout of N slot machine arms, eliciting random rewards. Learning of reward\nprobabilities is then combined with reward maximization, by carefully balancing\nreward exploration against reward exploitation. In this paper, we address a\nparticularly intriguing variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, referred to\nas the {\\it Stochastic Point Location (SPL) Problem}. The gambler is here only\ntold whether the optimal arm (point) lies to the \"left\" or to the \"right\" of\nthe arm pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability $1-\\pi$.\nThis formulation thus captures optimization in continuous action spaces with\nboth {\\it informative} and {\\it deceptive} feedback. To tackle this class of\nproblems, we formulate a compact and scalable Bayesian representation of the\nsolution space that simultaneously captures both the location of the optimal\narm as well as the probability of receiving correct feedback. We further\nintroduce the accompanying Thompson Sampling guided Stochastic Point Location\n(TS-SPL) scheme for balancing exploration against exploitation. By learning\n$\\pi$, TS-SPL also supports {\\it deceptive} environments that are lying about\nthe direction of the optimal arm. This, in turn, allows us to solve the\nfundamental Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) Problem. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that our scheme deals with both deceptive and informative\nenvironments, significantly outperforming competing algorithms both for SRF and\nSPL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 17:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

The software requirements are usually\nwritten in some natural language, and the analysis modeling is normally\nperformed by experienced human analysts. The huge gap between the software\nrequirements which are unstructured texts and analysis models which are usually\nstructured UML diagrams, along with human slip-ups inevitably makes the\ntransformation process error prone. The automation of this process can help in\nreducing the errors in the transformation. In this paper we propose a tool\nsupported approach for automated transformation of use case specifications\ndocumented in English language into analysis class diagrams. The approach works\nin four steps. It first takes the textual specification of a use case as input,\nand then using a natural language parser generates type dependencies and parts\nof speech tags for each sentence in the specification. Then, it identifies the\nsentence structure of each sentence using a set of comprehensive sentence\nstructure rules. Next, it applies a set of transformation rules on the type\ndependencies and parts of speech tags of the sentences to discover the problem\nlevel objects and the relationships between them. Finally, it generates and\nvisualizes the analysis class diagram. We conducted a controlled experiment to\ncompare the correctness, completeness and redundancy of the analysis class\ndiagrams generated by our approach with those generated by the existing\nautomated approaches. The results showed that the analysis class diagrams\ngenerated by our approach were more correct, more complete, and less redundant\nthan those generated by the other approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 18:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

We find that the combination of these\nfeatures could result in a device that approaches the single-photon strong\ncoupling regime, due to the high optical quality factors attainable at low\ntemperatures. Moreover, the system offers a unique opportunity to use optical\ntechniques to study the motion of a superfluid that is freely levitating in\nvacuum (in the case of $^{4}\\mathrm {He}$). Alternatively, for a normal fluid\ndrop of $^3 \\mathrm{He}$, we propose to exploit the coupling between the drop's\nrotations and vibrations to perform quantum non-demolition measurements of\nangular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 18:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected\nby stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a\nsmall but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,\nin fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 03:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In this paper\nwe describe novel neural network architectures for suggesting complementary\ncomponents and their placement for an incomplete 3D part assembly. Unlike most\nexisting techniques, our networks are trained on unlabeled data obtained from\npublic online repositories, and do not rely on consistent part segmentations or\nlabels. Absence of labels poses a challenge in indexing the database of parts\nfor the retrieval. We address it by jointly training embedding and retrieval\nnetworks, where the first indexes parts by mapping them to a low-dimensional\nfeature space, and the second maps partial assemblies to appropriate\ncomplements. The combinatorial nature of part arrangements poses another\nchallenge, since the retrieval network is not a function: several complements\ncan be appropriate for the same input. Thus, instead of predicting a single\noutput, we train our network to predict a probability distribution over the\nspace of part embeddings. This allows our method to deal with ambiguities and\nnaturally enables a UI that seamlessly integrates user preferences into the\ndesign process. We demonstrate that our method can be used to design complex\nshapes with minimal or no user input. To evaluate our approach we develop a\nnovel benchmark for component suggestion systems demonstrating significant\nimprovement over state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 04:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 17:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

Both cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy (DE) phenomena\nare described by a single component, the mimetic field. In linear theory, we\nshow that this component effectively behaves like a perfect fluid with zero\nsound speed and clusters on all scales. For the simpler mimetic cubic Horndeski\nmodel, if the background expansion history is chosen to be identical to a\nperfect fluid DE (PFDE) then the mimetic model predicts the same power spectrum\nof the Newtonian potential as the PFDE model with zero sound speed. In\nparticular, if the background is chosen to be the same as that of LCDM, then\nalso in this case the power spectrum of the Newtonian potential in the mimetic\nmodel becomes indistinguishable from the power spectrum in LCDM on linear\nscales. A different conclusion may be found in the case of non-adiabatic\nperturbations. We also discuss the distinguishability, using power spectrum\nmeasurements from LCDM N-body simulations as a proxy for future observations,\nbetween these mimetic models and other popular models of DE. For instance, we\nfind that if the background has an equation of state equal to -0.95 then we\nwill be able to distinguish the mimetic model from the PFDE model with unity\nsound speed. On the other hand, it will be hard to do this distinction with\nrespect to the LCDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 06:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 16:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

These flares were\nstudied by Kuznetsov et al. (2016) (Paper~I), and chosen here because of the\navailability of the vector magnetograms for their parent active regions (ARs)\nobtained with the SDO/HMI data. In Paper~I, based on the observations only, it\nwas suggested that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) might play an important role in\nthe process of generation of the HXR pulsations. The goal of the present paper\nis to test this hypothesis by using the extrapolation of magnetic field with\nthe non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) method. Having done this, we found that\nbefore each flare indeed there was an MFR elongated along and above a magnetic\npolarity inversion line (MPIL) on the photosphere. In two flare regions the\nsources of the HXR pulsations were located at the footpoints of different\nmagnetic field lines wrapping around the central axis, and constituting an MFR\nby themselves. In five other flares the parent field lines of the HXR\npulsations were not a part of an MFR, but surrounded it in the form of an\narcade of magnetic loops. These results show that, at least in the analyzed\ncases, the \"single flare loop\" models do not satisfy the observations and\nmagnetic field modeling, while are consistent with the concept that the HXR\npulsations are a consequence of successive episodes of energy release and\nelectron acceleration in different magnetic flux tubes (loops) of a complex AR.\nAn MFR could generate HXR pulsations by triggering episodes of magnetic\nreconnection in different loops in the course of its non-uniform evolution\nalong an MPIL. However, since three events studied here were confined flares,\nactual eruptions may not be required to trigger sequential particle\nacceleration episodes in the magnetic systems containing an MFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 10:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 11:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

On the one hand, for increasing number of\ngates, it suffices to choose bit-strings at random to approximate the noisy\ndistribution with fixed statistical distance.

Steps drift at a constant angle to the local front\npropagation direction and the increased local dissipation due to step formation\ncouples to the long-range deformation of the surrounding crack fronts.

For the two-layer multiplexes with initially high degree of\nsynchronization in each layer, the difference between the average phases in\neach layer is analyzed from two different perspectives: the spectral analysis\nand the non-linear Kuramoto model. Both viewpoints confirm that the prior\ntimescales are inversely proportional to the interlayer coupling strength.\nThus, increasing the interlayer coupling always shortens the transient regimes\nof both the global order parameter and the interlayer synchronization.\nSurprisingly, the analytical results show that the convergence of the global\norder parameter is faster than the interlayer synchronization, and the latter\nis generally faster than the global synchronization of the multiplex. The\nformalism also outlines the effects of frequencies on the difference between\nthe average phases of each layer, and identifies the conditions for an\noscillatory behavior. Computer simulations are in fairly good agreement with\nthe analytical findings and reveal that the timescale of the global order\nparameter is at least half times smaller than timescale of the multiplex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 13:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

One of the most widely-used\nmethods is the Kalman filter, which is both extremely simple and general.\nHowever, Kalman filters require a motion model and measurement model to be\nspecified a priori, which burdens the modeler and simultaneously demands that\nwe use explicit models that are often only crude approximations of reality. For\nexample, in the pose-estimation tasks mentioned above, it is common to use\nmotion models that assume constant velocity or constant acceleration, and we\nbelieve that these simplified representations are severely inhibitive. In this\nwork, we propose to instead learn rich, dynamic representations of the motion\nand noise models.

The independent\ncascade model for the influence spread assumes a one-time chance for each\nactivated node to influence its neighbors. This reasonable assumption cannot be\nbypassed, since otherwise the influence probabilities of the nodes, modeled by\nthe edge weights, would be altered. On the other hand, the manually activated\nseed set nodes can be reselected without violating the model parameters or\nassumptions. The reselection of a seed set node, simply means paying extra\nbudget to a previously paid node in order for it to retry its influential\nskills on its uninfluenced neighbors. This view divides the influence\nmaximization process into two cases: the simple case where the reselection of\nthe nodes is not considered and the reselection case. In this study we will\nanalyze the behavior of real world networks on the difference between these two\ninfluence maximization cases. First we will show that the difference between\nthe simple and the reselection cases constitutes a wide spectrum of networks\nranging from the reselection-independent ones, where the reselection case has\nno noticeable advantage to the simple case, to the reselection-friendly ones,\nwhere the influence spread in the reselection case is twice the one in the\nsimple case. Then we will correlate this dynamic to other influence\nmaximization dynamics of the network. Finally, a significant entanglement\nbetween this dynamic and the network structure is shown and verified by the\nexperiments. In other words, a series of conditions on the network structure is\nspecified whose fulfilment is a sign for a reselection-friendly network. As a\nresult of this entanglement, reselection-friendly networks can be spotted\nwithout performing the time consuming influence maximization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 13:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

It is shown that a generator can be represented\nas an effective admittance matrix with respect to low-frequency oscillations,\nand an explicit form for this matrix, for various generator models, is derived.\nFurthermore, it is shown that a source generator, in addition to its effective\nadmittance, is characterized by the presence of an effective current source\nthus giving a natural qualitative distinction between source and nonsource\ngenerators.

Spectral unmixing is a technique that allows\nus to obtain the material spectral signatures and their fractions from\nhyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a novel endmember extraction and\nhyperspectral unmixing scheme, so called \\textit{EndNet}, that is based on a\ntwo-staged autoencoder network.

In this work we present an extensive search for remnant\nradio galaxies in the Lockman Hole, a well-studied extragalactic field. We\ncreate mock catalogues of low-power radio galaxies based on Monte Carlo\nsimulations to derive first-order predictions of the fraction of remnants in\nradio flux limited samples for comparison with our Lockman-Hole sample. We have\ncombined LOFAR observations at 150 MHz with public surveys at higher\nfrequencies to perform a complete selection and have used, for the first time,\na combination of spectral criteria (e.g. the classical ultra-steep spectral\nindex and high spectral curvature) as well as morphological criteria (e.g. low\nradio core prominence and relaxed shapes). Mock catalogues of radio galaxies\nare created based on existing spectral and dynamical evolution models combined\nwith observed source properties. We have identified 23 candidate remnant radio\ngalaxies which cover a variety of morphologies and spectral characteristics. We\nsuggest that these different properties are related to different stages of the\nremnant evolution. We find that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a\nfraction of our remnant sample suggesting a very rapid luminosity evolution of\nthe radio plasma. Results from mock catalogues demonstrate the importance of\ndynamical evolution in the remnant phase of low-power radio galaxies to obtain\nfractions of remnant sources consistent with our observations. Moreover, these\nresults confirm that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a subset of\nthe entire population ($\\sim$50%) when frequencies higher than 1400 MHz are not\nincluded in the selection process, and that they are biased towards old ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 15:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Two\nchallenges have been observed during the exploration of recent developments in\ne-learning. Firstly, to incorporate e-learning systems effectively in the\nevolving semantic web environment and secondly, to realize adaptive\npersonalization according to the learner's changing behavior. An\nontology-driven system has proposed to implement the Felder-Silverman learning\nstyle model in addition to the learning contents, to validate its integration\nwith the semantic web environment. Software agents are employed to monitor the\nlearner's actual learning style and modify them accordingly. The learner's\nlearning style and their modifications are made within the proposed e-learning\nsystem. Cloud storage is used as the primary back-end in order to maintain the\nontology, databases and other required server resources. To verify the system,\ncomparisons are made between the information presented and adaptive learning\nstyles of the learner along with actions of agents according to learners'\nbehavior. Finally, various conclusions are drawn by exploring the learner's\nbehavior in an adaptive environment for the proposed e-learning system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 10:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

While focusing on\ne-learning technologies railway units failed to admit learner's need, cultural\ndiversity and background skills by creating ethnically impartial e-learning\nenvironments, which resulted in inadequate training and degraded performance.\nThe purpose of this study is to understand the vision of a global diverse group\nof station traffic controllers about e-learning courses developed by their\nindividual railway units. The opinions of these officials have been verified by\nquestionnaires on the basis of course organization, course accuracy, course\neffectiveness, course relevance, course productivity and course interactivity.\nThe results obtained show that the developed e-learning course was highly\nhelpful, interactive, creative, and user-friendly for learners.
