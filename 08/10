In this article I\nshow that the glitch-events observed in pulsars are exact quantum signatures\nfor their metamorphosis into dark super-baryons (SBs), whose interiors are made\nof purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids. Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter. As\ndictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, the prompt spin-down must be\nassociated with increase of the dimensions of the embryonic SB to finally\nconvert the entire pulsar into SB-Objects on the scale of Gyrs. Based on our\ncalculations, a Vela-like pulsar should display billions of glitches during its\nlifetime, before it metamorphoses entirely into a maximally compact SB-object\nand disappears from our observational windows. The present model predicts the\nmass of SBs and $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ in young pulsars to be relatively lower\nthan their older counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 16:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2017 21:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

An authentication framework\nover a wiretap channel $(W_1,W_2)$ is proposed to achieve information-theoretic\nsecurity with the same key. The proposed framework bridges the two research\nareas in physical (PHY) layer security: secure transmission and message\nauthentication. Specifically, the sender Alice first transmits message $M$ to\nthe receiver Bob over $(W_1,W_2)$ with an error correction code; then Alice\nemploys a hash function (i.e., $\\varepsilon$-AWU$_2$ hash functions) to\ngenerate a message tag $S$ of message $M$ using key $K$, and encodes $S$ to a\ncodeword $X^n$ by leveraging an existing strongly secure channel coding with\nexponentially small (in code length $n$) average probability of error; finally,\nAlice sends $X^n$ over $(W_1,W_2)$ to Bob who authenticates the received\nmessages. We develop a theorem regarding the requirements/conditions for the\nauthentication framework to be information-theoretic secure for authenticating\na polynomial number of messages in terms of $n$. Based on this theorem, we\npropose an authentication protocol that can guarantee the security\nrequirements, and prove its authentication rate can approach infinity when $n$\ngoes to infinity. Furthermore, we design and implement an efficient and\nfeasible authentication protocol over binary symmetric wiretap channel (BSWC)\nby using \\emph{Linear Feedback Shifting Register} based (LFSR-based) hash\nfunctions and strong secure polar code. Through extensive experiments, it is\ndemonstrated that the proposed protocol can achieve low time cost, high\nauthentication rate, and low authentication error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 16:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-19"}

Firstly, the rotor blades and gasoline engine are\nselected as a pair, so that sufficient lift can be comfortably provided by the\nengine. Secondly, drivetrain and airframe are designed. Major challenges\ninclude airframe vibration minimization and power transmission from one engine\nto four rotors while keeping alternate rotors contra-rotating. Lastly, a PD\ncontroller is tuned to facilitate preliminary flight tests. The methodology has\nbeen verified by the construction and successful flight of our gasoline\nquadrotor prototype, which is designed to have a flight time of 2 to 3 hours\nand a maximum take-off weight of 10 kg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 17:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

In NGC 454 W, the NUV-UVOT images and the Halpha show a set\nof star forming complexes connected by a faint tail.

We develop this thermodynamic analogy into a\nframework to study dusty gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks.

To understand the physics of HMXBs, detailed knowledge about the\ndonor star winds is required. AIMS: To gain a realistic picture of the donor\nstar in Vela X-1, we constructed a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere model\ndescribing the wind stratification while properly reproducing the observed\ndonor spectrum. To investigate how X-ray illumination affects the stellar wind,\nwe calculated additional models for different X-ray luminosity regimes.\nMETHODS: We use the recently updated version of the PoWR code to consistently\nsolve the hydrodynamic equation together with the statistical equations and the\nradiative transfer. RESULTS: The wind flow in Vela X-1 is driven by ions from\nvarious elements with Fe III and S III leading in the outer wind. The\nmodel-predicted mass-loss rate is in line with earlier empirical studies. The\nmass-loss rate is almost unaffected by the presence of the accreting NS in the\nwind.

In models with an enhanced level of X-rays, the\nvelocity field in the outer wind can be altered. If the X-ray flux is too high,\nthe acceleration breaks down because the ionization increases.

The importance of the magnetic field in high-mass-star formation is\nnot yet fully clear and there are still many open questions concerning its role\nin the accretion processes and generation of jets and outflows. In the past few\nyears, masers have been successfully used to probe the magnetic field\nmorphology and strength at scales of a few au around massive protostars, by\nmeasuring linear polarisation angles and Zeeman splitting. The massive\nprotostar IRAS 18089-1732 is a well studied high-mass-star forming region,\nshowing a hot core chemistry and a disc-outflow system. Previous SMA\nobservations of polarised dust revealed an ordered magnetic field oriented\naround the disc of IRAS 18089-1732. Aims. We want to determine the magnetic\nfield in the dense region probed by 6.7 GHz methanol maser observations and\ncompare it with observations in dust continuum polarisation, to investigate how\nthe magnetic field in the compact maser region relates to the large-scale field\naround massive protostars. Methods. We reduced MERLIN observations at 6.7 GHz\nof IRAS 18089-1732 and we analysed the polarised emission by methanol masers.\nResults. Our MERLIN observations show that the magnetic field in the 6.7 GHz\nmethanol maser region is consistent with the magnetic field constrained by the\nSMA dust polarisation observations. A tentative detection of circularly\npolarised line emission is also presented. Conclusions. We found that the\nmagnetic field in the maser region has the same orientation as in the disk.\nThus the large-scale field component, even at the au scale of the masers,\ndominates over any small-scale field fluctuations. We obtained, from the\ncircular polarisation tentative detection, a field strength along the line of\nsight of 5.5 mG which appeared to be consistent with the previous estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 18:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

While classic\ninformation-theoretic measures have transformed our understanding of\nfeedforward information processing in the brain's sensory periphery, comparable\nmeasures for information flow in the massively recurrent networks of the rest\nof the brain have been lacking. To address this, recent work in information\ntheory has produced a sound measure of network-wide \"integrated information,\"\nwhich can be estimated from time-series data. But, a computational hurdle has\nstymied attempts to measure large-scale information integration in real brains.\nSpecifically, the measurement of integrated information involves a\ncombinatorial search for the informational \"weakest link\" of a network, a\nprocess whose computation time explodes super-exponentially with network size.\nHere, we show that spectral clustering, applied on the correlation matrix of\ntime-series data, provides an approximate but robust solution to the search for\nthe the informational weakest link of large networks. This reduces the\ncomputation time for integrated information in large systems from longer than\nthe lifespan of the universe to just minutes. We evaluate this solution in\nbrain-like systems of coupled oscillators as well as in high-density\nelectrocortigraphy data from two macaque monkeys, and show that the\ninformational \"weakest link\" of the monkey cortex splits posterior sensory\nareas from anterior association areas. Finally, we use our solution to provide\nevidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that information\nintegration is maximized by networks with a high global efficiency, and that\nmodular network structures promote the segregation of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 18:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 21:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 21:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

When a\ncredible model of the healthy structure, such as the finite element model, is\navailable, using the impedance/admittance change information as input, it is\npossible to identify both the location and severity of damage. The inverse\nanalysis, however, may be under-determined as the number of unknowns in\nhigh-frequency analysis is usually large while available input information is\nlimited. The fundamental challenge thus is how to find a small set of solutions\nthat cover the true damage scenario. In this research we cast the damage\nidentification problem into a multi-objective optimization framework to tackle\nthis challenge. With damage locations and severities as unknown variables, one\nof the objective functions is the difference between impedance-based model\nprediction in the parametric space and the actual measurements. Considering\nthat damage occurrence generally affects only a small number of elements, we\nchoose the sparsity of the unknown variables as another objective function,\ndeliberately, the l0 norm.

As a deterministic\ntechnique, this approach yields results that are repeatable and conclusive. In\naddition, only one algorithmic parameter, the number of function evaluations,\nis needed.

Tidally locked planets on\ncircular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will\neither librate or rotate super-synchronously. I calculate how habitable planets\nevolve under two commonly-used models and find, for example, that one model\npredicts that the Earth's rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr\nif its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always\nmaintained the modern Earth's tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will\ninduce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal\nlocking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars.\nFor fast rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that\ncircularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the\norbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M\ndwarfs (<0.15 solar masses) are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr and\nhence those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly\ntidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet\ncould be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and\npotentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could\nbe tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide\nrange of assumptions, and the vast majority of all cases are found to tidally\nlock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a\nmajor factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets\nto be discovered in the near future.

To speed up the training\nprocess, the current deep learning systems heavily rely on the hardware\naccelerators. However, these accelerators have limited on-chip memory compared\nwith CPUs. To handle large datasets, they need to fetch data from either CPU\nmemory or remote processors. We use both self-hosted Intel Knights Landing\n(KNL) clusters and multi-GPU clusters as our target platforms.

They can capture conformational\ntransitions much slower than an average or maximal length of a single molecular\ndynamics (MD) trajectory from the set of trajectories used to build the MSM. A\nrule of thumb claiming that the slowest implicit timescale captured by an MSM\nshould be comparable by the order of magnitude to the aggregate duration of all\nMD trajectories used to build this MSM has been known in the field. However,\nthis rule have never been formally proved. In this work, we present analytical\nresults for the slowest timescale in several types of MSMs, supporting the\nabove rule. We conclude that the slowest implicit timescale equals the product\nof the aggregate sampling and four factors that quantify: (1) how much\nstatistics on the conformational transitions corresponding to the longest\nimplicit timescale is available, (2) how good the sampling of the destination\nMarkov state is, (3) the gain in statistics from using a sliding window for\ncounting transitions between Markov states, and (4) a bias in the estimate of\nthe implicit timescale arising from finite sampling of the conformational\ntransitions. We demonstrate that in many practically important cases all these\nfour factors are on the order of unity, and we analyze possible scenarios that\ncould lead to their significant deviation from unity. Overall, we provide for\nthe first time analytical results on the slowest timescales captured by MSMs.\nThese results can guide further practical applications of MSMs to biomolecular\ndynamics and allow for higher computational efficiency of simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 21:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Thus,\nthere is a stark contrast between the star formation rate and the abundance of\nraw material available to fuel it. However, using the ratio of the strength of\nthe HI 21-cm absorption to the total neutral gas column density to quantify the\nspin temperature of the gas, it has recently been shown that its reciprocal may\ntrace the star formation density. This would be expected on the grounds that\nthe cloud of gas must be sufficiently cool to collapse under its own gravity.\nThis, however, relies on very limited data and so here we explore the potential\nof applying the above method to absorbers for which individual column densities\nare not available (primarily MgII absorption systems). By using the mean value\nas a proxy to the column density of the gas at a given redshift, we do, again,\nfind that 1/T (degenerate with the absorber-emitter size ratio) traces the SF\ndensity.

Wolbachia is a natural parasitic microbe that stops the\nproliferation of the harmful viruses inside the mosquito and reduces disease\ntransmission. It is difficult to sustain an infection of the maternal\ntransmitted Wolbachia in a wild mosquito population because of the reduced\nfitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and cytoplasmic incompatibility\nlimiting maternal transmission. The infection will only persist if the fraction\nof the infected mosquitoes exceeds a minimum threshold. Our two-sex mosquito\nmodel captures the complex transmission-cycle by accounting for heterosexual\ntransmission, multiple pregnant states for female mosquitoes, and the\naquatic-life stage. We identify important dimensionless numbers and analyze the\ncritical threshold condition for obtaining a sustained Wolbachia infection in\nthe natural population. This threshold effect is characterized by a backward\nbifurcation with three coexisting equilibria of the system of differential\nequations: a stable disease-free equilibrium, an unstable\nintermediate-infection endemic equilibrium and a stable high-infection endemic\nequilibrium. We perform sensitivity analysis on epidemiological and\nenvironmental parameters to determine their relative importance to Wolbachia\ntransmission and prevalence. We also compare the effectiveness of different\nintegrated mitigation strategies and observe that the most efficient approach\nto establish the Wolbachia infection is to first reduce the natural mosquitoes\nand then release both infected males and pregnant females. The initial\nreduction of natural population could be accomplished by either residual\nspraying or ovitraps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 22:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

The benefit of modular information processing,\nin contrast to globally integrated information processing, is that complex\nglobal computations are more easily and flexibly implemented via a series of\nsimpler, localized information processing operations which only control and\nchange local degrees of freedom. We show that, despite these benefits, there\nare unavoidable thermodynamic costs to modularity---costs that arise directly\nfrom the operation of localized processing and that go beyond Landauer's\ndissipation bound for erasing information. Integrated computations can achieve\nLandauer's bound, however, when they globally coordinate the control of all of\nan information reservoir's degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, global\ncorrelations among the information-bearing degrees of freedom are easily lost\nby modular implementations. This is costly since such correlations are a\nthermodynamic fuel. We quantify the minimum irretrievable dissipation of\nmodular computations in terms of the difference between the change in global\nnonequilibrium free energy, which captures these global correlations, and the\nlocal (marginal) change in nonequilibrium free energy, which bounds modular\nwork production. This modularity dissipation is proportional to the amount of\nadditional work required to perform the computational task modularly. It has\nimmediate consequences for physically embedded transducers, known as\ninformation ratchets. We show how to circumvent modularity dissipation by\ndesigning internal ratchet states that capture the global correlations and\npatterns in the ratchet's information reservoir. Designed in this way,\ninformation ratchets match the optimum thermodynamic efficiency of globally\nintegrated computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 22:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

This has been\ndemonstrated using the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework with a\nclosure at second order. Furthermore, it was shown that for small\nsupercriticality the flow-forming instability follows Ginzburg-Landau (G-L)\ndynamics. Here, the SSD framework is used to study the equilibration of this\nflow-forming instability for small supercriticality. First, we compare the\npredictions of the weakly nonlinear G-L dynamics to the fully nonlinear SSD\ndynamics closed at second order for a wide ranges of parameters. A new branch\nof jet equilibria is revealed that is not contiguously connected with the G-L\nbranch. This new branch at weak supercriticalities involves jets with larger\namplitude compared to the ones of the G-L branch. Furthermore, this new branch\ncontinues even for subcritical values with respect to the linear flow-forming\ninstability. Thus, a new nonlinear flow-forming instability out of homogeneous\nturbulence is revealed. Second, we investigate how both the linear flow-forming\ninstability and the novel nonlinear flow-forming instability are equilibrated.\nWe identify the physical processes underlying the jet equilibration as well as\nthe types of eddies that contribute in each process.

In the\nforward setting, the solution to the RTE behaves differently in different\nregimes, and the stability of the inverse problem vary accordingly. In\nparticular, we consider two scalings in this paper. The first one concerns with\na diffusive scaling whose macroscopic limit is a diffusion equation.

EF is desirable to ensure the\nlong-term viability of the market. MC ensures that demand meets supply. Any\nallocation that is part of a WE is also welfare-maximizing; however, it need\nnot be revenue-maximizing. Furthermore, WE need not exist, e.g., in markets\nwhere bidders have combinatorial valuations. The traditional approach to\nsimultaneously addressing both existence and low revenue is to relax the MC\ncondition and instead require the price of unallocated goods be some, positive\nreserve price. The resulting solution concept, known as Envy-Free Pricing\n(EFP), has been studied in some special cases, e.g., single-minded bidders. In\nthis paper, we go one step further; we relax EF as well as MC. We propose a\nrelaxation of the EF condition where only winners are envy-free, and further\nrelax the MC condition so that unallocated goods are priced at least at the\nreserve. We call this new solution concept Restricted Envy-Free Pricing (REFP).\nWe investigate what REFP entails for single-minded bidders, and show that for\nsize-interchangeable bidders (a generalization of single-minded introduced in\nthis paper) we can compute a REFP in polynomial time, given a fixed allocation.\nAs in the study of EFP, we remain interested in maximizing seller revenue.\nInstead of computing an outcome that simultaneously yields an allocation and\ncorresponding prices, one could first solve for an allocation that respects a\nreserve price, and then solve for a corresponding set of supporting prices,\neach one at least the reserve. This two-step process fails in the case of EFP\nsince, given a fixed allocation, envy-free prices need not exist. However,\nrestricted envy-free prices always exist...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 06:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-11"}

The isotopic difference of Ga between Earth and the Moon and the\nisotopic heterogeneity of the crustal ferroan anorthosites suggest that the\nvolatile depletion occurred following the giant impact and during the lunar\nmagma ocean phase.

In contrast to existing methods that often learn a single\npatch-to-patch mapping from LR to HR images and are regardless of the\ncontextual interdependency between patches, we propose a novel Attention-aware\nFace Hallucination (Attention-FH) framework which resorts to deep reinforcement\nlearning for sequentially discovering attended patches and then performing the\nfacial part enhancement by fully exploiting the global interdependency of the\nimage. Specifically, in each time step, the recurrent policy network is\nproposed to dynamically specify a new attended region by incorporating what\nhappened in the past. The state (i.e., face hallucination result for the whole\nimage) can thus be exploited and updated by the local enhancement network on\nthe selected region. The Attention-FH approach jointly learns the recurrent\npolicy network and local enhancement network through maximizing the long-term\nreward that reflects the hallucination performance over the whole image.\nTherefore, our proposed Attention-FH is capable of adaptively personalizing an\noptimal searching path for each face image according to its own characteristic.\nExtensive experiments show our approach significantly surpasses the\nstate-of-the-arts on in-the-wild faces with large pose and illumination\nvariations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-11"}

The approximations\nintroduced by conventional techniques for thermal conductivity measurements can\nlead to unreliable results when applied to nanostructures, because heaters and\ntemperature sensors needed for the measurement cannot have a negligible size,\nand therefore perturb the result. In this paper we focus on the 3$\\omega$\ntechnique, applied to the thermal conductivity measurement of suspended silicon\nnanomembranes. To overcome the approximations introduced by conventional\nanalytical models used for the interpretation of the 3$\\omega$ data, we propose\nto use a numerical solution, performed by means of finite element modeling, of\nthe thermal and electrical transport equations. An excellent fit of the\nexperimental data will be presented, discussed, and compared with an analytical\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Like the SS-VRP introduced by Bertsimas (1992),\nwe search for optimal first stage routes for a fleet of vehicles to handle a\nset of stochastic customer demands, i.e., demands are uncertain and we only\nknow their probabilities. In addition to capacity constraints, customer demands\nare also constrained by time windows.

In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that\nthe plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with\nrespect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this\nX-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the\naccretion stream, and not in coronal structures. The comparison of the observed\nvelocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with the inferred intrinsic\nvelocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that the\nfootpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on\nthe stellar surface. Our results indicate that complex magnetic field\ngeometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude accretion spots.\nMoreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very\nsimilar to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550\nAng, as found by Ardila et al. (2013), then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at\n0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 12:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Here we reformulate multiscale community detection as a max-sum length\nvector partitioning problem with respect to the set of time-dependent node\nvectors expressed in terms of eigenvectors of the transition matrix. This\nformulation provides a geometric interpretation of Markov Stability in terms of\na time-dependent spectral embedding, where the Markov time acts as an\ninhomogeneous geometric resolution factor that zooms the components of the node\nvectors at different rates. Our geometric formulation encompasses both\nmodularity and the multi-resolution Potts model, which are shown to correspond\nto vector partitioning in a pseudo-Euclidean space, and is also linked to\nspectral partitioning methods, where the number of eigenvectors used\ncorresponds to the dimensionality of the underlying embedding vector space.\nInspired by the Louvain optimisation for community detection, we then propose\nan algorithm based on a graph-theoretical heuristic for the vector partitioning\nproblem. We apply the algorithm to the spectral optimisation of modularity and\nMarkov Stability community detection. The spectral embedding based on the\ntransition matrix eigenvectors leads to improved partitions with higher\ninformation content and higher modularity than the eigen-decomposition of the\nmodularity matrix.

As words with similar\nsyntactic usage are usually very close to each other in the embeddings space,\nalthough they are not semantically similar, the D2Q similarity approach may\nsuffer from the problem of \"multiple degrees of similarity\".

Unlike traditional loop fusion or blocking, the loops\nmay have different iteration spaces and access shared datasets through indirect\nmemory accesses, such as A[map[i]] -- hence the name \"sparse\". One notable\nexample of such loops arises in discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods,\nbecause of the computation of numerical integrals over different domains (e.g.,\ncells, facets). The major challenge with sparse tiling is implementation -- not\nonly is it cumbersome to understand and synthesize, but it is also onerous to\nmaintain and generalize, as it requires a complete rewrite of the bulk of the\nnumerical computation. In this article, we propose an approach to extend the\napplicability of sparse tiling based on raising the level of abstraction.\nThrough a sequence of compiler passes, the mathematical specification of a\nproblem is progressively lowered, and eventually sparse-tiled C for-loops are\ngenerated.

A common form of adaption is avoidance\nrewiring, where a noninfected node breaks a connection to an infected neighbor\nand forms a new connection to another noninfected node. Here we explore the\neffects of such adaptivity on stochastic fluctuations in the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model, focusing on the largest fluctuations\nthat result in extinction of infection. Using techniques from large-deviation\ntheory, combined with a measurement of heterogeneity in the susceptible degree\ndistribution at the endemic state, we are able to predict and analyze large\nfluctuations and extinction in adaptive networks. We find that in the limit of\nsmall rewiring there is a sharp exponential reduction in mean extinction times\ncompared to the case of zero adaption. Furthermore, we find an exponential\nenhancement in the probability of large fluctuations with increased rewiring\nrate, even when holding the average number of infected nodes constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 12:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 13:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

The focus of\nthis paper is to design a new mechanism framework that induces an efficient and\nfair equilibrium in a general class of games. To achieve this goal, we propose\na taxation framework, which first imposes a tax on each player based on the\nperceived payoff (income), and then redistributes the collected tax to other\nplayers properly. By turning the tax rate, this framework spans the continuum\nspace between strategic interactions (of selfish players) and altruistic\ninteractions (of unselfish players), hence provides rich modeling\npossibilities. The key challenge in the design of this framework is the proper\ntaxing rule (i.e., the tax exemption and tax rate) that induces the desired\nequilibrium in a wide range of games. First, we propose a flat tax rate (i.e.,\na single tax rate for all players), which is necessary and sufficient for\nachieving an efficient equilibrium in any static strategic game with common\nknowledge. Then, we provide several tax exemption rules that achieve some\ntypical fairness criterions (such as the Max-min fairness) at the equilibrium.\nWe further illustrate the implementation of the framework in the game of\nPrisoners' Dilemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 13:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-11"}

Using\nhybrid methods, it is shown that each switching mode is passive and the\npassivity of the system is preserved under arbitrary switching. Finally, the\ntwo systems, (i) one derived from the Brayton Moser formulation and (ii) the\nstate dependent switching system, are interconnected in a power conserving way.\nThe resulting trajectories of the overall system are shown to converge\nasymptotically, to the optimal solution of the convex optimization problem.

In this sense, techniques'\nperformance may vary due to a number of factors. While empirical studies\ncomparing the performance of TCP techniques have already been presented in\nliterature, there is still little knowledge, particularly in the MBT context,\nabout which factors may influence the outcomes suggested by a TCP technique. In\na previous family of empirical studies focusing on labeled transition systems,\nwe identified that the model layout, i.e. amount of branches, joins, and loops\nin the model, alone may have little influence on the performance of TCP\ntechniques investigated, whereas characteristics of test cases that actually\nfail definitely influences their performance.

The core idea is to learn how to\nembed items into a latent space such that they optimize a supervised objective\nin that latent space. The dimensions of the latent space have no clear\nsemantics, and this reduces the interpretability of the system. For example, in\npersonalization models, it is hard to explain why a particular item is ranked\nhigh for a given user profile. We propose a novel model of representation\nlearning called Supervised Explicit Semantic Analysis (SESA) that is trained in\na supervised fashion to embed items to a set of dimensions with explicit\nsemantics. The model learns to compare two objects by representing them in this\nexplicit space, where each dimension corresponds to a concept from a knowledge\nbase. This work extends Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) with a supervised\nmodel for ranking problems.

Every profile and job are encoded to this set of skills their\nsimilarity is calculated in this space. We use RNNs to embed text input into\nthis space.

Following Penrose, we argue that the evenly distributed matter of the\nearly universe is equivalent to low gravitational entropy. There are two\ncompeting explanations for how this initial low gravitational entropy comes\nabout. (1) Inflation and baryogenesis produce a virtually homogeneous\ndistribution of matter with a low gravitational entropy. (2) Dissatisfied with\nexplaining a low gravitational entropy as the product of a 'special' scalar\nfield, some theorists argue (following Boltzmann) for a 'more natural' initial\ncondition in which the entire universe is in an initial equilibrium state of\nmaximum entropy. In this equilibrium model, our observable universe is an\nunusual low entropy fluctuation embedded in a high entropy universe. The\nanthropic principle and the fluctuation theorem suggest that this low entropy\nregion should be as small as possible and have as large an entropy as possible,\nconsistent with our existence. However, our low entropy universe is much larger\nthan needed to produce observers, and we see no evidence for an embedding in a\nhigher entropy background.

It was brought to our attention that the definition\nof ECI+ was equivalent to the variation of the metric proposed in 2012.

We found that a large fraction of\nvariations have a similar predictive power, indicating that the chance of\nfinding a variation of ECI that works, after the seminal 2009 measure, are\nsurprisingly high. In fact, more than 28 percent of these variations have a\npredictive power that is within 90 percent of the maximum for any variation.\nThese findings show that, once the idea of measuring economic complexity was\nout, creating a variation with a similar predictive power (like the ones\nproposed in 2012) was trivial (a 1 in 3 shot).

Both ground-state and nonadiabatic dynamics\n(including singlet excited states) of the decomposition reaction of various\nmethyl-substituted dioxetanes have been simulated. Methyl-substitution leads to\na significant increase in the dissociation time scale. The rotation around the\nO-C-C-O dihedral angle is slowed; thus, the molecular system stays longer in\nthe \"entropic trap\" region. A simple kinetic model is proposed to explain how\nthis leads to a higher chemiluminescence yield.

A potential solution\nis to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We\nconsider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act\ndirectly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth,\nanti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This\nprevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while\nsimultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial\nclearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion\ntherapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7 coupled\npolystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to\nhost cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a Pseudomonas\naeruginosa burn wound infection in the rat.

The model\nconsists of two physical compartments: the epithelium and the exudate. It is\nfound that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor\ntreatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the epithelium\nand by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the epithelium into the\nexudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the\nbacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or\ncontinuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible.\nLastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our\nmathematical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The LiB operation is associated with the heat generation and\nbuildup effect, which manifests itself more strongly, in the form of highly\nuneven thermal distribution, for a LiB pack consisting of multiple cells. If\nnot well monitored and managed, the heating may accelerate aging and cause\nunwanted side reactions. In extreme cases, it will even cause fires and\nexplosions, as evidenced by a series of well-publicized incidents in recent\nyears. To address this threat, this paper, for the first time, seeks to\nreconstruct the three-dimensional temperature field of a LiB pack in real time.\nThe major challenge lies in how to acquire a high-fidelity reconstruction with\nconstrained computation time. In this study, a three-dimensional thermal model\nis established first for a LiB pack configured in series. Although spatially\nresolved, this model captures spatial thermal behavior with a combination of\nhigh integrity and low complexity. Given the model, the standard Kalman filter\nis then distributed to attain temperature field estimation at substantially\nreduced computational complexity. The arithmetic operation analysis and\nnumerical simulation illustrate that the proposed distributed estimation\nachieves a comparable accuracy as the centralized approach but with much less\ncomputation. This work can potentially contribute to the safer operation of the\nLiB packs in various systems dependent on LiB-based energy storage, potentially\nwidening the access of this technology to a broader range of engineering areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 03:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

In\nFog-RANs, the edge nodes and user terminals possess storage, computation and\ncommunication functionalities to various degrees, which provides high\nflexibility for network operation, i.e., from fully centralized to fully\ndistributed operation. In this paper, we study the cache placement problem in\nFog-RANs, by taking into account flexible physical-layer transmission schemes\nand diverse content preferences of different users. We develop both centralized\nand distributed transmission aware cache placement strategies to minimize\nusers' average download delay subject to the storage capacity constraints. In\nthe centralized mode, the cache placement problem is transformed into a matroid\nconstrained submodular maximization problem, and an approximation algorithm is\nproposed to find a solution within a constant factor to the optimum. In the\ndistributed mode, a belief propagation based distributed algorithm is proposed\nto provide a suboptimal solution, with iterative updates at each BS based on\nlocally collected information. Simulation results show that by exploiting\ncaching and cooperation gains, the proposed transmission aware caching\nalgorithms can greatly reduce the users' average download delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}
