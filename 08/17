To partly address\nthis, we introduce and evaluate a new training-image based inversion approach\nfor complex geologic media. Our approach relies on a deep neural network of the\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) type. After training using a training\nimage (TI), our proposed spatial GAN (SGAN) can quickly generate 2D and 3D\nunconditional realizations. A key characteristic of our SGAN is that it defines\na (very) low-dimensional parameterization, thereby allowing for efficient\nprobabilistic inversion using state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods. In addition, available direct conditioning data can be incorporated\nwithin the inversion. Several 2D and 3D categorical TIs are first used to\nanalyze the performance of our SGAN for unconditional geostatistical\nsimulation. Training our deep network can take several hours. After training,\nrealizations containing a few millions of pixels/voxels can be produced in a\nmatter of seconds. This makes it especially useful for simulating many\nthousands of realizations (e.g., for MCMC inversion) as the relative cost of\nthe training per realization diminishes with the considered number of\nrealizations. Synthetic inversion case studies involving 2D steady-state flow\nand 3D transient hydraulic tomography with and without direct conditioning data\nare used to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN-based inversion.\nFor the 2D case, the inversion rapidly explores the posterior model\ndistribution. For the 3D case, the inversion recovers model realizations that\nfit the data close to the target level and visually resemble the true model\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 17:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 14:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Most of the well-known algorithms for the computation of\nHerbrand equivalence in data flow frameworks proceed via iterative fix-point\ncomputation on some abstract lattice of short expressions relevant to the given\nflow graph. However the mathematical definition of Herbrand equivalence is\nbased on a meet over all path characterization over the (infinite) set of all\npossible expressions. The aim of this paper is to develop a lattice theoretic\nfix-point formulation of Herbrand equivalence on the (infinite) concrete\nlattice defined over the set of all terms constructible from variables,\nconstants and operators of a program. The present characterization uses an\naxiomatic formulation of the notion of Herbrand congruence and defines the\n(infinite) concrete lattice of Herbrand congruences. Transfer functions and\nnon-deterministic assignments are formulated as monotone functions over this\nconcrete lattice. Herbrand equivalence is defined as the maximum fix point of a\ncomposite transfer function defined over an appropriate product lattice of the\nabove concrete lattice. A re-formulation of the classical meet-over-all-paths\ndefinition of Herbrand equivalence in the above lattice theoretic framework is\nalso presented and is proven to be equivalent to the new lattice theoretic\nfix-point characterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 17:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 14:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

Its possible quantization lies at the heart of\nour understanding of all systems with topological band structures that were\ndiscovered over the last decades. While based on the concept of the \"charge\"\npolarization, the same theory can be used as an elegant tool to characterize\nthe Bloch bands of neutral bosonic systems such as photonic or phononic\ncrystals. Recently, the theory of this quantized polarization was extended from\nthe dipole- to higher multipole-moments. In particular, a two-dimensional\nquantized quadrupole insulator is predicted to have gapped yet topological\none-dimensional edge-modes, which in turn stabilize zero-dimensional in-gap\ncorner states. However, such a state of matter has not been observed\nexperimentally. Here, we provide the first measurements of a phononic\nquadrupole insulator. We experimentally characterize the bulk, edge, and corner\nphysics of a mechanical metamaterial and find the predicted gapped edge and\nin-gap corner states. We further corroborate our findings by comparing the\nmechanical properties of a topologically non-trivial system to samples in other\nphases predicted by the quadrupole theory. From an application point of view,\nthese topological corner states are an important stepping stone on the way to\ntopologically protected wave-guides in higher dimensions and thereby open a new\ndesign path for metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

We highlight two\ncritical issues of existing works. First, due to the large space of unobserved\nfeedback, most existing works resort to assign a uniform weight to the missing\ndata to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption is\ninvalid in real-world settings. Second, most methods are also designed in an\noffline setting and fail to keep up with the dynamic nature of online data. We\naddress the above two issues in learning MF models from implicit feedback. We\nfirst propose to weight the missing data based on item popularity, which is\nmore effective and flexible than the uniform-weight assumption. However, such a\nnon-uniform weighting poses efficiency challenge in learning the model. To\naddress this, we specifically design a new learning algorithm based on the\nelement-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) technique, for efficiently\noptimizing a MF model with variably-weighted missing data. We exploit this\nefficiency to then seamlessly devise an incremental update strategy that\ninstantly refreshes a MF model given new feedback.

To learn from such sparse data\neffectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features.\n  Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the\nsecond-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a\nlinear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex\ninherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently\nbeen applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the\nWide&Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile\nmakes them difficult to train.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM)\nfor prediction under sparse settings.

In the large\nFe-rich SEP events with T = 3 MK, where shock waves, driven out by coronal mass\nejections (CMEs), have reaccelerated residual ions from impulsive suprathermal\nevents that occur earlier in solar active regions, He/O = 90, a ratio similar\nto that in the slow solar wind, which may also originate from active regions.\nIons in the large SEP events with T < 2 MK may be accelerated outside active\nregions, and have values of 40 < He/O < 60.

The optical absorption leading to the high-energy resonance\n(approximately 40 eV), calculated from a many-site one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel, has a peak at U, the electrostatic interaction energy for two electrons\nwith antiparallel spins on the same carbon atom. In the model, there are also\ntwo satellites whose separation from the main resonance is approximately +/-10\neV suggesting that unresolved satellite structure may be contributing to the\nlinewidth of the resonant peak.

Bacteria and archaea\nwith this system incorporate genetic material from invading viruses into their\ngenomes, providing protection against future infection by similar viruses. The\nconditions for coexistence of prokaryots and viruses is an interesting problem\nin evolutionary biology. In this work, we show an intriguing phase diagram of\nthe virus extinction probability, which is more complex than that of the\nclassical predator-prey model. As the CRISPR incorporates genetic material,\nviruses are under pressure to evolve to escape the recognition by CRISPR. When\nbacteria have a small rate of deleting spacers, a new parameter region in which\nbacteria and viruses can coexist arises, and it leads to a more complex\ncoexistence patten for bacteria and viruses. For example, when the virus\nmutation rate is low, the virus extinction probability changes non-montonically\nwith the bacterial exposure rate. The virus and bacteria co-evolution not only\nalters the virus extinction probability, but also changes the bacterial\npopulation structure. Additionally, we show that recombination is a successful\nstrategy for viruses to escape from CRISPR recognition when viruses have\nmultiple proto-spacers, providing support for a recombination-mediated escape\nmechanism suggested experimentally. Finally, we suggest that the reentrant\nphase diagram, in which phages can progress through three phases of extinction\nand two phases of abundance at low spacer deletion rates as a function of\nexposure rate to bacteria, is an experimentally testable phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 20:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

All stars in our sample have an evolutionary\nage less than 4 million years, with the O2-type star being the youngest. All\nthese stars show a systematic discrepancy between evolutionary and\nspectroscopic masses. All stars in our sample are nitrogen enriched. Nitrogen\nenrichment shows a clear correlation with increasing projected rotational\nvelocities. The mechanical energy input from the Of stars alone is comparable\nto the energy stored in the N206 superbubble as measured from the observed\nX-ray and H alpha emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 21:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 09:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

In this paper, we study the\nmonodromy of these eigenvectors as the parameter varies within the real locus;\nthis gives an action of the fundamental group of this moduli space, which is\ncalled the cactus group.\n  We prove a conjecture of Etingof which states that the monodromy of\neigenvectors for Gaudin algebras agrees with the action of the cactus group on\ntensor products of g-crystals. In fact, we prove that the coboundary category\nof normal g-crystals can be reconstructed using the coverings of the moduli\nspaces.\n  Our main tool is the construction of a crystal structure on the set of\neigenvectors for shift of argument algebras, another family of commutative\nalgebras which act on any irreducible g-representation. We also prove that the\nmonodromy of such eigenvectors is given by the internal cactus group action on\ng-crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 23:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 20:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Our objective is to maximize the\naggregator's revenue while controlling the risk of penalties due to poor\nservice delivery. To achieve this goal, we propose data-driven risk-averse\nstrategies to effectively handle uncertainties in: 1) The DER parameters (e.g.,\nload demands and flexibilities) and 2) sub-hourly regulation signals (to the\naccuracy of every few seconds). We design both the day-ahead and the hour-ahead\nstrategies. In the day-ahead model, we develop a two-stage stochastic program\nto roughly model the above uncertainties, which achieves computational\nefficiency by leveraging novel aggregate models of both DER parameters and\nsub-hourly regulation signals. In the hour-ahead model, we formulate a\ndata-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained program to explicitly\nmodel the aforementioned uncertainties. This program can effectively control\nthe quality of regulation service based on the aggregator's risk aversion.\nFurthermore, it learns the distributions of the uncertain parameters from\nempirical data so that it outperforms existing techniques, (e.g. robust\noptimization or traditional chance-constrained programming) in both modelling\naccuracy and cost of robustness.

However, the\nHU research has been constrained a lot by three factors: (a) the number of\nhyperspectral images (especially the ones with ground truths) are very limited;\n(b) the ground truths of most hyperspectral images are not shared on the web,\nwhich may cause lots of unnecessary troubles for researchers to evaluate their\nalgorithms; (c) the codes of most state-of-the-art methods are not shared,\nwhich may also delay the testing of new methods.\n  Accordingly, this paper deals with the above issues from the following three\nperspectives: (1) as a profound contribution, we provide a general labeling\nmethod for the HU. With it, we labeled up to 15 hyperspectral images, providing\n18 versions of ground truths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\npaper to summarize and share up to 15 hyperspectral images and their 18\nversions of ground truths for the HU. Observing that the hyperspectral\nclassification (HyC) has much more standard datasets (whose ground truths are\ngenerally publicly shared) than the HU, we propose an interesting method to\ntransform the HyC datasets for the HU research. (2) To further facilitate the\nevaluation of HU methods under different conditions, we reviewed and\nimplemented the algorithm to generate a complex synthetic hyperspectral image.\nBy tuning the hyper-parameters in the code, we may verify the HU methods from\nfour perspectives. The code would also be shared on the web. (3) To provide a\nstandard comparison, we reviewed up to 10 state-of-the-art HU algorithms, then\nselected the 5 most benchmark HU algorithms, and compared them on the 15 real\nhyperspectral datasets. The experiment results are surely reproducible; the\nimplemented codes would be shared on the web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 03:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

However, to further investigate the nature\nof the dark energy, a H0 estimate down to 1% level is greatly needed. This\nrequires dozens of strongly lensed quasars that are yet to be delivered by\nongoing and forthcoming all-sky surveys.\n  Aims: In this work we aim to determine the spectroscopic redshift of\nPSOJ0147, the first strongly lensed quasar candidate found in the Pan-STARRS\nsurvey. The main goal of our work is to derive an accurate redshift estimate of\nthe background quasar for cosmography.\n  Methods: To obtain timely spectroscopically follow-up, we took advantage of\nthe fast-track service programme that is carried out by the Nordic Optical\nTelescope. Using a grism covering 3200 - 9600 A, we identified prominent\nemission line features, such as Ly-alpha, N V, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, and [C\nIII] in the spectra of the background quasar of the PSOJ0147 lens system. This\nenables us to determine accurately the redshift of the background quasar.\n  Results: The spectrum of the background quasar exhibits prominent absorption\nfeatures bluewards of the strong emission lines, such as Ly-alpha, N V, and C\nIV. These blue absorption lines indicate that the background source is a broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasar. Unfortunately, the BAL features hamper an\naccurate determination of redshift using the above-mentioned strong emission\nlines. Nevertheless, we are able to determine a redshift of 2.341+/-0.001 from\nthree of the four lensed quasar images with the clean forbidden line [C III].\nIn addition, we also derive a maximum outflow velocity of ~ 9800 km/s with the\nbroad absorption features bluewards of the C IV emission line. This value of\nmaximum outflow velocity is in good agreement with other BAL quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 04:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In this paper, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem of\nDC-MG is investigated considering convex relaxation based on second-order cone\nprogramming (SOCP). Mild assumptions are proposed to guarantee the exactness of\nrelaxation, which only require uniform nodal voltage upper bounds and positive\nnetwork loss. Furthermore, it is revealed that the exactness of SOCP relaxation\nof DC-MGs does not rely on either topology or operating mode of DC-MGs, and an\noptimal solution must be unique if it exists. If line constraints are\nconsidered, the exactness of SOCP relaxation may not hold. In this regard, two\nheuristic methods are proposed to give approximate solutions.

This equation arises in evolutionary biological systems, where the\narena for the dynamics is trait space, diffusion accounts for mutations and\nindividuals with similar traits compete, resulting in partial niche overlap. It\nhas been found that the (non-cutoff) deterministic system gives rise to a\nspatially inhomogeneous state for a certain class of interaction kernels, while\nthe stochastic system produces an inhomogeneous state for small enough\npopulation densities. Here we study the problem of front propagation in this\nsystem, comparing the stochastic dynamics to the heuristic approximation of\nthis system by a deterministic system where the linear growth term is cut off\nbelow some critical density. Of particular interest is the nontrivial pattern\nleft behind the front. For large population density, or small cutoff, there is\na constant velocity wave propagating from the populated region to the\nunpopulated region. As in the local Fisher equation, the spreading velocity is\nmuch lower than the Fisher velocity which is the spreading velocity for\ninfinite population size. The stochastic simulations give approximately the\nsame spreading velocity as the deterministic simulation with appropriate birth\ncutoff. When the population density is small enough, there is a different\nmechanism of population spreading. The population is concentrated on clusters\nwhich divide and separate. This mode of spreading has small spreading velocity,\ndecaying exponentially with the range of the interaction kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 05:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The evolution of these aspects upon\nsubstitution of Fe and Co at different crystallographic sites are investigated\nby computing the electronic structure, mechanical properties and magnetic\nexchange parameters. We find that the martensitic phase of Mn$_{2}$NiGa\ngradually de-stabilises with increase in concentration of Fe/Co due to the\nweakening of the minority spin hybridisation of Ni and Mn atoms occupying\ncrystallographically equivalent sites. The interplay between relative\nstructural stability and the compositional changes are understood from the\nvariations in the elastic modulii and electronic structures. We find that the\nelastic shear modulus C$^{\\prime}$ can be considered as a predictor of\ncomposition dependence of martensitic transformation temperature in substituted\nMn$_{2}$NiGa. The magnetic properties of Mn$_{2}$NiGa are found to be greatly\nimproved by the substitutions due to stronger ferromagnetic interactions in the\ncompounds. The gradually weaker(stronger) Jahn-Teller distortion (covalent\nbonding) in the minority spin densities of states due to substitutions lead to\na half-metallic like gap in these compounds resulting in materials with high\nspin-polarisation when the substitutions are complete. The substitutions at the\nGa site result in two new compounds Mn$_{2}$NiFe and Mn$_{2}$NiCo with very\nhigh magnetic moments and Curie temperatures.

For the new\naluminium phase-plate, no charging like for the carbon phase-plate is observed.\nUnder conditions of use, the stability of the aluminium phase-plate, is\nexcellent. For both materials, a distortion in the image's\nFourier-transformation is observed, when inserting the thin-film into the beam\nat the back-focal-plane. This distortion is a negative, spatial-frequency\ndependent phase-shift, that is not equal to a focus-change. A phase-shift and\nan increase of contrast, is observed for the tested phase-plates.

Chondrules may\nrepresent the building blocks of rocky planetesimals and protoplanets in the\ninner regions of protoplanetary discs, but the source of ubiquitous thermal\nprocessing of their dust aggregate precursors remains elusive. Here we\ndemonstrate that escape of positrons released in the decay of the short-lived\nradionuclide $^{26}$Al leads to a large-scale charging of dense pebble\nstructures, resulting in neutralisation by lightning discharge and\nflash-heating of dust and pebbles. This charging mechanism is similar to a\nnuclear battery where a radioactive source charges a capacitor. We show that\nthe nuclear battery effect operates in circumplanetesimal pebble discs. The\nextremely high pebble densities in such discs are consistent with conditions\nduring chondrule heating inferred from the high abundance of sodium within\nchondrules. The sedimented mid-plane layer of the protoplanetary disc may also\nbe prone to charging by the emission of positrons, if the mass density of small\ndust there is at least an order of magnitude above the gas density. Our results\nimply that the decay energy of $^{26}$Al can be harvested to drive intense\nlightning activity in protoplanetary discs. The total energy stored in positron\nemission is comparable to the energy needed to melt all solids in the\nprotoplanetary disc.

We\nillustrate our method by evaluating plasmonic spectra of doped graphene\nnanotriangles with varied size, where we predict remarkable peak splittings and\nother radical modifications in the spectra due to plasmons interactions with\nintrinsic optical phonons. Our method is equally applicable to other 2D\nmaterials and provides a simple approach for investigating coupling of plasmons\nto phonons, excitons, and other excitations in hybrid thin nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 08:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

The factorization of the\nmomentum distributions , bearing a universal character, results from a general\nproperty of realistic nuclear wave functions, namely their factorization at\nshort inter-nucleon separations. The factorization of the two-nucleon momentum\ndistribution allows one to develop the correlated part of the nucleon spectral\nfunction P(k,E) in terms of a convolution integral involving the product of the\nmany-body, parameter-free relative and c.m. momentum distributions of a given\nnucleus. It is shown that: (i) the obtained spectral function perfectly\nsatisfies the momentum sum rule, i.e. when it is integrated over the removal\nenergy E, it fully reproduces the momentum distributions obtained from\nrealistic many-body wave functions , (ii) in order to saturate the momentum sum\nrule at high values of the momentum (k \\simeq 5 fm^{-1}) the spectral function\nhas to be integrate up to E \\simeq 400 MeV.

At the heart of most cosmological model predictions is\na numerical solution of the Einstein-Boltzmann equations governing the\nevolution of linear perturbations in the Universe. We present PyCosmo, a new\nPython-based framework to solve this set of equations using a special pur- pose\nsolver based on symbolic manipulations, automatic generation of C++ code and\nsparsity optimisation. The code uses a consistency relation of the field\nequations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations\nfor speed-up. After reviewing the system of first-order linear homogeneous\ndifferential equations to be solved, we describe the numerical scheme\nimplemented in PyCosmo. We then compare the predictions and performance of the\ncode for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological\nperturbations and compare it to existing cosmological Boltzmann codes. We find\nthat we achieve comparable execution times for comparable accuracies.

One\nwell-known problem is that it often is impossible or unrealistic to test for\nevery outcome, as the input and/or output of a program component can represent\nincredbly large, unless infinite domains. A common approach to tackle this\nissue it to only test classes of cases, and to assume that those classes cover\nall (or at least most) of the cases a component is susceptible to be exposed\nto. Unfortunately, those kind of assumptions can prove wrong in many\nsituations, causing a yet well-tested program to fail upon a particular input.\nIn this short paper, we propose to leverage formal verification, in particular\nmodel checking techniques, as a way to better identify cases for which the\naforementioned assumptions do not hold, and ultimately strenghten the\nconfidence one can have in a test suite. The idea is to extract a formal\nspecification of the data types of a program, in the form of a term rewriting\nsystem, and to check that specification against a set of properties specified\nby the programmer. Cases for which tose properties do not hold can then be\nidentified using model checking, and selected as test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 10:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

Motivated by the observation that\nthe root of the spectrum scarcity is not a lack of resources but an inefficient\nmanaging that can be solved, dynamic opportunistic exploitation of spectral\nbands has been considered, under the name of Cognitive Radio (CR). This\ntechnology allows secondary users to access currently idle spectral bands by\ndetecting and tracking the spectrum occupancy. The CR application revisits this\ntraditional task with specific and severe requirements in terms of spectrum\nsensing and detection performance, real-time processing, robustness to noise\nand more. Unfortunately, conventional methods do not satisfy these demands for\ntypical signals, that often have very high Nyquist rates.\n  Recently, several sampling methods have been proposed that exploit signals' a\npriori known structure to sample them below the Nyquist rate. Here, we review\nsome of these techniques and tie them to the task of spectrum sensing in the\ncontext of CR. We then show how issues related to spectrum sensing can be\ntackled in the sub-Nyquist regime. First, to cope with low signal to noise\nratios, we propose to recover second-order statistics from the low rate\nsamples, rather than the signal itself. In particular, we consider\ncyclostationary based detection, and investigate CR networks that perform\ncollaborative spectrum sensing to overcome channel effects. To enhance the\nefficiency of the available spectral bands detection, we present joint spectrum\nsensing and direction of arrival estimation methods. Throughout this work, we\nhighlight the relation between theoretical algorithms and their practical\nimplementation. We show hardware simulations performed on a prototype we built,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing in the context of\nCR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 11:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We show that this sensitivity is closely\nlinked to manner in which viscous damping couples to floppy-like, non-affine\nmotion, which is prominent near jamming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 12:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 11:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

MLVs are typically formed from a lamellar phase and\nplay an important role in determining the rheological properties of surfactant\nsolutions. Despite the wide literature on the collective dynamics of flowing\nMLVs, investigations on the flow behavior of single MLVs are scarce. In this\nwork, we investigate a concentrated aqueous solution of linear alkylbenzene\nsulfonic acid (HLAS), characterized by MLVs dispersed in an isotropic micellar\nphase. Rheological tests show that the HLAS solution is a shear-thinning fluid\nwith a power law index dependent on the shear rate. Pressure-driven shear flow\nof the HLAS solution in glass capillaries is investigated by high-speed video\nmicroscopy and image analysis. The so obtained velocity profiles provide\nevidence of a power-law fluid behaviour of the HLAS solution and images show a\nflow-focusing effect of the lamellar phase in the central core of the\ncapillary. The flow behavior of individual MLVs shows analogies with that of\nunilamellar vesicles and emulsion droplets. Deformed MLVs exhibit typical\nshapes of unilamellar vesicles, such as parachute and bullet-like. Furthermore,\nMLV velocity follows the classical Hetsroni theory for droplets provided that\nthe power law shear dependent viscosity of the HLAS solution is taken into\naccount. The results of this work are relevant for the processing of\nsurfactant-based systems in which the final properties depend on flow-induced\nmorphology, such as cosmetic formulations and food products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 12:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

However, this assumption\nis not generally true, especially for a bath with a considerably non-negligible\nmemory effect and for a system repeatedly projected into an initial general\nsuperposition state. We find that in stark contrast to the result of a constant\nvalue found in the traditional approach, the scaled average decay rate in unit\nZeno interval of the survival probability is generally time-dependent or has an\noscillatory behavior. In the case of strong bath correlation, the transition\nbetween the QZE and QAZE depends sensitively on the number of measurements $N$.\nFor a fixed $N$, a QZE region predicted by the tradition approach may be in\nfact already in the QAZE region.

A fundamental problem is that structurally related patterns can have\nvery distinct appearances, because the structural relationships are often based\non transformations of musical material, like chromatic or diatonic\ntransposition, inversion, retrograde, or rhythm change. In this preliminary\nwork, we study the potential of two unsupervised learning techniques -\nRestricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Gated Autoencoders (GAEs) - to capture\npre-defined transformations from constructed data pairs. We evaluate the models\nby using the learned representations as inputs in a discriminative task where\nfor a given type of transformation (e.g. diatonic transposition), the specific\nrelation between two musical patterns must be recognized (e.g. an upward\ntransposition of diatonic steps). Furthermore, we measure the reconstruction\nerror of models when reconstructing musical transformed patterns. Lastly, we\ntest the models in an analogy-making task. We find that it is difficult to\nlearn musical transformations with the RBM and that the GAE is much more\nadequate for this task, since it is able to learn representations of specific\ntransformations that are largely content-invariant.

We also present the Comprehensive & Adaptable Aperture\nPhotometry Routine (CAAPR), the pipeline we developed to carry out our\naperture-matched photometry. CAAPR is designed to produce consistent photometry\nfor the enormous range of galaxy and observation types in our data. In\nparticular, CAAPR is able to determine robust cross-compatible uncertainties,\nthanks to a novel method for reliably extrapolating the aperture noise for\nobservations that cover a very limited amount of background. Our rich database\nof imagery and photometry is being made available to the community\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Electronic\nimplementation of such stochastic networks is currently limited to addition of\nalgorithmic noise to digital machines which is inherently inefficient; albeit\nrecent efforts to harness physical noise in devices for stochasticity have\nshown promise. To succeed in fabricating electronic neuromorphic networks we\nneed experimental evidence of devices with measurable and controllable\nstochasticity which is complemented with the development of reliable\nstatistical models of such observed stochasticity. Current research literature\nhas sparse evidence of the former and a complete lack of the latter. This\nmotivates the current article where we demonstrate a stochastic neuron using an\ninsulator-metal-transition (IMT) device, based on electrically induced\nphase-transition, in series with a tunable resistance. We show that an IMT\nneuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron\nand incorporates all characteristics of a spiking neuron in the device\nphenomena. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous stochastic spiking along\nwith electrically controllable firing probabilities using Vanadium Dioxide\n(VO$_2$) based IMT neurons which show a sigmoid-like transfer function. The\nstochastic spiking is explained by two noise sources - thermal noise and\nthreshold fluctuations, which act as precursors of bifurcation. As such, the\nIMT neuron is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating\nboundary resulting in transfer curves that closely match experiments. As one of\nthe first comprehensive studies of a stochastic neuron hardware and its\nstatistical properties, this article would enable efficient implementation of a\nlarge class of neuro-mimetic networks and algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 19:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 18:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 21:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 18:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}
