A minimax formulation is able to establish among a\nclassifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with\nGAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same\ndistribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether\nsamples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies\nwhich generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that\ninternal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them\nwill be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a\nprobabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture GAN (MGAN). We develop\ntheoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators' distributions and the\nempirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators'\ndistributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapse. By\nutilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost\nto the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale\ndatasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural\nimage databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over\nlatest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at\ndifferent resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects\nby generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 16:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 01:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 03:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 23:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

In this\narticle, I review important applications of engineered dissipation, including\nstate generation, state stabilization, and autonomous quantum error correction,\nwhere engineered dissipation can mitigate the effect of intrinsic noise,\nreducing logical error rates in quantum information processing. Further, I\nprovide a pedagogical review of the basic noise processes in superconducting\nqubits (photon loss and phase noise), and argue that any dissipative mechanism\nwhich can correct photon loss errors is very likely to automatically suppress\ndephasing.

Such subpopulations can be identified by\nconsidering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all\ncases in the population occurring before (Bp) and after the epidemic peak (Ap)\nto calculate the subpopulation's relative risk, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for\nseveral age groups using data on RSV hospitalizations in the US between\n2001-2012 from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).\n  Results: Children aged 3-4y and 5-6y each had the highest RR estimate for\n5/11 seasons in the data, with RSV hospitalization rates in infants being\ngenerally higher during seasons when children aged 5-6y had the highest RR\nestimates.

However,\nprevious methods for computing exact RWR require prohibitive storage sizes and\ncomputational costs, and alternative methods which avoid such costs by\ncomputing approximate RWR have limited accuracy. In this paper, we propose TPA,\na fast, scalable, and highly accurate method for computing approximate RWR on\nlarge graphs. TPA exploits two important properties in RWR: 1) nodes close to a\nseed node are likely to be revisited in following steps due to block-wise\nstructure of many real-world graphs, and 2) RWR scores of nodes which reside\nfar from the seed node are proportional to their PageRank scores. Based on\nthese two properties, TPA divides approximate RWR problem into two subproblems\ncalled neighbor approximation and stranger approximation. In the neighbor\napproximation, TPA estimates RWR scores of nodes close to the seed based on\nscores of few early steps from the seed. In the stranger approximation, TPA\nestimates RWR scores for nodes far from the seed using their PageRank. The\nstranger and neighbor approximations are conducted in the preprocessing phase\nand the online phase, respectively. Through extensive experiments, we show that\nTPA requires up to 3.5x less time with up to 40x less memory space than other\nstate-of-the-art methods for the preprocessing phase. In the online phase, TPA\ncomputes approximate RWR up to 30x faster than existing methods while\nmaintaining high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 17:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 11:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 14:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 13:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

Belief propagation\nis a widely deployed iterative method for solving these problems. However,\ndespite its significant empirical success, not much is known about the\ncorrectness and efficiency of belief propagation.\n  Bethe approximation is an optimization-based framework for approximating\npartition functions. While it is known that the stationary points of the Bethe\napproximation coincide with the fixed points of belief propagation, in general,\nthe relation between the Bethe approximation and the partition function is not\nwell understood. It has been observed that for a few classes of factor graphs,\nthe Bethe approximation always gives a lower bound to the partition function,\nwhich distinguishes them from the general case, where neither a lower bound,\nnor an upper bound holds universally. This has been rigorously proved for\npermanents and for attractive graphical models.\n  Here we consider bipartite normal factor graphs and show that if the local\nconstraints satisfy a certain analytic property, the Bethe approximation is a\nlower bound to the partition function. We arrive at this result by viewing\nfactor graphs through the lens of polynomials. In this process, we reformulate\nthe Bethe approximation as a polynomial optimization problem. Our sufficient\ncondition for the lower bound property to hold is inspired by recent\ndevelopments in the theory of real stable polynomials. We believe that this way\nof viewing factor graphs and its connection to real stability might lead to a\nbetter understanding of belief propagation and factor graphs in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 17:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

We show that since these stars are\nconstantly cooling, the velocity dispersion has a noticeable trend with\nspectral type. With realistic assumptions for the initial-mass function,\nstar-formation history, and the cooling models, we show that the velocity\ndispersion is roughly consistent with what is observed for M dwarfs, decreases\nto cooler spectral types, and increases again for the coolest types in our\nstudy ($\\sim$T9). We predict a minimum in the velocity dispersions for L/T\ntransition objects, however the detailed properties of the minimum\npredominately depend on the star-formation history. Since this trend is due to\nbrown dwarf cooling, we expect the velocity dispersion as a function of\nspectral type should deviate from constancy around the hydrogen-burning limit.\nWe convert from velocity dispersion to vertical scale height using standard\ndisk models, and present similar trends in disk thickness as a function of\nspectral type. We suggest that future, wide-field photometric and/or\nspectroscopic missions may collect sizable samples of distant ($\\sim\\!1$ kpc)\nof dwarfs that span the hydrogen-burning limit. As such, we speculate that such\nobservations may provide a unique way of constraining the average spectral type\nof hydrogen-burning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 18:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Where the SSP property is needed, it has been shown that implicit\nand implicit-explicit methods have very restrictive time-steps and are\ntherefore not efficient. For this reason, SSP integrating factor methods may\noffer an attractive alternative to traditional time-stepping methods for\nproblems with a linear component that is stiff and a nonlinear component that\nis not. However, the strong stability properties of integrating factor\nRunge-Kutta methods have not been established. In this work we show that it is\npossible to define explicit integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods that\npreserve the desired strong stability properties satisfied by each of the two\ncomponents when coupled with forward Euler time-stepping, or even given weaker\nconditions. We define sufficient conditions for an explicit integrating factor\nRunge--Kutta method to be SSP, namely that they are based on explicit SSP\nRunge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing abscissas. We find such methods of up\nto fourth order and up to ten stages, analyze their SSP coefficients, and prove\ntheir optimality in a few cases. We test these methods to demonstrate their\nconvergence and to show that the SSP time-step predicted by the theory is\ngenerally sharp, and that the non-decreasing abscissa condition is needed in\nour test cases. Finally, we show that on typical total variation diminishing\nlinear and nonlinear test-cases our new explicit SSP integrating factor\nRunge-Kutta methods out-perform the corresponding explicit SSP Runge-Kutta\nmethods, implicit-explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods, and some well-known\nexponential time differencing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 18:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

ERGM parameter estimation requires the\napproximation of an intractable normalizing constant. Simulation methods\nrepresent the state-of-the-art approach to approximating the normalizing\nconstant, leading to estimation by Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMLE).\nMCMLE is accurate when a large sample of networks is used to approximate the\nnormalizing constant. However, MCMLE is computationally expensive, and may be\nprohibitively so if the size of the network is on the order of 1,000 nodes\n(i.e., one million potential ties) or greater.

Such shocks are mediated\nby scattering of radiation. We introduce a time dependent, special relativistic\ncode which dynamically couples Monte Carlo radiative transfer to the flow\nhydrodynamics. The code also self-consistently implements electron-positron\npair production and annihilation. We simulate shocks with properties relevant\nfor GRBs and study the steady-state solutions, which are accurate deep below\nthe jet photosphere.

Strong shocks (for which the downstream pressure is much larger\nthan the upstream pressure) have rising $\\nu F_\\nu$ shock spectra. The spectrum\nextends up to $\\epsilon_{max} \\equiv E_{max}/m_e c^2 \\sim v^2$ for\nnon-relativistic shocks, where $m_e$ is the electron rest mass and $v$ is the\nrelative speed between the upstream and downstream in units of the speed of\nlight $c$.

At last, we make a brief discussion on the impacts coming from\ndifferent baryon models and simulation codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 20:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 14:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 21:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Conventional phylogenetic clustering approaches rely on arbitrary\ncutpoints applied a posteriori to phylogenetic estimates. Although in practice,\nBayesian and bootstrap-based clustering tend to lead to similar estimates, they\noften produce conflicting measures of confidence in clusters. The current study\nproposes a new Bayesian phylogenetic clustering algorithm, which we refer to as\nDM-PhyClus, that identifies sets of sequences resulting from quick transmission\nchains, thus yielding easily-interpretable clusters, without using any ad hoc\ndistance or confidence requirement. Results. Simulations reveal that DM-PhyClus\ncan outperform conventional clustering methods, as well as the Gap procedure, a\npure distance-based algorithm, in terms of mean cluster recovery. We apply\nDM-PhyClus to a sample of real HIV-1 sequences, producing a set of clusters\nwhose inference is in line with the conclusions of a previous thorough\nanalysis. Conclusions. DM-PhyClus, by eliminating the need for cutpoints and\nproducing sensible inference for cluster configurations, can facilitate\ntransmission cluster detection. Future efforts to reduce incidence of\ninfectious diseases, like HIV-1, will need reliable estimates of transmission\nclusters.

The construction of accurate surrogate models with large\nnumbers of independent variables is currently prohibitive because it requires a\nlarge number of function evaluations. Gradient-enhanced kriging has the\npotential to reduce the number of function evaluations for the desired accuracy\nwhen efficient gradient computation, such as an adjoint method, is available.\nHowever, current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the\nnumber of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the\ncorrelation matrix where new information is added for each sampling point in\neach direction of the design space.

Previous approaches utilize a two-step procedure (visible feature\nestimation and visible image reconstruction) to synthesize the visible image\ngiven the corresponding polarimetric thermal image. However, these are regarded\nas two disjoint steps and hence may hinder the performance of visible face\nreconstruction. We argue that joint optimization would be a better way to\nreconstruct more photo-realistic images for both computer vision algorithms and\nhuman-examiners to examine. To this end, this paper proposes a Generative\nAdversarial Network-based Visible Face Synthesis (GAN-VFS) method to synthesize\nmore photo-realistic visible face images from their corresponding polarimetric\nimages. To ensure that the encoded visible-features contain more semantically\nmeaningful information in reconstructing the visible face image, a guidance\nsub-network is involved into the training procedure.

Specifically, detonation\nattenuation by a porous medium, and the subsequent re-initiation for\nmethane-oxygen, a moderately unstable mixture, was considered. The purpose of\nthe investigation was to validate the numerical strategy with previous\nexperimental observations, and to determine what specific roles turbulent\nmixing and shock compression have on flame acceleration during the final stages\nof DDT. The modelling procedure adopted was a grid-within-a-grid approach: The\ncompressible linear eddy model for large eddy simulation (CLEM-LES). It was\nfound that average turbulent fluctuations greater than the laminar flame speed\nwere required in order to maintain wave velocities above the Chapman-Jouguet\n(CJ)-deflagration velocity threshold, a precursor requirement for DDT to occur.\nIt was also found that sufficient turbulent burning on the flame surface was\nrequired in order to drive pressure waves to sufficiently strengthen the\nleading shock wave, locally, in order to trigger auto-ignition hot spots in the\nwave front. These local explosion events, which were found to burn out through\nturbulent surface reactions, drive transverse pressure waves outward. Upon\nsubsequent shock reflections or interactions of the transverse waves, new local\nexplosion events occurred, which further strengthened the adjacent leading\nshock wave above the CJ-detonation speed. Eventually, through this process, the\nwave sustained the CJ-detonation speed, on average, through the cyclic\nmechanism of local explosion events followed by turbulent surface reactions.\nFinally, combustion of the flame acceleration process was found to lie\npredominantly within the thin-reaction zones regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 00:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

However, for classes of\ndecision-making problems based on robust, interval chance-constrained\noptimization, necessary inputs take the form of polyhedra or ellipsoids.\nConsequently, we propose a systematic framework to readily generate and\nevaluate ellipsoidal prediction regions, with predefined probability and\nminimum volume. A skill score is proposed for quantitative assessment of the\nquality of prediction ellipsoids. A set of experiments is used to illustrate\nthe discrimination ability of the proposed scoring rule for misspecification of\nellipsoidal prediction regions. Application results based on three datasets\nwith wind, PV power and electricity prices, allow us to assess the skill of the\nresulting ellipsoidal prediction regions, in terms of calibration, sharpness\nand overall skill.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 03:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

However, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC), fermions prepared in identical internal states with distinct momenta\nbecome distinguishable. The resulting strongly interacting system can exhibit\nexotic topological and pairing behaviors, many of which are yet to be observed\nin condensed matter systems. Ultracold atomic gases offer a promising pathway\nfor simulating these rich phenomena. Two recent experiments reported the\nobservation of single atom SOC in optical lattice clocks (OLCs) based on\nalkaline-earth atoms. In these works encoding the effective spin degree of\nfreedom in the long-lived electronic clock states significantly reduced the\ndetrimental effects of spontaneous emission and heating that have thus far\nhindered the study of interacting SOC with alkali atoms. Beyond first studies\nof interacting SOC with alkali atoms in a bulk gas and with two particles in a\nlattice, here we enter a new regime of many-body interacting SOC in an OLC.\nUsing clock spectroscopy, we observe the precession of the collective\nmagnetization and the emergence of spin locking effects arising from an\ninterplay between p-wave and SOC-induced exchange interactions. The many-body\ndynamics are well captured by a collective XXZ spin model, which describes a\nbroad class of condensed matter systems ranging from superconductors to quantum\nmagnets. Furthermore, our work will aid in the design of next-generation OLCs\nby offering a route for avoiding the observed large density shifts caused by\nSOC-induced exchange interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 03:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2017 02:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Here we\npropose and demonstrate the use of correlated spin-Hamiltonians for the\nrealization of Heisenberg-limited Rabi-type spectroscopy. Rather than probing\nthe free evolution of the phase of an entangled state with respect to a local\noscillator (LO), we probe the evolution of an, initially separable, two-atom\nregister under an Ising spin-Hamiltonian with a transverse field. The resulting\ncorrelated spin-rotation spectrum is twice as narrow as compared with\nuncorrelated rotation. We implement this Heisenberg-limited Rabi spectroscopy\nscheme on the optical-clock electric-quadrupole transition of $^{88}$Sr$^+$\nusing a two-ion crystal. We further show that depending on the initial state,\ncorrelated rotation can occur in two orthogonal sub-spaces of the full Hilbert\nspace, yielding Heisenberg-limited spectroscopy of either the average\ntransition frequency of the two ions or their difference from the mean\nfrequency. The potential improvement of clock stability due to the use of\nentangled states depends on the details of the method used and the dominating\ndecoherence mechanism. The use of correlated spin-rotations can therefore\npotentially lead to new paths for clock stability improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 07:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

The\nalgebra $A_{n}(0,b,-b^2)$ is a coset of the braid algebra.\n  The two other algebras $B_{n}$ and $C_{n}$ do not possess any parameter, and\ncan be also viewed as a coset of the braid algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 08:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

In practical scenarios, due to the\ndifference in channel characteristics, an extra residual component, termed as\nANC noise, appears during the processing of the received signal. This ANC noise\ncomponent may suppress the ANC gain. None of the existing literature to our\nknowledge considers the effect of spatial correlation among channels on ANC\nnoise. This paper develops a generic framework to investigate the effect of\nchannel characteristics on ANC noise.

One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning\nof immunity. In some disease systems, the process of waning immunity can be\nnon-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration of immunity\nand subsequent boosting of immunity through asymptomatic re-exposure.\n  We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine\nthe interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration of\ninfection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity,\nwe explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease\npatterns and prevalence of infection.\n  Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its\nability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration of\ninfection-acquired immunity and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity. We find\nthat increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in\noverall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary\ninfections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period\nand taller peaks.\n  Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease\nmay change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs\nfrom that of infection-acquired immunity.

In turn, this has inspired synthetic biologists to design de\nnovo protein cages. We use simple models, on multiple scales, to investigate\nthe self-assembly of a spherical cage, focusing on the regularity of the\npacking of protein-like objects on the surface. Using building blocks, which\nare able to pack with icosahedral symmetry, we examine how stable these highly\nsymmetric structures are to perturbations that may arise from the interplay\nbetween flexibility of the interacting blocks and entropic effects. We find\nthat, in the presence of those perturbations, icosahedral packing is not the\nmost stable arrangement for a wide range of parameters; rather disordered\nstructures are found to be the most stable. Our results suggest that (i) many\ndesigned, or even natural, protein cages may not be regular in the presence of\nthose perturbations, and (ii) that optimizing those flexibilities can be a\npossible design strategy to obtain regular synthetic cages with full control\nover their surface properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 12:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

This is, therefore, the first indication of coherent\nemission other than radio originating in pulsars. At the same time, we\nidentified an extended structure, preliminarily detected in ground-based\nobservations. We support its interpretation as a counter-jet protruding from\nthe pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 13:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 14:40:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

A key requirement from such\ndistance functions is the absence of spurious local minima, which may foil such\nan approach, and this has led to the common use of harmonic potential\nfunctions. Based on the planar Laplace operator, the potential function\nguarantees the absence of spurious minima, but is well known to be slow to\nnumerically compute and prone to numerical precision issues. To alleviate the\nfirst of these problems, we propose a family of novel divergence distances.\nThese are based on f-divergence of the Poisson kernel of the domain. We define\nthe divergence distances and compare them to the harmonic potential function\nand other related distance functions.\n  Our first result is theoretical: We show that the family of divergence\ndistances are equivalent to the harmonic potential function on simply-connected\ndomains, namely generate paths which are identical to those generated by the\npotential function. The proof is based on the concept of conformal invariance.\n  Our other results are more practical and relate to two special cases of\ndivergence distances, one based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and one\nbased on the total variation divergence. We show that using divergence\ndistances instead of the potential function and other distances has a\nsignificant computational advantage, as, following a pre-processing stage, they\nmay be computed up to an order of magnitude faster than the others when taking\nadvantage of certain sparsity properties of the Poisson kernel. Furthermore,\nthe computation is \"embarrassingly parallel\", so may be implemented on a GPU\nwith up to three orders of magnitude speedup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 13:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

Several \"bubbles\" are clearly identified in the Carina\nNebula Complex, produced by the impact of the massive star clusters located in\nthis region. An HI absorption profile obtained towards the strong extragalactic\nradio source PMN J1032--5917 showed the distribution of the cold component of\nthe atomic gas along the Galactic disk, with the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus\nspiral arms clearly distinguishable. Preliminary calculations of the optical\ndepth and spin temperatures of the cold atomic gas show that the HI line is\nopaque ($\\tau \\gtrsim$ 2) at several velocities in the Sagittarius-Carina\nspiral arm. The spin temperature is $\\sim100$ K in the regions with the highest\noptical depth, although this value might be lower for the saturated components.\nThe atomic mass budget of Gum 31 is $\\sim35 \\%$ of the total gas mass. HI self\nabsorption features have molecular counterparts and good spatial correlation\nwith the regions of cold dust as traced by the infrared maps. We suggest that\nin Gum 31 regions of cold temperature and high density are where the atomic to\nmolecular gas phase transition is likely to be occurring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 15:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

The radiative transfer code was\nvalidated through two test calculations: (1) computing in different inertial\nframes and (2) computing in flow-fields with discontinuous and smeared shock\nfronts. The simulation results of the angular distribution and spectrum were\ncompared among three different inertial frames and in good agreement with each\nother. If the time duration for updating the flow-field was sufficiently small\nto resolve a mean free path of a photon into ten steps, the results were\nthoroughly converged. The spectrum computed in the flow-field with a\ndiscontinuous shock front obeyed a power-law in frequency whose index was\npositive in the range from 1 to 10 MeV. The number of photons in the\nhigh-energy side decreased with the smeared shock front because the photons\nwere less scattered immediately behind the shock wave due to the small electron\nnumber density. The large optical depth near the shock front was needed for\nobtaining high-energy photons through bulk Compton scattering. Even\none-dimensional structure of the shock wave could affect the results of\nradiation transport computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 15:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Conformal invariance predicts that the leading finite-size correction\nto the free energy of a two-dimensional system at a conformal invariant\ncritical point is linearly related to the central charge of the corresponding\nconformal field theory. However, experimental determination of the central\ncharge of a non-unitary conformal invariant critical theory has not been done\nbefore because of the intrinsic difficulty that complex parameters occurs in\nnon-unitary theory, which is not physical. Here we propose to extract the\ncentral charge of the non-unitary conformal invariant critical point of a\ntwo-dimensional lattice models from the quantum coherence measurement of a\nprobe spin which is coupled to the two-dimensional lattice models. A recent\ndiscovery shows that quantum decoherence of a probe spin which is coupled to a\nbath is proportional to the partition function of the bath with a complex\nparameter. Thus the central charge of a non-unitary conformal field theory\ncould be extracted from quantum decoherence measurement of a probe spin which\nis coupled to a bath.

The influence of\narginine content on structure, mechanical, surface and biological properties of\nthe scaffolds was investigated. It was found that with an increase of arginine\nconcentration diameter of the scaffold fibers was reduced, which was\naccompanied by an increase of scaffold strength and Young modulus. It was\ndemonstrated that porosity and water contact angle of the scaffold are\nindependent from arginine content. The best cell adhesion and viability was\nshown on scaffolds with arginine concentration from 0.5 to 1 % wt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 09:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}
