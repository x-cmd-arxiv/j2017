Wavenet is a deep neural\nnetwork originally developed as a deep generative model of raw audio\nwave-forms. Wavenet architecture is based on dilated causal convolutions, which\nexhibit very large receptive fields. In this short paper we suggest using the\nWavenet architecture, in particular its large receptive filed in order to learn\nPESQ algorithm. By doing so we can use it as a differentiable loss function for\nspeech enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 16:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

By suitably designing the wave field,\nremote tweezers are produced that stably levitate particles in the air without\nany mechanical contact forces. Recent works have revealed that holographic\ntraps can levitate particles even with a single-sided wave source. However, the\nlevitatable objects in the previous studies were limited to particles smaller\nthan the wavelength, or flat parts placed near a rigid wall. Here, we achieve a\nstable levitation of a macroscopic rigid body by a holographic design of\nacoustic field without any dynamic control. The levitator models the acoustic\nradiation force and torque applied to a rigid body by discretising the body's\nsurface, as well as the acoustic wave sources, and optimizes the acoustic field\non the body surface to achieve the Lyapunov stability so that the field can\nproperly respond to the fluctuation of the body position and rotation. In an\nexperiment, a 40 kHz (8.5 mm wavelength) ultrasonic phased array levitated a\npolystyrene sphere and a regular octahedron with a size of ~50 mm located 200\nmm away from acoustic elements in the air. This method not only expands the\nvariety of levitatable objects but also contributes to microscopic contexts,\nsuch as in-vivo micromachines, since shorter-wavelength ultrasound than the\nsize of target objects can be used to achieve higher controllability and\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 16:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In particular, we present some methods in the\nqualitative theory of piecewise smooth vector fields, emphasizing a geometrical\nanalysis of the foliations generated by their orbits. Such approach displays\nsurprisingly a rich dynamical behaviour that has been studied in details in\nthis work.\n  It is worth to say that this subject has not been treated recently from a\nnon-local point of view, and we hope that the approach adopted in this work\ncontributes to the understanding of the structural stability for\npiecewise-smooth vector fields in its most global sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 16:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

With\nthe RCRP, one can allow both the number of clusters and the cluster parameters\nin a model to change over time. However, application of the RCRP has largely\nbeen limited due to the non-conjugacy between the cluster evolutionary priors\nand the Multinomial likelihood. This non-conjugacy makes inference di cult and\nrestricts the scalability of models which use the RCRP, leading to the RCRP\nbeing applied only in simple problems, such as those that can be approximated\nby a single Gaussian emission.

Their classical\nstudies were based on an integrable model of the secular evolution, obtained by\ndouble averaging of the disturbing function approximated with its first\nnon-trivial term. This was the quadrupole term in the series expansion with\nrespect to the ratio of the semimajor axis of the disturbed body to that of the\ndisturbing body. If the next (octupole) term is kept in the expression for the\ndisturbing function, long-term modulation of the KL-cycles can established\n(Ford et al., 2000, Naoz et al., 2011, Katz et al., 2011). Specifically, flips\nbetween the prograde and retrograde orbits become possible. Since such flips\nare observed only when the perturber has a non-zero eccentricity, the term\n\"Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Effect\" (or EKL-effect) was proposed by Lithwick and\nNaoz (2011) to specify such behaviour. We demonstrate that the EKL-effect can\nbe interpreted as a resonance phenomenon. To this end, we write down the\nequations of motion in terms of \"action-angle\" variables emerging in the\nintegrable Kozai-Lidov model. It turns out that for some initial values the\nresonance is degenerate and the usual \"pendulum\" approximation is insufficient\nto describe the evolution of the resonance phase.

The\nfirst is a deterministic linear proximal scheme that handles a sequence of\nconvex quadratic problems, each efficiently solvable either via off-the-shelf\nalgorithms or through the alternating direction method of multipliers.\nLeveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to power networks, the second\nscheme is stochastic, and updates only \\emph{a few} entries of the complex\nvoltage state vector per iteration. In particular, when voltage magnitude and\n(re)active power flow measurements are used only, this number reduces to one or\ntwo, \\emph{regardless of} the number of buses in the network. This\ncomputational complexity evidently scales well to large-size power systems.\nFurthermore, by carefully \\emph{mini-batching} the voltage and power flow\nmeasurements, accelerated implementation of the stochastic iterations becomes\npossible. The developed algorithms are numerically evaluated using a variety of\nbenchmark power networks. Simulated tests corroborate that improved robustness\ncan be attained at comparable or markedly reduced computation times for medium-\nor large-size networks relative to the \"workhorse\" WLS-based Gauss-Newton\niterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 19:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 16:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

The Kepler star in question,\nKIC 3542116, is of spectral type F2V and is quite bright at K_p = 10. The\ntransits have a distinct asymmetric shape with a steeper ingress and slower\negress that can be ascribed to objects with a trailing dust tail passing over\nthe stellar disk. There are three deeper transits with depths of ~0.1% that\nlast for about a day, and three that are several times more shallow and of\nshorter duration. The transits were found via an exhaustive visual search of\nthe entire Kepler photometric data set, which we describe in some detail. We\nreview the methods we use to validate the Kepler data showing the comet\ntransits, and rule out instrumental artefacts as sources of the signals. We fit\nthe transits with a simple dust-tail model, and find that a transverse comet\nspeed of ~35-50 km/s and a minimum amount of dust present in the tail of ~10^16\ng are required to explain the larger transits. For a dust replenishment time of\n~10 days, and a comet lifetime of only ~300 days, this implies a total cometary\nmass of > 3 x 10^17 g, or about the mass of Halley's comet. We also discuss the\nnumber of comets and orbital geometry that would be necessary to explain the\nsix transits detected over the four years of Kepler prime-field observations.\nFinally, we also report the discovery of a single comet-shaped transit in KIC\n11084727 with very similar transit and host-star properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 03:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 01:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

In the discrete, a complex D can be called\nelliptic if a McKean-Singer spectral symmetry applies as this implies\nstr(exp(-t D^2)) is t-independent. In that case, the analytic index of D is the\nsum of (-1)^k b_k(D), where b_k(D) is the k'th Betti number, which by Hodge is\nthe nullity of the (k+1)'th block of the Hodge operator L=D^2. It can also be\nwritten as a topological index summing K(v) over the set of zero-dimensional\nsimplices in G and where K is an Euler type curvature defined by G and D. This\ncan be interpreted as a Atiyah-Singer type correspondence between analytic and\ntopological index. Examples are the de Rham differential complex for the Euler\ncharacteristic X(G) or the connection differential complex for Wu\ncharacteristic w_k(G). Given an endomorphism T of an elliptic complex, the\nLefschetz number X(T,G,D) is defined as the super trace of T acting on\ncohomology defined by E. It is equal to the sum i(v) over V which are contained\nin fixed simplices of T, and i is a Brouwer type index. This Atiyah-Bott result\ngeneralizes the Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem for an endomorphism of\nthe simplicial complex G. In both the static and dynamic setting, the proof is\ndone by heat deforming the Koopman operator U(T) to get the cohomological\npicture str(exp(-t D^2) U(T)) in the limit t to infinity and then use Hodge,\nand then by applying a discrete gradient flow to the simplex data defining the\nvaluation to push str(U(T)) to V, getting curvature K(v) or the Brouwer type\nindex i(v).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 03:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Correlation-based variable screening, in\nwhich one leverages marginal correlations for removal of irrelevant variables\nfrom the model prior to statistical inference, can be used to overcome this\nchallenge. Prior works on correlation-based variable screening either impose\nstatistical priors on the linear model or assume specific post-screening\ninference methods. This paper first extends the analysis of correlation-based\nvariable screening to arbitrary linear models and post-screening inference\ntechniques. In particular, (i) it shows that a condition---termed the screening\ncondition---is sufficient for successful correlation-based screening of linear\nmodels, and (ii) it provides insights into the dependence of marginal\ncorrelation-based screening on different problem parameters. Numerical\nexperiments confirm that these insights are not mere artifacts of analysis;\nrather, they are reflective of the challenges associated with marginal\ncorrelation-based variable screening. Second, the paper explicitly derives the\nscreening condition for arbitrary (random or deterministic) linear models and,\nin the process, it establishes that---under appropriate conditions---it is\npossible to reduce the dimension of an ultrahigh-dimensional, arbitrary linear\nmodel to almost the sample size even when the number of active variables scales\nalmost linearly with the sample size. Third, it specializes the screening\ncondition to sub-Gaussian linear models and contrasts the final results to\nthose existing in the literature. This specialization formally validates the\nclaim that the main result of this paper generalizes existing ones on\ncorrelation-based screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 03:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 18:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode\nGermanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of\nsmall samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast\nscreening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser\nmaterials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases, sensitivity is\ndemonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228\nRa, 0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90%\nconfidence level. These meet the requirements of most screening campaigns\npresently under way for rare-event search experiments, such as the LUX-ZEPLIN\n(LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector\nto probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the\npresence of radioisotopes associated with neutron production; this is of\nparticular relevance in experiments sensitive to nuclear recoils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases\nmoderately with the Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller\nthan that of the axisymmetric ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 11:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 17:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

In the mean sphericity profile of\nIllustris halos we identify a dip close to the virial radius, which is robust\nacross a broad range of masses and infall rates. The inner edge of this feature\nmay be related to the virial radius and the outer edge with the splashback\nradius. Due to the high halo-to-halo variation this result is visible only on\naverage. However, in four individual halos in the MUGS sample, a decrease in\nthe sphericity and a subsequent recovery is evident close to the splashback\nradius. We find that this feature persists for several Gyr, growing with the\nhalo. This feature appears at the interface between the spherical halo density\ndistribution and the filamentary structure in the environment. The shape\nfeature is strongest when there is a high rate of infall, implying that the\neffect is due to the mixing of accreting and virializing material. The\nfilamentary velocity field becomes rapidly mixed in the halo region inside the\nvirial radius, with the area between this and the splashback radius serving as\nthe transition region. We also identify a long-lasting and smoothly evolving\nsplashback region in the radial density gradient in many of the MUGS halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

However, the\npossible connection between radio and very high energy (VHE, E>0.1 TeV)\nemission still remains elusive, owing to the lack of a homogeneous coverage of\nthe VHE sky. The main goal of this work is to quantify and assess the\nsignificance of a possible connection between the radio emission on parsec\nscale measured by the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and GeV-TeV\ngamma-ray emission in blazars, which is a central issue for understanding the\nblazar physics and the emission processes. We investigate the radio VLBI and\nhigh energy gamma-ray emission by using two large and unbiased AGN samples\nextracted from the first and second Fermi-LAT catalogs of hard gamma-ray\nsources detected above 10 GeV (1FHL) and 50 GeV (2FHL). For comparison, we\nperform the same correlation analysis by using the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energy\nflux provided by the third Fermi-LAT source catalog. We find that the\ncorrelation strength and significance depend on the gamma-ray energy range with\na different behavior among the blazar sub-classes. Overall, the radio and\ngamma-ray emission above 10 GeV turns out to be uncorrelated for the full\nsamples and for all of the blazar sub-classes with the exception of high\nsynchrotron peaked (HSP) objects, which show a strong and significant\ncorrelation. On the contrary, when 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energies are\nconsidered, a strong and significant correlation is found for the full blazar\nsample as well as for all of the blazar sub-classes. We interpret and explain\nthis correlation behavior within the framework of the blazar spectral energy\ndistribution properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 13:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 09:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 08:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

This paper proposes a novel method of action\nrecognition which uses temporal 3D skeletal Kinect data. This method introduces\nthe definition of body states and then every action is modeled as a sequence of\nthese states. The learning stage uses Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\nto construct discriminant feature space for discriminating the body states.\nMoreover, this paper suggests the use of the Mahalonobis distance as an\nappropriate distance metric for the classification of the states of involuntary\nactions.

This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration\nand mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD\nunder cryogenic temperatures.

The reflectivity of a\nbare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient\nconditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs\noff state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000/:1 when illuminated\nwith an f/4 optical beam.

GRAPHR follows the principle of near-data processing and explores\nthe opportunity of performing massive parallel analog operations with low\nhardware and energy cost. The analog computation is suit- able for graph\nprocessing because: 1) The algorithms are iterative and could inherently\ntolerate the imprecision; 2) Both probability calculation (e.g., PageRank and\nCollaborative Filtering) and typical graph algorithms involving integers (e.g.,\nBFS/SSSP) are resilient to errors. The key insight of GRAPHR is that if a\nvertex program of a graph algorithm can be expressed in sparse matrix vector\nmultiplication (SpMV), it can be efficiently performed by ReRAM crossbar. We\nshow that this assumption is generally true for a large set of graph\nalgorithms. GRAPHR is a novel accelerator architecture consisting of two\ncomponents: memory ReRAM and graph engine (GE). The core graph computations are\nperformed in sparse matrix format in GEs (ReRAM crossbars). The\nvector/matrix-based graph computation is not new, but ReRAM offers the unique\nopportunity to realize the massive parallelism with unprecedented energy\nefficiency and low hardware cost.

Much of the research on this topic has focused on coloring with\n$\\Delta+1$ colors, where $\\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree. Using $\\Delta+1$\ncolors may be unsatisfactory in sparse graphs, where not all nodes have such a\nhigh degree; it would be more desirable to use a number of colors that improves\nwith sparsity. A standard measure that captures sparsity is arboricity, which\nis the smallest number of forests into which the edges of the graph can be\npartitioned.\n  We present simple randomized distributed algorithms that, with high\nprobability, color any $n$-node $\\alpha$-arboricity graph:\n  - using $(2+\\varepsilon)\\cdot \\alpha$ colors, for constant $\\varepsilon>0$,\nin $O(\\log n)$ rounds, if $\\alpha=\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log n)$, or\n  - using $O(\\alpha \\log \\alpha )$ colors, in $O(\\log n)$ rounds, or\n  - using $O(\\alpha)$ colors, in $O(\\log n \\cdot \\min\\{\\log\\log n,\\; \\log\n\\alpha\\})$ rounds.\n  These algorithms are nearly-optimal, as it is known by results of Linial\n[FOCS'87] and Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08] that coloring with $\\Theta(\\alpha)$\ncolors, or even poly$(\\alpha)$ colors, requires $\\Omega(\\log_{\\alpha} n)$\nrounds. The previously best-known $O(\\log n)$-time result was a deterministic\nalgorithm due to Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08], which uses $\\Theta(\\alpha ^2)$\ncolors. Barenboim and Elkin stated improving this number of colors as an open\nproblem in their Distributed Graph Coloring Book.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 15:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 08:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}
