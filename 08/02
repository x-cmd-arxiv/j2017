With generated heat fluxes within\nthese devices reaching magnitude close to ten times of that at the sun surface,\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is an attractive candidate to aid in\nthe extraction of this heat in order to keep the operating temperatures of\nthese high power electronics as low as possible. Due to the observed\ninhomogeneous structure, CVD diamond membranes exhibit a 3D anisotropic thermal\nconductivity which may result in significantly different cooling performance\nfrom expected in a given application. In this work, time domain\nthermoreflectance (TDTR) is used to measure the thermal properties of an\n11.8-{\\mu}m CVD diamond membrane from its nucleation side. Starting with a spot\nsize diameter larger than the thickness of the membrane, measurements are made\nat various modulation frequencies from 1.2 MHz to 11.6 MHz to tune the heat\npenetration depth, and subsequently the part of diamond sampled by TDTR. We\ndivide the membrane into ten sublayers and assume isotropic thermal\nconductivity in each sublayer. From this, we observe a 2D gradient of the\ndepth-dependent thermal conductivity for this membrane. By measuring the same\nregion with a smaller spot size at multiple frequencies, the in-plane and\ncross-plane thermal conductivity are extracted respectively. Through this use\nof multiple spot sizes and modulation frequencies, the 3D anisotropic thermal\nconductivity of CVD diamond membrane is experimentally obtained by fitting the\nexperimental data to a thermal model.

In all models of early growth, there are\nseveral processes that can inhibit grains from reaching larger sizes.\nNevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must be rapid.\nIf a small number of 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc,\nthen gas drag effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids\nfrom beyond their gravitationally focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced\naccretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid rates, in principle. We\npresent self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle\nintegration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth\ndue to pebble accretion. Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of\nparticle sizes and disc conditions. We also explore analytic estimates of\nplanetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift due to the\naccretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we\nconsider, there is a clearly preferred particle size for accretion that depends\non the properties of the accreting planetesimal and the local disc conditions.\nFor solids much smaller than the preferred particle size, accretion rates are\nsignificantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow around\nthe planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates\nconsistent with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble\naccretion highlight the timescales that are needed for the growth of large\nobjects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

The MLMDP can perform never-before-seen tasks by\nrepresenting them as a linear combination of a previously learned basis set of\ntasks.

Given that the surface itself varies\nfrom protein to protein, and that each surface facing the water is\nheterogeneous, search for universal features has been elusive. Here, we perform\natomistic molecular dynamics simulation in order to propose and demonstrate\nthat such defining characteristics can emerge if we look not at average\nproperties but the distribution of relaxation times. We present results of\ncalculations of distributions of residence times and rotational relaxation\ntimes for four different protein-water systems, and compare them with the same\nquantities in the bulk. The distributions in the hydration layer is unusually\nbroad and log-normal in nature, due to the simultaneous presence of peptide\nbackbones that form weak hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic amino acid side chains\nthat form no hydrogen bond and charged polar groups that form strong hydrogen\nbond with the surrounding water molecules. The broad distribution is\nresponsible for the non-exponential dielectric response and also agrees with\nlarge specific heat of the hydration water. Our calculations reveal that while\nthe average time constant is just about 2-3 times larger than that of bulk\nwater, it provides a poor representation of the real behaviour.

Dust devils exhibit pressure\nperturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as\na discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several\nsurveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil\nstructures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such\nsurveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil\nproperties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with\nthe widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be\ndistorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such\nsurveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure\ntime series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series\ncannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical\nand geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of\nthe duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a\ndistribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the\nunderlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a\nscheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey\nusing data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil\noccurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our\nresults to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five\nlow-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 19:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

By studying the different\ncontributions to the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, we propose that\nthe physical origin of the enhanced piezoelectricity in Cr$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N\nalloys is the increase of the internal parameter $u$ of the wurtzite structure\nupon substitution of Al with the larger Cr ions.

As a result, in such a game, the reward function of each agent,\nat the time of stopping, depends directly on the controls of other players. The\nequilibrium problem leads naturally to a system of coupled control-stopping\nproblems (or, equivalently, Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential\nEquations (RBSDEs)), in which the individual reward functions (or, reflecting\nbarriers) depend on the value functions (or, solution components) of other\nagents. The resulting system, in general, presents multiple mathematical\nchallenges due to the non-standard form of coupling (or, reflection). In the\npresent case, this system is also complicated by the fact that the continuous\ncontrols of the agents, describing their posted bid and ask prices, are\nconstrained to take values in a discrete grid. The latter feature reflects the\npresence of a positive tick size in the market, and it creates additional\ndiscontinuities in the agents reward functions (or, reflecting barriers).\nHerein, we prove the existence of a solution to the associated system in a\nspecial Markovian framework, provide numerical examples, and discuss the\npotential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 20:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 03:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

This result supports that HL is not a suitable\nexplanation for the value of $\\beta$, which is instead significantly affected\nby finite dimensional effects. From considerations on elasto-plastic models and\non the limitation of speed at which avalanches of plasticity can propagate, we\nargue that $\\beta=1+1/(d-d_f)$ where $d_f$ is the fractal dimension of\navalanches and $d$ the spatial dimension. Measurements of $d_f$ then supports\nthat $\\beta\\approx 2.1$ and $\\beta\\approx 1.7$ in two and three dimensions\nrespectively. We discuss theoretical arguments leading to approximations of\n$\\beta$ in finite dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 21:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 02:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Interactive proofs are increasingly used as a\nframework to design protocols for computation outsourcing.\n  Existing interactive-proof games largely fall into two categories: either as\ngames of cooperation such as multi-prover interactive proofs and cooperative\nrational proofs, where the provers work together as a team; or as games of\nconflict such as refereed games, where the provers directly compete with each\nother in a zero-sum game. Neither of these extremes truly capture the strategic\nnature of service providers in outsourcing applications. How to design and\nanalyze non-cooperative interactive proofs is an important open problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce a mechanism-design approach to define a\nmulti-prover interactive-proof model in which the provers are rational and\nnon-cooperative---they act to maximize their expected utility given others'\nstrategies. We define a strong notion of backwards induction as our solution\nconcept to analyze the resulting extensive-form game with imperfect\ninformation.\n  Our protocols provide utility gap guarantees, which are analogous to\nsoundness gap in classic interactive proofs. At a high level, a utility gap of\nu means that the protocol is robust against provers that may not care about a\nutility loss of 1/u.\n  We fully characterize the complexity of our proof system under different\nutility gap guarantees.

However, existing non-asymptotic\nanalyses of first-order optimization algorithms typically employ a gradient\nsmoothness assumption that is too strong to be applicable in the case of deep\nneural networks. To address this, we propose an algorithm named duality\nstructure gradient descent (DSGD) that is amenable to non-asymptotic\nperformance analysis, under mild assumptions on the training set and network\narchitecture. The algorithm can be viewed as a form of layer-wise coordinate\ndescent, where at each iteration the algorithm chooses one layer of the network\nto update. The decision of what layer to update is done in a greedy fashion,\nbased on a rigorous lower bound on the improvement of the objective function\nfor each choice of layer. In the analysis, we bound the time required to reach\napproximate stationary points, in both the deterministic and stochastic\nsettings. The convergence is measured in terms of a parameter-dependent family\nof norms that is derived from the network architecture and designed to confirm\na smoothness-like property on the gradient of the training loss function.

Exploring neural activity behind synchronization and time locking\nin brain circuits is one of the most important tasks in neuroscience.

The target areas, the deep mesencephalic\nreticular-, pedunculopontine tegmental- and pontine reticular nuclei are\nrelated to the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Approach. The three targeted\nnuclei are collinear, therefore a single-shank MEA was designed in order to\ncontact them. The silicon-based device was equipped with 3*4 recording sites,\nlocated according to the geometry of the brain regions. Furthermore, a\nmicrodrive was developed to allow fine actuation and post-implantation\nrelocation of the probe. The probe was attached to a rigid printed circuit\nboard, which was fastened to the microdrive. A flexible cable was designed in\norder to provide not only electronic connection between the probe and the\namplifier system, but sufficient freedom for the movements of the probe as\nwell. Main results. The microdrive was stable enough to allow precise electrode\ntargeting into the tissue via a single track. The microelectrodes on the probe\nwere suitable for recording neural activity from the three targeted brainstem\nareas. Significance. The system offers a robust solution to provide long-term\ninterface between an array of precisely defined microelectrodes and deep-brain\nareas of a behaving rodent.

However,\nthis task is very challenging due to ambiguous cardiac borders and large\nanatomical variations among different subjects. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel densely-connected volumetric convolutional neural network, referred as\nDenseVoxNet, to automatically segment the cardiac and vascular structures from\n3D cardiac MR images. The DenseVoxNet adopts the 3D fully convolutional\narchitecture for effective volume-to-volume prediction. From the learning\nperspective, our DenseVoxNet has three compelling advantages. First, it\npreserves the maximum information flow between layers by a densely-connected\nmechanism and hence eases the network training. Second, it avoids learning\nredundant feature maps by encouraging feature reuse and hence requires fewer\nparameters to achieve high performance, which is essential for medical\napplications with limited training data. Third, we add auxiliary side paths to\nstrengthen the gradient propagation and stabilize the learning process. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DenseVoxNet by comparing it with the\nstate-of-the-art approaches from HVSMR 2016 challenge in conjunction with\nMICCAI, and our network achieves the best dice coefficient.

A grid\nsearch of launching sites of ejecta was defined over the globe of Didymoon, and\nconsidering a wide range of possible ejection speeds, we determined the\ndependency of ejecta fate on launching sites (projectile impact sites) and\nspeeds. This range allows us to track all the complex cases that include\ndifferent types of dynamical fates. Two major mechanisms are found to be\nworking broadly during the post-ejection evolution of the ejecta cloud: 1)\nejecta on mean motion resonance orbits with Didymoon produce long-term\nquasi-periodic showers onto Didymoon over at least a couple of weeks after the\nprojectile impact, 2) ejecta on non-resonant orbits produce a rapid and high\nre-accretion flux. This rapid and high flux occurs just once because ejecta on\nsuch orbits leave the system unless they experience a collision during their\nfirst encounter. For the second part of this study, we performed full-scale\nsimulations of the ejecta cloud released from 6 hypothetical impact sites. We\nconsidered two kinds of material composing Didymoon's subsurface and then\ncombined a power-law size distribution of the ejecta with an ejection speed\ndistribution. We find that the ejecta cloud evolution can be divided in two\nperiods. It starts with a first violent period (<10 hr) with fast re-accretion\nor ejection from the system. A second period is found to be more sensitive to\nthe launching site than the first one. During this second period, ejecta will\neither re-accrete or being ejected from the system, depending both on their\nsizes and on their average survival time in close proximity of the binary\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 03:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Unfortunately, this is not always in the best interest of the\nad platform. In this paper, we examine the following basic question in the\ncontext of second-price ad auctions: how should an ad platform optimally reveal\ninformation about the ad opportunity to the advertisers in order to maximize\nrevenue? We consider a model in which bidders' valuations depend on a random\nstate of the ad opportunity. Different from previous work, we focus on a more\npractical, and challenging, situation where the space of possible realizations\nof ad opportunities is extremely large. We thus focus on developing algorithms\nwhose running time is independent of the number of ad opportunity realizations.\n  We examine the auctioneer's algorithmic question of designing the optimal\nsignaling scheme. When the auctioneer is restricted to send a public signal to\nall bidders, we focus on a well-motivated Bayesian valuation setting in which\nthe auctioneer and bidders both have private information, and present two main\nresults: 1. we exhibit a characterization result regarding approximately\noptimal schemes and prove that any constant-approximate public signaling scheme\nmust use exponentially many signals; 2. we present a \"simple\" public signaling\nscheme that serves as a constant approximation under mild assumptions. We then\ninitiate an exploration on the power of being able to send different signals\nprivately to different bidders. Here we examine a basic setting where the\nauctioneer knows bidders' valuations, and exhibit a polynomial-time private\nscheme that extracts almost full surplus even in the worst Bayes Nash\nequilibrium. This illustrates the surprising power of private signaling schemes\nin extracting revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 06:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 05:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 00:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Here, based on the density-functional theory calculations, we\ndemonstrates that the donated electrons from K dopants are mostly localized at\nthe topmost BP layer and such a surface charging efficiently screens the K ion\npotential. It is found that, as the K doping increases, the extreme surface\ncharging and its screening of K atoms shift the conduction bands down in\nenergy, i.e., towards higher binding energy, because they have more charge near\nthe surface, while it has little influence on the valence bands having more\ncharge in the deeper layers.

One of the main theoretical\ncontribution of this article is to study stabilizer codes starting with a\ndifferent symplectic form.\n  In this paper, we concentrate on cyclic codes. Modifying the symplectic form\nallows us to generalize the previous known construction for linear cyclic\nstabilizer codes, and in the process, circumvent some of the Galois theoretic\nno-go results proved there. More importantly, this tweak in the symplectic form\nallows us to make use of well known error correcting algorithms for cyclic\ncodes to give efficient quantum error correcting algorithms. Cyclicity of error\ncorrecting codes is a \"basis dependent\" property. Our codes are no more\n\"cyclic\" when they are derived using the standard symplectic forms (if we\nignore the error correcting properties like distance, all such symplectic forms\ncan be converted to each other via a basis transformation). Hence this change\nof perspective is crucial from the point of view of designing efficient\ndecoding algorithm for these family of codes.

Even\nwith the external trigger by the particle detectors, the separation of the\nair-shower signal from the radio background was difficult in the noisy\nenvironment of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

In autumn 2016 Tunka-Rex\nhas been extended to a total of 63 stations, each equipped with SALLA antennas\nfor two polarization directions operating in the band of $30-80\\,$MHz. All\nantenna stations are triggered by the other cosmic-ray detectors at the site,\ni.e., Tunka-Rex runs in coincidence with the Tunka-Grande array of\nscintillation detectors and during clear nights additionally in coincidence\nwith the Tunka-133 non-imaging air-Cherenkov array. Compared to previous\nmeasurements, the day-time and bad-weather trigger increases the annual\nexposure by an order of magnitude, and the higher density of antennas is\nexpected to increase the accuracy - in particular for the cosmic-ray mass\ncomposition. In addition to the status and potential of Tunka-Rex an overview\nof recently published results will be presented: by comparing the radio and the\nair-Cherenkov signals of the same air showers, the Tunka-Rex precision for the\nmost important shower parameters has been determined. The direction precision\nis about $1^\\circ$, the precision for the depth of the shower maximum,\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$, is better than $40\\,$g/cm$^2$ for high-quality events, and\nthe energy precision is better than $15\\,\\%$. A rough estimation of the shower\nenergy and of $X_\\mathrm{max}$ is even possible with only a single antenna\nstation when using the shower geometry measured by Tunka-133. Moreover, by\nusing exactly the same external calibration source for the antennas as at the\nLOPES experiment we have shown that the absolute energy scale of different\nair-shower arrays can be compared with each other at $10\\,\\%$ precision. Thus,\nTunka-Rex will improve the total accuracy of TAIGA for the energy as well as\nfor the mass composition of cosmic rays of energy above $0.1\\,$EeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 07:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

However, it is often\nprohibitive to use typical neural networks on devices like mobile phones or\nsmart watches since the model sizes are huge and cannot fit in the limited\nmemory available on such devices. While these devices could make use of machine\nlearning models running on high-performance data centers with CPUs or GPUs,\nthis is not feasible for many applications because data can be privacy\nsensitive and inference needs to be performed directly \"on\" device.\n  We introduce a new architecture for training compact neural networks using a\njoint optimization framework. At its core lies a novel objective that jointly\ntrains using two different types of networks--a full trainer neural network\n(using existing architectures like Feed-forward NNs or LSTM RNNs) combined with\na simpler \"projection\" network that leverages random projections to transform\ninputs or intermediate representations into bits. The simpler network encodes\nlightweight and efficient-to-compute operations in bit space with a low memory\nfootprint. The two networks are trained jointly using backpropagation, where\nthe projection network learns from the full network similar to apprenticeship\nlearning. Once trained, the smaller network can be used directly for inference\nat low memory and computation cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new\napproach at significantly shrinking the memory requirements of different types\nof neural networks while preserving good accuracy on visual recognition and\ntext classification tasks. We also study the question \"how many neural bits are\nrequired to solve a given task?\" using the new framework and show empirical\nresults contrasting model predictive capacity (in bits) versus accuracy on\nseveral datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 07:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 10:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

The\nmean-field replicator equations are valid in the limit of large populations\nand, in the presence of mutation and unbalanced payoffs, they exhibit an\nattracting limit cycle. The period of this cycle depends on the rate of\nmutation; specifically, the period grows logarithmically as the mutation rate\ntends to zero. We find that this behaviour is not reproduced in stochastic\nsimulations with a fixed finite population size. Instead, demographic noise\npresent in the individual-based model dramatically slows down the progress of\nthe limit cycle, with the typical period growing as the reciprocal of the\nmutation rate. Here we develop a theory that explains these scaling regimes and\ndelineates them in terms of population size and mutation rate.

The\nproposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) -- reverses such\nprocedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or more unknown\nimpedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain, via spatial integration of the\nTWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned conditions on other\nboundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order spatial\ndiscretization of the TWEs on an unstructured staggered grid arrangement. Only\nthe momentum equation is extended to the center of each IB face where pressure\nand velocity components are co-located and treated as unknowns. The iHS is\nfinally closed via assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over\nthe IBs, corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the\nIB. The iHS procedure can be carried out independently for different\nfrequencies, making it embarrassingly parallel, and able to return the complete\nbroadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any desired frequency\nrange to arbitrary numerical precision. The iHS approach is first validated\nagainst Rott's theory for viscous rectangular and circular ducts.

However, these detectors often fail to generalize to videos because\nof the existing domain shift. Therefore, we investigate learning these\ndetectors directly from boring videos of daily activities. Instead of using\nbounding boxes, we explore the use of action descriptions as supervision since\nthey are relatively easy to gather. A common issue, however, is that objects of\ninterest that are not involved in human actions are often absent in global\naction descriptions known as \"missing label\". To tackle this problem, we\npropose a novel temporal dynamic graph Long Short-Term Memory network (TD-Graph\nLSTM). TD-Graph LSTM enables global temporal reasoning by constructing a\ndynamic graph that is based on temporal correlations of object proposals and\nspans the entire video. The missing label issue for each individual frame can\nthus be significantly alleviated by transferring knowledge across correlated\nobjects proposals in the whole video. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale\ndaily-life action dataset (i.e., Charades) demonstrates the superiority of our\nproposed method.

A limit theorem is introduced for minimal\nenergy configuration, where the rigid surface converges to a smooth one, but\nthe roughness parameter is kept constant. It turns out that the limit of\nminimal energy configurations correspond to liquid drop on a smooth surface\nwith an appropriately defined effective chemical interaction energy. It turns\nout that the effective chemical interaction depends linearly on the roughness\nin a certain range of parameters, corresponding to full wetting. Outside this\nrange the most stable configuration corresponds to a partial wetting and the\neffective interaction energy depends on the geometry in an essential way.\n  This result partially justifies and extends Wenzel and Cassie's laws and can\nbe used to deduce the actual inclination angle in the most stable state, where\nthe apparent one is known by measurement.

In the case of discrete Bayesian\nnetworks, MAP networks are selected by maximising one of several possible\nBayesian Dirichlet (BD) scores; the most famous is the Bayesian Dirichlet\nequivalent uniform (BDeu) score from Heckerman et al (1995). The key properties\nof BDeu arise from its uniform prior over the parameters of each local\ndistribution in the network, which makes structure learning computationally\nefficient; it does not require the elicitation of prior knowledge from experts;\nand it satisfies score equivalence.\n  In this paper we will review the derivation and the properties of BD scores,\nand of BDeu in particular, and we will link them to the corresponding entropy\nestimates to study them from an information theoretic perspective. To this end,\nwe will work in the context of the foundational work of Giffin and Caticha\n(2007), who showed that Bayesian inference can be framed as a particular case\nof the maximum relative entropy principle. We will use this connection to show\nthat BDeu should not be used for structure learning from sparse data, since it\nviolates the maximum relative entropy principle; and that it is also\nproblematic from a more classic Bayesian model selection perspective, because\nit produces Bayes factors that are sensitive to the value of its only\nhyperparameter. Using a large simulation study, we found in our previous work\n(Scutari, 2016) that the Bayesian Dirichlet sparse (BDs) score seems to provide\nbetter accuracy in structure learning; in this paper we further show that BDs\ndoes not suffer from the issues above, and we recommend to use it for sparse\ndata instead of BDeu. Finally, will show that these issues are in fact\ndifferent aspects of the same problem and a consequence of the distributional\nassumptions of the prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 10:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 21:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 22:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 09:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 11:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

Occam's razor suggests these two extremely rare properties\ncoincide in this system because they are causally related. The absence of the\nexpected chromospheric emission is attributable to absorption by a diffuse\ncircumstellar gas shroud which surrounds the entire planetary system and fills\nour line of sight to the chromospherically active regions of the star.

Leggett and Garg put forward a practical criterion capable\nof identifying violations of macrorealism, and so far experiments performed on\nmicroscopic and mesoscopic systems have always ruled out in favor of quantum\nmechanics. However, a macrorealist can always assign the cause of such\nviolations to the perturbation that measurements effect on such small systems,\nand hence a definitive test would require using non-invasive measurements,\npreferably on macroscopic objects, where such measurements seem more plausible.\nHowever, the generation of truly macroscopic quantum superposition states\ncapable of violating macrorealism remains a big challenge. In this work we\npropose a setup that makes use of measurements on the polarization of light, a\nproperty which has been extensively manipulated both in classical and quantum\ncontexts, hence establishing the perfect link between the microscopic and\nmacroscopic worlds. In particular, we use Leggett-Garg inequalities and the\ncriterion of no-signaling in time to study the macrorealistic character of\nlight polarization for different kinds of measurements, in particular with\ndifferent degrees of coarse-graining. Our proposal is non-invasive for coherent\ninput states by construction. We show for states with well defined photon\nnumber in two orthogonal polarization modes, that there always exists a way of\nmaking the measurement sufficiently coarse-grained so that a violation of\nmacrorealism becomes arbitrarily small, while sufficiently sharp measurements\ncan always lead to a significant violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 11:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Our aim is to explore whether masses derived from\nspectroscopy and isochrone fitting may have been systematically overestimated.\nOur targets have all previously been subject to long term radial velocity\nobservations to detect orbiting bodies, and satisfy the criteria used by\nJohnson et al. (2006) to select survey stars that may have had A-type (or early\nF-type) main-sequence progenitors. The sample actually spans a somewhat wider\nrange in mass, from $\\approx 1\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$ up to $\\approx 1.7\\,\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$. Whilst for five of the seven stars the reported discovery mass from\nspectroscopy exceeds the mass estimated using asteroseismology, there is no\nstrong evidence for a significant, systematic bias across the sample. Moreover,\ncomparisons with other masses from the literature show that the absolute scale\nof any differences is highly sensitive to the chosen reference literature mass,\nwith the scatter between different literature masses significantly larger than\nreported error bars. We find that any mass difference can be explained through\nuse of differing constraints during the recovery process. We also conclude that\nunderestimated uncertainties on the input parameters can significantly bias the\nrecovered stellar masses, which may have contributed to the controversy on the\nmass scale for retired A stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 12:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 14:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

For the low energy regime, we\ncompare our LFQM results of the transition form factors (TFFs) for the low\ntimelike momentum transfer region and the slope parameters at $q^2=0$ with the\nrecent experimental data from the Dalitz decays of $(\\pi^0,\\eta,\\eta')$.

It is defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance to the\ngraph distance between these vertices. It is often used as an average, for\ninstance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively to all the\nother vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. In some\ncases, one needs to process the Straightness between not only vertices, but\nalso any other points constituting the graph of interest. Suppose for instance\nthat our graph represents a road network and we do not want to limit ourselves\nto crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to be a\nstarting point or destination. In this situation, the standard approach\nconsists in: 1) discretizing the graph edges, 2) processing the\nvertex-to-vertex Straightness considering the additional vertices resulting\nfrom this discretization, and 3) performing the appropriate average on the\nobtained values. However, this discrete approximation can be computationally\nexpensive on large graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. In\nthis article, we adopt a continuous approach to average the Straightness over\nthe edges of spatial graphs. This allows us to derive 5 distinct measures able\nto characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as\nindividual vertices and edges. Our method is generic and could be applied to\nother measures designed for spatial graphs. We perform an experimental\nevaluation of our continuous average Straightness measures, and show how they\nbehave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. Moreover, we\nalso study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is\nglobally less demanding in terms of both processing time and memory usage.

The framework is based on uncharacterised (black-box) parties\nperforming quantum measurements on their share of a (possibly unphysical)\nquantum state, and its starting point is the characterisation of general\nno-signalling assemblages via non-positive local hidden-state models. By\ndeveloping a connection to entanglement witnesses, this formalism allows for\nnew definitions of families of assemblages, in particular via (i)\nnon-decomposable positive maps and (ii) unextendible product bases. The former\nproves to be useful for constructing post-quantum assemblages with the built-in\nfeature of yielding only quantum correlations in Bell experiments, while the\nlatter always gives certifiably post-quantum assemblages. Finally, our\nframework is equipped with an inherent quantifier of post-quantum steering,\nwhich we call the negativity of post-quantum steering. We postulate that\npost-quantum steering should not increase under one-way quantum operations from\nthe steered parties to the steering parties, and we show that, in this sense,\nthe negativity of post-quantum steering is a convex post-quantum-steering\nmonotone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Such planets are present in the Solar\nSystem (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed in short periods around\nother stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations,\ntheoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue\nthat such low mass envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five\nEarth masses. Instead, under nominal disc conditions, these planets would\nacquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion within the lifetime of\nthe protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are not\nin hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of\n3-dimensional, global, radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady\nstate gas flow, which enters through the poles and exits in the disc midplane.\nGas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital timescales. In\nregions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope\naccretion onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow\nenters the deep interior. Accreted solids sublimate deep in the convective\ninterior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped in the flow and do not\nsettle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to\nrunaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than\ntypical Super-Earths, beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc\nopacities are below kappa=1 cm^2/g. These findings offer an explanation for the\ntypical low-mass envelopes around the cores of Super-Earths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

To this end,\nwe first generalize existing results for finite-dimensional linear regression\nwith fixed regularization and known variance to the kernel setup with a\nregularization parameter allowed to be a measurable function of past\nobservations. Then, using appropriate self-normalized inequalities we build\nupper and lower bound estimates for the variance, leading to Bersntein-like\nconcentration bounds.

This method further allows us to avoid prohibitive\nnumerical computations normally required in order to accurately quantify the\neffect of time-domain windowing on the nonlinear Fourier spectrum of the\nmulti-solitonic signals. The method devised in this work also applies to\ngeneral type of signals and may prove to be a useful tool in the theoretical\nanalysis of such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 06:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 19:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

This paper investigates how well the profile\narithmetic mean average roughness, $R_a$, approximates its areal equivalent\n$S_a$. Simulated rough surfaces and samples from the ETOPO1 global relief model\nwere used. The mean of up to 20 $R_a$ profiles from the surface were compared\nwith surface $S_a$ for 100 repeats. Differences between $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$\nfell as the number of $R_a$ values averaged increased. For simulated surfaces\nmean % difference between $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$ was in the range 16.06% to\n3.47% when only one $R_a$ profile was taken. By averaging 20 $R_a$ values mean\n% difference fell to 6.60% to 0.81%. By not considering $R_a$ profiles parallel\nto the main feature direction (identified visually), mean % difference was\nfurther reduced. For ETOPO1 global relief surfaces mean % difference was in the\nrange 52.09% to 22.60% when only one $R_a$ value was used, and was 33.22% to\n9.90% when 20 $R_a$ values were averaged.

However, for some complex real world surfaces discrepancy\nbetween $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$ are high.

Albeit the recent great progress\nthanks to the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the state-of-the-art\nmonocular depth estimation methods still fall short to handle such real-world\nchallenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deep end-to-end learning\nframework to tackle these challenges, which learns the direct mapping from a\ncolor image to the corresponding depth map. First, we represent monocular depth\nestimation as a multi-category dense labeling task by contrast to the\nregression based formulation. In this way, we could build upon the recent\nprogress in dense labeling such as semantic segmentation. Second, we fuse\ndifferent side-outputs from our front-end dilated convolutional neural network\nin a hierarchical way to exploit the multi-scale depth cues for depth\nestimation, which is critical to achieve scale-aware depth estimation. Third,\nwe propose to utilize soft-weighted-sum inference instead of the hard-max\ninference, transforming the discretized depth score to continuous depth value.\nThus, we reduce the influence of quantization error and improve the robustness\nof our method. Extensive experiments on the NYU Depth V2 and KITTI datasets\nshow the superiority of our method compared with current state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, experiments on the NYU V2 dataset reveal that our model\nis able to learn the probability distribution of depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 06:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}
