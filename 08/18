The same initial planet\nas a result of the same total accreted planetesimal mass can have up to ~5%\ndifference in mean densities several Gyr after the last accretion due to\ninherent stochasticity of the accretion process. During the phase of rapid\naccretion these differences are more dramatic. The additional energy deposition\nfrom the accreted planetesimals increase the ratio between the planet's radius\nto that of the core during rapid accretion, which in turn leads to enhanced\nloss of atmospheric mass. As a result, the same initial planet can end up with\nvery different envelope mass fractions. These differences manifest as\ndifferences in mean densities long after accretion stops. These effects are\nparticularly important for planets initially less massive than ~10 MEarth and\nwith envelope mass fraction less than ~10%, thought to be the most common type\nof planets discovered by Kepler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 17:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 05:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

They seem to belong to a class of events for\nwhich the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion\nis still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of\nSN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in\nthe range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,\nand half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN\n2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3\nMsun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium.

The question at hand is\nwhether some large-time corrections are captured by higher-order hydrodynamics.\nWe consider in particular the dynamics after that two chains, prepared in\ndifferent conditions, are joined together. In these situations a light cone,\nseparating regions with macroscopically different properties, emerges from the\njunction. In free fermionic systems some observables close to the light cone\nfollow a universal behavior, known as Tracy-Widom scaling.

Supernova ejecta drive a blast wave through any CSM from the progenitor\nsystem; as material is swept up, a reverse shock forms in the ejecta, reheating\nthem. This ejecta-driven phase lasts until ten or more times the ejected mass\nis swept up, and the remnant approaches the Sedov or self-similar evolutionary\nphase. The evolution up to this time is approximately adiabatic. Eventually, as\nthe blast wave slows, the remnant age approaches the cooling time for immediate\npost-shock gas, and the shock becomes radiative and highly compressive.\nEventually the shock speed drops below the local ISM sound speed and the\nremnant dissipates. I then review the various processes by which remnants\nradiate. At early times, during the adiabatic phases, thermal X-rays and\nnonthermal radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission dominate, while optical\nemission is faint and confined to a few strong lines of hydrogen and perhaps\nhelium. Once the shock is radiative, prominent optical and infrared emission is\nproduced. Young remnants are profoundly affected by interaction with often\nanisotropic CSM, while even mature remnants can still show evidence of ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

In this scenario, planets grow by accreting\ncm-to-m-sized pebbles instead of km-sized planetesimals. One of the main\ndifferences with planetesimal-driven core accretion is the increased thermal\nablation experienced by pebbles. This provides early enrichment to the planet's\nenvelope, which changes the process of core growth.\n  Aims: We aim to predict core masses and envelope compositions of planets that\nform by pebble accretion and compare mass deposition of pebbles to\nplanetesimals.\n  Methods: We model the early growth of a proto-planet by calculating the\nstructure of its envelope, taking into account the fate of impacting pebbles or\nplanetesimals. The region where high-Z material can exist in vapor form is\ndetermined by the vapor pressure. We include enrichment effects by locally\nmodifying the mean molecular weight.\n  Results: In the pebble case, three phases of core growth can be identified.\nIn the first phase, pebbles impact the core without significant ablation.\nDuring the second phase, ablation becomes increasingly severe. A layer of\nhigh-Z vapor starts to form around the core that absorbs a small fraction of\nthe ablated mass. The rest either rains out to the core or mixes outwards\ninstead, slowing core growth. In the third phase, the vapor inner region\nexpands outwards, absorbing an increasing fraction of the ablated material as\nvapor. Rainout ends before the core mass reaches 0.6 M_Earth, terminating\ndirect core growth. In the case of icy H2O pebbles, this happens before 0.1\nM_Earth.\n  Conclusions: Our results indicate that pebble accretion can directly form\nrocky cores up to only 0.6 M_Earth, and is unable to form similarly sized icy\ncores. Subsequent core growth can proceed indirectly when the planet cools,\nprovided it is able to retain its high-Z material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 21:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 12:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 19:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

Such radial focusing underlies other axial\nchanneling phenomena in thin crystals including planar channeling of small\nimpact parameter trajectories, peaks around the azimuthal distribution at small\ntilts and large shoulders in the nuclear encounter probability at tilts beyond\npsi(a).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 19:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Due to the complexity of the governing\nequations, approximate models are often necessary to describe wave dynamics. In\nthis dissertation, waves are treated as geometric objects of a variational\ntheory rather than formal solutions of specific PDEs. This approach simplifies\ncalculations, highlights the underlying wave symmetries, and leads to improved\nmodeling of wave dynamics. This thesis presents two breakthroughs that were\nobtained in the general theory of waves. The first main contribution is an\nextension and reformulation of geometrical optics (GO) as a first-principle\nLagrangian theory that correctly describes polarization effects, such as\npolarization precession and the polarization-driven bending of ray\ntrajectories, which appear as leading-order corrections to GO. The theory was\napplied to several systems of interest, such as relativistic spin-1/2 particles\nand radio-frequency waves in magnetized plasma. The second main contribution of\nthis thesis is the development of a phase-space method to study basic\nproperties of nonlinear wave--wave interactions. Specifically, I show that\nwaves propagating in modulated media, both classical and quantum, can\nexperience time-averaged refraction caused by effective ponderomotive forces on\nwave rays. This phenomenon is analogous to the ponderomotive effect encountered\nby charged particles in high-frequency electromagnetic fields. I also show that\nphase-space methods can be useful to study problems in the field of wave\nturbulence, such as the nonlinear interaction of high-frequency waves with\nlarge-scale structures. Overall, the results obtained can serve as a basis for\nfuture studies on more complex nonlinear wave--wave interactions, such as\nmodulational instabilities in general wave ensembles or wave turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 20:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

Doing so necessitates effectively utilizing available network\nbandwidth and resources, yet in practice transfers seldom reach the levels of\nutilization they potentially could. Tuning protocol parameters such as\npipelining, parallelism, and concurrency can significantly increase utilization\nand performance, however determining the best settings for these parameters is\na difficult problem, as network conditions can vary greatly between sites and\nover time. Nevertheless, it is an important problem, since poor tuning can\ncause either under- or over-utilization of network resources and thus degrade\ntransfer performance. In this paper, we present three algorithms for\napplication-level tuning of different protocol parameters for maximizing\ntransfer throughput in wide-area networks. Our algorithms dynamically tune the\nnumber of parallel data streams per file (for large file optimization), the\nlevel of control channel pipelining (for small file optimization), and the\nnumber of concurrent file transfers to increase I/O throughput (a technique\nuseful for all types of files). The proposed heuristic algorithms improve the\ntransfer throughput up to 10x compared to the baseline and 7x compared to the\nstate of the art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 20:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

On tuning the coupling between the QPC and the electronic\ncavity, fine oscillations are observed when the arch QPC is operated in the\nquasi-1D regime. These oscillations correspond to interference between the 1D\nstates and a state which is similar to the Fabry-Perot state and suppressed by\na small transverse magnetic field of 60mT. Tuning the reflector, we find a peak\nin resistance which follows the behavior expected for a Fano resonance.

Remarkably, the Fano factor shows\nan oscillatory behavior taking peaks for each fine oscillation, thus,\nconfirming coupling between the discrete and continuum states.

The state-of-the-art decision-making methods in mHealth\ngenerally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the Gaussian\ndistribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate\nthe expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with\nthe issue of outliers, we propose a novel robust actor-critic contextual bandit\nmethod for the mHealth intervention. In the critic updating, the\ncapped-$\\ell_{2}$ norm is used to measure the approximation error, which\nprevents outliers from dominating our objective. A set of weights could be\nachieved from the critic updating. Considering them gives a weighted objective\nfor the actor updating. It provides the badly noised sample in the critic\nupdating with zero weights for the actor updating. As a result, the robustness\nof both actor-critic updating is enhanced.

With probability one with respect to the choice of points $\\{x_i\\}_{i\n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$, we show that as $n \\to \\infty$ the discrete Dirichlet\nenergies for functions $G_n \\to \\Sigma_k$ $\\Gamma$-converge to (a scalar\nmultiple of) the continuum Dirichlet energy for functions $U \\to \\Sigma_k$ with\nrespect to a metric coming from the theory of optimal transport. This, along\nwith a compactness property for the aforementioned energies that we prove,\nimplies the convergence of minimizers. When $\\nu$ is the uniform distribution,\nour results also imply the statistical consistency statement that Dirichlet\npartitions of geometric graphs converge to partitions of the sampled space in\nthe Hausdorff sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 00:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

Most existing CNN models for\nimage denoising have many layers. In such cases, the models involve a large\namount of parameters and are computationally expensive to train. In this paper,\nwe develop a dilated residual CNN for Gaussian image denoising. Compared with\nthe recently proposed residual denoiser, our method can achieve comparable\nperformance with less computational cost. Specifically, we enlarge receptive\nfield by adopting dilated convolution in residual network, and the dilation\nfactor is set to a certain value. We utilize appropriate zero padding to make\nthe dimension of the output the same as the input. It has been proven that the\nexpansion of receptive field can boost the CNN performance in image\nclassification, and we further demonstrate that it can also lead to competitive\nperformance for denoising problem. Moreover, we present a formula to calculate\nreceptive field size when dilated convolution is incorporated. Thus, the change\nof receptive field can be interpreted mathematically. To validate the efficacy\nof our approach, we conduct extensive experiments for both gray and color image\ndenoising with specific or randomized noise levels.

For the Kaspi problem, we first present the properties of optimal test\nchannels.

Finally,\nfor discrete memoryless sources, we derive refined asymptotics which includes\nthe second-order, large and moderate deviations asymptotics.

The\nmajor challenge lies in how to preserve similarity of the same person across\nvideo footages with large appearance variations, while discriminating different\nindividuals. To address this problem, conventional methods usually consider the\npairwise similarity between persons by only measuring the point to point (P2P)\ndistance. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning technique to model a\nnovel set to set (S2S) distance, in which the underline objective focuses on\npreserving the compactness of intra-class samples for each camera view, while\nmaximizing the margin between the intra-class set and inter-class set. The S2S\ndistance metric is consisted of three terms, namely the class-identity term,\nthe relative distance term and the regularization term. The class-identity term\nkeeps the intra-class samples within each camera view gathering together, the\nrelative distance term maximizes the distance between the intra-class class set\nand inter-class set across different camera views, and the regularization term\nsmoothness the parameters of deep convolutional neural network (CNN). As a\nresult, the final learned deep model can effectively find out the matched\ntarget to the probe object among various candidates in the video gallery by\nlearning discriminative and stable feature representations. Using the CUHK01,\nCUHK03, PRID2011 and Market1501 benchmark datasets, we extensively conducted\ncomparative evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of our method over the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 05:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

We analyzed both optical\nand radar astrometry for 600 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of\ndetecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect.

To estimate the corners, we formulate a full-scale model of the\nchessboard and fit it to the segmented 3D points of the chessboard. The model\nis fitted by optimizing the cost function under constraints of correlation\nbetween the reflectance intensity of laser and the color of the chessboard's\npatterns. Powell's method is introduced for resolving the discontinuity problem\nin optimization. The corners of the fitted model are considered as the 3D\ncorners of the chessboard. Once the corners of the chessboard in the 3D point\ncloud are estimated, the extrinsic calibration of the two sensors is converted\nto a 3D-2D matching problem. The corresponding 3D-2D points are used to\ncalculate the absolute pose of the two sensors with Unified Perspective-n-Point\n(UPnP). Further, the calculated parameters are regarded as initial values and\nare refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The performance of the\nproposed corner detection method from the 3D point cloud is evaluated using\nsimulations.

Keyword spotting, an\nalternative way to retrieve information, performs efficient text searching in\nsuch scenarios. However, current word spotting techniques in scene/video images\nare script-specific and they are mainly developed for Latin script. This paper\npresents a novel word spotting framework using dynamic shape coding for text\nretrieval in natural scene image and video frames. The framework is designed to\nsearch query keyword from multiple scripts with the help of on-the-fly\nscript-wise keyword generation for the corresponding script. We have used a\ntwo-stage word spotting approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect the\ntranslated keyword in a given text line by identifying the script of the line.\nA novel unsupervised dynamic shape coding based scheme has been used to group\nsimilar shape characters to avoid confusion and to improve text alignment.\nNext, the hypotheses locations are verified to improve retrieval performance.\nTo evaluate the proposed system for searching keyword from natural scene image\nand video frames, we have considered two popular Indic scripts such as Bangla\n(Bengali) and Devanagari along with English. Inspired by the zone-wise\nrecognition approach in Indic scripts[1], zone-wise text information has been\nused to improve the traditional word spotting performance in Indic scripts.

However, this fundamental assumption needs to be\ntested with observations of high-z SNe Ia. To date, the majority of SNe Ia\nobserved at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.0) are faint, and the\nresultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios\nthat impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases\nhowever, the Universe offers a helping hand: to date a few SNe Ia have been\nobserved that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper we present\nlong-slit spectroscopy of the lensed SNe Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a\nredshift of z=0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ~55 by a galaxy located\nat z=0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple weeks to a\ncouple months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of\nwell-observed, nearby SNe Ia, finding that SN 2016geu's properties are\ncommensurate with those of SNe Ia in the local universe. Based primarily on the\nvelocity and strength of the Si II 6355 absorption feature, we find that SN\n2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity gradient and\n\"core-normal\" SN Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their\npseudo-equivalent widths) argue against SN 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined,\ncool or shallow-silicon SN Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of\nSN 2016geu imply that it is a normal SN Ia, and when taking previous results by\nother authors into consideration, there is very little, if any, evolution in\nthe observational properties of SNe Ia up to z~0.4.

For this\nreason, we propose and investigate two state space models for moving object\ntracking: (i) a direct product SE(2)xR3 and (ii) a direct product of the two\nrigid body motion groups SE(2)xSE(2). The first term within these two state\nspace constructions describes the current pose of the rigid body, while the\nsecond one employs its second order dynamics, i.e., the velocities.

It thus promises to play an important role in exoplanet\nscience in the future. However, such precision can only be acquired from space,\nand requires dedicated instrumentation for a sufficient astrometric\ncalibration. Here we present a series of concepts designed for handling this\ntask. STARE is a small satellite concept dedicated to finding planets in the\nvery nearest stellar systems, which offers a low-cost option toward the study\nof habitable planets. The NEAT concept is a set of two formation-flying\nsatellites with the aim to survey the 200 nearest Sun-like stars for Earths in\nthe habitable zone. Finally, THEIA is a proposal for an ESA M-class mission,\nwith a single-unit telescope designed for both dark matter studies as well as a\nsurvey for habitable Earth-like planets among the 50 nearest stars. The\nconcepts illustrate various possible paths and strategies for achieving\nexquisite astrometric performance, and thereby addressing key scientific\nquestions regarding the distribution of habitability and life in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 10:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The electronic\nstructure of SWCNTs is computed for each deformed configuration by means of\nreal space, Order(N) Tight Binding Molecular Dynamic (O(N) TBMD) simulations.\nEnergy band gap is obtained in real space through the behavior of electronic\ndensity of states (eDOS) near the Fermi level. Vacancies can effectively change\nthe energetics and hence the electronic structure of SWCNTs.

Their energy band gap values decrease to 0.07 eV\nand 0.09 eV when mono-vacancy defects are induced in their horizontal\ndirections. Then the di-vacancy defects open the band gap again. So in both\ncases, the semiconducting-metallic - semiconducting transitions occur. It is\nalso shown that the band gap modification exhibits irreversible\ncharacteristics, which means that band gap values of the nanotubes do not reach\ntheir pristine values with increasing number of vacancies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 11:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-21"}

The modularity function $Q$ is an established\nmeasure quantifying the quality of a community, being identified as a set of\nnodes having high modularity. In our terminology, a set of nodes with positive\nmodularity is called a \\textit{module} and a set that maximizes $Q$ is thus\ncalled \\textit{leading module}. Finding a leading module in a network is an\nimportant task, however the dimension of real-world problems makes the\nmaximization of $Q$ unfeasible. This poses the need of approximation techniques\nwhich are typically based on a linear relaxation of $Q$, induced by the\nspectrum of the modularity matrix $M$. In this work we propose a nonlinear\nrelaxation which is instead based on the spectrum of a nonlinear modularity\noperator $\\mathcal M$. We show that extremal eigenvalues of $\\mathcal M$\nprovide an exact relaxation of the modularity measure $Q$, however at the price\nof being more challenging to be computed than those of $M$.

The resulted field\nequations decouple asymptotically for slowly varying short waves to a set of\nthree PDEs of different orders of magnitude. A second-order WKB method provides\ntransport equations for the wave amplitudes. The influence of background\ncurvature already appears in the first-order amplitudes, which gives rise to\ndiffraction. We have shown that the transport equation of these amplitudes\nprovides numerical solutions for the frequency-alteration. The energy\ndissipating process is responsible for decreasing frequency. The decrease is\nsignificantly smaller than the magnitude of the original frequency and exhibits\na power-law relationship between original and decreased frequencies. The\nfrequency deviation was examined particularly for the transient signal\nGW150914. Considering AGNs as larger background structures and high-frequency\nsignals emitted by BNS mergers, the frequency-deviation grows large enough to\nbe relevant in future GW-observations with increased sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 12:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

We\ndemonstrate that such supportive clues not only significantly enhances\nperformance of salient object detection but also gives better justified\ndetection results. More specifically, we develop a multi-stage saliency encoder\nto extract multi-scale features which contain both low- and high-level saliency\ncontext. Dense short- and long-range connections are introduced to reuse these\nfeatures iteratively. Benefiting from the direct access to low- and high-level\nfeatures, the proposed saliency encoder can not only model the object context\nbut also preserve the boundary. Furthermore, a self-explanatory generator is\nproposed to interpret how the proposed saliency encoder or other deep saliency\nmodels making decisions. The generator simulates the absence of interesting\nfeatures by preventing these features from contributing to the saliency\nclassifier and estimates the corresponding saliency prediction without these\nfeatures. A comparison function, saliency explanation, is defined to measure\nthe prediction changes between deep saliency models and corresponding\ngenerator. Through visualizing the differences, we can interpret the capability\nof different deep neural networks based saliency detection models and\ndemonstrate that our proposed model indeed uses more reasonable structure for\nsalient object detection.

In the\nsecond step, the growth parameters are chosen to optimize the NW shape,\nallowing NWs with a thin diameter (45 nm) and an untapered morphology to be\nrealized. This result is in contrast to the commonly observed thick, inversely\ntapered shape of SAG NWs. We quantify the flux dependence of radial\nvapour-solid (VS) growth and build a model that takes into account diffusion on\nthe NW sidewalls to explain the observed VS growth rates. Combining this model\nfor the radial VS growth with an existing model for the droplet dynamics at the\nNW top, we achieve full understanding of the diameter of NWs over their entire\nlength and the evolution of the diameter and tapering during growth. We\nconclude that only the combination of droplet dynamics and VS growth results in\nan untapered morphology. This result enables NW shape engineering and has\nimportant implications for doping of NWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 13:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Two primary issues to be addressed in transfer\nlearning are what and how to transfer. For a pair of domains, adopting\ndifferent transfer learning algorithms results in different knowledge\ntransferred between them. To discover the optimal transfer learning algorithm\nthat maximally improves the learning performance in the target domain,\nresearchers have to exhaustively explore all existing transfer learning\nalgorithms, which is computationally intractable. As a trade-off, a sub-optimal\nalgorithm is selected, which requires considerable expertise in an ad-hoc way.\nMeanwhile, it is widely accepted in educational psychology that human beings\nimprove transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer through\nmeta-cognitive reflection on inductive transfer learning practices. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel transfer learning framework known as Learning to\nTransfer (L2T) to automatically determine what and how to transfer are the best\nby leveraging previous transfer learning experiences. We establish the L2T\nframework in two stages: 1) we first learn a reflection function encrypting\ntransfer learning skills from experiences; and 2) we infer what and how to\ntransfer for a newly arrived pair of domains by optimizing the reflection\nfunction.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers are\nregarded as the ideal platform to study quantum sciences as a result of its\nlong coherence time up to a millisecond timescale. In high-purity diamond,\nhyperfine interaction with 13C nuclear spins dominates the decoherence process.\nIn this paper, we numerically simulate the decoherence process between 0 and +1\nof the individual NV color center spin in 13C nuclear baths with various of\nmagnitudes of external magnetic fields. By applying Hahn echo into the system,\nwe obtain the coherence of NV color center spin as a function of total\nevolution time and magnetic field. Furthermore we obtain the high-accuracy\nrelationship between the three decoherence-characteristic timescales, i.e. T_W,\nT_R, T_2, and magnetic field B. And we draw a conclusion that T_R has the\nhighest sensitivity about magnetic field among the three time-scales. Thus, for\na certain NV color center, T_R can be the scale for the magnitude of magnetic\nfield, or rather, the component along the NV electronic spin axis. When\nmeasuring an unknown magnetic field, we adjust the NV axis to three mutually\northogonal directions respectively. By this means, we obtain the three\ncomponents of the magnetic field and thus the magnitude and direction of the\nactual magnetic field. The accuracy could reach 60 nT/Hz^{1/2},and could be\ngreatly improved by using an ensemble of NV color centers or diamond crystals\npurified with 12C atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The results show that a distinct main vortex ring is formed following\nthe shape of nozzle exit at initial formation time. However entrainment from\nthe surrounding ambient fluid through the trough locations creates pairs of\nstreamwise structure after the piston stops.

The estimation of\nphotometric redshifts (photo-zs) has been consolidated as the standard strategy\nto bypass the high production costs and incompleteness of spectroscopic\nredshift samples. Training-based photo-z methods require the preparation of a\nhigh-quality list of spectroscopic redshifts, which needs to be constantly\nupdated. The photo-z training, validation, and estimation must be performed in\na consistent and reproducible way in order to accomplish the scientific\nrequirements. To meet this purpose, we developed an integrated web-based data\ninterface that not only provides the framework to carry out the above steps in\na systematic way, enabling the ease testing and comparison of different\nalgorithms, but also addresses the processing requirements by parallelizing the\ncalculation in a transparent way for the user. This framework called the\nScience Portal (hereafter Portal) was developed in the context the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) to facilitate scientific analysis.

Unlike single-objective MAB problems in which the learner\nobtains a random scalar reward for each arm it selects, in the proposed\nproblem, the learner obtains a random reward vector, where each component of\nthe reward vector corresponds to one of the objectives and the distribution of\nthe reward depends on the context that is provided to the learner at the\nbeginning of each round. We call this problem contextual multi-armed bandit\nwith a dominant objective (CMAB-DO). In CMAB-DO, the goal of the learner is to\nmaximize its total reward in the non-dominant objective while ensuring that it\nmaximizes its total reward in the dominant objective. In this case, the optimal\narm given a context is the one that maximizes the expected reward in the\nnon-dominant objective among all arms that maximize the expected reward in the\ndominant objective. First, we show that the optimal arm lies in the Pareto\nfront. Then, we propose the multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit\nalgorithm (MOC-MAB), and define two performance measures: the 2-dimensional\n(2D) regret and the Pareto regret. We show that both the 2D regret and the\nPareto regret of MOC-MAB are sublinear in the number of rounds.

This topologically-based piecewise\nregression algorithm has shown promise in its initial applications, but the\ncurrent implementation in the literature has been limited to elastic net and\ngeneralized linear regression. It is possible that nonparametric methods, such\nas random forest or conditional inference trees, may provide better prediction\nand insight through modeling interaction terms and other nonlinear\nrelationships between predictors and a given outcome.\n  This study explores the use of several machine learning algorithms within a\nMorse-Smale piecewise regression framework, including boosted regression with\nlinear baselearners, homotopy-based LASSO, conditional inference trees, random\nforest, and a wide neural network framework called extreme learning machines.\nSimulations on Tweedie regression problems with varying Tweedie parameter and\ndispersion suggest that many machine learning approaches to Morse-Smale\npiecewise regression improve the original algorithm's performance, particularly\nfor outcomes with lower dispersion and linear or a mix of linear and nonlinear\npredictor relationships.

As important properties, the EVaR is strongly monotone over its domain\nand strictly monotone over a broad sub-domain including all continuous\ndistributions, while well-known monotone risk measures, such as VaR and CVaR\nlack these properties. A key feature for a risk measure, besides its financial\nproperties, is its applicability in large-scale sample-based portfolio\noptimization. If the negative return of an investment portfolio is a\ndifferentiable convex function, the portfolio optimization with the EVaR\nresults in a differentiable convex program whose number of variables and\nconstraints is independent of the sample size, which is not the case for the\nVaR and CVaR.

This comparison shows that the EVaR approach generally\nperforms similarly, and it outperforms as the sample size increases.

However, mixture filtering faces the issue of a constantly\ngrowing number of components, hence require appropriate mixture reduction\ntechniques. In this letter we propose a mixture reduction approach for\ndistributions on matrix Lie groups, called the concentrated Gaussian\ndistributions (CGDs). This entails appropriate reparametrization of CGD\nparameters to compute the KL divergence, pick and merge the mixture components.\nFurthermore, we also introduce a multitarget tracking filter on Lie groups as a\nmixture filtering study example for the proposed reduction method. In\nparticular, we implemented the probability hypothesis density filter on matrix\nLie groups. We validate the filter performance using the optimal subpattern\nassignment metric on a synthetic dataset consisting of 100 randomly generated\nmultitarget scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

This proposition is\nquite natural and understandable, however the idea of phonon spin seems\nambiguous in the literature. In 1988 McLellan presented phonon angular momentum\nstates for circular and elliptical polarizations of phonons that represent\norbital angular momentum and also pointed out analogy to isotropic quantum\nharmonic oscillator. In view of its fundamental importance we investigate this\nissue and conclude that phonon spin hypothesis is physically untenable, and the\nphonon angular momentum has to be interpreted as orbital. The photon-phonon\nanalogy is also misleading. It is argued that Cosserat elastic medium having\ninternal torque may have lattice excitations different from phonons having spin\none or spin two that we term as Cosseratons. In addition a new source of\nangular momentum balance originationg from anomalous electron magnetic moment\nis suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 08:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 10:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

However, hardware\nimplementations of ANNs using conventional binary arithmetic units are\ncomputationally expensive, energy-intensive and have large area overheads.\nStochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm which replaces these\nconventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for\nfault-tolerant applications. Spintronic devices, such as Magnetic Tunnel\nJunctions (MTJs), are capable of replacing CMOS in memory and logic circuits.\nIn this work, we propose an energy-efficient use of MTJs, which exhibit\nprobabilistic switching behavior, as Stochastic Number Generators (SNGs), which\nforms the basis of our NN implementation in the SC domain. Further, error\nresilient target applications of NNs allow us to introduce Approximate\nComputing, a framework wherein accuracy of computations is traded-off for\nsubstantial reductions in power consumption. We propose approximating the\nsynaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by\nproperties of our MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. We design an algorithm\nthat can perform such approximations within a given error tolerance in a\nsingle-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem\nformulation. We then use this algorithm and develop a heuristic approach for\napproximating multi-layer NNs. To give a perspective of the effectiveness of\nour approach, a 43% reduction in power consumption was obtained with less than\n1% accuracy loss on a standard classification problem, with 26% being brought\nabout by the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 19:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}
