A\ndifficult issue that is connected with this type of approach is the\ndetermination of a suitable coupling mechanism between the fluid velocity at\nthe boundary and the displacement of the boundary mesh nodes. In order to avoid\nlarge mesh distortions, one goal is to keep the nodal movements as small as\npossible; but of course still compliant with the no-penetration boundary\ncondition. Standard displacement techniques are full velocity, velocity in a\nspecific coordinate direction, and velocity in normal direction.

In similarity with systems which are far from equilibrium but near\nthe onset of jamming [O'Hern et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 165702 (2004)],\nwe find that the relaxation is characterized by two time-scales: the decay of\nlong-wavelength (slow) fluctuations of potential energy is controlled by the\nthe slope $[\\partial (G/N)/\\partial \\phi]$ of the Gibbs free energy ($G$) at a\nunique value of per particle potential energy $\\phi = \\phi_{mid}$. The\nshort-wavelength (fast) fluctuations are controlled by the bath temperature\n$T$. The relaxation of the supercooled liquid is initiated with a dynamical\ncrossover after which the potential energy fluctuations are biased towards\nvalues progressively lesser than $\\phi_{mid}$. The dynamical crossover leads to\nthe change of time-scale, i.e., the decay of long-wavelength potential energy\nfluctuations (intermediate relaxation). Because of the condition [$\\partial^2\n(G/N)/\\partial \\phi^2 = 0$] at $\\phi = \\phi_{mid}$, the slope $[\\partial\n(G/N)/\\partial \\phi]$ has a unique value and governs the intermediate stage of\nrelaxation, which ends just after the crossover. In the subsequent stage, there\nis a relatively rapid crystallization due to lack of long-wavelength\nfluctuations and the instability at $\\phi_{mid}$, i.e., the condition that $G$\ndecreases as configurations with potential energies lower than $\\phi_{mid}$ are\naccessed. The dynamical crossover point and the associated change in the\ntime-scale of fluctuations is found to be consistent with the previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Our goal is to identify a class of quantum\ncritical points between topologically nontrivial phases with fractionally\nquantized Hall (FQH) conductivity and topologically trivial gapped phases\nthrough the discontinuities of the many-body Berry curvature in the so-called\nflux Brillouin zone (fBZ), the latter being defined by imposing all possible\ntwisted boundary conditions. For this purpose, we study the finite-size\nsignatures of several quantum phase transitions between fractional Chern\ninsulators and charge-ordered phases for two-dimensional lattices by evaluating\nthe many-body Berry curvature numerically using exact diagonalization. We\nobserve degeneracy points (nodes) of many-body energy levels at high-symmetry\npoints in the fBZ, accompanied by diverging Berry curvature. We find a\ncorrespondence between the number and order of these nodal points, and the\nchange of the topological invariants of the many-body ground states across the\ntransition, in close analogy with Weyl nodes in non-interacting band\nstructures. This motivates us to apply a scaling procedure, originally\ndeveloped for non-interacting systems, for the Berry curvature at the nodal\npoints. This procedure offers a useful tool for the classification of\ntopological phase transitions in interacting systems harboring FQH-like\ntopological order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 16:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

When the graph is a regular tree, we show that there is a unique\nGibbs measure associated to each activity parameter $\\lambda>0$. Our result\nshows that, in contrast to the standard discrete hardcore model, the continuous\nhardcore model does not exhibit a phase transition on the infinite regular\ntree. We also consider a family of continuous models that interpolate between\nthe discrete and continuous hardcore models on a regular tree when $\\lambda =\n1$ and show that each member of the family has a unique Gibbs measure, even\nwhen the discrete model does not. In each case, the proof entails the analysis\nof an associated Hamiltonian dynamical system that describes a certain limit of\nthe marginal distribution at a node. Furthermore, given any sequence of regular\ngraphs with fixed degree and girth diverging to infinity, we apply our results\nto compute the asymptotic limit of suitably normalized volumes of the\ncorresponding sequence of convex polytopes of feasible configurations.

In this manuscript, we present results from the first\nsynthesis of these two technologies in a titanium, aluminum, vanadium\n(Ti-6Al-4V) superconducting radio frequency resonator which exploits a design\nunattainable through conventional fabrication means.

While the lower transition temperature, not\npreviously known in literature, is consistent with the observed temperature\ndependence of the superconducting microwave surface impedance. From the surface\nreactance, we extract a London penetration depth of $8\\pm3{\\mu}$m - roughly an\norder of magnitude larger than other titanium alloys and several orders of\nmagnitude larger than other conventional elemental superconductors.

We show that an adversary can subtly\nmanipulate a video in such a way that a human observer would perceive the\ncontent of the original video, but the video analysis algorithm will return the\nadversary's desired outputs.\n  We then apply the attacks on the recently released Google Cloud Video\nIntelligence API.

The orbital energy is defined as the mechanical energy\nof the two bodies' center of mass. According to the classical analysis of\nKepler and Newton, when the fluids are replaced by point masses, the conic\ncurve describing the trajectories of the masses is a hyperbola when the orbital\nenergy is positive and an ellipse when the orbital energy is negative. The\norbital energy is conserved in the case of point masses. If the point masses\nare initially very far, then the orbital energy is positive, corresponding to\nhyperbolic motion. However, in the motion of fluid bodies the orbital energy is\nno longer conserved because part of the conserved energy is used in deforming\nthe boundaries of the bodies. In this case the total energy\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}$ can be decomposed into a sum\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}:=\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{orbital}}}}+\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{tidal}}}}$,\nwith $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{tidal}}}}$ measuring the energy used in\ndeforming the boundaries, such that if\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{orbital}}}}<-c<0$ for some absolute constant\n$c>0$, then the orbit of the bodies must be bounded.

One approach to RS is Collaborative Filtering\n(CF), which is based on the idea that similar users are interested in similar\nitems. Most model-based approaches to CF seek to train a\nmachine-learning/data-mining model based on sparse data; the model is then used\nto provide recommendations. While most of the proposed approaches are effective\nfor small-size situations, the combinatorial nature of the problem makes it\nimpractical for medium-to-large instances. In this work we present a novel\napproach to CF that works by training a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) on\ncorrupted baskets, i.e., baskets from which one or more items have been\nremoved. The DAE is then forced to learn to reconstruct the original basket\ngiven its corrupted input. Due to recent advancements in optimization and other\ntechnologies for training neural-network models (such as DAE), the proposed\nmethod results in a scalable and practical approach to CF. The contribution of\nthis work is twofold: (1) to identify missing items in observed baskets and,\nthus, directly providing a CF model; and, (2) to construct a generative model\nof baskets which may be used, for instance, in simulation analysis or as part\nof a more complex analytical method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

In particular, a comparison to\nthe homogeneous electron gas (HEG) shows that the satellites are influenced by\nthe crystal environment, although the crystal potential in sodium is weak.\nMoreover, the temperature dependence of the lattice constant is reflected in\nthe position of the satellites. Details of the screening also play an important\nrole; in particular, the contribution of transitions from 2s and 2p semi-core\nlevels influence the satellites, but not the QP. Moreover, inclusion of\ncontributions to the screening beyond the RPA has an effect on the satellites.\nFinally, we elucidate the importance of the coupling of electrons and holes by\ncomparing the results of the time-ordered (TOC) and the retarded (RC) cumulant\nexpansion approximations.

For predictable interference control, we propose the\nCyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework that leverages the PRK interference\nmodel and addresses the challenges of vehicle mobility to PRK-based scheduling.\nIn particular, CPS leverage physical locations of vehicles to define the gPRK\ninterference model, a geometric approximation of the PRK model, for effective\ninterference relation estimation, and CPS leverages cyber-physical structures\nof vehicle traffic flows (particularly, spatiotemporal interference correlation\nas well as macro- and micro-scopic vehicle dynamics) for effective use of the\ngPRK model.

One example is the pole expansion and selected inversion (PEXSI)\nmethod, which approximates the Fermi operator by rational matrix functions and\nreduces the computational complexity to at most quadratic scaling for solving\nKSDFT. Unlike diagonalization type methods, the chemical potential often cannot\nbe directly read off from the result of a single step of evaluation of the\nFermi operator. Hence multiple evaluations are needed to be sequentially\nperformed to compute the chemical potential to ensure the correct number of\nelectrons within a given tolerance. This hinders the performance of FOE methods\nin practice. In this paper we develop an efficient and robust strategy to\ndetermine the chemical potential in the context of the PEXSI method. The main\nidea of the new method is not to find the exact chemical potential at each\nself-consistent-field (SCF) iteration iteration, but to dynamically and\nrigorously update the upper and lower bounds for the true chemical potential,\nso that the chemical potential reaches its convergence along the SCF iteration.\nInstead of evaluating the Fermi operator for multiple times sequentially, our\nmethod uses a two-level strategy that evaluates the Fermi operators in\nparallel. In the regime of full parallelization, the wall clock time of each\nSCF iteration is always close to the time for one single evaluation of the\nFermi operator, even when the initial guess is far away from the converged\nsolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method using examples\nwith metallic and insulating characters, as well as results from ab initio\nmolecular dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

For each case we study the\ndiscretization error between the actual time the event occurs versus the time\nthe event occurs for the discretized path, and also the discretization error on\nthe position of the Brownian motion at these times. We show limits in\ndistribution for the discretization errors normalized by their convergence\nrate, and give closed-form analytic expressions for the limiting random\nvariables. Additionally, we use these limits to study the asymptotic behaviour\nof Gaussian random walks in the following situations: (1.) the overshoot of a\nGaussian walk above a barrier that goes to infinity; (2.) the minimum of a\nGaussian walk compared to the minimum of the Brownian motion obtained when\ninterpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, both up to the same time\nhorizon that goes to infinity; and (3.) the global minimum of a Gaussian walk\ncompared to the global minimum of the Brownian motion obtained when\ninterpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, when both have the same\npositive drift decreasing to zero.

In particular, output\nmaps of the existing methods remain low in spatial resolution causing blurred\nedges due to the stride and pooling operations, networks often neglect\ndescriptive statistical and handcrafted priors that have potential to\ncomplement saliency detection results, and deep features at different layers\nstay mainly desolate waiting to be effectively fused to handle multi-scale\nsalient objects. In this paper, we tackle these issues by a new fully\nconvolutional neural network that jointly learns salient edges and saliency\nlabels in an end-to-end fashion. Our framework first employs convolutional\nlayers that reformulate the detection task as a dense labeling problem, then\nintegrates handcrafted saliency features in a hierarchical manner into lower\nand higher levels of the deep network to leverage available information for\nmulti-scale response, and finally refines the saliency map through dilated\nconvolutions by imposing context. In this way, the salient edge priors are\nefficiently incorporated and the output resolution is significantly improved\nwhile keeping the memory requirements low, leading to cleaner and sharper\nobject boundaries. Extensive experimental analyses on ten benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistently superior performance and\nattains robustness for complex scenes in comparison to the very recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 00:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Solar flares are magnetic explosions:\nmagnetic energy stored in unneutralized currents in coronal loops is released\ninto energetic electrons in the impulsive phase and into mass motion in a CME.\nThe energy release is due to a change in current configuration effectively\nreducing the net current path. A flare is driven by the electromotive force\n(EMF) due to the changing magnetic flux. The EMF drives a flare-associated\ncurrent whose cross-field closure is achieved by redirection along field lines\nto the chromosphere and back. The essential roles that currents play are\nobscured in the \"standard\" model and are described incorrectly in circuit\nmodels. A semi-quantitative treatment of the energy and the EMF is provided by\na multi-current model, in which the currents are constant and the change in the\ncurrent paths is described by time-dependent inductances. There is no\nself-consistent model that includes the intrinsic time dependence, the EMF, the\nflare-associated current and the internal energy transport during a flare.

Accordingly, SPOD modes represent structures that are dynamic\nin the same sense as DMD modes but also optimally account for the statistical\nvariability of turbulent flows. Finally, we establish a connection between SPOD\nand resolvent analysis. The key observation is that the resolvent-mode\nexpansion coefficients must be regarded as statistical quantities to ensure\nconvergent approximations of the flow statistics.

These segregate to form a special\npattern, known as the immunological synapse (IS), consisting of a central\nquasi-circular domain of TCR-pMHC bonds surrounded by a peripheral domain of\nLFA1-ICAM1 complexes. Insights gained from imaging studies had led to the\nconclusion that the formation of the central adhesion domain in the IS is\ndriven by active (ATP-driven) mechanisms. Recent studies, however, suggested\nthat passive (thermodynamic) mechanisms may also play an important role in this\nprocess. Here, we present a simple physical model, taking into account the\nmembrane-mediated thermodynamic attraction between the TCR-pMHC bonds and the\neffective forces that they experience due to ATP-driven actin retrograde flow\nand transport by dynein motor proteins. Monte Carlo simulations of the model\nexhibit a good spatio-temporal agreement with the experimentally observed\npattern evolution of the TCR-pMHC microclusters. The agreement is lost when one\nof the aggregation mechanisms is \"muted\", which helps to identify the\nrespective roles in the process. We conclude that actin retrograde flow drives\nthe centripetal motion of TCR-pMHC bonds, while the membrane-mediated\ninteractions facilitate microcluster formation and growth. In the absence of\ndynein motors, the system evolves into a ring-shaped pattern, which highlights\nthe role of dynein motors in the formation of the final concentric pattern. The\ninterplay between the passive and active mechanisms regulates the rate of the\naccumulation process, which in the absence of one them proceeds either too\nquickly or slowly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 06:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Massive MIMO can be implemented with Time Division Duplexing (TDD) or\nFrequency Division Duplexing (FDD) operation. FDD massive MIMO systems are\nparticularly desirable due to their implementation in current wireless networks\nand their efficiency in situations with symmetric traffic and delay-sensitive\napplications. However, implementing FDD massive MIMO systems is known to be\nchallenging since it imposes a large feedback overhead in the Uplink (UL) to\nobtain channel state information for the Downlink (DL). In recent years, a\nconsiderable amount of research is dedicated to developing methods to reduce\nthe feedback overhead in such systems. In this paper, we use the sparse spatial\nscattering properties of the environment to achieve this goal. The idea is to\nestimate the support of the continuous, frequency-invariant scattering function\nfrom UL channel observations and use this estimate to obtain the support of the\nDL channel vector via appropriate interpolation. We use the resulting support\nestimate to design an efficient DL probing and UL feedback scheme in which the\nfeedback dimension scales proportionally with the sparsity order of DL channel\nvectors. Since the sparsity order is much less than the number of BS antennas\nin almost all practically relevant scenarios, our method incurs much less\nfeedback overhead compared with the currently proposed methods in the\nliterature, such as those based on compressed-sensing.

Such systems can be modelled at multiple\nscales with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency. When\nrepresenting genuinely multiscale phenomena, fine-scale models can be\nprohibitively expensive, whereas coarser models, although cheaper, often lack\nsufficient detail to accurately represent the phenomenon at hand. Spatial\nhybrid methods couple two or more of these representations in order to improve\nefficiency without compromising accuracy.\n  In this paper, we present a novel spatial hybrid method, which we call the\nauxiliary region method (ARM), which couples PDE and Brownian-based\nrepresentations of reaction-diffusion systems. Numerical PDE solutions on one\nside of an interface are coupled to Brownian-based dynamics on the other side\nusing compartment-based \"auxiliary regions\". We demonstrate that the hybrid\nmethod is able to simulate reaction-diffusion dynamics for a number of\ndifferent test problems with high accuracy. Further, we undertake error\nanalysis on the ARM which demonstrates that it is robust to changes in the free\nparameters in the model, where previous coupling algorithms are not. In\nparticular, we envisage that the method will be applicable for a wide range of\nspatial multi-scales problems including, filopodial dynamics, intracellular\nsignalling, embryogenesis and travelling wave phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 10:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 13:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

They have been firmly established as a useful\ntool for the synthesis and analysis of localized (concentrated or confined)\nsignals, and for the modeling and inversion of noise-contaminated data that are\nonly regionally available or only of regional interest. In this paper, we\nconsider a general abstract setup for inverse problems represented by a linear\nand compact operator between Hilbert spaces with a known singular-value\ndecomposition (svd). In practice, such an svd is often only given for the case\nof a global expansion of the data (e.g. on the whole sphere) but not for\nregional data distributions. We show that, in either case, Slepian functions\n(associated to an arbitrarily prescribed region and the given compact operator)\ncan be determined and applied to construct a regularization for the ill-posed\nregional inverse problem. Moreover, we describe an algorithm for constructing\nthe Slepian basis via an algebraic eigenvalue problem. The obtained Slepian\nfunctions can be used to derive an svd for the combination of the regionalizing\nprojection and the compact operator. As a result, standard regularization\ntechniques relying on a known svd become applicable also to those inverse\nproblems where the data are regionally given only.

In large part, these\ntechniques solve continuous optimization problems. Recently however, discrete\ngenerative deep learning models have been successfully used to efficiently\nsearch high-dimensional discrete spaces. These methods work by representing\ndiscrete objects as sequences, for which powerful sequence-based deep models\ncan be employed. Unfortunately, these techniques are significantly hindered by\nthe fact that these generative models often produce invalid sequences. As a\nstep towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent\nvalidator model. Given a partial sequence, our model learns the probability of\nthat sequence occurring as the beginning of a full valid sequence. Thus this\nidentifies valid versus invalid sequences and crucially it also provides\ninsight about how individual sequence elements influence the validity of\ndiscrete objects. To learn this model we propose an approach inspired by\nseminal work in Bayesian active learning. On a synthetic dataset, we\ndemonstrate the ability of our model to distinguish valid and invalid\nsequences. We believe this is a key step toward learning generative models that\nfaithfully produce valid discrete objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 11:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Methods based on von Neumann's mean-square\nsuccessive-difference estimator are found to be superior to those using other\nestimators.

We\npropose an efficient intersection traffic control scheme without the traffic\nlights, that only requires a majority of vehicles on the road to be equipped\nwith a simple driver assistance system. The algorithm of our scheme is\ncompletely decentralized, and takes into full account the non-linear\ninteraction between the vehicles at high density. For vehicles approaching the\nintersection in different directions, our algorithm imposes simple interactions\nbetween vehicles around the intersection, by defining specific conditions on\nthe real-time basis, for which the involved vehicles are required to briefly\nadjust their dynamics. This leads to a self-organised traffic flow that is\nsafe, robust, and efficient. We also take into account of the driver comfort\nlevel and study its effect on the control efficiency. The scheme has low\ntechnological barrier, minimal impact on the conventional driving behaviour,\nand can coexist with the traffic light control. It also has the advantages of\nbeing easily scalable, and fully compatible with both the conventional road\nsystems as well as the futuristic scenario in which driverless vehicles\ndominate the road. The mathematical formulation of our scheme permits large\nscale realistic numerical simulations of busy intersections, allowing a more\ncomplete evaluation of the control performance, instead of just the collision\navoidance at the intersection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 15:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

By adjusting the syphon and the cross geometry, we find that the\noptimized combination of both structures prevents failures in the full sensor\nstructure yielding robust operation. Our modeling results show that the\noptimized element geometry allows for the realization of the sensor with\ncross-shaped intersections and operation that is tolerant to inaccuracies of\nthe fabrication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 15:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Here we discuss weak localization and\nantilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and\nmassive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both\nintrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the\ncomplex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar\nand spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic\nspin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum\nrelaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the\ndiffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In\nTIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity\nspin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak\nantilocalization correction. They produce substantial qualitative modifications\nto the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly from the conventional HLN formula\ntraditionally used in experimental fits, which predicts a crossover from weak\nlocalization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit\nstrength. In contrast, our analysis reveals that topological insulators always\nexhibit weak antilocalization.

In this paper, we present\na prototyping photodiode-based VLC system towards large-scale localization.\nSpecially, we give in-depth analysis of the design constraints and\nconsiderations for large-scale indoor localization research. After that we\nidentify the key enablers for such systems: 1) distributed architecture, 2)\none-way communication, and 3) random multiple access. Accordingly, we propose\nPlugo -- a photodiode-based VLC system conforming to the aforementioned\ncriteria. We present a compact design of the VLC-compatible LED bulbs featuring\nplug-and-go use-cases. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii\nArea (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared\noptical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by\nexperiments, and further demonstrate its scalability to large-scale scenarios\nthrough simulations. Finally, preliminary localization experiments are\nconducted using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed, achieving\nan average accuracy of 0.14 m along with a 90-percentile accuracy of 0.33 m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

We find a series of\nresonances as the grating couples a normally-incident THz wave to standing\nsurface plasmon waves on both thin and thick InSb layers. In a marked contrast\nwith previously-explored metallic gratings, we observe the emergence of a much\nstronger additional resonance. The mechanism of this giant plasmonic resonance\nis well interpreted by the dispersion of surface plasmon excited in the\nair\\TiO2\\InSb trilayer system. We demonstrate that both the frequency and the\nintensity of the giant resonance can be tuned by varying dielectric grating\nparameters, providing more flexible tunability than metallic gratings. The\nphase and amplitude of the normally-incident THz wave are spatially modulated\nby the dielectric grating to optimize the surface plasmon excitation. The giant\nsurface plasmon resonance gives rise to strong enhancement of the electric\nfield above the grating structure, which can be useful in sensing and\nspectroscopy applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}
