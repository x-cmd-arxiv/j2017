Although the pressures in the multi-megabar range can be\nproduced by the shocks generated with a large variety of methods, the higher\npressures, in the sub-gigabar or gigabar range, are achievable only with\nnuclear explosions or laser-driven shocks. However, the laser-to-shock energy\nconversion efficiency in the laser-based methods currently applied is low and,\nas a result, multi-kilojoule multi-beam lasers have to be used to produce such\nextremely high pressures. In this paper, the generation of high-pressure shocks\nin the newly proposed collider in which the projectile impacting a solid target\nis driven by the laser-induced cavity pressure acceleration (LICPA) mechanism\nis investigated using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. A special\nattention is paid to the dependence of shock parameters and the laser-to-shock\nenergy conversion efficiency on the impacted target material and the laser\ndriver energy. It has been found that both in case of low-density and\nhigh-density solid targets the shock pressures in the sub-gigabar range can be\nproduced in the LICPA-based collider with the laser energy of only a few\nhundred of joules, and the laser-to-shock energy conversion efficiency can\nreach values of 10 to 20 percent, by an order of magnitude higher than the\nconversion efficiencies achieved with other laser-based methods used so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We show that for odd number of chains , in the thermodynamic limit\n$L \\to \\infty,$ these models exhibit APT at $\\rho_c= \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac1M)$\nwith $\\beta =1.$ On the other hand, for even-chain systems transition occurs at\n$\\rho_c=\\frac12$ with $\\beta=1,2$ for $M=2,4$ respectively, and $\\beta= 3$ for\n$M\\ge6.$ We illustrate this unusual critical behavior analytically using a\ntransfer matrix method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

The efficiency of collective\ncommunication operations depends on the actual algorithm, its implementation,\nand the specific communication problem (type of communication, message size,\nnumber of processes). Many MPI libraries provide numerous algorithms for\nspecific collective operations. The strategy for selecting an efficient\nalgorithm is often times predefined (hard-coded) in MPI libraries, but some of\nthem, such as Open MPI, allow users to change the algorithm manually. Finding\nthe best algorithm for each case is a hard problem, and several approaches to\ntune these algorithmic parameters have been proposed. We use an orthogonal\napproach to the parameter-tuning of MPI collectives, that is, instead of\ntesting individual algorithmic choices provided by an MPI library, we compare\nthe latency of a specific MPI collective operation to the latency of\nsemantically equivalent functions, which we call the mock-up implementations.\nThe structure of the mock-up implementations is defined by self-consistent\nperformance guidelines. The advantage of this approach is that tuning using\nmock-up implementations is always possible, whether or not an MPI library\nallows users to select a specific algorithm at run-time. We implement this\nconcept in a library called PGMPITuneLib, which is layered between the user\ncode and the actual MPI implementation. This library selects the\nbest-performing algorithmic pattern of an MPI collective by intercepting MPI\ncalls and redirecting them to our mock-up implementations. Experimental results\nshow that PGMPITuneLib can significantly reduce the latency of MPI collectives,\nand also equally important, that it can help identifying the tuning potential\nof MPI libraries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 14:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-11"}

Given a collection of $n$ items and a few pairwise comparisons\nacross them, one wishes to identify the set of $K$ items that receive the\nhighest ranks. To tackle this problem, we adopt the logistic parametric model\n--- the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where each item is assigned a latent\npreference score, and where the outcome of each pairwise comparison depends\nsolely on the relative scores of the two items involved. Recent works have made\nsignificant progress towards characterizing the performance (e.g. the mean\nsquare error for estimating the scores) of several classical methods, including\nthe spectral method and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, where\nthey stand regarding top-$K$ ranking remains unsettled.\n  We demonstrate that under a natural random sampling model, the spectral\nmethod alone, or the regularized MLE alone, is minimax optimal in terms of the\nsample complexity --- the number of paired comparisons needed to ensure exact\ntop-$K$ identification, for the fixed dynamic range regime. This is\naccomplished via optimal control of the entrywise error of the score estimates.\nWe complement our theoretical studies by numerical experiments, confirming that\nboth methods yield low entrywise errors for estimating the underlying scores.\nOur theory is established via a novel leave-one-out trick, which proves\neffective for analyzing both iterative and non-iterative procedures. Along the\nway, we derive an elementary eigenvector perturbation bound for probability\ntransition matrices, which parallels the Davis-Kahan $\\sin\\Theta$ theorem for\nsymmetric matrices. This also allows us to close the gap between the $\\ell_2$\nerror upper bound for the spectral method and the minimax lower limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 03:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 16:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

During an inflationary period,\nthe Higgs mass squared is selected to be negative and hierarchically small in a\ntheory which is consistent with 't Hooft's technical naturalness criteria.\nHowever, in the original model proposed by Graham, Kaplan and Rajendran (2015),\nthe relaxion does not solve the strong CP problem, and in fact contributes to\nit, as the coupling of the relaxion to the Higgs field and the introduction of\na linear potential for the relaxion produces large strong CP violation. We\nresolve this tension by considering inflation with a Hubble scale which is\nabove the QCD scale but below the weak scale, and estimating the Hubble\ntemperature dependence of the axion mass. The relaxion potential is thus very\ndifferent during inflation than it is today.

We show that, in practice, the gain,\nquantum efficiency, and output field squeezing of these devices are limited by\nusually neglected higher-order corrections to the idealized model. To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength.

When observed with the WFIRST Wide Field\nCamera, these stars will saturate the detector and produce very strong\ndiffraction spikes. In this paper, we forecast the astrometric precision that\nWFIRST can achieve by centering on the diffraction spikes of highly saturated\nstars. This measurement principle is strongly facilitated by the WFIRST H4RG\ndetectors, which confine excess charges within the potential well of saturated\npixels. By adopting a simplified analytical model of the diffraction spike\ncaused by a single support strut obscuring the telescope aperture, integrated\nover the WFIRST pixel size, we predict the performance of this approach with\nthe Fisher-matrix formalism. We discuss the validity of the model and find that\n10 ${\\mu}$as astrometric precision is achievable with a single 100 s exposure\nof a R = 6 or a J = 5 star.

To suppress those systematics, we suggest a series of short exposures,\ndithered by at least several hundred pixels, to reach an effective per-visit\nastrometric precision of better than 10 ${\\mu}$as.

In our\nsettings, buyers arrive online and purchase bundles of items; buyers' values\nfor the bundles are drawn from known distributions. This problem is closely\nrelated to the so-called prophet-inequality of Krengel and Sucheston and its\nextensions in recent literature. Motivated by applications to cloud economics,\nwe consider two kinds of buyer preferences. In the first, items correspond to\ndifferent units of time at which a resource is available; the items are\narranged in a total order and buyers desire intervals of items. The second\ncorresponds to bandwidth allocation over a tree network; the items are edges in\nthe network and buyers desire paths.\n  Because buyers' preferences have complementarities in the settings we\nconsider, recent constant-factor approximations via item prices do not apply,\nand indeed strong negative results are known. We develop static, anonymous\nbundle pricing mechanisms.\n  For the interval preferences setting, we show that static, anonymous bundle\npricings achieve a sublogarithmic competitive ratio, which is optimal (within\nconstant factors) over the class of all online allocation algorithms, truthful\nor not. For the path preferences setting, we obtain a nearly-tight logarithmic\ncompetitive ratio. Both of these results exhibit an exponential improvement\nover item pricings for these settings. Our results extend to settings where the\nseller has multiple copies of each item, with the competitive ratio decreasing\nlinearly with supply.

We also included support for\nskip connections, that are used in state-of-the art NNs, and shown that our\narchitecture allows to add those connections almost for free. All this allowed\nus to implement an 18-layer ResNet for 224x224 images classification, achieving\n57.5% top-1 accuracy.\n  In addition, we implemented a full-sized quantized AlexNet. In contrast to\nprevious works, we use 2-bit activations instead of 1-bit ones, which improves\nAlexNet's top-1 accuracy from 41.8% to 51.03% for the ImageNet classification.\nBoth AlexNet and ResNet can handle 1000-class real-time classification on an\nFPGA.\n  Our implementation of ResNet-18 consumes 5x less power and is 4x slower for\nImageNet, when compared to the same NN on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Smaller NNs,\nthat fit a single FPGA, are running faster then on GPUs on small (32x32)\ninputs, while consuming up to 20x less energy and power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 11:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 13:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

Rating transition\nmatrices have gained in importance with the newly adopted IFRS 9 accounting\nstandard. Here, the multi-year PDs can be used to calculate the so-called\nexpected credit losses (ECL) over the entire lifetime of relevant credit\nassets. A typical approach for estimating the rating transition matrices relies\non calculating empirical rating migration counts and frequencies from rating\nhistory data. For small portfolios, however, this approach often leads to zero\ncounts and high count volatility, which makes the estimations unreliable and\nunstable, and can also produce counter-intuitive prediction patterns such as\nnon-parallel/crossing forward PD patterns. This paper proposes a structural\nmodel which overcomes these problems. We make a plausible assumption of an\nunderlying autoregressive mean-reverting ability-to-pay process. With only\nthree parameters, this sparse process can well describe an entire typical\nrating transition matrix, provided the one-year PDs of the rating classes are\nspecified. The transition probabilities produced by the structural approach are\nwell-behaved by design. The approach significantly reduces the statistical\ndegrees of freedom of the estimated transition probabilities, which makes the\nrating transition matrix more reliable for small portfolios. The approach can\nbe applied to data with as few as 50 observed rating transitions. Moreover, the\napproach can be efficiently applied to data consisting of continuous PDs (prior\nto rating discretization). In the IFRS 9 context, the approach offers an\nadditional merit: it can easily account for the macroeconomic adjustments,\nwhich are required by the IFRS 9 accounting standard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 03:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 11:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Among these, regression trees and their\nensembles have demonstrated impressive empirical performance. In this work, we\nshed light on the machinery behind Bayesian variants of these methods. In\nparticular, we study Bayesian regression histograms, such as Bayesian dyadic\ntrees, in the simple regression case with just one predictor. We focus on the\nreconstruction of regression surfaces that are piecewise constant, where the\nnumber of jumps is unknown. We show that with suitably designed priors,\nposterior distributions concentrate around the true step regression function at\na near-minimax rate.

A biased graph has two natural matroids, the frame\nmatroid and the lift matroid. A classical question in matroid theory is whether\na matroid can be embedded in a projective geometry. There is no known general\nanswer, but for matroids of biased graphs it is possible to give algebraic\ncriteria. Zaslavsky has previously given such criteria for embeddability of\nbiased-graphic matroids in Desarguesian projective spaces; in this paper we\nestablish criteria for the remaining case, that is, embeddability in an\narbitrary projective plane that is not necessarily Desarguesian.\n  The criteria depend on the embeddability of a quasigroup associated to the\ngraph into the additive or multiplicative loop of a ternary coordinate ring for\nthe plane. A 3-node biased graph is equivalent to an abstract partial 3-net;\nthus, we have a new algebraic criterion for an abstract 3-net to be realized in\na non-Desarguesian projective plane. We work in terms of a special kind of\n3-node biased graph called a biased expansion of a triangle. Our results apply\nto all finite 3-node biased graphs because, as we prove, every such biased\ngraph is a subgraph of a finite biased expansion of a triangle. A biased\nexpansion of a triangle, in turn, is equivalent to an isostrophe class of\nquasigroups, which is equivalent to a $3$-net. Much is not known about\nembedding a quasigroup into a ternary ring, so we do not say our criteria are\ndefinitive. For instance, it is not even known whether there is a finite\nquasigroup that cannot be embedded in any finite ternary ring. If there is,\nthen there is a finite rank-3 matroid (of the corresponding biased expansion)\nthat cannot be embedded in any finite projective plane---a presently unsolved\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 23:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The resonance behaviors of the E2g1 and\nA1g modes are examined. Firstly, both the E2g1 and A1g modes are enhanced near\nresonances with the exciton states. The A1g mode exhibits Davydov splitting for\ntrilayers or thicker near some of the exciton resonances. The low-frequency\nRaman spectra show shear and breathing modes involving rigid vibrations of the\nlayers and also exhibit strong dependence on the excitation energy. An\nunidentified peak at ~19 cm-1 that does not depend on the number of layers\nappears near resonance with the B exciton state at 1.96 eV (632.8 nm). The\nstrengths of the intra- and inter-layer interactions are estimated by comparing\nthe mode frequencies and Davydov splitting with the linear chain model, and the\ncontribution of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction to the inter-layer\ninteraction turns out to be about 34% of the nearest-neighbor interaction. Fano\nresonance is observed for 1.58-eV excitation, and its origin is found to be the\ninterplay between two-phonon scattering and indirect band transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 01:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

In this paper, we study\nactive learning of a hierarchical clustering using only ordinal queries.

Real-time and high accuracy tracking algorithms, however, remain\nscarce. In this paper we study the problem from a new perspective and present a\nnovel parallel tracking and verifying (PTAV) framework, by taking advantage of\nthe ubiquity of multi-thread techniques and borrowing from the success of\nparallel tracking and mapping in visual SLAM. Our PTAV framework typically\nconsists of two components, a tracker T and a verifier V, working in parallel\non two separate threads. The tracker T aims to provide a super real-time\ntracking inference and is expected to perform well most of the time; by\ncontrast, the verifier V checks the tracking results and corrects T when\nneeded. The key innovation is that, V does not work on every frame but only\nupon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust the tracking according\nto the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV enjoys both the high\nefficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative power by V. In our\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, TC128\nand UAV20L, PTAV achieves the best tracking accuracy among all real-time\ntrackers, and in fact performs even better than many deep learning based\nsolutions. Moreover, as a general framework, PTAV is very flexible and has\ngreat rooms for improvement and generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 04:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The manual\nselection of features or designing new ones can be a tedious task. Therefore,\nit is desirable to automatically adapt the features to a certain image or class\nof images. Typically, this requires a large set of training images with similar\ntextures and ground truth segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework to\nlearn features for texture segmentation when no such training data is\navailable. The cost function for our learning process is constructed to match a\ncommonly used segmentation model, the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model.\nThis means that the features are learned such that they provide an\napproximately piecewise constant feature image with a small jump set. Based on\nthis idea, we develop a two-stage algorithm which first learns suitable\nconvolutional features and then performs a segmentation. We note that the\nfeatures can be learned from a small set of images, from a single image, or\neven from image patches. The proposed method achieves a competitive rank in the\nPrague texture segmentation benchmark, and it is effective for segmenting\nhistological images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 06:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The orbital phase-dependent variations in the Halpha\nprofile can be related to an accretion disk around the companion, from which a\nhigh-velocity outflow or jet is launched.

The origin of the fast outflow in this system can be attributed to a\ngaseous disk around the secondary component, which is most likely a main\nsequence star.

Because of complex nature due to\ncompound characters, modifiers, overlapping and touching, etc., character\nsegmentation and recognition is a tedious job in Indic scripts (e.g.\nDevanagari, Bangla, Gurumukhi, and other similar scripts). To avoid character\nsegmentation in such scripts, HMM-based sequence modeling has been used earlier\nin holistic way. This paper proposes an efficient word recognition framework by\nsegmenting the handwritten word images horizontally into three zones (upper,\nmiddle and lower) and recognize the corresponding zones. The main aim of this\nzone segmentation approach is to reduce the number of distinct component\nclasses compared to the total number of classes in Indic scripts. As a result,\nuse of this zone segmentation approach enhances the recognition performance of\nthe system. The components in middle zone where characters are mostly touching\nare recognized using HMM. After the recognition of middle zone, HMM based\nViterbi forced alignment is applied to mark the left and right boundaries of\nthe characters. Next, the residue components, if any, in upper and lower zones\nin their respective boundary are combined to achieve the final word level\nrecognition. Water reservoir feature has been integrated in this framework to\nimprove the zone segmentation and character alignment defects while\nsegmentation. A novel sliding window-based feature, called Pyramid Histogram of\nOriented Gradient (PHOG) is proposed for middle zone recognition. An exhaustive\nexperiment is performed on two Indic scripts namely, Bangla and Devanagari for\nthe performance evaluation. From the experiment, it has been noted that\nproposed zone-wise recognition improves accuracy with respect to the\ntraditional way of Indic word recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 09:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The\ninelasticity can be calculated by solving a third-order polynomial equation\ncontaining: a) the kinematics of the interaction, b) the LIV term for each\nparticle and c) the geometry of the interaction. We use the inelasticity we\ncalculate to investigate the proton propagation in the intergalactic media. The\nphotopion production of the proton interaction with the CMB is taken into\naccount using the inelasticity and the attenuation length in different LIV\nscenarios. We show how the allowed phase space for the photopion production\nchanges when LIV is considered for the interaction. The calculations presented\nhere are going to be extended in order to calculated the modified ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays spectrum and compare it to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 11:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Combined with X-ray and optical analyses, mass maps of cluster\nmergers reconstructed from weak-lensing observations have been used to\nconstrain the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. The dynamically\ncomplex Abell 520 (A520) cluster is an exceptional case, even among merging\nsystems: multi-wavelength observations have revealed a surprising high\nmass-to-light concentration of dark mass, the interpretation of which is\ndifficult under the standard assumption of effectively collisionless dark\nmatter.

Video frames are naturally generated by the\ninherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion\ndynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly\nhallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we\ndevelop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which\nlearns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the\npixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal\nfuture-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop,\ngenerating informative feedback signals to each other for better video\nprediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable\nfrom reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the\nfuture-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the\nfuture-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual\nmotion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations\nwith a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational\nautoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion\nGAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthesizing new\nvideo frames and predicting future flows.

This\nphenomenon has rarely been measured, usually due to soft homeotropic anchoring\ninduced at the nanoparticle surface. Here we present an optical study of the\nmagnetic Fredericksz transition combined with a light scattering study of the\nclassical nematic liquid crystal, 5CB, doped with 6 nm diameter magnetic and\nnon-magnetic nanoparticles. Surprisingly, for both nanoparticles, we observe at\nroom temperature a net decrease of the threshold field of the Fredericksz\ntransition at low nanoparticle concentrations, which appears associated with a\ncoating of the nanoparticles by a brush of polydimethylsiloxane copolymer\nchains inducing planar anchoring of the director on the nanoparticle surface.\nMoreover the magnetic Fredericksz threshold exhibits non-monotonic behaviour as\na function of the nanoparticle concentration for both types of nanoparticles,\nfirst decreasing down to a value from 23\\% to 31\\% below that of pure 5CB, then\nincreasing with a further increase of nanoparticle concentration. This is\ninterpreted as an aggregation starting at around 0.02 weight fraction that\nconsumes more isolated nanoparticles than those introduced when the\nconcentration is increased above $c = 0.05$ weight fraction (volume fraction\n$3.5 \\times 10^{-2}$). This shows the larger effect of isolated nanoparticles\non the threshold with respect to aggregates. From dynamic light scattering\nmeasurements we deduced that, if the decrease of the magnetic threshold when\nthe nanoparticle concentration increases is similar for both kinds of\nnanoparticles, the origin of this decrease is different for magnetic and\nnon-magnetic nanoparticles. For non-magnetic nanoparticles, the behavior may be\nassociated with a decrease of the elastic constant due to weak planar\nanchoring. For magnetic nanoparticles there are non-negligible local magnetic\ninteractions between liquid crystal molecules and magnetic nanoparticles,\nleading to an increase of the average order parameter. This magnetic\ninteraction thus favors an easier liquid crystal director rotation in the\npresence of external magnetic field, able to reorient the magnetic moments of\nthe nanoparticles along with the molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 12:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

By doing so,\nseveral well-known sampling techniques can be applied for clustering data\npoints in a semi-metric space. One particularly interesting sampling technique\nis the exponentially twisted sampling in which one can specify the desired\naverage distance from the sampling distribution to detect clusters with various\nresolutions.\n  We also propose a softmax clustering algorithm that can perform a clustering\nand embed data points in a semi-metric space to a low dimensional Euclidean\nspace.

X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray\nobservations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with\nADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely\nlaunching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD\ntemperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the\nX-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small\nCV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same\norder as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U\nGem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 13:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Recent literature tried to\nunderstand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale\nchromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning\ntasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured,\nhigh-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what\nare the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either\nfailed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate\nfeature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an\nattention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a\nunified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin\nfactors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of\nmultiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and\nto model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome\ntrains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it\nto attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions\nper mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in\nhuman.

We use this framework to analyze two different kinds of\ntwo-qubit invariants of Makhlin and Jing et. al. These invariants allow to\nfully reconstruct any two-qubit state up to local unitaries. We demonstrate\nthat measuring 3 invariants is sufficient to find, e.g., the optimal Bell\ninequality violation. These invariants can be measured with local or nonlocal\nmeasurements. We show that the nonlocal strategy that follows from Makhlin's\ninvariants is more resource-efficient than local strategy following from the\ninvariants of Jing et al. To measure all of the Makhlin's invariants directly\none needs to use both two-qubit singlet and three-qubit W-state projections on\nmultiple copies of the two-qubit state. This problem is equivalent to a\ncordinate system handness measurement.

The estimator generates a sparse\nrepresentation for each data point. Then, we construct a nonlinear kernel\nmatrix from the sparse representation of data. One major advantage of the\nproposed kernel method is that it is relatively insensitive to its free\nparameters, and therefore, it can produce reasonable results without parameter\ntuning. Another advantage is that it is simple. We conjecture that the proposed\nmethod can find its applications in many learning tasks or methods where sparse\nrepresentation or kernel matrix is explored.

Facial occlusions are often treated as noise and discarded in\nrecognition of affective states. However, hand over face occlusions can provide\nadditional information for recognition of some affective states such as\ncuriosity, frustration and boredom. One of the reasons that this problem has\nnot gained attention is the lack of naturalistic occluded faces that contain\nhand over face occlusions as well as other types of occlusions.

Conventional NVMs, such as magnetic random access\nmemory (MRAM) and resistive random access memory (RRAM) suffer from limitations\nof low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), low access speed or finite endurance.\nNVMs with synergetic advantages are still highly desired for future computer\narchitectures.

An automated brain tumor\nsegmentation algorithm using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is\npresented in this paper.

If the constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously, it is\ndesirable to identify the core problems among them. Such cores are called\nminimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes).

However, a\nfull enumeration of all MUSes is in general intractable due to the large number\n(even exponential) of possible conflicts. Moreover, to identify MUSes\nalgorithms must test sets of constraints for their simultaneous satisfiabilty.\nThe type of the test depends on the application domains. The complexity of\ntests can be extremely high especially for domains like temporal logics, model\nchecking, or SMT. In this paper, we propose a recursive algorithm that\nidentifies MUSes in an online manner (i.e., one by one) and can be terminated\nat any time.

Given this, we propose a frequency stability assessment framework\nbased on a time-series approach that facilitates the analysis of a large number\nof future power system scenarios. We use this framework to assess the frequency\nstability of the Australian future power system by considering a large number\nof future scenarios and sensitivity of different parameters. By doing this, we\nidentify a maximum non-synchronous instantaneous penetration range from the\nfrequency stability point of view. Further, to reduce the detrimental impacts\nof high NS-RES penetration on system frequency stability, a dynamic inertia\nconstraint is derived and incorporated in the market dispatch model. The\nresults show that such a constraint guarantees frequency stability of the\nsystem for all credible contingencies. Also, we assess and quantify the\ncontribution of synchronous condensers, synthetic inertia of wind farms and a\ngovernor-like response from de-loaded wind farms on system frequency stability.\nThe results show that the last option is the most effective one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 02:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}

In the core mechanism of the\nmodel, oscillatory patterns in cortex are selected by and routed through the\nbasal ganglia to the thalamus phase-coherently, then circulated back to widely\nseparated areas of cortex, synchronizing those areas and functionally\nconnecting them. Corticostriatal and striatonigral conduction delays are\ncrucial to this mechanism, and evidence suggests that these delays are\nunusually long, and unusually varied, in arrangements that might facilitate\nlearning of useful time alignments and associated resonant frequencies.

So far, a variety of filtering\n(de-speckling) techniques is introduced to reduce speckle in OCT images. Most\nof these methods are generic and can be applied to OCT images of different\ntissues. The ambition of this work is to provide a de-speckling framework\nspecialized for filtering skin tissues for the community to utilize, adapt or\nbuild upon. In this paper, we present an adaptive cluster-based filtering\nframework, optimized for speckle reduction of OCT skin images. In this\nframework, by considering the layered structure of skin, first the OCT skin\nimages are segmented into differentiable layers utilizing clustering\nalgorithms, and then each cluster is de-speckled individually using adaptive\nfiltering techniques. In this study, hierarchical clustering algorithm and\nadaptive Wiener filtering technique are utilized to develop the framework. The\nproposed method is tested on optical solid phantoms with predetermined optical\nproperties. The method is also tested on healthy human skin images. The results\nshow that the proposed cluster-based filtering method can effectively reduce\nthe speckle and increase the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast while\npreserving the edges in the image. The proposed cluster-based filtering\nframework enables researchers to develop unsupervised learning solutions for\nde-speckling OCT skin images using adaptive filtering methods, or extend the\nframework to new applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 06:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 01:31:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 18:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The panels are composed of a periodic array of\nvarying cross-section waveguides, each of them being loaded by an array of\nHelmholtz resonators (HRs) with graded dimensions. The low cut-off frequency of\nthe absorption band is fixed by the resonance frequency of the deepest HR, that\nreduces drastically the transmission. The preceding HR is designed with a\nslightly higher resonance frequency with a geometry that allows the impedance\nmatching to the surrounding medium. Therefore, reflection vanishes and the\nstructure is critically coupled. This results in perfect sound absorption at a\nsingle frequency. We report perfect absorption at 300 Hz for a structure whose\nthickness is 40 times smaller than the wavelength. Moreover, this process is\nrepeated by adding HRs to the waveguide, each of them with a higher resonance\nfrequency than the preceding one. Using this frequency cascade effect, we\nreport quasi-perfect sound absorption over almost two frequency octaves ranging\nfrom 300 to 1000 Hz for a panel composed of 9 resonators with a total thickness\nof 11 cm, i.e., 10 times smaller than the wavelength at 300 Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

The SDPD-DV method is realized with fluid particles, boundary\nparticles and dynamically allocated virtual particles near solid boundaries.\nThe physical domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries,\nperiodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the\ndomain are represented with boundary particles which have an assigned position,\nwall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid domain is\ndiscretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for\nnearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell\nand Verlet-list approaches and utilizes large rectangular cells for\ncomputational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in the\nproximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual\nparticles in its truncated support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a\nvirtual particle are identical to those of the corresponding fluid particle.\nAdditional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient, planar,\nCouette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m\nfrom the bottom stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good\nagreement with the analytical solutions. Additional SDPD-DV verification is\naccomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number\nflow of water over a cylinder of radius .

To measure the importance\nof these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by\nusing Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the\neffect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market\nintegration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting\nprices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a\ncase study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements\nin forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features.

They exhibit two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin\nzone, and the valley populations can be directly controlled and determined\nusing circularly polarized optical excitation and emission. The\nphotoluminescence polarization reflects the ratio of the two valley\npopulations. A wide range of values for the degree of circularly polarized\nemission, Pcirc, has been reported for monolayer WS2, although the reasons for\nthe disparity are unclear. Here we optically populate one valley, and measure\nPcirc to explore the valley population dynamics at room temperature in a large\nnumber of monolayer WS2 samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition.\nUnder resonant excitation, Pcirc ranges from 2% to 32%, and we observe a\npronounced inverse relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and\nPcirc. High quality samples exhibiting strong PL and long exciton relaxation\ntime exhibit a low degree of valley polarization, and vice versa. This behavior\nis also demonstrated in monolayer WSe2 samples and transferred WS2, indicating\nthat this correlation may be more generally observed and account for the wide\nvariations reported for Pcirc. Time resolved PL provides insight into the role\nof radiative and non-radiative contributions to the observed polarization.\nShort non-radiative lifetimes result in a higher measured polarization by\nlimiting opportunity for depolarizing scattering events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}
