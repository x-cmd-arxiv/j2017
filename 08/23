This approach makes it possible to understand what information is\nbeing extracted at each stage and layer of processing as well as to minimize\nheuristic choices in design. Another key aspect of the network is its recurrent\nnature, whereby the output of each layer of processing feeds back to the input.\nTo keep the network size manageable across layers, a novel cross-channel\nfeature pooling is proposed. The multilayer architecture that results\nsystematically reveals hierarchical image structure in terms of multiscale,\nmultiorientation properties of visual spacetime.

The reliability of this background estimate is limited\nby the number of background samples and by the fact that GW detectors cannot be\nshielded from signals, making it impossible to identify a pure background data\nset.

These are the prime\ntargets for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave triggers, which\nholds enormous promise of rich science. However, hunting for electromagnetic\ncounterparts of gravitational wave events is a non-trivial task due to the\nsheer size of the error regions, which could span hundreds of square degrees.\nThe Zwicky Transient facility (ZTF), scheduled to begin operation in 2017, is\ndesigned to cover such large sky-localization areas.

In many\ndisciplines, data are collected from heterogeneous sources, resulting in\nmulti-view or multi-modal datasets. The missing data problem has been\nchallenging to address in multi-view data analysis. Especially, when certain\nsamples miss an entire view of data, it creates the missing view problem.\nClassic multiple imputations or matrix completion methods are hardly effective\nhere when no information can be based on in the specific view to impute data\nfor such samples. The commonly-used simple method of removing samples with a\nmissing view can dramatically reduce sample size, thus diminishing the\nstatistical power of a subsequent analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for view imputation via generative adversarial networks (GANs), which\nwe name by VIGAN. This approach first treats each view as a separate domain and\nidentifies domain-to-domain mappings via a GAN using randomly-sampled data from\neach view, and then employs a multi-modal denoising autoencoder (DAE) to\nreconstruct the missing view from the GAN outputs based on paired data across\nthe views.

Often, however, their sensitivity is limited\nby the decohering effects of this same environment. Dynamical decoupling\nschemes are widely used to filter environmental noise from signals, but their\nperformance is limited by the spectral properties of the signal and noise at\nhand. Quantum error correction schemes have therefore emerged as a\ncomplementary technique without the same limitations. To date, however, they\nhave failed to correct the dominant noise type in many quantum sensors, which\ncouples to each qubit in a sensor in the same way as the signal.

Most dictionary-based source separation algorithms rely\non iterative update rules during the run time, which becomes computationally\ncostly especially when we employ an overcomplete dictionary and sparse encoding\nthat tend to give better separation results. To avoid such cost we propose a\nbitwise scheme on hashed spectra that leads to an efficient posterior\nprobability calculation. For each source, the algorithm uses a partial rank\norder metric to extract robust features that form a binarized dictionary of\nhashed spectra. Then, for a mixture spectrum, its hash code is compared with\neach source's hashed dictionary in one pass. This simple voting-based\ndictionary search allows a fast and iteration-free estimation of ratio masking\nat each bin of a signal spectrogram.

In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been\nperformed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,\ntheoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and\nnew theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations. Here,\nwe perform an experimental quantum simulation in a periodically modulated\nhexagonal lattice and show that anti-ferromagnetic correlations in a fermionic\nmany-body system can be reduced or enhanced or even switched to ferromagnetic\ncorrelations. We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the\ndescription of the many-body system by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a\nrenormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing the results to\nmeasurements in an equivalent static lattice. For near-resonant driving, the\nenhancement and sign reversal of correlations is explained by a microscopic\nmodel, in which the particle tunnelling and magnetic exchange energies can be\ncontrolled independently. In combination with the observed sufficiently long\nlifetime of correlations, Floquet engineering thus constitutes an alternative\nroute to experimentally investigate unconventional pairing in strongly\ncorrelated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 17:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 09:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

While an early XMM-Newton study\nsuggested the emission was mainly from NGC 6921, the superior spatial\nresolution of NuSTAR above 10 keV resolves the Swift/BAT emission into two\nsources associated with the nearby galaxies MCG +04-48-002 and NGC 6921 (z =\n0.014) with a projected separation of 25.3 kpc (91\"). NuSTAR's sensitivity\nabove 10 keV finds both are heavily obscured to Compton-thick levels (N\nH=(1-2)x10^24 cm-2) and contribute equally to the BAT detection ({L}10-50\n{keV}{{int}}= 6x10^42 erg s-1). The observed luminosity of both sources is\nseverely diminished in the 2-10 keV band, illustrating the importance of >10\nkeV surveys like those with NuSTAR and Swift/BAT. Compared to archival X-ray\ndata, MCG +04-48-002 shows significant variability (>3) between observations.\nDespite being bright X-ray AGNs, they are difficult to detect using optical\nemission-line diagnostics because MCG +04-48-002 is identified as a\nstarburst/composite because of the high rates of star formation from a luminous\ninfrared galaxy while NGC 6921 is only classified as a LINER using line\ndetection limits. SWIFT J2028.5+2543 is the first dual AGN resolved above 10\nkeV and is the second most heavily obscured dual AGN discovered to date in the\nX-rays other than NGC 6240.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

In order to address this challenge, two notions of\npartial entropy production have been introduced in the literature as a way to\nassign an entropy production to an observed subsystem: one due to Shiraishi and\nSagawa [Phys.

Of course, such a constant wave can ultimately last\nonly the duration of its enveloping wave packet. However, as a unique feature\nof this paper, we assume the source is sufficiently steady to be capable of\nemitting wave packets, or pulses, of size much larger than the separation\nbetween sender and receiver. Therefore, if a pre-existing and enduring wave\nenvelope already connects the two sides, the subluminal nature of the\nenvelope's group velocity will no longer slow down the communication, which is\nnow limited by the speed at which information encoded as phase modulation\npropagates through the plasma, i.e. the phase velocity $v_p > c$.

Let $\\nu(u,v)$ denote the maximum number of edge-disjoint odd\n$(u,v)$-trails, and $\\tau(u,v)$ denote the minimum size of an edge-set that\nintersects every odd $(u,v)$-trail.\n  We prove that $\\tau(u,v)\\leq 2\\nu(u,v)+1$.

Video summarization alleviates this issue to\nsome extent, shortening a video based on the desired length of a summary as an\ninput variable. But an optimal length of a summarized video is often not\navailable in advance. Moreover, the user cannot edit the summary once it is\nproduced, limiting its practical applications. We argue that video\nsummarization should be an interactive, mixed-initiative process in which users\nhave control over the summarization procedure while algorithms help users\nachieve their goal via video understanding. In this paper, we introduce\nElasticPlay, a mixed-initiative approach that combines an advanced video\nsummarization technique with direct interface manipulation to help users\ncontrol the video summarization process. Users can specify a time budget for\nthe remaining content while watching a video; our system then immediately\nupdates the playback plan using our proposed cut-and-forward algorithm,\ndetermining which parts to skip or to fast-forward. This interactive process\nallows users to fine-tune the summarization result with immediate feedback. We\nshow that our system outperforms existing video summarization techniques on the\nTVSum50 dataset. We also report two lab studies (22 participants) and a\nMechanical Turk deployment study (60 participants), and show that the\nparticipants responded favorably to ElasticPlay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 00:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach, policy\niteration algorithm, is used to create an infinite horizon problem formulation\nto calculate optimal power distribution policies for the vehicle. The developed\nSDP strategy distributes the demanded power, between the front and rear IWMs by\nconsidering states of the vehicle, including the vehicle speed and the front\nand the rear wheels' slip ratios. In addition, a skid avoidance rule is added\nto the power management strategy to maintain the wheels' slip ratios within the\ndesired values. Undesirable slip ratios cause poor brake and traction control\nperformances and therefore should be avoided. The resulting strategy consists\nof a time- invariant, rule-based controller which is fast enough for real-time\nimplementations, and additionally, it is not expensive to be launched since the\nfuture power demand is approximated without a need to vehicle communication\nsystems or telemetric capability. A high-fidelity model of an IWM-EV is\ndeveloped in the Autonomie/Simulink environment for evaluating the proposed\nstrategy. The simulation results show that the proposed SDP strategy is more\nefficient in comparison to some benchmark strategies, such as an equal power\ndistribution (ED) and generalized rule- based dynamic programming (GRDP). The\nsimulation results of different driving scenarios for the considered IWM-EV\nshows the proposed power management strategy leads to considerable energy\nconsumption reduction in average, at no additional cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 00:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

This is due to the fact that in coastal regions convection is\noften supported by meso-scale land-sea interactions and the topography of\ncoastal areas. As these effects are not resolved and not included in standard\ncumulus parametrization schemes, coastal convection is among the most poorly\nsimulated phenomena in global models. To outline a possible parametrization\nframework for coastal convection we develop an idealized modeling approach and\ntest its ability to capture the main characteristics of coastal convection. The\nnew approach first develops a decision algorithm, or trigger function, for the\nexistence of coastal convection. The function is then applied in a stochastic\ncloud model to increase the occurrence probability of deep convection when\nland-sea interactions are diagnosed to be important. The results suggest that\nthe combination of the trigger function with a stochastic model is able to\ncapture the occurrence of deep convection in atmospheric conditions often found\nfor coastal convection. When coastal effects are deemed to be present the\nspatial and temporal organization of clouds that has been documented form\nobservations is well captured by the model. The presented modeling approach has\ntherefore potential to improve the representation of clouds and convection in\nglobal numerical weather forecasting and climate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 01:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 11:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 13:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 06:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

In this regard, local breakout is a promising solution\nto save core network load and, more importantly, to reduce end-to-end (e2e)\ndelay of packets with local significance. However, the capacity of local\nbreakout link is limited, resulting in excessive delay when the traffic load\nthrough the local link is high. Therefore, the decision on whether the traffic\nflows should be transmitted through core network or by local breakout link has\ngreat practical significance. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel\nlocal breakout framework to deliver low e2e delay packets with local\nsignificance. A real-time local breakout rule based on the solution to a Markov\ndecision process is given, showing that some packets with local significance\nshould pass through core network rather than being delivered by local breakout\nlink to meet the delay requirements.

These logs, once fully analyzed and\ncorrelated, can produce detailed information about the system health, root\ncauses of failures, and analyze an application's interactions with the system,\nproviding valuable insights to domain scientists and system administrators.\nHowever, processing HPC logs requires a deep understanding of hardware and\nsoftware components at multiple layers of the system stack. Moreover, most log\ndata is unstructured and voluminous, making it more difficult for system users\nand administrators to manually inspect the data. With rapid increases in the\nscale and complexity of HPC systems, log data processing is becoming a big data\nchallenge. This paper introduces a HPC log data analytics framework that is\nbased on a distributed NoSQL database technology, which provides scalability\nand high availability, and the Apache Spark framework for rapid in-memory\nprocessing of the log data. The analytics framework enables the extraction of a\nrange of information about the system so that system administrators and end\nusers alike can obtain necessary insights for their specific needs.

Six of them are\nindividually detected (within 10\") in deep 0.75\" resolution VLA 3GHz imaging,\nwith S(3GHz)>8uJy. Of the six, AGN likely affects the radio emission in two\ngalaxies while star formation is the dominant source powering the remaining\nfour. We searched for cluster candidates over the full COSMOS 2-square degree\nfield using radio-detected 3GHz sources and looking for peaks in Sigma5 density\nmaps. ClJ1001 is the strongest overdensity by far with >10sigma, with a simple\nz_phot>1.5 preselection. A cruder photometric rejection of z<1 radio\nforegrounds leaves ClJ1001 as the second strongest overdensity, while even\nusing all radio sources ClJ1001 remains among the four strongest projected\noverdensities. We conclude that there are great prospects for future, deep and\nwide-area radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation of\nforming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures widespread star\nformation and AGN activity of massive galaxy cluster members, residing within\nthe inner cluster core, will ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the\nmost effective means for their identification, with detection rates expected in\nthe ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at z>2.5.

We use these\ninequalities to develop an efficient (relaxed) ALP decoder for general\n(non-SPC) linear codes over prime fields. The key ingredient is an efficient\nseparation algorithm based on the principle of dynamic programming.\nFurthermore, we construct a decoder for linear codes over arbitrary fields\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q=p^m$ and $m>1$ by a factor graph representation that\nreduces to several instances of the case $m=1$, which results, in general, in a\nrelaxation of the original decoding polytope. Finally, we present an efficient\ncut-generating algorithm to search for redundant parity-checks to further\nimprove the performance towards maximum-likelihood decoding for short-to-medium\nblock lengths. Numerical experiments confirm that our new decoder is very\nefficient compared to a static LP decoder for various field sizes, check-node\ndegrees, and block lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 11:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 10:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

In this paper, we present\nexperiments and theory on viscous flow in a simple bioinspired soft valve which\nillustrate essential features of interactions between hydrodynamic and elastic\nforces at low Reynolds numbers. The setup comprises a sphere connected to a\nspring located inside a tapering cylindrical channel. The spring is aligned\nwith the central axis of the channel and a pressure drop is applied across the\nsphere, thus forcing the liquid through the narrow gap between the sphere and\nthe channel walls. The sphere's equilibrium position is determined by a balance\nbetween spring and hydrodynamic forces. Since the gap thickness changes with\nthe sphere's position, the system has a pressure-dependent hydraulic\nresistance. This leads to a non-linear relation between applied pressure and\nflow rate: flow initially increases with pressure, but decreases when the\npressure exceeds a certain critical value as the gap closes. To rationalize\nthese observations, we propose a mathematical model that reduced the complexity\nof the flow to a two-dimensional lubrication approximation.

We present\na method to address this issue, and learn object detectors incrementally, when\nneither the original training data nor annotations for the original classes in\nthe new training set are available.

These\nmodels are used to fit empirical data for 15 low-mass stars for which precise\nmasses and radii have been measured. We show that our 10 kG magneto-convective\nmodels can replicate the empirical radii and effective temperatures for 14 of\nthe stars. In the case of the remaining star (in the Praesepe cluster), two\ndifferent solutions have been reported in the literature. We find that one of\nthese solutions (by Gillen et al. 2017) can be fitted well with our model using\nthe nominal age of Praesepe (800 Myr). However, the second solution (by Kraus\net al. 2017) cannot be fitted unless the star's age is assumed to be much\nyounger (~ 150 Myr).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 14:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

The force-velocity relationship\nquantitatively summarizes the nature of this process. By a stochastic dynamical\nmodel, we give, together with the evolution of a staggered bundle of $N_f$\nrigid living filaments facing a loaded wall, the corresponding force--velocity\nrelationship. We compute systematically the simplified evolution of the model\nin supercritical conditions $\\rho_1=U_0/W_0>1$ at $\\epsilon=d^2W_0/D=0$, where\n$d$ is the monomer size, $D$ is the obstacle diffusion coefficient, $U_0$ and\n$W_0$ are the polymerization and depolymerization rates.

We consider two classical protocols: the bundle is opposed\neither to a constant load or to an optical trap set-up, characterized by a\nharmonic restoring force. The constant force case leads, for each $F$ value, to\na stationary velocity $V^{stat}(F;N_f,\\rho_1)$ after a relaxation with\ncharacteristic time $\\tau_{micro}(F)$. When the bundle (initially taken as an\nassembly of filament seeds) is subjected to a harmonic restoring force (optical\ntrap load), the bundle elongates and the load increases up to stalling\n(equilibrium) over a characteristic time $\\tau^{OT}$.

The key idea in EZ-AG is to introduce a\ntoken that performs a self-repelling random walk in the network and aggregates\ninformation from nodes when they are visited for the first time. A\nself-repelling random walk of a token on a graph is one in which at each step,\nthe token moves to a neighbor that has been visited least often. While\nself-repelling random walks visit all nodes in the network much faster than\nplain random walks, they tend to slow down when most of the nodes are already\nvisited. In this paper, we show that a single step push phase at each node can\nsignificantly speed up the aggregation and eliminate this slow down. By doing\nso, EZ-AG achieves aggregation in only O(N) time and messages. In terms of\noverhead, EZ-AG outperforms existing structure-free data aggregation by a\nfactor of at least log(N) and achieves the lower bound for aggregation message\noverhead. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of EZ-AG using ns-3\nsimulations in networks ranging from 100 to 4000 nodes under different mobility\nmodels and node speeds. We also describe a hierarchical extension for EZ-AG\nthat can produce multi-resolution aggregates at each node using only O(NlogN)\nmessages, which is a poly-logarithmic factor improvement over existing\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

This intent system has been developed to take into account\nthe psychology behind what pedestrians are familiar with and what they expect\nfrom machines. The system integrates those expectations into the design of\nphysical systems and mathematical algorithms. The goal of the system is to\nensure that communication is simple, yet effective without leaving pedestrians\nwith a sense of distrust in autonomous vehicles. To validate the ICS, two types\nof experiments have been run: field tests with an autonomous vehicle to\ndetermine how humans actually interact with the ICS and simulations to account\nfor multiple potential behaviors.The results from both experiments show that\nhumans react positively and more predictably when the intent of the vehicle is\ncommunicated compared to when the intent of the vehicle is unknown. In\nparticular, the results from the simulation specifically showed a 142 percent\ndifference between the pedestrian's trust in the vehicle's actions when the ICS\nis enabled and the pedestrian has prior knowledge of the vehicle than when the\nICS is not enabled and the pedestrian having no prior knowledge of the vehicle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

However, we were able to come up with an\nefficient method of improving the seller revenue by mainly focusing on\nadjusting the reserve price for those high-value inventories. Previously, no\ndedicated work has been performed from this perspective. Inspired by Paul and\nMichael, our model first identifies the value of the inventory by predicting\nthe top bid price bucket using a cascade of classifiers.

The proposed\napproach, called Non-Surjective Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders (NS-FAIDs),\nexploits the robustness of message-passing LDPC decoders to inaccuracies in the\ncalculation of exchanged messages, and it is shown to provide a unified\nframework for several designs previously proposed in the literature. NS-FAIDs\nare optimized by density evolution for regular and irregular LDPC codes, and\nare shown to provide different trade-offs between hardware complexity and\ndecoding performance. Two hardware architectures targeting high-throughput\napplications are also proposed, integrating both Min-Sum (MS) and NS-FAID\ndecoding kernels. ASIC post synthesis implementation results on 65nm CMOS\ntechnology show that NS-FAIDs yield significant improvements in the throughput\nto area ratio, by up to 58.75% with respect to the MS decoder, with even better\nor only slightly degraded error correction performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 09:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

The digitized 8 bits/pixel are\nraw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy\nfringe-patterns store much less Shannon information than the capacity of the\ndigitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras may\nwaste to noise most bits/pixel. For example one would not use smartphone\ncameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images.\nHowever smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we\nshow here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its\n(S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy\nH, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images\nmay be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information\nphase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in\nspite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are\nredundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and\ndata compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage.\nShannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression\nalgorithms. Here we show that phase-modulated phase-shifted fringes are highly\ncorrelated, and as a consequence, phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be used\nas fringe-data compressors. Therefore a PSA may compress a large number of\nphase-shifted fringes into a single complex-valued image. This is important in\nspaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by\nhuge distance and low-power downlink. That is, instead of transmitting M\nphase-shifted fringes, one only transmit the phase-demodulated signal as\ncompressed sensing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 18:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 21:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}
