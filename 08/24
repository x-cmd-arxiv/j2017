Until relatively recently, tabling has required either low-level\nsupport in the underlying Prolog engine, or extensive program transormation (de\nGuzman et al., 2008). An alternative approach is to augment Prolog with low\nlevel support for continuation capturing control operators, particularly\ndelimited continuations, which have been investigated in the field of\nfunctional programming and found to be capable of supporting a wide variety of\ncomputational effects within an otherwise declarative language.\n  This technical report describes an implementation of tabling in SWI Prolog\nbased on delimited control operators for Prolog recently introduced by\nSchrijvers et al. (2013). In comparison with a previous implementation of\ntabling for SWI Prolog using delimited control (Desouter et al., 2015), this\napproach, based on the functional memoising parser combinators of Johnson\n(1995), stays closer to the declarative core of Prolog, requires less code, and\nis able to deliver solutions from systems of tabled predicates incrementally\n(as opposed to finding all solutions before delivering any to the rest of the\nprogram).\n  A collection of benchmarks shows that a small number of carefully targeted\noptimisations yields performance within a factor of about 2 of the optimised\nversion of Desouter et al.'s system currently included in SWI Prolog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 16:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 08:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

The latter represents the distance between two infinitesimally\nclose states, and its superextensive size scaling witnesses a critical\nbehaviour due to a phase transition, since all the interaction terms are\nextensive. Perturbatively in the noise strength, we found superextensive Fisher\ninformation at anisotropy $|\\Delta|\\leqslant1$ and irrational\n$\\frac{\\arccos\\Delta}{\\pi}$ irrespective of the order of two non-commuting\nlimits, i.e. the thermodynamic limit and the limit of sending\n$\\frac{\\arccos\\Delta}{\\pi}$ to an irrational number via a sequence of rational\napproximants.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to address numerous\nquestions in astrophysics and cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and\nphotometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to study gas and dust along the\nlines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral\ncontinuum of SNe Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust\nalong the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which occurred in an unusual location, in\na tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods. Using a\ntime-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption features for variations in time, which would be indicative for\ncircumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore, we take advantage of the well known\nphotometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to dust along the\nline-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we\ndetermine that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS\nmedium of iPTF16abc. While the Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be\noptically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points to a small column of\ninterstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight to\niPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwithin a galaxy. It suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally\nstripped during an interaction of NGC 5221 with one of its neighbouring\ngalaxies in the past $\\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds could\nbecome the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds\nmight diffuse, enriching the circum-galactic medium (CGM) with metals. The gas\nprofile along the line-of-sight should be useful for future studies of the\ndynamics of the galaxy group containing NGC 5221.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 18:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Such EPDs involve the\ncoalescence of Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves in CROWs, without the presence of gain\nand loss, which is in contrast to the requirement of Parity-Time (PT) symmetry\nto develop exceptional points based on gain and loss balance. The EPDs arise\nhere by introducing symmetry breaking in a conventional chain of coupled\nresonators through coupling the chain of resonators to an adjacent uniform\noptical waveguide, which leads to unique modal characteristics that cannot be\nrealized in conventional CROWs. Such remarkable characteristics include high\nquality factors (Q-factor) and strong field enhancement, even without any\nmirrors at the two ends of a cavity. We show for the first time the capability\nof CROWs to exhibit EPDs of various order; including the degenerate band edge\n(DBE) and the stationary inflection point (SIP). The proposed CROW of finite\nlength shows enhanced quality factor when operating near the DBE, and the\nQ-factor exhibits an anomalous scaling with the CROW's length. We develop the\ntheory of EPDs in such unconventional CROW using coupled-wave equations, and we\nderive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation.

The level of thermal X-ray emission is a direct measure of the density of\nthe circumstellar medium (CSM), and the absence of X-ray emission from Type Ia\nSNe has been interpreted as a sign of a very low density CSM. In this paper, we\nreport late-time (500--800 days after discovery) X-ray detections of SN 2012ca\nin {\\it Chandra} data. The presence of hydrogen in the initial spectrum led to\na classification of Type Ia-CSM, ostensibly making it the first SN~Ia detected\nwith X-rays. Our analysis of the X-ray data favors an asymmetric medium, with a\nhigh-density component which supplies the X-ray emission. The data suggest a\nnumber density $> 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the higher-density medium, which is\nconsistent with the large observed Balmer decrement if it arises from\ncollisional excitation. This is high compared to most core-collapse SNe, but it\nmay be consistent with densities suggested for some Type IIn or superluminous\nSNe. If SN 2012ca is a thermonuclear SN, the large CSM density could imply\nclumps in the wind, or a dense torus or disk, consistent with the\nsingle-degenerate channel. A remote possibility for a core-degenerate channel\ninvolves a white dwarf merging with the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant\nbranch star shortly before the explosion, leading to a common envelope around\nthe SN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 20:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Waveform inversion-based image reconstruction methods account for\nhigher order diffraction effects and can produce high-resolution USCT images,\nbut are computationally demanding. Recently, a source encoding technique was\ncombined with stochastic gradient descent to greatly reduce image\nreconstruction times. However, this method bundles the stochastic data fidelity\nterm with the deterministic regularization term. This limitation can be\novercome by replacing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a structured\noptimization method, such as the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that\nexploits knowledge of the composition of the cost function. In this work, the\ndual averaging method is combined with source encoding techniques to improve\nthe effectiveness of regularization while maintaining the reduced\nreconstruction times afforded by source encoding. It is demonstrated that each\niteration can be decomposed into a gradient descent step based on the data\nfidelity term and a proximal update step corresponding to the regularization\nterm. Furthermore, the regularization term is never explicitly differentiated,\nallowing non-smooth regularization penalties to be naturally incorporated. The\nwave equation is solved by use of a time-domain method. The effectiveness of\nthis approach is demonstrated through computer-simulation and experimental\nstudies. The results suggest that the dual averaging method can produce images\nwith less noise and comparable resolution to those obtained by use of\nstochastic gradient descent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 00:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

One popular BLR model is the disk-wind model that\noffers a geometric unification of a quasar based on the angle of viewing. We\nconstruct a simple kinematical disk-wind model with a narrow outflowing wind\nangle. The model is combined with radiative transfer in the Sobolev, or high\nvelocity, limit. We examine how angle of viewing affects the observed\ncharacteristics of the emission line, especially the line widths and velocity\noffsets. The line profiles exhibit distinct properties depending on the\norientation, wind opening angle, and region of the wind where the emission\narises.\n  At low inclination angle (close to face-on), we find the shape of the\nemission line is asymmetric with narrow width and significantly blueshifted. As\nthe inclination angle increases (close to edge-on), the line profile becomes\nmore symmetric, broader, and less blueshifted. Additionally, lines that arise\nclose to the base of the disk wind, near the accretion disk, tend to be broad\nand symmetric. The relative increase in blueshift of the emission line with\nincreasing wind vertical distance is larger for polar winds compared with\nequatorial winds. By considering the optical thickness of the wind,\nsingle-peaked line profiles are recovered for the intermediate and equatorial\noutflowing wind. The model is able to reproduce a faster response in either the\nred and blue sides of the line profile found in reverberation mapping studies.\nA quicker response in the red side is achieved in the model with a polar wind\nand intermediate wind opening angle at low viewing angle. The blue side\nresponse is faster for an equatorial wind seen at high inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 00:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

We show that, for a given threshold on the approximation error, the\nrequired number of boundary facets to approximate a general smooth boundary\ngrows exponentially with the dimension of the data, and thus the number of\nboundary facets, referred to as boundary resolution, of a PWL classifier is an\nimportant quality measure that can be used to estimate a lower bound on the\nclassification errors. However, learning naively an exponentially large number\nof boundary facets requires the determination of an exponentially large number\nof parameters and also requires an exponentially large number of training\npatterns. To overcome this issue of \"curse of dimensionality\", compressive\nrepresentations of high resolution classifier boundaries are required. To show\nthe superior compressive power of deep rectifier networks over shallow\nrectifier networks, we prove that the maximum boundary resolution of a single\nhidden layer rectifier network classifier grows exponentially with the number\nof units when this number is smaller than the dimension of the patterns. When\nthe number of units is larger than the dimension of the patterns, the growth\nrate is reduced to a polynomial order. Consequently, the capacity of generating\na high resolution boundary will increase if the same large number of units are\narranged in multiple layers instead of a single hidden layer. Taking high\ndimensional spherical boundaries as examples, we show how deep rectifier\nnetworks can utilize geometric symmetries to approximate a boundary with the\nsame accuracy but with a significantly fewer number of parameters than single\nhidden layer nets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 01:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

Existing\ntensor clustering methods either fail to account for the dynamic nature of the\ndata, or are inapplicable to a general-order tensor. Also there is often a gap\nbetween statistical guarantee and computational efficiency for existing tensor\nclustering solutions. In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a\nnew dynamic tensor clustering method, which takes into account both sparsity\nand fusion structures, and enjoys strong statistical guarantees as well as high\ncomputational efficiency. Our proposal is based upon a new structured tensor\nfactorization that encourages both sparsity and smoothness in parameters along\nthe specified tensor modes. Computationally, we develop a highly efficient\noptimization algorithm that benefits from substantial dimension reduction. In\ntheory, we first establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the estimator from\nthe structured tensor factorization. Built upon this error bound, we then\nderive the rate of convergence of the estimated cluster centers, and show that\nthe estimated clusters recover the true cluster structures with a high\nprobability. Moreover, our proposed method can be naturally extended to\nco-clustering of multiple modes of the tensor data.

Because\ngenerally no analytic solution exists to these equations, researchers rely on\nnumerical methods which are prone to various errors. In an effort to mitigate\nthese errors, powerful symplectic integrators have been employed. But\nsymplectic integrators can be severely limited because they are not compatible\nwith adaptive stepping and thus they have difficulty accommodating changing\ntime and length scales. A promising alternative is time-reversible integration,\nwhich can handle adaptive time stepping, but the errors due to time-reversible\nintegration in astrophysics are less understood.

Second, deep neural networks can be used to automatically\ncombine input features, and including non-local features that capture semantic\npatterns that cannot be expressed using discrete indicator features.

Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim\nof one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the\nopponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by\nattackers by occupying selected vertices.

Departing from the\nanalysis of the numerical renormalization group flows, we build a general\nequivalence between the higher-dimensional ground state and a one-dimensional\n(1D) quantum state defined in the imaginary time direction in terms of the\nso-called time matrix product state (tMPS). We show that the criticality of the\ntargeted model can be faithfully identified by the tMPS, using the mature\nscaling schemes of correlation length and entanglement entropy in 1D quantum\ntheories. We benchmark our proposal with the results obtained for the\nHeisenberg anti-ferromagnet on honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate critical\nscaling relation of the tMPS for the gapless case, and a trivial scaling for\nthe gapped case with spatial anisotropy. The critical scaling behaviors are\ninsensitive to the system size, suggesting the criticality can be identified in\nsmall systems. Our tMPS scheme for critical scaling shows clearly that the\nspin-1/2 kagom\\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a gapless ground state. More\ngenerally, the present study indicates that the 1D conformal field theories in\nimaginary time provide a very useful tool to characterize the criticality of\nhigher dimensional quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 06:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

In this paper, we describe the\nease.ml architecture and focus on a novel technical problem introduced by\nease.ml regarding resource allocation. We ask, as a \"service provider\" that\nmanages a shared cluster of machines among all our users running machine\nlearning workloads, what is the resource allocation strategy that maximizes the\nglobal satisfaction of all our users?\n  Resource allocation is a critical yet subtle issue in this multi-tenant\nscenario, as we have to balance between efficiency and fairness. We first\nformalize the problem that we call multi-tenant model selection, aiming for\nminimizing the total regret of all users running automatic model selection\ntasks. We then develop a novel algorithm that combines multi-armed bandits with\nBayesian optimization and prove a regret bound under the multi-tenant setting.\nFinally, we report our evaluation of ease.ml on synthetic data and on one\nservice we are providing to our users, namely, image classification with deep\nneural networks. Our experimental evaluation results show that our proposed\nsolution can be up to 9.8x faster in achieving the same global quality for all\nusers as the two popular heuristics used by our users before ease.ml.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 08:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

In\nrecent times, several theoretical and experimental works have been reported for\ndemonstrating the joint weak value of two observables where the coupling\nstrength is restricted to the second order. In this paper, we extend such a\nformulation by providing a complete treatment of joint weak measurement\nscenario for all-order-coupling for the observable satisfying $A^2=\\mathbb{I}$\nand $A^2=A$, which allows us to reveal several hitherto unexplored features. By\nconsidering the probe state to be discrete as well as continuous variable, we\ndemonstrate how the joint weak value can be inferred for any given strength of\nthe coupling. A particularly interesting result we pointed out that even if the\ninitial pointer state is uncorrelated, the single pointer displacement can\nprovide the information about the joint weak value, if at least third order of\nthe coupling is taken into account. As an application of our scheme, we provide\nan all-order-coupling treatment of the well-known Hardy paradox by considering\nthe continuous as well as discrete meter states and show how the negative joint\nweak probabilities emerge in the quantum paradoxes at the weak coupling limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 09:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

The pair-wise approach for\nbi-partite ranking construct a quadratic number of pairs to solve the problem,\nwhich is infeasible for large-scale data sets. The point-wise approach, albeit\nmore efficient, often results in inferior performance. That is, it is difficult\nto conduct bipartite ranking accurately and efficiently at the same time. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel active sampling scheme within the pair-wise\napproach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. The scheme is inspired from\nactive learning and can reach a competitive ranking performance while focusing\nonly on a small subset of the many pairs during training. Moreover, we propose\na general Combined Ranking and Classification (CRC) framework to accurately\nconduct bipartite ranking. The framework unifies point-wise and pair-wise\napproaches and is simply based on the idea of treating each instance point as a\npseudo-pair. Experiments on 14 real-word large-scale data sets demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm of Active Sampling within CRC, when coupled with a\nlinear Support Vector Machine, usually outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise\nand pair-wise ranking approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 09:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

The main task of\nMMEP is to determine the optimal sizing, type selection, and installation time\nof distributed energy resources (DER) in microgrid. In the proposed\nformulation, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is applied to hedge against\nnon-random uncertainties of long-term demand growth. Then, chance constraints\nare imposed in the operational stage to address the random uncertainties of\nhourly renewable energy generation and load variation. The objective of chance\nconstrained information gap decision model is to maximize the robustness level\nof DER investment meanwhile satisfying a set of operational constraints with a\nhigh probability. The integration of IGDT and chance constrained program,\nhowever, makes it very challenging to compute.

This\nstudy suggests a simple approach for modeling water networks and diseases, and\napplies this method to a dataset of self-reported gastrointestinal conditions\nfrom a questionnaire-based population health survey in central Norway.\n  Method: Our approach is based on a standard conditional autoregressive (CAR)\nmodel. An inverse matrix was constructed, with nodes weighted based on the\ndistance to neighboring nodes within the networks. This matrix was then fitted\nas a generic model. To illustrate its possible use, we utilized data taken from\na questionnaire-based population health survey, the HUNT Study, to measure\nself-reported gastrointestinal complaints. For hypothesis testing, we used the\ndeviance information criterion (DIC) and included variables in a stepwise\nmanner.\n  Results: The full model converged after six hours. We found no relation\nbetween the water networks and the health conditions of people whose residences\nconnected to different parts of the network in the geographical area studied.\n  Conclusion: All water network models are simplifications of the real\nnetworks. Nevertheless, we suggest a valid approach for distinguishing between\nthe general spatial effect and the water network using a generic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 11:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 07:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

Benefiting form such novel formulations, computing\nsensitivity of the self-supporting constraint with respect to the design\ndensity is straightforward, which otherwise would require lots of research\nefforts in general topology optimization studies. The derived sensitivity for\neach element is only linearly dependent on its sole density, which, different\nfrom previous layer-based sensitivities, consequently allows for a parallel\nimplementation and possible higher convergence rate. In addition, a discrete\nconvolution operator is also designed to detect the unsupported elements as\ninvolved in each step of optimization iteration, and improves the detection\nprocess 100 times as compared with simply enumerating these elements. The\napproach works for cases of general overhang angle, or general domain, and\nproduces an optimized structures, and their associated optimal compliance, very\nclose to that of the reference structure obtained without considering the\nself-supporting constraint, as demonstrated by extensive 2D and 3D benchmark\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 11:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

Considering a linear convolution\nmodel, as opposed to the standard circular convolution model, we derive a\nsufficient condition for stable deconvolution. The columns of the linear\nconvolution matrix form a Riesz basis with the tightness of the Riesz bounds\ndetermined by the autocorrelation of the blur kernel. Employing a Bayesian\nframework results in a non-convex, non-smooth cost function consisting of an\n$\\ell_2$ data-fidelity term and a sparsity promoting $\\ell_p$-norm ($0 \\le p\n\\le 1$) regularizer.

We establish a complexity\ndichotomy with respect to both the maximum degree and the level-width, that is,\nthe maximum number of vertices that share a level. Our study of Ordered Level\nPlanarity is motivated by connections to several other graph drawing problems.\n  Geodesic Planarity asks for a planar drawing of a graph such that vertices\nare placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is\nrealized as a polygonal path composed of line segments with two adjacent\ndirections from a given set $S$ of directions symmetric with respect to the\norigin.

The K2\nMission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision photometric\ntime series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However, bright targets\nrequire a large number of pixels to capture the entirety of the stellar flux,\nand bandwidth restrictions limit the number and brightness of stars that can be\nobserved. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric technique, that\nwe call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars using a limited number of\npixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and does not require extensive pixel\nallocation, and will allow us to use K2 and other photometric missions, such as\nTESS, to observe very bright stars for asteroseismology and to search for\ntransiting exoplanets. We apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the\nPleiades open cluster. Each star exhibits variability; six of the stars show\nwhat are most-likely slowly pulsating B-star (SPB) pulsations, with amplitudes\nranging from 20 to 2000 ppm. For the star Maia, we demonstrate the utility of\ncombining K2 photometry with spectroscopy and interferometry to show that it is\nnot a 'Maia variable', and to establish that its variability is caused by\nrotational modulation of a large chemical spot on a 10 d time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

One\ncommon way to assess similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided\ninto spike-resolved, such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance,\nand time-resolved, e.g. the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance.\n  New Method: We use independent steady-rate Poisson processes as surrogates\nfor spike trains with fixed rate and no timing information to address two basic\nquestions: How does the sensitivity of the different spike train distances to\ntemporal coding depend on the rates of the two processes and how do the\ndistances deal with very low rates?\n  Results: Spike-resolved distances always contain rate information even for\nparameters indicating time coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates\nbut beneficial for very low rates. In contrast, the operational range for\ndetecting time coding of time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates,\nbut these measures produce artefacts at very low rates.

Using small simulation systems during prior research, we\ninitially studied the evolution of both electron-proton and electron-positron\nrelativistic jets containing helical magnetic fields, by focusing on their\ninteractions with an ambient plasma. Here, using larger jet radii, we have\nperformed simulations of global jets containing helical magnetic fields in\norder to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such\nas the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI) and\nthe Mushroom instability (MI). We found that the evolution of global jets\nstrongly depends on the size of the jet radius. For example, phase bunching of\njet electrons, in particular in the electron-proton jet, is mixed with larger\njet radius due to the more complicated structures of magnetic fields with\nexcited kinetic instabilities. In our simulation study these kinetic\ninstabilities lead to new types of instabilities in global jets. In the\nelectron-proton jet simulation a modified recollimation occurs and jet\nelectrons are strongly perturbed. In the electron-positron jet simulation mixed\nkinetic instabilities occur at early times followed by a turbulence-like\nstructure. Simulations using much larger (and longer) systems are further\nrequired in order to thoroughly investigate the evolution of global jets\ncontaining helical magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 19:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

To\ndemonstrate the utility of B\\'{e}zier projection for both geometry and material\nlocking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko beams and\nvolumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the\napproach can be applied generally to other types of locking phenemona as well.\nB\\'{e}zier projection is a local projection technique with optimal\napproximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are\ncomparable to global $L^2$ projection.

Our study revealed that the\nproposed Bi-CNN outperforms the random forest and the support vector machine\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 12:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 16:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 22:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

We show that cancellation of multipole moments of the same kind\nlead to almost zero radiation losses due to the counter-directed multipolar\nmoments in metamolecule. . Nullifying of multipoles, mainly dipoles and\nsuppression of higher multipoles results in ideal transmission of incident wave\nthrough the designed metamaterial. The observed effect could pave the road to\nnew generation of light-manipulating transparent metadevices such as filters,\nwaveguides, cloaks and more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 16:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

What single concept of law is encompassed in its encoding in\nscientific, judicial, and customary forms? Since understandings of law can be\nculture specific, what concept of law is common across social systems? This\npaper will develop a definition of law--and a way to measure the binding power\nof a law or legal system--that is applicable across forms and civilizations. In\ndeveloping the definition, the paper will demonstrate that a QBist\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics can serve as a Rosetta Stone which allows us\nto reconcile Western and non-Western scientific systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 13:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 18:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}
