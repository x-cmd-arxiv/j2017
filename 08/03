The hard squares are (i) confined between soft repulsive walls with\nsquare symmetry, or (ii) exposed to external potentials that mimic the presence\nof obstacles with circular, square, rectangular or triangular symmetries. For\nthe first case the final equilibrium profile of a well commensurated cavity\nconsists of a crystal phase with highly localized particles in concentric\nsquare layers at the nodes of a slightly deformed square lattice. We\ncharacterize the growth dynamics of the crystal phase by quantifying the\ninterlayer and intralayer fluxes and the non-monotonicity of the former, the\nsaturation time, and other dynamical quantities. The interlayer fluxes are much\nmore monotonic in time, and dominant for poorly commensurated cavities, while\nthe opposite is true for well commensurated cells: although smaller, the time\nevolution of interlayer fluxes are much more complex, presenting strongly\ndamped oscillations which dramatically increase the saturation time. We also\nstudy how the geometry of the obstacle affects the symmetry of the final\nequilibrium non-uniform phase (columnar vs. crystal). For obstacles with\nfourfold symmetry, (circular and square) the crystal is more stable, while the\ncolumnar phase is stabilized for obstacles without this symmetry (rectangular\nor triangular). We find that, in general, density waves of columnar symmetry\ngrow from the obstacle. However, additional particle localization along the\nwavefronts gives rise to a crystalline structure which is conserved for\ncircular and square obstacles, but destroyed for the other two obstacles where\ncolumnar symmetry is restored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 16:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Prior studies on exception handling aim to\nunderstand the practices of exception handling in its different components,\nsuch as the origin of the exceptions and the handling code of the exceptions.\nYet, the observed findings were scattered and diverse. In this paper, to\ncomplement prior research findings on exception handling, we study its features\nby enriching the knowledge of handling code with a flow analysis of exceptions.\nOur case study is conducted with over 10K exception handling blocks, and over\n77K related exception flows from 16 open-source Java and C# (.NET) libraries\nand applications. Our case study results show that each try block has up to 12\npossible potentially recoverable yet propagated exceptions. More importantly,\n22% of the distinct possible exceptions can be traced back to multiple methods\n(average of 1.39 and max of 34). Such results highlight the additional\nchallenge of composing quality exception handling code. To make it worse, we\nconfirm that there is a lack of documentation of the possible exceptions and\ntheir sources. However, such critical information can be identified by\nexception flow analysis on well- documented API calls (e.g., JRE and .NET\ndocumentation).

Incoherent nuclear DVCS, i.e. DVCS on a nucleon inside a nucleus, can\nreveal the 3D partonic structure of the bound nucleon and shed a new light on\nthe EMC effect. However, the Fermi motion of the struck nucleon, off-shell\neffects and final-state interactions (FSIs) complicate this parton level\ninterpretation. We propose here a measurement of incoherent DVCS with a tagging\nof the recoiling spectator system (nucleus A-1) to systematically control\nnuclear effects.

To achieve high-quality image compression at low bit rates, two\nCNNs are seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end compression framework. The\nfirst CNN, named compact convolutional neural network (ComCNN), learns an\noptimal compact representation from an input image, which preserves the\nstructural information and is then encoded using an image codec (e.g., JPEG,\nJPEG2000 or BPG). The second CNN, named reconstruction convolutional neural\nnetwork (RecCNN), is used to reconstruct the decoded image with high-quality in\nthe decoding end. To make two CNNs effectively collaborate, we develop a\nunified end-to-end learning algorithm to simultaneously learn ComCNN and\nRecCNN, which facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the decoded image\nusing RecCNN. Such a design also makes the proposed compression framework\ncompatible with existing image coding standards.

Estimation of latent parameters in these models has the potential to\nprovide highly desirable capabilities such as network self-calibration.\nConventional solutions to the problem pose difficulties in scaling with the\nnumber of sensors due to the joint multi-sensor filtering involved when\nevaluating the parameter likelihood.

In\naddition, we consider using separable likelihoods in the presence of many\nobjects and ambiguity in associating measurements with objects that originated\nthem. To this end, we use a state space model with a hypothesis based\nparameterisation, and, develop an empirical Bayesian perspective in order to\nevaluate separable likelihoods on this model using local filtering. Bayesian\ninference with this likelihood is carried out using belief propagation on the\nassociated pairwise Markov random field.

A total\nof 52 high-resolution spectra have been gathered over a decade. We use their\nanalysis, in combination with the photometric data from All Sky Automated\nSurvey and Hipparcos catalogues, to conclude that HD 64315 is composed of at\nleast two spectroscopic binaries, one of which is an eclipsing binary. HD 64315\ncontains two binary systems, one of which is an eclipsing binary. The two\nbinaries are separated by 0.09 arcsec (or 500 AU) if the most likely distance\nto the system, around 5 kpc, is considered. The presence of fainter companions\nis not excluded by current observations. The non-eclipsing binary (HD 64315\nAaAb) has a period of 2.70962901+/-0.00000021 d.

At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift\nSLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf\ngalaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important\nto the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest\ndistance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study\nGaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical\ncolor is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an\nSLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than\nGaia16apd. Thanks to the high signal-to-noise ratios of our spectra, we\nidentify several new spectroscopic features that may help to probe the\nproperties of these enigmatic explosions. We detect polarization at the ~0.5%\nlevel that is not strongly dependent on wavelength, suggesting a modest, global\ndeparture from spherical symmetry. In addition, we put the tightest upper limit\nyet on the radio luminosity of an SLSN-I with <5.4x10^26 erg/s/Hz (at 10 GHz),\nwhich is almost a factor of 40 better than previous upper limits and one of the\nfew measured at an early stage in the evolution of an SLSN-I. This limit\nlargely rules out an association of this SLSNe-I with known populations of\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) like central engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2017 15:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus\nentropy \"tuning fork\" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities\nfor hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead\nto a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.\nHowever, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the\npost-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result\nwe predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep\nincrease towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of\nlow-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an\nestimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas\naccretion rate can be estimated. Due to the \"core-mass effect\" planets that\nunderwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies.

It is known that these\nbiological molecular motors usually perform their cellular tasks by acting\ncollectively, and there are interactions between individual motors that specify\nthe overall collective behavior. One of the fundamental issues related to the\ncollective dynamics of motor proteins is the question if they function at\nstationary-state conditions. To investigate this problem, we analyze a\nrelaxation to the stationary state for the system of interacting molecular\nmotors. Our approach utilizes a recently developed theoretical framework, which\nviews the collective dynamics of motor proteins as a totally asymmetric simple\nexclusion process of interacting particles, where interactions are taken into\naccount via a thermodynamically consistent approach. The dynamics of relaxation\nto the stationary state is analyzed using a domain-wall method that relies on a\nmean-field description, which takes into account some correlations. It is found\nthat the system quickly relaxes for repulsive interactions, while attractive\ninteractions always slow down reaching the stationary state. It is also\npredicted that for some range of parameters the fastest relaxation might be\nachieved for a weak repulsive interaction. Our theoretical predictions are\ntested with Monte Carlo computer simulations. The implications of our findings\nfor biological systems are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 18:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We present results of target of\nopportunity observations with the H.E.S.S. experiment on this source over the\nnights around the peak of the outburst. The H.E.S.S. data were analysed with\nmono and stereo chains. Thanks to the extreme brightness of the source at GeV\nenergies, it was possible to obtain data from Fermi-LAT, strictly simultaneous\nto the H.E.S.S. observation. Simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations\nat optical and X-ray energies were gathered to reconstruct the multi-wavelength\nspectrum helping to constrain theoretical models describing the flare. The\nH.E.S.S. observation during the second night, using H.E.S.S. II MONO data, lead\nto a clear detection of the source in about 3 hours of live-time. The H.E.S.S.\nresults were also used to derive limits on the Quantum Gravity scale under the\nassumption of Lorentz Invariance Violation. Furthermore, since FSRQs possess\nintense optical photon fields surrounding the central region near the black\nhole, the VHE data allows constraints on the location of the emitting region to\nbe derived in order that internal absorption be avoided. The detection of VHE\nemission from the powerful flare of the FSRQ 3C 279 by H.E.S.S.

We\ninvestigated a typical case, when defects fill a thin layer below the top film\nsurface with a constant concentration creating an additional gradient of\nelastic fields. The defective surface of the film is not covered with an\nelectrode, but instead with an ultra-thin layer of ambient screening charges,\ncharacterized by a surface screening length. This geometry is typical for the\nscanning probe piezoelectric force microscopy. Obtained results revealed an\nunexpectedly strong effect of the joint action of Vegard stresses and\nflexoelectric effect (shortly flexo-chemical coupling) on the ferroelectric\ntransition temperature, distribution of the spontaneous polarization and\nelastic fields, domain wall structure and period in thin PbTiO3 films\ncontaining a layer of elastic defects. A nontrivial result is the\nferroelectricity persisting at film thicknesses below 4 nm, temperatures lower\nthan 350 K and relatively high surface screening length (~0.1 nm). The origin\nof this phenomenon is the re-building of the domain structure in the film\n(namely the cross-over from c-domain stripes to a-type closure domains) when\nits thickness decreases below 4 nm, conditioned by the flexoelectric coupling\nand facilitated by negative Vegard effect. For positive Vegard effect, thicker\nfilms exhibit the appearance of pronounced maxima on the thickness dependence\nof the transition temperature, whose position and height can be controlled by\nthe defect type and concentration. The revealed features may have important\nimplications for miniaturization of ferroelectric-based devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 19:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Therefore, resource allocation in such a UAV-enabled LTE-U\nnetwork must jointly consider the uplink and downlink links over both licensed\nand unlicensed bands. In such a VR setting, the UAVs can dynamically adjust the\nimage quality and format of each VR image to change the data size of each VR\nimage, then meet the delay requirement. Therefore, resource allocation must\nalso take into account the image quality and format. This VR-centric resource\nallocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that enables a joint\nallocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, as well as a dynamic\nadaptation of VR image quality and format. To solve this game, a learning\nalgorithm based on the machine learning tools of echo state networks (ESNs)\nwith leaky integrator neurons is proposed. Unlike conventional ESN based\nlearning algorithms that are suitable for discrete-time systems, the proposed\nalgorithm can dynamically adjust the update speed of the ESN's state and,\nhence, it can enable the UAVs to learn the continuous dynamics of their\nassociated VR users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm\nachieves up to 14% and 27.1% gains in terms of total VR QoE for all users\ncompared to Q-learning using LTE-U and Q-learning using LTE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 20:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

A sudden transition of the runout is detected at a\ncritical content of fine particles, with a dependence on the grain-size ratio\nand flume tilt. This transition is explained as two simultaneous avalanches in\ndifferent flowing regimes (a viscous-like one and an inertial one) competing\nagainst each other and provoking a full segregation and a split-off of the\ndeposit into two well-defined, separated deposits. The formation of the distal\ndeposit, in turn, depends on a critical amount of coarse particles. This allows\nthe condensation of the pure coarse deposit around a small, initial seed\ncluster, which grows rapidly by braking and capturing subsequent colliding\ncoarse particles. For different grain-size ratios and keeping a constant total\nmass, the change in the amount of fines needed for the transition to occur is\nfound to be always less than 7%.

A nontrivial and interesting question concerning this\nsubject is whether there is a sequential scheme for locally discriminating\nbetween two bipartite unitary operations, because a sequential scheme usually\nrepresents the most economic strategy for discrimination. An affirmative answer\nto this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i)\nthe unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on $d\\otimes d$,\ni.e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were\nassumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in\nexperiment.

Specifically, we show that any two bipartite unitary operations\nacting on $d_A\\otimes d_B$ can be locally discriminated by a sequential scheme,\nwithout using the inverses of the unitary operations.

The latter is significantly less\ncomputationally expensive, hence it is desirable to know in which parameter\nrange this approximation is valid. As a benchmark problem, we consider the\nclassical dam-break problem. This paper establishes the validity window of the\nlubrication approximation in terms of the Reynolds number, Froude number, and\nfilm aspect ratio. To validate the solutions produced by the solver,\nexperimental data has been obtained for the levelling of silicone oil. The free\nsurface velocity measured experimentally is compared to that produced by the\ntwo numerical models and found to have relatively good agreement. The\nlubrication approximation is then compared with the Navier-Stokes model for a\nrange of Reynolds and Froude numbers, and for a range of film aspect ratios.\nThe results show that the lubrication approximation is remarkably robust and\nparticularly accurate for low Reynolds and Froude numbers, for which inertial\neffects are negligible.

The formulation based on the winding number naturally leads to two\ntypes of the generalized Luttinger theorem. Exploring two examples of\nsingle-band translationally invariant interacting electrons, i.e., simple metal\nand Mott insulator, we show that the first type falls into the original\nstatement for Fermi liquids given by Luttinger, while the second type\ncorresponds to the extended one for non metallic cases with no Fermi surface\ngeneralized by Dzyaloshinskii.

Due to smearing of discontinuous solution by\nthe excessive numerical dissipation, conventional shock-capturing schemes have\ndifficulties to obtain the correct location of detonation front without enough\ngrids resolution. To overcome the excessive numerical errors around\ndiscontinuities by traditional discretized schemes used in non-reacting high\nspeed compressible flow, we introduce a new shock-capturing scheme in which\nbesides linear function constructed by MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered\nSchemes for Conservation Law) scheme, a step like THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola\nfor INterface Capturing) function is also employed as another candidate in the\nreconstruction process. The final reconstruction function is determined by\nboundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm by which numerical dissipation\naround discontinuities can be reduced significantly. The new resulted\nshock-capturing scheme is named MUSCL-THINC-BVD. One- and two-dimensional\ncomparative numerical tests about stiff detonation waves problems are conducted\nwith the 5th order WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and\nMUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme respectively, which show MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme can\ncapture the correct position of detonation waves with improved resolution while\nWENO scheme, in spite of higher order, produces spurious waves. Compared with\nother existing methods which involves extra treatments by accepting the smeared\nout discontinuities profiles, the current method obtain the correct but also\nsharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors\nfrom shock-capturing schemes. Thus the proposed approach is an effective but\nsimple method to solve stiff detonation problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 05:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

However, they\nsuffer much from the non-negligible accuracy drop. This paper proposes the\nstochastic quantization (SQ) algorithm for learning accurate low-bit DNNs. The\nmotivation is due to the following observation. Existing training algorithms\napproximate the real-valued elements/filters with low-bit representation all\ntogether in each iteration. The quantization errors may be small for some\nelements/filters, while are remarkable for others, which lead to inappropriate\ngradient direction during training, and thus bring notable accuracy drop.\nInstead, SQ quantizes a portion of elements/filters to low-bit with a\nstochastic probability inversely proportional to the quantization error, while\nkeeping the other portion unchanged with full-precision. The quantized and\nfull-precision portions are updated with corresponding gradients separately in\neach iteration. The SQ ratio is gradually increased until the whole network is\nquantized. This procedure can greatly compensate the quantization error and\nthus yield better accuracy for low-bit DNNs. Experiments show that SQ can\nconsistently and significantly improve the accuracy for different low-bit DNNs\non various datasets and various network structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 05:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

In real applications, however, this approach is confronted with two\nchallenging problems, namely (1) tensor rank determination; (2) handling real\ntensor data which only approximately fulfils the low-rank requirement. To\naddress these two issues, we develop a data-adaptive tensor completion model\nwhich explicitly represents both the low-rank and non-low-rank structures in a\nlatent tensor. Representing the non-low-rank structure separately from the\nlow-rank one allows priors which capture the important distinctions between the\ntwo, thus enabling more accurate modelling, and ultimately, completion. Through\ndefining a new tensor rank, we develop a sparsity induced prior for the\nlow-rank structure, with which the tensor rank can be automatically determined.\nThe prior for the non-low-rank structure is established based on a mixture of\nGaussians which is shown to be flexible enough, and powerful enough, to inform\nthe completion process for a variety of real tensor data. With these two\npriors, we develop a Bayesian minimum mean squared error estimate (MMSE)\nframework for inference which provides the posterior mean of missing entries as\nwell as their uncertainty.

We consider a scenario in which an\nindividual shares his sequential data (such as genomic data or location\npatterns) with several service providers (SPs). In such a scenario, if his data\nis shared with other third parties without his consent, the individual wants to\ndetermine the service provider that is responsible for this unauthorized\nsharing. To provide this functionality, we propose a novel optimization-based\nwatermarking scheme for sharing of sequential data. Thus, in the case of an\nunauthorized sharing of sensitive data, the proposed scheme can find the source\nof the leakage by checking the watermark inside the leaked data. In particular,\nthe proposed schemes guarantees with a high probability that (i) the malicious\nSP that receives the data cannot understand the watermarked data points, (ii)\nwhen more than one malicious SPs aggregate their data, they still cannot\ndetermine the watermarked data points, (iii) even if the unauthorized sharing\ninvolves only a portion of the original data or modified data (to damage the\nwatermark), the corresponding malicious SP can be kept responsible for the\nleakage, and (iv) the added watermark is compliant with the nature of the\ncorresponding data. That is, if there are inherent correlations in the data,\nthe added watermark still preserves such correlations. Watermarking typically\nmeans changing certain parts of the data, and hence it may have negative\neffects on data utility. The proposed scheme also minimizes such utility loss\nwhile it provides the aforementioned security guarantees.

The first central notion of this\nthesis is a common generalisation of these, which we call a proto-theory. In\norder to define models of a proto-theory in a category, we need a way of\nrelating the arities of the proto-theory with the objects of the category. This\nleads to our second central notion, that of an interpretation of arities, or\naritation for short. We show that every aritation gives rise to a semantics\nfunctor sending proto-theories to models. In fact this functor always has an\nadjoint, giving a structure-semantics adjunction. Furthermore, we show that the\nsemantics of proto-theories generalises the classical semantics of many\nexisting notions of algebraic theory.\n  Another aim of this thesis is to find a convenient category of monads in the\nfollowing sense. Every right adjoint gives rise to a monad on its codomain, and\nmore generally so does any functor that admits a codensity monad. However, not\nall functors have codensity monads. This means that the semantics functor for\nmonads on a category, viewed as a functor into the category of all functors\ninto the base category, does not have a left adjoint. We seek a generalisation\nof monads with a semantics functor that does have a left adjoint.\n  This can be accomplished with proto-theories, but at a cost. The classical\nsemantics functor for monads is full and faithful; this is a kind of\ncompleteness theorem, and is highly desirable in a notion of algebraic theory.\nHowever, the semantics functor for general proto-theories is not full and\nfaithful.

Turbulent evolution within the\naccretion disk is expected on timescales comparable to the orbital period,\ntypically an order of magnitude larger than $t_G$.

However, these methods\nhave two main shortcomings. First, when a series is symbolized based on\npermutation patterns, repetition as an unavoidable phenomenon in data is not\ntook in to account. Second, they consider only the order of amplitude values\nand so, some information regarding the amplitude values themselves may be\nignored. To address these deficiencies, we have very recently introduced\ndispersion patterns and subsequently, dispersion entropy (DispEn). In this\npaper, we investigate the effect of different linear and non-linear mapping\napproaches, used in the algorithm of DispEn, on the characterization of\nsignals. We also inspect the sensitivity of different parameters of DispEn to\nnoise. Moreover, we introduce frequency-based DispEn (FDispEn) as a measure to\ndeal with only the frequency of time series. The results suggest that DispEn\nand FDispEn with the log-sigmoid mapping approach, unlike PerEn, can detect\noutliers. Furthermore, the original and frequency-based forbidden dispersion\npatterns are introduced to discriminate deterministic from stochastic time\nseries. The computation times show that DispEn and FDispEn are considerably\nfaster than PerEn. Finally, we find that DispEn and FDispEn outperform PerEn to\ndistinguish various dynamics of biomedical signals. Due to their advantages\nover existing entropy methods, DispEn and FDispEn are expected to be widely\nused for the characterization of a wide variety of real-world time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 09:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

Therefore, we provide theoretic derivation to\nextend the current weight initialization scheme to multi-branch network\nstructures.

As human perception is inherently limited, such approaches can\ndiscover patterns, e.g. that two objects are similar, in arbitrarily\nhigh-dimensional spaces what no human is able to do.

Towards this\ndifficult task, we carried out a pilot study of spectroscopically investigating\nthe relative variation of temperature (T) at a number of points in the solar\ncircumference region near to the limb (where latitude dependence should show up\nif any exists) based on the equivalent widths (W) of 28 selected lines in the\n5367--5393A and 6075--6100A regions.

We found that lines with strong\nT-sensitivity (|log W/log T|) should be used and that very weak lines should be\navoided because they inevitably suffer large relative fluctuations (Delta_W/W).\nOur analysis revealed that a precision of Delta_T/T ~ 0.003 (corresponding to\n~15K) can be achieved at best by a spectral line with comparatively large |log\nW/log T|, though this can possibly be further improved if other more suitable\nlines are used. Accordingly, if many such favorable lines could be measured\nwith sub-% precision of Delta_W/W and by averaging the resulting Delta_T/T from\neach line, the random noise would eventually be reduced down to <~1K and\ndetection of very subtle amount of global T-gradient might be possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 12:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

In order to get\nmodel independent results, high energy new physics is parametrized in two\ndifferent independent ways: as higher order operators in the Higgs field, or\nintroducing new particles with very large masses. The destabilizing effect is\nobserved in both cases, hinting at a general mechanism that does not depend on\nthe parametrization details for new physics, thus maintaining the results\nobtained from the analysis performed in flat spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 13:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

It is usually\nbased on the estimated or real objective values of the candidate offspring\nsolutions. In a sense, the preselection can be treated as a classification\nprocedure, which classifies the candidate offspring solutions into promising\nones and unpromising ones. Following this idea, we propose a classification\nbased preselection (CPS) strategy for evolutionary multiobjective optimization.\nWhen applying classification based preselection, an evolutionary algorithm\nmaintains two external populations (training data set) that consist of some\nselected good and bad solutions found so far; then it trains a classifier based\non the training data set in each generation. Finally it uses the classifier to\nfilter the unpromising candidate offspring solutions and choose a promising one\nfrom the generated candidate offspring set for each parent solution. In such\ncases, it is not necessary to estimate or evaluate the objective values of the\ncandidate offspring solutions.

Parallel graph algorithms, running on many-core systems such as\nGPUs, are no exception: most research has focused on how to efficiently\nimplement and tune different graph operations on a specific GPU. However, the\nperformance impact of the input graph has only been taken into account\nindirectly as a result of the graphs used to benchmark the system.\n  In this work, we present a case study investigating how to use the properties\nof the input graph to improve the performance of the breadth-first search (BFS)\ngraph traversal. To do so, we first study the performance variation of 15\ndifferent BFS implementations across 248 graphs. Using this performance data,\nwe show that significant speed-up can be achieved by combining the best\nimplementation for each level of the traversal. To make use of this\ndata-dependent optimization, we must correctly predict the relative performance\nof algorithms per graph level, and enable dynamic switching to the optimal\nalgorithm for each level at runtime.\n  We use the collected performance data to train a binary decision tree, to\nenable high-accuracy predictions and fast switching. We demonstrate empirically\nthat our decision tree is both fast enough to allow dynamic switching between\nimplementations, without noticeable overhead, and accurate enough in its\nprediction to enable significant BFS speedup. We conclude that our model-driven\napproach (1) enables BFS to outperform state of the art GPU algorithms, and (2)\ncan be adapted for other BFS variants, other algorithms, or more specific\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 14:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

In the\nlimit of flavour number $N \\to 1/2$ it is equivalent to the Gross-Neveu model,\nwhich shows a parity-breaking discrete phase transition. The model was already\nstudied with different methods, including Dyson-Schwinger equations, functional\nrenormalisation group methods and lattice simulations.

If we reformulate the model in an irreducible representation of the\nClifford algebra, we find, in contradiction to earlier results, that the\nbehaviour for even and odd flavour numbers is very different: For even flavour\nnumbers, chiral and parity symmetry are always unbroken.

Moreover, there exist\nassociated finite hypergroups. The notion of classical discrete association\nschemes can be easily extended to the possibly infinite case. Moreover, the\nnotion of association schemes can be relaxed slightly by using suitably\ndeformed families of stochastic matrices by skipping the integrality\nconditions. This leads to larger class of examples which are again associated\nto discrete hypergroups.\n  In this paper we propose a topological generalization of the notion of\nassociation schemes by using a locally compact basis space $X$ and a family of\nMarkov-kernels on $X$ indexed by a further locally compact space $D$ where the\nsupports of the associated probability measures satisfy some partition\nproperty. These objects, called continuous association schemes, will be related\nto hypergroup structures on $D$. We study some basic results for this new\nnotion and present several classes of examples. It turns out that for a given\ncommutative hypergroup the existence of an associated continuous association\nscheme implies that the hypergroup has many features of a double coset\nhypergroup. We in particular show that commutative hypergroups, which are\nassociated with commutative continuous association schemes, carry dual positive\nproduct formulas for the characters. On the other hand, we prove some rigidity\nresults in particular in the compact case which say that for given spaces $X,D$\nthere are only a few continuous association schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 15:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

An important aspect of the merging process is the\nin-spiral of the supermassive black-holes (SMBHs) to the centre of the merger\nremnant and the eventual formation of a SMBH binary. If both the SMBHs are\naccreting they will form a dual or binary active galactic nucleus (DAGN). The\nfinal merger remnant is usually very bright and shows enhanced star formation.\nIn this paper we summarize the current sample of DAGN from previous studies and\ndescribe methods that can be used to identify strong DAGN candidates from\noptical and spectroscopic surveys. These methods depend on the Doppler\nseparation of the double peaked AGN emission lines, the nuclear velocity\ndispersion of the galaxies and their optical/UV colours. We describe two high\nresolution, radio observations of DAGN candidates that have been selected based\non their double peaked optical emission lines (DPAGN). We also examine whether\nDAGN host galaxies have higher star formation rates (SFRs) compared to merging\ngalaxies that do not appear to have DAGN. We find that the SFR is not higher\nfor DAGN host galaxies. This suggests that the SFRs in DAGN host galaxies is\ndue to the merging process itself and not related to the presence of two AGN in\nthe system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 15:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

Phenomenological analyses usually relies on analytic\nparameterizations provided by the Regge-Gribov formalism and fits to the\nexperimental data.

Equations of electron\ndynamics are nearly exact and apply from nuclear particles to stars.

We show how the Bohm\nformulation of quantum mechanics allows easy definition of current. We show how\nconservation of current can be derived without mention of the polarization or\ndielectric properties of matter.

We show that current is conserved\nexactly in any material no matter how complex the dielectric, polarization or\nconduction currents are.

A representative setting is coupled systems of a topological\ninsulator and an insulating ferromagnet, where the former possesses an\ninsulating bulk with topologically protected, dissipationless, and conducting\nsurface electronic states governed by the relativistic quantum Dirac\nHamiltonian and latter is described by the nonlinear classical evolution of its\nmagnetization vector. The interactions between the two are essentially the spin\ntransfer torque from the topological insulator to the ferromagnet and the local\nproximity induced exchange coupling in the opposite direction. The hybrid\nsystem exhibits a rich variety of nonlinear dynamical phenomena besides\nmultistability such as bifurcations, chaos, and phase synchronization. The\ndegree of multistability can be controlled by an external voltage. In the case\nof two coexisting states, the system is effectively binary, opening a door to\nexploitation for developing spintronic memory devices.
