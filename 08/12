The strain\ncontribution to the work of dislocation emission is calculated to be negative,\nwhile the chemical contribution to be always positive.

By combining these\ncontributions together we find, in agreement with experimental observations,\nthat a strong segregation of S can reduce the work of grain boundary separation\nbelow the work of dislocation emission, thus embrittling Cu, while such an\nembrittlement cannot be produced by a P segregation because it lowers the\nenergy barrier for dislocation emission relatively more than for work\nseparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 16:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Initial inspection reveals the\npresence of narrow emission lines in boron nitride powder and exfoliated flakes\nof hexagonal boron nitride deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates. Generally rather\nstable, the boron nitride emitters constitute a good quality visible light\nsource. However, as briefly discussed, certain specimens reveal a peculiar type\nof blinking effects, which are likely related to existence of meta-stable\nelectronic states. More advanced characterisation of representative stable\nemitting centres uncovers a strong dependence of the emission intensity on the\nenergy and polarisation of excitation. On this basis, we speculate that rather\nstrict excitation selectivity is an important factor determining the character\nof the emission spectra, which allows the observation of single and\nwell-isolated emitters. Finally, we investigate the properties of the emitting\ncentres in varying external conditions.

Pre-trained word\nembeddings are used in several downstream applications as well as for\nconstructing representations for sentences, paragraphs and documents. Recently,\nthere has been an emphasis on further improving the pre-trained word vectors\nthrough post-processing algorithms. One such area of improvement is the\ndimensionality reduction of the word embeddings. Reducing the size of word\nembeddings through dimensionality reduction can improve their utility in memory\nconstrained devices, benefiting several real-world applications. In this work,\nwe present a novel algorithm that effectively combines PCA based dimensionality\nreduction with a recently proposed post-processing algorithm, to construct word\nembeddings of lower dimensions. Empirical evaluations on 12 standard word\nsimilarity benchmarks show that our algorithm reduces the embedding\ndimensionality by 50%, while achieving similar or (more often) better\nperformance than the higher dimension embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 17:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2017 09:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

The Hierachical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code identifies halos as they\nform and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting\nsubhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation\nof this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more\nphysically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological\nsimulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass\nfunction are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between\nthe two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive\nsubhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal\nstripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more\nconcentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.\nSubhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the\nmasses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This\nmay explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster\ncentres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the\npeak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the\nmerger trees constructed using HBT+ do not suffer from the missing or switched\nlinks that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo\nfinders. We make the HBT+ code publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 18:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Curvature from a straight line implies a deviation from a\nscaling of $D^{-1}$. We measure the V-shape curvature of 11 young asteroid\nfamilies including the \\FYnospace, Aeolia, Brangane, Brasilia, Clarissa,\nIannini, Karin, Konig, Koronis(2), Theobalda and Veritas asteroid families.

Unexpected drops in traffic can be an\nindication of an underlying issue and may be an early warning that remedial\naction may be necessary. Detecting such drops is non-trivial because streams\nare variable and noisy, with roughly regular spikes (in many different shapes)\nin traffic data. We investigated the question of whether or not we can predict\nanomalies in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and\nstatistical approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy,\ntraffic patterns. Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to\ndirectly apply supervised learning for anomaly classification, we approached\nthe problem in two parts. First we used TensorFlow to train our various models\nincluding DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected\nvalue in the time series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that\ncompared the actual values to predicted values. Since the problem requires\nfinding sustained anomalies, rather than just short delays or momentary\ninactivity in the data, our two detection methods focused on continuous\nsections of activity rather than just single points. We tried multiple\ncombinations of our models and rules and found that using the intersection of\nour two anomaly detection methods proved to be an effective method of detecting\nanomalies on almost all of our models. In the process we also found that not\nall data fell within our experimental assumptions, as one data stream had no\nperiodicity, and therefore no time based model could predict it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 19:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

The effects of instrument-specific musical training\non auditory grouping in the context of stream segregation are investigated here\nin three experiments. In Experiment 1a, participants listened to sequences of\nABA tones and indicated when they heard a change in rhythm. This change is\ncaused by the manipulation of the B tones' timbre and indexes a change in\nperception from integration to segregation, or vice versa. While it was\nexpected that musicians would detect a change in rhythm earlier when their own\ninstrument was involved, no such pattern was observed. In Experiment 1b,\ndesigned to control for potential expectation effects in Experiment 1a,\nparticipants heard sequences of static ABA tones and reported their initial\nperceptions, whether the sequence was integrated or segregated. Results show\nthat participants tend to initially perceive these static sequences as\nsegregated, and that perception is influenced by similarity between the timbres\ninvolved. Finally, in Experiment 2 violinists and flautists located mistuned\nnotes in an interleaved melody paradigm containing a violin and a flute melody.\nPerformance did not depend on the instrument the participant played but rather\nwhich melody their attention was directed to. Taken together, results from the\nthree experiments suggest that the specific instrument one practices does not\nhave an influence on auditory grouping, but attentional mechanisms are\nnecessary for processing auditory scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 19:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

Significant work has been devoted to these\ntasks in flow represented by vector fields, but there are unique challenges in\naddressing these tasks for time-varying particle data. The unstructured nature\nof particle data, nonuniform and sparse sampling, and the inability to access\narbitrary particles in space-time make it difficult to define separation and\nclustering for particle data. We observe that weaker notions of separation and\nclustering through continuous measures of these structures are meaningful when\ncoupled with user exploration. We achieve this goal by defining a measure of\nparticle similarity between pairs of particles. More specifically, separation\noccurs when spatially-localized particles are dissimilar, while clustering is\ncharacterized by sets of particles that are similar to one another. To be\nrobust to imperfections in sampling we use diffusion geometry to compute\nparticle similarity. Diffusion geometry is parameterized by a scale that allows\na user to explore separation and clustering in a continuous manner. We\nillustrate the benefits of our technique on a variety of 2D and 3D flow\ndatasets, from particles integrated in fluid simulations based on time-varying\nvector fields, to particle-based simulations in astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 19:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

During the latter, Cygnus X-1 shows a\none-sided relativistic radio-jet. Recent detection of the system in the high\nenergy (HE; $E\\gtrsim60$ MeV) gamma-ray range with \\textit{Fermi}-LAT\nassociates this emission with the outflow. Former MAGIC observations revealed a\nhint of flaring activity in the very high-energy (VHE; $E\\gtrsim100$ GeV)\nregime during this X-ray state. We analyze $\\sim97$ hr of Cygnus X-1 data taken\nwith the MAGIC telescopes between July 2007 and October 2014. To shed light on\nthe correlation between hard X-ray and VHE gamma rays as previously suggested,\nwe study each main X-ray state separately. We perform an orbital phase-folded\nanalysis to look for variability in the VHE band.

Current methodology\nrests on models of stars. Here we aim to obtain flux calibration that is\ntraceable to state-of-the-art detector-based calibration. We present the SNIFS\nCalibration Apparatus (SCALA), a color (relative) flux calibration system\ndeveloped for the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS), operating at\nthe University of Hawaii 2.2 m (UH 88) telescope. By comparing the color trend\nof the illumination generated by SCALA during two commissioning runs, and to\nprevious laboratory measurements, we show that we can determine the light\nemitted by SCALA with a long-term repeatability better than 1%. We describe the\ncalibration procedure necessary to control for system aging. We present\nmeasurements of the SNIFS throughput as estimated by SCALA observations.

The starting-point is a\ndeterminant wavefunction formed with natural orbitals obtained from a new\ninteracting-pair model. The latter leads to a natural orbital functional (NOF)\ncapable of recovering the complete intra-pair, but only the static inter-pair\ncorrelation. Using the solution of the NOF, two new energy functionals are\ndefined for both dynamic (Edyn) and static (Esta) correlation. Edyn is derived\nfrom a modified second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), while\nEsta is obtained from the static component of the new NOF. Double counting is\navoided by introducing the amount of static and dynamic correlation in each\norbital as a function of its occupation. As a result, the total energy is\nrepresented by the sum Ehf + Edyn + Esta, where Ehf is the Hartree-Fock energy\nobtained with natural orbitals.

Outlier detection\ntechniques, classical and robust alike, will typically flag the entire case as\noutlying, or attribute a specific case weight to the entire case. In practice,\nparticularly in high dimensional data, the outlier will most likely not be\noutlying along all of its variables, but just along a subset of them. If so,\nthe scientific question why the case has been flagged as an outlier becomes of\ninterest. In this article, a fast and efficient method is proposed to detect\nvariables that contribute most to an outlier's outlyingness. Thereby, it helps\nthe analyst understand why an outlier lies out. The approach pursued in this\nwork is to estimate the univariate direction of maximal outlyingness. It is\nshown that the problem of estimating that direction can be rewritten as the\nnormed solution of a classical least squares regression problem. Identifying\nthe subset of variables contributing most to outlyingness, can thus be achieved\nby estimating the associated least squares problem in a sparse manner. From a\npractical perspective, sparse partial least squares (SPLS) regression,\npreferably by the fast sparse NIPALS (SNIPLS) algorithm, is suggested to tackle\nthat problem.

The transition density is calculated\nmicroscopically with the second Tamm-Dancoff approximation, and the\ndistorted-wave Born approximation is employed to describe the reaction process.\nA phenomenological one-range Gaussian interaction is used to prepare the form\nfactor. For the Fermi transition, our approach describes the experimental\nbehavior of the cross section better than the Lane model, which is the\nconventional method. For spin-flip excitations including the GT transition, the\n2p2h effect decreases the magnitude of the cross section and does not change\nthe shape of the angular distribution. The $\\Delta l=2$ transition of the\npresent reaction is found to play a negligible role. The 2p2h effect will not\nchange the angular-distributed cross section of spin-flip responses. This is\nbecause the transition density of the Gamow-Teller response, the leading\ncontribution to the cross section, is not significantly varied by the 2p2h\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 11:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 20:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 14:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

However, power law\ndistributions for the acoustic emission energies are reported in distinctly\ndifferent plastically deforming situations such as in hcp and, fcc single and\npolycrystalline samples exhibiting smooth stress-strain curves, and in dilute\nmetallic alloys exhibiting discontinuous flow. This is surprising since the\nunderlying dislocation mechanisms in these two types of deformations are very\ndifferent. So far, there has been no models that predict the power law\nstatistics for the discontinuous flow. Furthermore, the statistics of the\nacoustic emission signals in jerky flow is even more complex requiring\nmultifractal measures for a proper characterization. There has been no model\nthat explains the complex statistics either.

On the one hand, it\nnecessitates the use of variable selection strategies or more general\ndata-adaptive high-dimensional statistical methods. On the other hand, the use\nof such techniques tends to result in biased estimators with a non-standard\nasymptotic behaviour. Double-robust estimators are vital for offering a\nresolution because they possess a so-called small bias property (Newey et al.,\n2004). This means that their bias vanishes faster than the bias in the nuisance\nparameter estimators when the relevant smoothing parameter goes to zero, making\ntheir performance less sensitive to smoothing (Chernozhukov et al., 2016). This\nproperty has been exploited to achieve valid (uniform) inference of the average\ncausal effect when data-adaptive estimators of the propensity score and\nconditional outcome mean both converge to their respective truths at\nsufficiently fast rate (e.g., van der Laan, 2014; Farrell, 2015; Belloni et\nal., 2016). In this article, we extend this work in order to retain valid\n(uniform) inference when one of these estimators does not converge to the\ntruth, regardless of which. This is done by generalising prior work for\nlow-dimensional settings by Vermeulen and Vansteelandt (2015) to incorporate\nregularisation. The proposed penalised bias-reduced double-robust estimation\nstrategy exhibits promising performance in extensive simulation studies and a\ndata analysis, relative to competing proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 15:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

We\nconclude by proposing that the string singularity in the magnetic field of an\n{\\it isolated} magnetic charge suggests a confinement mechanism for magnetic\ncharge, similar to the flux tube confinement of quarks in QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 17:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

As this joint optimization problem is nonconvex and\ncombinatorial in nature, we propose a non-trivial solution methodology that\neffectively decouples it into three individual optimization problems. Firstly,\nby using the distance distribution of the farthest UE from the BS, we present\nnovel insights on optimal BS location in an optimal sectoring type for a given\nnumber of BSs. After that we provide a tight approximation for the optimal\ntransmit power allocation to each BS. Lastly, using the latter two results, the\noptimal number of BSs that minimize the operational cost is obtained. Also, we\nhave investigated both circular and square field deployments. Numerical results\nvalidate the analysis and provide practical insights on optimal BS deployment.\nWe observe that the proposed joint optimization framework, that solves the\ncoverage probability versus operational cost tradeoff, can yield a significant\nreduction of about $65\\%$ in the operational cost as compared to the benchmark\nfixed allocation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 06:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}
