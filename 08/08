However, investing in option is still\nrisky. Such risk becomes much severer for speculators who utilize option as a\nmeans of leverage to increase their potential returns. In order to mitigate\nrisk on their positions, the rudimentary concept of financial option insurance\nis introduced into practice. Two starkly-dissimilar concepts of insurance and\nfinancial option are integrated into the formation of financial option\ninsurance. The proposed financial product insures investors option premiums\nwhen misfortune befalls on them. As a trade-off, they are likely to sacrifice a\nlimited portion of their potential profits. The loopholes of prevailing\nfinancial market are addressed and the void is filled by introducing a stable\nthree-entity framework. Moreover, a specifically designed mathematical model is\nproposed. It consists of two portions: the business strategy of matching and a\nverification-and-modification process. The proposed model enables the option\ninvestors with calls and puts of different moneyness to be protected by the\nissued option insurance. Meanwhile, it minimizes the exposure of option\ninsurers position to any potential losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to\nreduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative\nknowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition\nnetwork that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by\n(i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through\nfeature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data\naugmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain\nadversarial discriminator.

Previous approaches specify\neither the position or the timing of steps, however, the proposed locomotion\nplanner simultaneously computes both of these parameters as locomotion outputs.\nOur locomotion strategy relies on devising a reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach for robust walking. The learned policy generates multi step walking\npatterns, and the process is quick enough to be suitable for real-time\ncontrols. For learning, we devise an RL strategy that uses a phase space\nplanner (PSP) and a linear inverted pendulum model to make the problem\ntractable and very fast. Then, the learned policy is used to provide goal-based\ncommands to the WBLC, which calculates the torque commands to be executed in\nfull-humanoid robots. The WBLC combines multiple prioritized tasks and\ncalculates the associated reaction forces based on practical inequality\nconstraints. The novel formulation includes efficient calculation of the time\nderivatives of various Jacobians. This provides high-fidelity dynamic control\nof fast motions. More specifically, we compute the time derivative of the\nJacobian for various tasks and the Jacobian of the centroidal momentum task by\nutilizing Lie group operators and operational space dynamics respectively. The\nintegration of RL-PSP and the WBLC provides highly robust, versatile, and\npractical locomotion including steering while walking and handling push\ndisturbances of up to 520 N during an interval of 0.1 sec.

Sphere bias\nextends the idea of halo bias to intermediate density environments and voids as\nunderdense regions. In the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity, sphere bias\ndisplays a strong scale dependence relevant for both high and low density\nregions, which is predicted analytically. The statistics of densities in\nspheres are built to model primordial non-Gaussianity via an initial skewness\nwith a scale-dependence that depends on the bispectrum of the underlying model.\nThe analytical formulas with the measured nonlinear dark matter variance as\ninput are successfully tested against numerical simulations.

The scattering comes with an atomic density modulation, which\nis measured by the photon flux leaking from the cavity. We initialize the\nsystem in a Mott-insulating state and then rapidly increase the global coupling\nstrength. We observe that the system falls into either of two distinct final\nstates.

A stellar-merger\nevent was proposed to explain its ancient eruption. Aims: We aim to investigate\nthe composition of the molecular gas recently discovered in the remnant of CK\nVul. Methods: We observed millimeter and submillimeter-wave spectra of CK Vul\nusing the IRAM 30m and APEX telescopes. Radiative-transfer modeling of the\nobserved molecular features was performed to yield isotopic ratios for various\nelements. Results: The spectra of CK Vul reveal a very rich molecular\nenvironment of low excitation ($T_{\\rm ex} \\lesssim$12 K). Atomic carbon and\ntwenty seven different molecules, including two ions, were identified. They\nrange from simple diatomic to complex polyatomic species of up to 7 atoms\nlarge. The chemical composition of the molecular gas is indicative of carbon\nand nitrogen-driven chemistry but oxides are also present. Additionally, the\nabundance of F may be enhanced. The spectra are rich in isotopologues that are\nvery rare in most known sources. All stable isotopes of C, N, O, Si, and S are\nobserved and their isotopic ratios are derived. Conclusions: The composition of\nthe remnant's molecular gas is most peculiar and gives rise to a very unique\nmillimeter and submillimeter spectrum. The observation of ions and complex\nmolecules suggests the presence of a photoionizing source but its nature (a\ncentral star or shocks) remains unknown. The elemental and isotopic composition\nof the gas cannot be easily reconciled with standard nucleosynthesis but\nprocessing in hot CNO cycles and partial He burning can explain most of the\nchemical peculiarities. The isotopic ratios of CK Vul are remarkably close to\nthose of presolar nova grains but the link of Nova 1670 to objects responsible\nfor these grains is unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 18:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 15:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

We empirically investigate for the\nfirst time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs)\nfollow the ESL. Here we consider the `global' law where surface densities are\naveraged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at\nthe lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because\nthey are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Our sample\nis drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the\nlargest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities\nare determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates\nare calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust\nextinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using Spitzer\n3.6 $\\mu$m fluxes. All surface densities are calculated over stellar discs\ndefined by the 3.6 $\\mu$m images. We find dIrrs indeed follow the extended\nSchmidt law. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01\ndex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the\noriginal relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much\nmore deviant when compared to the `canonical' Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our\nresults help strengthen the universality of the extended Schmidt law,\nespecially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star\nformation in which feedback from previous generations of stars set the pressure\nin the ISM, are promising candidates for explaining the ESL. We also confirm\nthat ESL is an independent relation and not a form of a relation between star\nformation efficiency and metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 20:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The inner edge of the Scutum arm tangency is a unique location in\nwhich to disentangle the WIM from other components. We use high spectral\nresolution [C II] 158 micron and [N II] 205 micron fine structure line\nobservations taken with the upGREAT and GREAT instruments on SOFIA, along with\nauxiliary HI and 13CO observations. The observations were in and out of the\nGalactic plane along 18 lines of sight between longitude 30deg and 32deg. We\ndetect strong [N II] emission throughout the Scutum tangency. At VLSR = 110 to\n125 km/s, where there is little, if any, 13CO, we could disentangle the [N II]\nand [C II] emission that arises from the WIM at the inner edge. We find an\naverage electron density, <n(e)> about 0.9 cm{-3} in the plane, and about 0.4\ncm{-3} above the plane. For VLSR < 110 km/s there is [N II] emission tracing\nhighly ionized gas throughout the arm's molecular layer. This ionized gas has a\nhigh density, n(e) ~ 30 cm{-3}, and a few percent filling factor. Thus, [N II]\nand [C II] at the Scutum arm tangency reveal a highly ionized gas with <n(e)>\nabout 10 to 20 times those of the interarm WIM, which is best explained by a\nmodel in which the interarm WIM is compressed as it falls into the potential\nwell of the arm. The widespread distribution of [N II] in the molecular layers\nshows that high density ionized gas is distributed throughout the Scutum arm.\nThe n(e) derived from [N II] for these molecular cloud regions are about 30\ncm{-3}, and probably arise in the ionized boundary layers of clouds. This [N\nII] emission from the ionized boundary layers is probably the result of the\nshock compression of the WIM as it impacts the arm's neutral gas, but some\ncould arise from extended HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 21:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

We make the observation that cross field design for\ntwo-dimensional quad meshing is related to the well-known Ginzburg-Landau\nproblem from mathematical physics. This yields a variety of theoretical tools\nfor efficiently computing boundary-aligned quad meshes, with provable\nguarantees on the resulting mesh, such as the number of mesh defects and bounds\non the defect locations. The procedure for generating the quad mesh is to (i)\nfind a complex-valued \"representation\" field that minimizes the Ginzburg-Landau\nenergy subject to a boundary constraint, (ii) convert the representation field\ninto a boundary-aligned, smooth cross field, (iii) use separatrices of the\ncross field to partition the domain into four sided regions, and (iv) mesh each\nof these four-sided regions using standard techniques. Leveraging the\nGinzburg-Landau theory, we prove that this procedure can be used to produce a\ncross field whose separatrices partition the domain into four sided regions.

Yet selecting good defaults is hard. A mutable data\nstructure's workload is not known in advance, and it may shift over its\nlifetime - e.g., between read-heavy and write-heavy, or from heavy contention\nby multiple threads to single-threaded or low-frequency use. One idea is to\nswitch implementations adaptively, but it is nontrivial to switch the\nimplementation of a concurrent data structure at runtime. Performing the\ntransition requires a concurrent snapshot of data structure contents, which\nnormally demands special engineering in the data structure's design. However,\nin this paper we identify and formalize an relevant property of lock-free\nalgorithms. Namely, lock-freedom is sufficient to guarantee that freezing\nmemory locations in an arbitrary order will result in a valid snapshot. Several\nfunctional languages have data structures that freeze and thaw, transitioning\nbetween mutable and immutable, such as Haskell vectors and Clojure transients,\nbut these enable only single-threaded writers. We generalize this approach to\naugment an arbitrary lock-free data structure with the ability to gradually\nfreeze and optionally transition to a new representation. This augmentation\ndoesn't require changing the algorithm or code for the data structure, only\nreplacing its datatype for mutable references with a freezable variant. In this\npaper, we present an algorithm for lifting plain to adaptive data and prove\nthat the resulting hybrid data structure is itself lock-free, linearizable, and\nsimulates the original.

These solutions may be on equal grounds\ninterpreted as those of GR with a traceless stress-energy tensor and as vacuum\nsolutions in a brane world. For such wormholes, the traversability conditions\nand gravitational lensing properties are briefly discussed. As a by-product, we\nobtain twice asymptotically flat regular black hole solutions with up to four\nKilling horizons.

It is, however, challenging to ensure system safety and\nefficiency as the wireless channels in VNS are often subject to state-dependent\ndeep fades where the data rate suffers a severe drop and changes as a function\nof vehicle states. Such couplings between vehicle states and channel states in\nVNS thereby invalidate the use of separation principle to design event-based\ncontrol strategies. By adopting a state-dependent fading channel model that was\nproposed to capture the interaction between vehicle and channel states, this\npaper presents a novel self-triggered scheme under which the VNS ensures\nefficient use of communication bandwidth while preserving stochastic stability.\nThe novelty of the proposed scheme lies in its use of the state-dependent\nfading channel model in the event design that enables an adaptive and effective\nadjustment on transmission frequency in response to dynamic variations on\nchannel and vehicle states. Under the proposed self-triggered scheme, this\npaper presents a novel source coding scheme that tracks vehicle's states with\nperformance guarantee in the presence of state-dependent fading channels.

We present our new\nALMA cycle 3 observational results of HL Tau in the 13CO (2-1) and C18O (2-1)\nemission at resolutions of 0.8\" (110 au), and we compare the observed velocity\npattern with models of different kinds of gas motions. Both the 13CO and C18O\nemission lines show a central compact component with a size of 2\" (280 au),\nwhich traces the protoplanetary disk. The disk is clearly resolved and shows a\nKeplerian motion, from which the protostellar mass of HL Tau is estimated to be\n1.8+/-0.3 M$_\\odot$, assuming the inclination angle of the disk to be 47 deg\nfrom the plane of the sky. The 13CO emission shows two arc structures with\nsizes of 1000-2000 au and masses of 3E-3 M$_\\odot$ connected to the central\ndisk.

The gas kinematics of the arc structures can be better\nexplained with three-dimensional infalling or outflowing motions. Nevertheless,\nthe observed velocity in the northwestern part of the blueshifted arc structure\nis ~60-70% higher than the expected free-fall velocity.

However, HFR is a much more\nchallenging problem than traditional face recognition because of large\nintra-class variations of heterogeneous face images and limited training\nsamples of cross-modality face image pairs. This paper proposes a novel\napproach namely Wasserstein CNN (convolutional neural networks, or WCNN for\nshort) to learn invariant features between near-infrared and visual face images\n(i.e. NIR-VIS face recognition). The low-level layers of WCNN are trained with\nwidely available face images in visual spectrum. The high-level layer is\ndivided into three parts, i.e., NIR layer, VIS layer and NIR-VIS shared layer.\nThe first two layers aims to learn modality-specific features and NIR-VIS\nshared layer is designed to learn modality-invariant feature subspace.\nWasserstein distance is introduced into NIR-VIS shared layer to measure the\ndissimilarity between heterogeneous feature distributions. So W-CNN learning\naims to achieve the minimization of Wasserstein distance between NIR\ndistribution and VIS distribution for invariant deep feature representation of\nheterogeneous face images. To avoid the over-fitting problem on small-scale\nheterogeneous face data, a correlation prior is introduced on the\nfully-connected layers of WCNN network to reduce parameter space. This prior is\nimplemented by a low-rank constraint in an end-to-end network. The joint\nformulation leads to an alternating minimization for deep feature\nrepresentation at training stage and an efficient computation for heterogeneous\ndata at testing stage. Extensive experiments on three challenging NIR-VIS face\nrecognition databases demonstrate the significant superiority of Wasserstein\nCNN over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 09:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Thus, they suffer\nfrom heterogeneous object scales caused by perspective projection of cameras on\nactual scenes and inevitably encounter parsing failures on distant objects as\nwell as other boundary and recognition errors. In this work, we propose a new\nFoveaNet model to fully exploit the perspective geometry of scene images and\naddress the common failures of generic parsing models. FoveaNet estimates the\nperspective geometry of a scene image through a convolutional network which\nintegrates supportive evidence from contextual objects within the image.

We are proposing a method to infer directed\nconnectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at\nmultiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected\nin neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic\nlinear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which\nrepresent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for\ninferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the\ncovariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about\nthe existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely\ncoupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via\n$L^1$-minimization. In general, this method is suited to infer effective\nconnectivity from resting state data of various types.

The engineering effort to implement OSR and the lack of\nabstractions make it rarely accessible to the research community, leaving\nfundamental question regarding its flexibility largely unexplored.\n  In this article we make a first step towards a provably sound abstract\nframework for OSR.

They showed that if the poset $P$ is a rooted forest, the\ntransition matrix of this Markov chain has eigenvalues that are linear in the\ntransition probabilities and described their multiplicities. We show that the\nsame property holds for a larger class of posets for which we also derive\nconvergence to stationarity results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 11:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

In the proposed\nframework, we address two main problems: 1) how to directly generate binary\ncodes without relaxation? 2) how to equip the binary representation with the\nability of accurate image retrieval? We resolve these problems by proposing new\nsign-activation strategy and a loss function steering the learning process,\nwhich consists of new models for adversarial loss, a content loss, and a\nneighborhood structure loss.

However, existing methods based on DNN face the challenge\nof insufficient cross-modal training data, which limits the training\neffectiveness and easily leads to overfitting. Transfer learning is for\nrelieving the problem of insufficient training data, but it mainly focuses on\nknowledge transfer only from large-scale datasets as single-modal source domain\nto single-modal target domain. Such large-scale single-modal datasets also\ncontain rich modal-independent semantic knowledge that can be shared across\ndifferent modalities. Besides, large-scale cross-modal datasets are very\nlabor-consuming to collect and label, so it is significant to fully exploit the\nknowledge in single-modal datasets for boosting cross-modal retrieval. This\npaper proposes modal-adversarial hybrid transfer network (MHTN), which to the\nbest of our knowledge is the first work to realize knowledge transfer from\nsingle-modal source domain to cross-modal target domain, and learn cross-modal\ncommon representation. It is an end-to-end architecture with two subnetworks:\n(1) Modal-sharing knowledge transfer subnetwork is proposed to jointly transfer\nknowledge from a large-scale single-modal dataset in source domain to all\nmodalities in target domain with a star network structure, which distills\nmodal-independent supplementary knowledge for promoting cross-modal common\nrepresentation learning. (2) Modal-adversarial semantic learning subnetwork is\nproposed to construct an adversarial training mechanism between common\nrepresentation generator and modality discriminator, making the common\nrepresentation discriminative for semantics but indiscriminative for modalities\nto enhance cross-modal semantic consistency during transfer process.\nComprehensive experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show its effectiveness and\ngenerality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 07:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

A real time\nsampled FID signal is well modeled as a finite mixture of exponential sequences\nplus noise. We propose to use the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) for noise\nreduction and characterization, where the generalized Hilbert-Huang represents\na way to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF) along\nwith a trend, and obtain instantaneous frequency data. Moreover, the HHT for an\nFID signal's feature analysis is applied for the first time.

By theory analysis and the testing of an actual\nFID signal, the results show that, compared with general noise reduction\nmethods such as auto correlation and singular value decomposition (SVD),\ncombined with the proposed method can further suppress the interfered signals\neffectively, and can obtain different components of FID signal, which can use\nto identify the magnetic anomaly, the existence of groundwater etc. This is a\nvery important property since it can be exploited to separate the FID signal\nfrom noise and to estimate exponential sequence parameters of FID signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 22:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

The electrons and\nions have different kappa-parameters. We obtain the expressions of both\ndiffusion and mobility coefficients of electrons and ions respectively in the\nplasma. We find that these new transport coefficient formulae depend strongly\non the kappa-parameters in the power-law distributed plasma. When we take kappa\nto be infinite, these formulae reduce to the classical forms in the weakly\nionized plasma with a Maxwellian distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 02:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 02:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 14:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
