We\npurposefully give only a short description of pore creation and subsequent\nevolution of pore populations, as these are adequately discussed in both\nreviews and original research reports. In contrast, post-pulse pore concepts\nhave changed dramatically. For perspective we note that pores are not directly\nobserved. Instead understanding of pores is based on inference from experiments\nand, increasingly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the past decade\nconcepts for post-pulse pores have changed significantly: The idea of pure\nlipidic transient pores (TPs) that exist for milliseconds or longer post-pulse\nhas become inconsistent with MD results, which support TP lifetimes of only\n$\\sim$100 ns. A typical large TP number during cell EP pulsing is of order\n$10^6$. In twenty MD-based TP lifetimes (2 us total), the TP number plummets to\n$\\sim$0.001. In short, TPs vanish 2 us after a pulse ends, and cannot account\nfor post-pulse behavior such as large and relatively non-specific ionic and\nmolecular transport. Instead, an early conjecture of complex pores (CPs) with\nboth lipidic and other molecule should be taken seriously. Indeed, in the past\ndecade several experiments provide partial support for complex pores (CPs).\nPresently, CPs are \"dark\", in the sense that while some CP functions are known,\nlittle is known about their structure(s). There may be a wide range of\nlifetimes and permeabilities, not yet revealed by experiments. Like cosmology's\ndark matter, these unseen pores present us with an outstanding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 16:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

It is estimated to be a decade\nor more before a short GRB jet within the LIGO volume points along our line of\nsight.

Previous works studied the water retention in minor planets around\nmain-sequence and evolving host stars, in order to evaluate the possibility\nthat water survives inside minor planets around WDs. However, all of these\nstudies focused on small, comet-sized to moonlet-sized minor planets, when the\ninferred mass inside the convection zones of He-dominated WDs could actually\nalso be compatible with much more massive minor planets. In this study we\ntherefore explore for the first time, the water retention inside exo-planetary\ndwarf planets, or moderate-sized moons, with radii of the order of hundreds of\nkilometres. We now cover nearly the entire potential mass range of minor\nplanets. The rest of the parameter space considered in this study is identical\nto that of our previous study, and also includes multiple WD progenitor star\nmasses. We find that water retention in more massive minor planets is still\naffected by the mass of the WD progenitor, however not as much as when small\nminor planets were considered. We also find that water retention is now almost\nalways greater than zero. On average, the detected water fraction in\nHe-dominated WD atmospheres should be at least 5\\%, irrespective of the assumed\ninitial water composition, if it came from a single accretion event of an icy\ndwarf planet or moon. This finding also strengthens the possibility of WD\nhabitability. To finalize our previous and current findings, we provide a code\nwhich may be freely used as a service to the community. The code calculates ice\nand water retention by interpolation, spanning the full mass range of both\nminor planets and their host stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 16:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

We\ndiscuss the difficulties that we encounter in modeling these convective regions\nand outline the potential effects of this convection on the subsequent WD\nevolution. For models in which we do not allow convection to operate, we find\nthat oxygen ignites around a density of $\\log(\\rho_{\\rm c}/\\rm g\\,cm^{-3})\n\\approx 9.95$, very similar to the value without Urca cooling. Nonetheless, the\ninclusion of the effects of Urca-process cooling is an important step in\nproducing progenitor models with more realistic temperature and composition\nprofiles which are needed for the evolution of the subsequent oxygen\ndeflagration and hence for studies of the signature of accretion-induced\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

The CGC\nformalism takes into account the dynamics of large gluon densities at small $x$\nand has been successfully applied to Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and\nparticle production in high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions in the small\n$x$ kinematic region. The effective degrees of of freedom in CGC are Wilson\nlines which enter in the effective quark (and gluon) propagators and re-sum\nmultiple soft scatterings from the small $x$ gluon field of the target. It is\nhowever known that the CGC effective theory breaks down when one probes the\nmoderately large $x$ (high $p_t$) kinematics where collinear factorization and\nDGLAP evolution of parton distribution functions should be the right framework.\nHere we propose a general framework which may allow one to eventually unify the\ntwo approaches and to calculate pQCD cross sections in both small and large\nBjorken $x$ regions. We take the first step towards this goal by deriving an\nexpression for the quark propagator in a background field which includes\nscatterings from both small and large $x$ modes of the gluon field of the\ntarget. We describe how this quark propagator can be used to calculate QCD\nstructure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ at all $x$ and thus generalize the dipole\nmodel of DIS. We outline this approach can also be used to extend the so-called\nhybrid approach to particle production in the forward rapidity region of high\nenergy hadronic and nuclear collisions to all $x$ and $p_t$ regions and\nspeculate on how one may apply the same techniques to extend the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan effective action used in high energy heavy ion collisions\nto include high $p_t$ physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 19:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Giant planets that arrive with periastron\ndistances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\\mathrm{R}$ lose their\ngaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets'\ndistribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is\nnonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay.\nHere we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of\na spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization\ntime becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous\nstudies already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its\nproperties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by\ntidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}$). Our work extends these treatments by constructing\nexplicit model distributions for comparison with the data and by carrying out\nbackward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters. We show that\ncircularization generally occurs outside the distribution's inner edge (which\ndefines the boundary of the so-called sub-Jovian desert) and that typically\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}\\approx10^6$ in the circularization zone (to within a\nfactor of 3).

The ratio of the rate coefficients for\nelectrons and H$_2$ molecules, $\\simeq$10$^5$ for HCN, yields the requirements\nfor electron excitation to be of practical importance if $n({\\rm H}_2) \\leq\\\n10^{5.5} ~ \\rm cm^{-3}$ and $X({\\rm e}^-) \\geq\\ 10^{-5}$, where the numerical\nfactors reflect critical values $n_{\\rm{}c}({\\rm H_2})$ and $X^*({\\rm{}e}^-)$.\nThis indicates that in regions where a large fraction of carbon is ionized,\n$X({\\rm e}^-)$ will be large enough to make electron excitation significant.\nThe situation is in general similar for other \"high density tracers\", including\nHCO$^+$, CN, and CS. But there are significant differences in the critical\nelectron fractional abundance, $X^*({\\rm e}^-)$, defined by the value required\nfor equal effect from collisions with H$_2$ and e$^-$. Electron excitation is,\nfor example, unimportant for CO and C$^+$. Electron excitation may be\nresponsible for the surprisingly large spatial extent of the emission from\ndense gas tracers in some molecular clouds (Pety et al. 2017; Kauffmann,\nGoldsmith et al. 2017). The enhanced estimates for HCN abundances and HCN/CO\nand HCN/HCO$^+$ ratios observed in the nuclear regions of luminous galaxies may\nbe in part a result of electron excitation of high dipole moment tracers. The\nimportance of electron excitation will depend on detailed models of the\nchemistry, which may well be non-steady state and non-static.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 20:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

Among them, the Hierarchical Multi-scale RNN\n(HM-RNN), a kind of multi-scale hierarchical RNN proposed recently, can learn\nthe hierarchical temporal structure from data automatically. In this paper, we\nextend the work to solve the computer vision task of action recognition.\nHowever, in sequence-to-sequence models like RNN, it is normally very hard to\ndiscover the relationships between inputs and outputs given static inputs. As a\nsolution, attention mechanism could be applied to extract the relevant\ninformation from input thus facilitating the modeling of input-output\nrelationships. Based on these considerations, we propose a novel attention\nnetwork, namely Hierarchical Multi-scale Attention Network (HM-AN), by\ncombining the HM-RNN and the attention mechanism and apply it to action\nrecognition. A newly proposed gradient estimation method for stochastic\nneurons, namely Gumbel-softmax, is exploited to implement the temporal boundary\ndetectors and the stochastic hard attention mechanism. To amealiate the\nnegative effect of sensitive temperature of the Gumbel-softmax, an adaptive\ntemperature training method is applied to better the system performance. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the improved effect of HM-AN over LSTM with\nattention on the vision task. Through visualization of what have been learnt by\nthe networks, it can be observed that both the attention regions of images and\nthe hierarchical temporal structure can be captured by HM-AN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 01:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 05:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

The continuity equation\nrequires two specific inputs gauged on observations: (i) the star formation\nrate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/sub-mm/radio\nmeasurements; (ii) average star-formation histories for individual galaxies,\nwith different prescriptions for discs and spheroids. The continuity equation\nalso includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent\nnumerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass\nfunction derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass\nfunction and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and\nthe main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance matching\ntechnique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass function for\nactive and quiescent galaxies, of the galaxy main sequence and of the\nstar-formation efficiency with current observations is found; the comparison\nwith data also allows to robustly constrain the characteristic timescales for\nstar formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history\nof their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in-situ star\nformation vs. that contributed by external merger events.

For practical purposes the exploited\nspectral series expansion is typically truncated to allow for efficient\ncomputation, which leads to approximation errors.

Despite its oscillatory behavior, the presence of a\nfinite large-distance asymptotic value in the $s$-wave component of the\none-body density matrix indicates the existence of a Bose condensate. The\nsuperfluid fraction along the stripes direction is always close to 1, while in\nthe $y$ direction decreases to a small value that is nevertheless different\nfrom zero. These two facts confirms that the stripe phase of the dipolar Bose\ngas in 2D is superfluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 10:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Starting with atoms, the vastness\nof the space of possible configurations poses a formidable challenge to any\nsimulation of complex atomic and molecular systems. We introduce a\ncomputational method to reduce the complexity of atomic configuration space by\nsystematically recognising hierarchical levels of atomic structure, and\nidentifying the individual components. Given a list of atomic coordinates, a\nnetwork is generated based on the distances between the atoms. Using the\ntechnique of modularity optimisation, the network is decomposed into modules.\nThis procedure can be performed at different resolution levels, leading to a\ndecomposition of the system at different scales, from which hierarchical\nstructure can be identified. By considering the amount of information required\nto represent a given modular decomposition we can furthermore find the most\nsuccinct descriptions of a given atomic ensemble. Our straightforward,\nautomatic and general approach is applied to complex crystal structures. We\nshow that modular decomposition of these structures considerably simplifies\nconfiguration space, which in turn can be used in discovery of novel crystal\nstructures, and opens up a pathway towards accelerated molecular dynamics of\ncomplex atomic ensembles. The power of this approach is demonstrated by the\nidentification of a possible allotrope of boron containing 56 atoms in the\nprimitive unit cell, which we uncover using an accelerated structure search,\nbased on a modular decomposition of a known dense phase of boron,\n$\\gamma$-B$_{28}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 13:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

We hypothesize that (i)\ncommunication with peers, defined as callers of similar age, will be most\nimportant during the period of family formation and that (ii) the importance of\nbest friends defined as same-sex callers of exactly the same age, will be\nstronger for women than for men.

Partly in line with the second hypothesis, the increase in\nphone calls turned out to be particularly pronounced among females, although\nthere were only minor gender differences in call frequencies. Furthermore,\nwomen tended to have long phone conversations with their same-age female\nfriend, and also with somewhat older peers.

Two methods\nare discussed for enabling the remote control of a vehicle (in this case, an\nelectric 2013 Ford Focus). The first approach used digital filtering of\nController Area Network (CAN) messages. In the case of the test vehicle, this\napproach allowed for the control of acceleration from a tap-point on the CAN\nbus and the OBD-II port. The second approach, based on the emulation of the\nanalog output(s) of a vehicle's accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering\ntorque sensors, is more generally applicable and, in the test vehicle, allowed\nfor the full control vehicle acceleration, braking, and steering. To\ndemonstrate the utility of the testbed for vehicle automation research, system\nidentification was performed on the test vehicle and speed and steering\ncontrollers were designed to allow the vehicle to follow a predetermined path.\nThe resulting system was shown to be differentially flat, and a high level path\nfollowing algorithm was developed using the differentially flat properties and\nstate feedback. The path following algorithm is experimentally validated on the\nautomation testbed developed in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 15:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Our\nproof extends work of Druskin and Knizhnerman [DK91], leveraging the stability\nof the classic Chebyshev recurrence to bound the stability of any polynomial\napproximating $f(x)$.\n  We also study the special case of $f(A) = A^{-1}$, where stronger guarantees\nhold. In exact arithmetic Lanczos performs as well as the best polynomial\napproximating $1/x$ at each of $A$'s eigenvalues, rather than on the full\neigenvalue range. In seminal work, Greenbaum gives an approach to extending\nthis bound to finite precision: she proves that finite precision Lanczos and\nthe related CG method match any polynomial approximating $1/x$ in a tiny range\naround each eigenvalue [Gre89].\n  For $A^{-1}$, this bound appears stronger than ours. However, we exhibit\nmatrices with condition number $\\kappa$ where exact arithmetic Lanczos\nconverges in $polylog(\\kappa)$ iterations, but Greenbaum's bound predicts\n$\\Omega(\\kappa^{1/5})$ iterations. It thus cannot offer significant improvement\nover the $O(\\kappa^{1/2})$ bound achievable via our result. Our analysis raises\nthe question of if convergence in less than $poly(\\kappa)$ iterations can be\nexpected in finite precision, even for matrices with clustered, skewed, or\notherwise favorable eigenvalue distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 15:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}
