We show that\nthe on-site interaction $U$ of Re induces orbital ordering (denoted COO), with\neach Re site having an occupied $d_{xy}$ orbital and a C-type alternation among\n$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$, resulting in an insulating state consistent with\nexperimentally determined insulators Sr$_2$CrReO$_6$, Ca$_2$CrReO$_6$, and\nCa$_2$FeReO$_6$. The threshold value of $U_{Re}$ for orbital ordering is\nreduced by inducing $E_g$ octahedral distortions of the same C-type wavelength\n(denoted COD), which serves as a structural signature of the orbital ordering;\noctahedral tilting also reduces the threshold. The COO, and the concomitant\nCOD, are a spontaneously broken symmetry for the Sr based materials (i.e.\n$a^0a^0c^-$ tilt pattern), while not for the Ca based systems (i.e. $a^-a^-b^+$\ntilt pattern).

Alternatively,\nCSIT can be estimated by assuming a model for the propagation channel, whereas\nthis model is only validated in millimeter-wave (mmWave) band thanks to its\npoor scattering nature. In this paper, we focus on time division duplex (TDD)\nsystems with hybrid beamforming structure and propose a reciprocity calibration\nscheme that allows to acquire full CSIT.

Self-force phenomena such as these have been poorly understood\nfor spacetime dimensions not equal to four, despite the relevance of differing\ndimensionalities for holographic duals, effectively two-dimensional condensed\nmatter and fluid systems, and so on. We remedy this by showing that forces and\ntorques acting on extended electromagnetic charges in all dimensions $d \\geq 3$\nhave the same functional form as the usual test body expressions, except that\nthe electromagnetic field appearing in those expressions is not the physical\none; it is an effective surrogate. For arbitrary even $d \\geq 4$, our surrogate\nfield locally satisfies the source-free field equations, and is conceptually\nvery similar to what arises in the Detweiler-Whiting prescription previously\nestablished when $d=4$. The odd-dimensional case is different, involving\neffective fields which are not necessarily source-free. Moreover, we find a\n1-parameter family of natural effective fields for each odd $d$, where the free\nparameter--a lengthscale--is degenerate with (finite) renormalizations of a\nbody's stress-energy tensor. While different parameter choices can result in\ndifferent forces, they do so without affecting physical observables. Having\nestablished these general results, explicit point-particle self-forces are\nderived in odd-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes. Simple examples are discussed\nfor $d=3$ and $d=5$, one of which illustrates that the particularly slow decay\nof fields in three spacetime dimensions results in particles creating their own\n\"preferred rest frames:\" Initially-static charges which are later perturbed\nhave a strong tendency to return to rest.

This implies $\\varrho(E) \\sim\n|E|^2$ scaling of the density of states (DoS) at low energies in the clean\nlimit, or $\\varrho(E) \\sim |E|$ over a wide critical region in the presence of\ndisorder. The latter is consistent with the $T$-dependence of the penetration\ndepth in the half-Heusler compound YPtBi. We enumerate routes for experimental\nverification, including specific heat, thermal conductivity, NMR relaxation\ntime, and topological Fermi arcs. Nucleation of any $d$-wave pairing also\ncauses a small lattice distortion and induces an $s$-wave component; this gives\na route to strain-engineer exotic $s+d$ pairings. We also consider odd-parity,\nfully gapped $p$-wave superconductivity. For hole doping, a gapless Majorana\nfluid with cubic dispersion appears at the surface. We invent a generalized\nsurface model with $\\nu$-fold dispersion to simulate a bulk with winding number\n$\\nu$. Using exact diagonalization, we show that disorder drives the surface\ninto a critically delocalized phase, with universal DoS and multifractal\nscaling consistent with the conformal field theory (CFT) SO($n$)${}_\\nu$, where\n$n \\rightarrow 0$ counts replicas. This is contrary to the naive expectation of\na surface thermal metal, and implies that the topology tunes the surface\nrenormalization group to the CFT in the presence of disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 15:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

The trends in this sample suggest that normal\nhigh-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared to average z <\n4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies.

However, such formulations\noften require solving for a matrix of the size of the data matrix, making it\nchallenging to apply them to large scale datasets. Moreover, in many\napplications the data can display structures beyond simply being low-rank,\ne.g., images and videos present complex spatio-temporal structures that are\nlargely ignored by standard low-rank methods. In this paper we study a matrix\nfactorization technique that is suitable for large datasets and captures\nadditional structure in the factors by using a particular form of\nregularization that includes well-known regularizers such as total variation\nand the nuclear norm as particular cases. Although the resulting optimization\nproblem is non-convex, we show that if the size of the factors is large enough,\nunder certain conditions, any local minimizer for the factors yields a global\nminimizer. A few practical algorithms are also provided to solve the matrix\nfactorization problem, and bounds on the distance from a given approximate\nsolution of the optimization problem to the global optimum are derived.\nExamples in neural calcium imaging video segmentation and hyperspectral\ncompressed recovery show the advantages of our approach on high-dimensional\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 18:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

The final prediction is made based on features from both the neural\nnetwork encoder and the kNN memory. Experimental results on several standard\nbenchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline model on all\nthe datasets, and it even beats a very deep neural network model (with 29\nlayers) in several datasets.

One way is to\ndirectly apply a mature dependency graph learned from a source domain to the\ntarget domain. But due to the domain variety problem, directly using the source\ndependency graph often can not achieve good performance. Traditional transfer\nlearning methods mainly focus on numerical data and are not applicable.\n  In this paper, we propose ACRET, a knowledge transfer based model for\naccelerating dependency graph learning from heterogeneous categorical event\nstreams. In particular, we first propose an entity estimation model to filter\nout irrelevant entities from the source domain based on entity embedding and\nmanifold learning. Only the entities with statistically high correlations are\ntransferred to the target domain. On the surviving entities, we propose a\ndependency construction model for constructing the unbiased dependency\nrelationships by solving a two-constraint optimization problem.

Integrated information\ntheory (IIT), offers a theoretical framework to (1) investigate the\ncompositional cause-effect structure of a system, and to (2) identify causal\nborders of highly integrated elements comprising local maxima of intrinsic\ncause-effect power. Here we apply this comprehensive causal analysis to a\nBoolean network model of the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)\ncell-cycle. We demonstrate that this biological model features a non-trivial\ncausal architecture, whose discovery may provide insights about the real cell\ncycle that could not be gained from holistic or reductionist approaches. We\nalso show how some specific properties of this underlying causal architecture\nrelate to the biological notion of autonomy. Ultimately, we suggest that\nanalysing the causal organisation of a system, including key features like\nintrinsic control and stable causal borders, should prove relevant for\ndistinguishing life from non-life, and thus could also illuminate the origin of\nlife problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 21:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

One example is finding acceptable car body styling designs based\non constraints like aesthetics and functionality. Current active-learning based\nmethods learn feasible domains for bounded input spaces. However, we usually\nlack prior knowledge about how to set those input variable bounds. Bounds that\nare too small will fail to cover all feasible domains; while bounds that are\ntoo large will waste query budget. To avoid this problem, we introduce Active\nExpansion Sampling (AES), a method that identifies (possibly disconnected)\nfeasible domains over an unbounded input space. AES progressively expands our\nknowledge of the input space, and uses successive exploitation and exploration\nstages to switch between learning the decision boundary and searching for new\nfeasible domains. We show that AES has a misclassification loss guarantee\nwithin the explored region, independent of the number of iterations or labeled\nsamples. Thus it can be used for real-time prediction of samples' feasibility\nwithin the explored region. We evaluate AES on three test examples and compare\nAES with two adaptive sampling methods -- the Neighborhood-Voronoi algorithm\nand the straddle heuristic -- that operate over fixed input variable bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 21:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 22:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 19:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

We compute the optical density\nof states, quality factors and effective mode volumes of the cavity modes, with\nand without disorder, and compare with the localized modes of the corresponding\ndisordered photonic crystal waveguide. We demonstrate how the quality factors\nand effective mode volumes saturate at a specific cavity length and become\nbounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson modes appearing in the\ndisordered waveguide. By means of the intensity fluctuation criterion, we\nobserve Anderson localization for cavity lengths larger than around L31, and\nshow that the field confinement in the disordered LN cavities is mainly\ndetermined by the local characteristics of the structural disorder as long as\nthe confinement region is far enough from the cavity mirrors and the effective\nmode localization length is much smaller than the cavity length; under this\nregime, the disordered cavity system becomes insensitive to changes in the\ncavity boundaries and a good agreement with the intensity fluctuation criterion\nis found for localization.

Here, an analysis of the energetics of nanometric precipitates of\nthe meta-stable $\\beta''$ phases is performed, identifying the bulk, elastic\nstrain and interface energies that contribute to the stability of a nucleating\ncluster.

By caching input and intermediate data in memory,\ncompute tasks can witness speedup by orders of magnitude. To maximize the\nchance of in-memory data access, existing cache algorithms, be it recency- or\nfrequency-based, settle on cache hit ratio as the optimization objective.\nHowever, unlike the conventional belief, we show in this paper that simply\npursuing a higher cache hit ratio of individual data blocks does not\nnecessarily translate into faster task completion in data-parallel\nenvironments. A data-parallel task typically depends on multiple input data\nblocks. Unless all of these blocks are cached in memory, no speedup will\nresult. To capture this all-or-nothing property, we propose a more relevant\nmetric, called effective cache hit ratio. Specifically, a cache hit of a data\nblock is said to be effective if it can speed up a compute task. In order to\noptimize the effective cache hit ratio, we propose the Least Effective\nReference Count (LERC) policy that persists the dependent blocks of a compute\ntask as a whole in memory. We have implemented the LERC policy as a memory\nmanager in Spark and evaluated its performance through Amazon EC2 deployment.\nEvaluation results demonstrate that LERC helps speed up data-parallel jobs by\nup to 37% compared with the widely employed least-recently-used (LRU) policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 07:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Based on the phase transition dynamics from magnetized warm neutral\nmedium to molecular clouds, Kobayashi et al. 2017 proposes a semi-analytical\nevolutionary description for GMC mass functions including cloud-cloud collision\n(CCC) process. Their results show that CCC is less dominant in shaping the mass\nfunction of GMCs compared with the accretion of dense HI gas driven by the\npropagation of supersonic shock waves. However, their formulation does not take\ninto account the possible enhancement of star formation by CCC. Radio\nobservations within the Milky Way indicate the importance of CCC for the\nformation of star clusters and massive stars. In this article, we reformulate\nthe time evolution equation largely modified from Kobayashi et al. 2017 so that\nwe additionally compute star formation subsequently taking place in CCC clouds.\nOur results suggest that, although CCC events between smaller clouds outnumber\nthe ones between massive GMCs, CCC-driven star formation is mostly driven by\nmassive GMCs > 10^5.5 Msun (where Msun is the solar mass). The resultant\ncumulative CCC-driven star formation may amount to a few 10 percent of the\ntotal star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 08:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 05:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

On the other hand, rigorous methods such as the\nexponential mechanism for differential privacy are often computationally\nimpractical to use for releasing high dimensional data or cannot preserve high\nutility of original data due to their extensive data perturbation.\n  This paper presents a criterion called plausible deniability that provides a\nformal privacy guarantee, notably for releasing sensitive datasets: an output\nrecord can be released only if a certain amount of input records are\nindistinguishable, up to a privacy parameter. This notion does not depend on\nthe background knowledge of an adversary. Also, it can efficiently be checked\nby privacy tests. We present mechanisms to generate synthetic datasets with\nsimilar statistical properties to the input data and the same format. We study\nthis technique both theoretically and experimentally.

It is\nassumed that there exists an adversary which wants to eavesdrop on the\ninformation transmission from the base station (BS) to CUs. Since D2D\ncommunication shares the same spectrum with cellular network, cross\ninterference must be considered. However, when secrecy capacity is considered,\nthe interference caused by D2D communication can help to improve the secrecy\ncommunications by confusing the eavesdroppers. Since both systems share the\nsame spectrum, cross interference must be considered. We formulate the proposed\nresource allocation into an optimization problem whose objective is to maximize\nthe average transmission rate of D2D pair in the presence of the cellular\ncommunications under average transmission power constraint. For the cellular\nnetwork, we require a minimum average achievable secrecy rate in the absence of\nD2D communication as well as a maximum secrecy outage probability in the\npresence of D2D communication which should be satisfied.

The essence of their assembly dynamics can be understood from a\nsimpler mathematical model that combines elements of classical nucleation\ntheory with continuum elasticity.

Here we present new trends\nin the study of radiation effects in solid methane. We particularly focus on\nrelaxation phenomena in solid methane pre-irradiated by energetic neutrons and\nelectron beam. We compare experimental results obtained in the temperature\nrange from 10K to 100K with a model based on the assumption that radiolysis\ndefect recombinations happen in two stages, at two different temperatures. In\nthe case of slow heating up of the solid methane sample, irradiated at 10K, the\nfirst wave of recombination occurs around 20K with a further second wave taking\nplace between 50 and 60K. We also discuss the role of the recombination\nmechanisms in burp phenomenon discovered by J. Carpenter in the late 1980s. An\nunderstanding of these mechanisms is vital for the designing and operation of\nsolid methane moderators used in advanced neutron sources and could also be a\npossible explanation for the driving forces behind cryo-volcanism on celestial\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 14:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

At the microscopic level, firms\nare growing at different rates while also being exposed to idiosyncratic shocks\nat the firm and sector level. We describe such fluctuations as independent\nL\\'evy-stable fluctuations, varying over multiple orders of magnitude. These\nfluctuations are aggregated and measured at the macroscopic level in averaged\neconomic output quantities such as GDP. A fundamental question is thereby to\nwhat extend individual firm size fluctuations can have a noticeable impact on\nthe overall economy. We argue that this question can be answered by considering\nthe L\\'evy fluctuations as embedded in a steep confining potential well,\nensuring nonlinear mean-reversal behavior, without having to rely on\nmicroscopic details of the system. The steepness of the potential well directly\ncontrols the extend towards which idiosyncratic shocks to firms and sectors are\ndamped at the level of the economy. Additionally, the theory naturally accounts\nfor business cycles, represented in terms of a bimodal economic output\ndistribution, and thus connects two so far unrelated fields in economics. By\nanalyzing 200 years of US GDP growth rates, we find that the model is in good\nagreement with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 02:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
