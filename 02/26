The\nresults so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the\nrotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus\nindicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at\nwork. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13\nlow-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first\nnominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied\npreviously Corsaro et al. 2015, which not only have a large number of extracted\noscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications We aim to\nextend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by\ntheoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive\nthe rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these\nmethods with each other. We built seismic models using a grid search combined\nwith a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing\nBayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those\nobtained using a previously developed model-independent method. We find that\nthe cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster\nthan their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation\nrates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets,\nwhile some discrepancies exist for others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Yet, the presence of proton dynamics, observed already by us for DNA\nin the gas phase, and its impact on protein structural determinants, have not\nbeen investigated so far. Here, we address this issue by a multi-step\nsimulation strategy on a pharmacologically relevant peptide, the N-terminal\nresidues of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-16)). Our calculations reproduce the\nexperimental maximum charge state from ESI-MS and are also in fair agreement\nwith collision cross section (CCS) data measured here by ESI/IM-MS. Although\nthe main structural features are preserved, subtle conformational changes do\ntake place in the first ~0.1 ms of dynamics. In addition, intramolecular proton\ndynamics processes occur on the ps-timescale in the gas phase as emerging from\nquantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations at the B3LYP level of\ntheory. We conclude that proton transfer phenomena do occur frequently during\nfly time in ESI-MS experiments (typically on the ms timescale). However, the\nstructural changes associated with the process do not significantly affect the\nstructural determinants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 17:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

It is difficult\nto achieve good alignment and it is easy to break image structures due to\ninsufficient and unreliable point correspondences. Moreover, because of the\nviewpoint variations between multiple images, the stitched images suffer from\nprojective distortions. To solve these problems, this paper presents a\nline-guided local warping method with a global similarity constraint for image\nstitching. Line features which serve well for geometric descriptions and scene\nconstraints, are employed to guide image stitching accurately. On one hand, the\nline features are integrated into a local warping model through a designed\nweight function. On the other hand, line features are adopted to impose strong\ngeometric constraints, including line correspondence and line colinearity, to\nimprove the stitching performance through mesh optimization. To mitigate\nprojective distortions, we adopt a global similarity constraint, which is\nintegrated with the projective warps via a designed weight strategy. This\nconstraint causes the final warp to slowly change from a projective to a\nsimilarity transformation across the image. Finally, the images undergo a\ntwo-stage alignment scheme that provides accurate alignment and reduces\nprojective distortion. We evaluate our method on a series of images and compare\nit with several other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method provides a convincing stitching performance and that it\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 18:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 09:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

We illustrate the advantages of using\nthe SVR model over traditional regression method which finds line parameters in\ndistribution grids. Specifically, the SVR model is robust enough to recover the\nmapping rules while the regression method fails when 1) there are measurement\noutliers and missing data, 2) there are active controllers, or 3) measurements\nare only available at some part of a distribution grid. We demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our method through extensive numerical validation on\ndifferent scales of distribution grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 21:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 03:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-05"}

However, despite the many advances in this field, its\nimpact and penetration in our daily life has been hindered by a convoluted and\niterative process, cycling through modeling, nanofabrication and\nnano-characterization. The fundamental reason is the fact that not only the\nprediction of the optical response is very time consuming and requires solving\nMaxwell's equations with dedicated numerical packages. But, more significantly,\nthe inverse problem, i.e. designing a nanostructure with an on-demand optical\nresponse, is currently a prohibitive task even with the most advanced numerical\ntools due to the high non-linearity of the problem.

Therefore, how to generate land-use, urban density, and\npopulation distribution maps at a fine scale using VHR satellite images has\nbecome a hot topic. Previous studies have focused solely on individual tasks\nwith elaborate hand-crafted features and have ignored the relationship between\ndifferent tasks. In this study, we aim to propose a universal framework which\ncan: 1) automatically learn the internal feature representation from the raw\nimage data; and 2) simultaneously produce fine-scale land-use, urban density,\nand population distribution maps. For the first target, a deep convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is applied to learn the hierarchical feature\nrepresentation from the raw image data. For the second target, a novel\nCNN-based universal framework is proposed to process the VHR satellite images\nand generate the land-use, urban density, and population distribution maps.

Global peer ranking is one such mechanism. In this mechanism, peers are\nranked based on a metric called contribution index. Contribution index is\ndefined in such a manner that peers are motivated to share the resources in the\nnetwork. Fairness in the terms of upload to download ratio in each peer can be\nachieved by this method. However, calculation of contribution index is not\ntrivial. It is computed distributively and iteratively in the entire network\nand requires strict clock synchronization among the peers. A very small error\nin clock synchronization may lead to wrong results. Furthermore, iterative\ncalculation requires a lot of message overhead and storage capacity, which\nmakes its implementation more complex. In this paper, we are proposing a simple\nincentive mechanism based on the contributions of peers, which can balance the\nupload and download amount of resources in each peer.

Due to a low spatial resolution, a pixel of a\nhyperspectral image rarely represents a single material, but rather a mixture\nof different spectra. HSU aims at estimating the pure spectra present in the\nscene of interest, referred to as endmembers, and their fractions in each\npixel, referred to as abundances. Today, many HSU algorithms have been\nproposed, based either on a geometrical or statistical model. While most\nmethods assume that the number of endmembers present in the scene is known,\nthere is only little work about estimating this number from the observed data.\nIn this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework that jointly\nestimates the number of endmembers, the endmembers itself, and their\nabundances, by making use of the Indian Buffet Process as a prior for the\nendmembers. Simulation results and experiments on real data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm, yielding results comparable with\nstate-of-the-art methods while being able to reliably infer the number of\nendmembers. In scenarios with strong noise, where other algorithms provide only\npoor results, the proposed approach tends to overestimate the number of\nendmembers slightly. The additional endmembers, however, often simply represent\nnoisy replicas of present endmembers and could easily be merged in a\npost-processing step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 09:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Load data, collected at\nhigher geographical granularity and frequency through thousands of smart\nmeters, allows us to build a more accurate local load forecasting model, which\nis essential for local optimization of power load through demand side\nmanagement. With this paper, we show how several existing approaches for STLF\nare not applicable on local load forecasting, either because of long training\ntime, unstable optimization process, or sensitivity to hyper-parameters.\nAccordingly, we select five models suitable for local STFL, which can be\ntrained on different time-series with limited intervention from the user. The\nexperiment, which consists of 40 time-series collected at different locations\nand aggregation levels, revealed that yearly pattern and temperature\ninformation are only useful for high aggregation level STLF. On local STLF\ntask, the modified version of double seasonal Holt-Winter proposed in this\npaper performs relatively well with only 3 months of training data, compared to\nmore complex methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 12:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Previous work introduced a technique called\nsingle-pass restore, which increases restore bandwidth and thus substantially\ndecreases time to repair. Instant restore goes further as it permits read/write\naccess to any data on a device undergoing restore--even data not yet\nrestored--by restoring individual data segments on demand. Thus, the restore\nprocess is guided primarily by the needs of applications, and the observed mean\ntime to repair is effectively reduced from several hours to a few seconds.\n  This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of instant restore.

Lower and upper bounds are derived on the\ncapacity-memory tradeoff, i.e., on the largest rate of reliable communication\nover the BC as a function of the receivers' cache sizes, and the bounds are\nshown to match for some special cases. The lower bounds are achieved by two new\ncoding schemes that benefit from non-uniform cache assignment. Lower and upper\nbounds are also established on the global capacity-memory tradeoff, i.e., on\nthe largest capacity-memory tradeoff that can be attained by optimizing the\nreceivers' cache sizes subject to a total cache memory budget. The bounds\ncoincide when the total cache memory budget is sufficiently small or\nsufficiently large, characterized in terms of the BC statistics. For small\ncache memories, it is optimal to assign all the cache memory to the weakest\nreceiver. In this regime, the global capacity-memory tradeoff grows as the\ntotal cache memory budget divided by the number of files in the system. In\nother words, a perfect global caching gain is achievable in this regime and the\nperformance corresponds to a system where all cache contents in the network are\navailable to all receivers. For large cache memories, it is optimal to assign a\npositive cache memory to every receiver such that the weaker receivers are\nassigned larger cache memories compared to the stronger receivers. In this\nregime, the growth rate of the global capacity-memory tradeoff is further\ndivided by the number of users, which corresponds to a local caching gain.\nNumerical indicate suggest that a uniform cache-assignment of the total cache\nmemory is suboptimal in all regimes unless the BC is completely symmetric. For\nerasure BCs, this claim is proved analytically in the regime of small\ncache-sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 15:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}
