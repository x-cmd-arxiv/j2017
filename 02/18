With ever-growing sizes and amounts of three-dimensional\nimages to be processed, there is a need for better and faster segmentation\nmethods. Graph-based image segmentation has seen a rise in popularity in recent\nyears, but is seen as very costly with regard to computational demand. We\npropose a new segmentation algorithm which overcomes these limitations. Our\nmethod uses recursive balanced graph partitioning to segment foreground\ncomponents of a fast and efficient binarization. We construct a model for the\ncell nuclei to guide the partitioning process. Our algorithm is compared to\nother state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms in an experimental evaluation on\ntwo sets of realistically simulated inputs. Our method is faster, has similar\nor better quality and an acceptable memory overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

Aim: To analyze the physical mechanisms that cause\nasymmetries and surface structures in observed images, we use detailed 3D\ndynamical simulations of AGB stars; these simulations self-consistently\ndescribe convection and pulsations. Methods: We used the CO5BOLD\nradiation-hydrodynamics code to produce an exploratory grid of global\n\"star-in-a-box\" models of the outer convective envelope and the inner\natmosphere of AGB stars to study convection, pulsations, and shock waves and\ntheir dependence on stellar and numerical parameters. Results: The model\ndynamics are governed by the interaction of long-lasting giant convection\ncells, short-lived surface granules, and strong, radial, fundamental-mode\npulsations. Radial pulsations and shorter wavelength, traveling, acoustic waves\ninduce shocks on various scales in the atmosphere. Convection, waves, and\nshocks all contribute to the dynamical pressure and, thus, to an increase of\nthe stellar radius and to a levitation of material into layers where dust can\nform. Consequently, the resulting relation of pulsation period and stellar\nradius is shifted toward larger radii compared to that of non-linear 1D models.\nThe dependence of pulsation period on luminosity agrees well with observed\nrelations. The interaction of the pulsation mode with the non-stationary\nconvective flow causes occasional amplitude changes and phase shifts. The\nregularity of the pulsations decreases with decreasing gravity as the relative\nsize of convection cells increases. The model stars do not have a well-defined\nsurface. Instead, the light is emitted from a very extended inhomogeneous\natmosphere with a complex dynamic pattern of high-contrast features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

The integrated CO 6-5 intensity is\naligned with the previously discovered jet/outflow of NGC1377 and is tracing\nthe dense (n>1e4 cm-3), hot gas at the base of the outflow. The velocity\nstructure is complex and shifts across the jet/outflow are discussed in terms\nof jet-rotation or separate, overlapping kinematical components. High velocity\ngas (deltaV +-145 km/s) is detected inside r<2-3 pc and we suggest that it is\nemerging from an inclined rotating disk or torus of position angle PA=140+-20\ndeg with a dynamical mass of approx 3e6 Msun. This mass is consistent with that\nof a supermassive black hole (SMBH), as inferred from the M-sigma relation. The\ngas mass of the proposed disk/torus constitutes <3% of the nuclear dynamical\nmass.

The extreme radio quietness, and the lack\nof emission from other star formation tracers, raise questions on the origin of\nthe FIR emission.

Our behavioral analytics framework involves\nthree steps: first, we develop a behavioral model that describes the\ndecision-making process of an agent; second, we use data to estimate behavioral\nmodel parameters for each agent and then use these estimates to predict future\ndecisions of each agent; and third, we use the estimated behavioral model\nparameters to optimize a set of costly incentives to provide to each agent.

Let $\\Gamma \\subset\n\\mathbb R^n$ be an Ahlfors regular set of dimension $d<n-1$ (not necessarily\ninteger) and $\\Omega = \\mathbb R^n \\setminus \\Gamma$.

Before or during the actual\nsolving process, such procedures identify and remove clauses that are\nirrelevant to the solving result. These simplifications usually rely on\nso-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of\na clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. One\nparticularly successful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because\nit generalizes several other redundancy properties. To find out whether a\nclause is blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its\nresolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved. For\nthis reason, we say that the redundancy property of blocked clauses is local.\nIn this paper, we show that there exist local redundancy properties that are\neven more general than blocked clauses. We present a semantic notion of\nblocking and prove that it constitutes the most general local redundancy\nproperty. We furthermore introduce the syntax-based notions of set-blocking and\nsuper-blocking, and show that the latter coincides with our semantic blocking\nnotion. In addition, we show how semantic blocking can be alternatively\ncharacterized via Davis and Putnam's rule for eliminating atomic formulas.\nFinally, we perform a detailed complexity analysis and relate our novel\nredundancy properties to prominent redundancy properties from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 13:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 08:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

However, these\nISP-centric approaches for traffic management do not always match the interests\nof mobile users. Users face a complex, multi-dimensional tradeoff between cost,\nthroughput, and delay in making their offloading decisions: while they may save\nmoney and receive a higher throughput by waiting for WiFi access, they may not\nwait for WiFi if they are sensitive to delay. To navigate this tradeoff, we\ndevelop AMUSE (Adaptive bandwidth Management through USer-Empowerment), a\nfunctional prototype of a practical, cost-aware WiFi offloading system that\ntakes into account a user's throughput-delay tradeoffs and cellular budget\nconstraint. Based on predicted future usage and WiFi availability, AMUSE\ndecides which applications to offload to what times of the day. Since nearly\nall traffic flows from mobile devices are TCP flows, we introduce a new\nreceiver-side bandwidth allocation mechanism to practically enforce the\nassigned rate of each TCP application. Thus, AMUSE users can optimize their\nbandwidth rates according to their own cost-throughput-delay tradeoff without\nrelying on support from different apps' content servers.

Also, a classical mathematical feature is that\n(fractional) parabolic equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with\nthe case of hyperbolic equations, which typically exhibit shocks and\ndiscontinuities. In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly\nramified structure, somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce\na fractional diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a\nhyperbolic equation. This could suggest that the high ramification of the\nPurkinje cells might have provided an evolutionary advantage of \"smoothing\" the\ntransmission of signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of\nslowing a bit such transmission). Although an experimental confirmation of the\npossibility of such evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this\npaper, we think that it is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to\nconsider the time fractional diffusion as arising from the superposition of\ndelayed travelling waves in highly ramified transmission media. The case of a\ntravelling concave parabola with sufficiently small curvature is explicitly\ncomputed. The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and\nhyperbolic equation also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm\nrelating time fractional diffusion with parabolic equations in the limit.

Therefore, a\ndirection-aware descriptor is designed, denoted as GHOG, a combination of Gabor\nand HOG, which is extremely valuable for localizing the defect region. Upon\ndevising a powerful directional descriptor, an efficient low-rank decomposition\nmodel is constructed to divide the matrix generated by the directional feature\nextracted from image blocks into a low-rank matrix (background information) and\na sparse matrix (defect information). A nonconvex log det(.) as a smooth\nsurrogate function for the rank instead of the nuclear norm is also exploited\nto improve the efficiency of the low-rank model.

Consider a random poll of sample size $n$\nconducted on a population of individuals, where each pollee is asked to answer\n$d$ binary questions. We consider one of the two polling impediments: (a) in\nlossy population recovery, a pollee may skip each question with probability\n$\\epsilon$, (b) in noisy population recovery, a pollee may lie on each question\nwith probability $\\epsilon$. Given $n$ lossy or noisy samples, the goal is to\nestimate the probabilities of all $2^d$ binary vectors simultaneously within\naccuracy $\\delta$ with high probability.\n  This paper settles the sample complexity of population recovery.

This light-induced refractive-index\nchange hampers the use of CLN when high-power densities are in play, a typical\nregime in integrated optics. The resistance to PRD can be largely improved by\ndoping the lithium-niobate substrates with magnesium oxide. However, the\nfabrication of waveguides on MgO-doped substrates is not as effective as for\nCLN: either the resistance to PRD is strongly reduced by the waveguide\nfabrication process (as it happens in Ti-indiffused waveguides) or the\nnonlinear conversion efficiency is lowered (as it occurs in annealed-proton\nexchange). Here we fabricate, for the first time, waveguides starting from\nMgO-doped substrates using the Soft-Proton Exchange (SPE) technique and we show\nthat this third way represents a promising alternative. We demonstrate that SPE\nallows to produce refractive-index profiles almost identical to those produced\non CLN without reducing the nonlinearity in the substrate. We also prove that\nthe SPE does not affect substantially the resistance to PRD.

Due\nto phase ambiguity, a unique estimation can only be obtained within the\nunambiguous distance (UD), which depends on the carrier frequencies used for\nranging. Without external information, the maximum measurable distance of an\nMPR system is defined by its UD. The MPR system employing random frequency\nhopping (FH) waveform has a strong anti-jamming capability and sees promising\npotentials in many fields. However, it is challenging to depict its measurable\ndistance. Different from current MPR system employing deterministic\nfrequencies, the carrier frequency under the FH waveform hops randomly within\nthe occupied bandwidth. Consequently, the UD is a random variable. In this\npaper, we try to find a deterministic value to depict the UD of an MPR system\nunder the random spaced frequencies (RSF) configuration, serving as a metric of\nits measurable distance in engineering applications. It is safe to adopt the\nlower bound of the random UD as the metric, but the measurable distance may be\ndrastically underestimated. Alternatively, we propose to adopt the upper bound\nof the random UD as the metric, because when the RSF set contains more than a\ndozen of carriers, i) we prove the probability that the random UD obtains its\nupper bound is very close to 1 if phase noise is not introduced; ii)\nsimulations show that the upper bound can also be obtained reliably in the\npresence of phase noise. As a comparison, the practical measurable range of the\nMPR system under the traditional linearly spaced frequencies (LSF)\nconfiguration is only a fraction of its theoretical UD because the UD is more\nsensitive to phase error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 14:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

This type of\nword-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of\nthe syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus.\nThis, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification\ntasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general\npractice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be\ninferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations.

This\npaper presents calculations of reactor antineutrino interactions from\nquasi-elastic neutrino-proton scattering and elastic neutrino-electron\nscattering in a water-based detector operated $\\gtrsim10$ km from a commercial\npower reactor. It separately calculates signal from the proximal reactor and\nbackground from all other registered reactors. The main results are\ndifferential and integral interaction rates from the quasi-elastic and elastic\nprocesses. There are two underground facilities capable of hosting a detector\n($\\sim1$ kT H$_2$O) project nearby ($L\\sim20$ km) an operating commercial\nreactor ($P_{th}\\sim3$ GW). These reactor-site combinations, which are under\nconsideration for project WATCHMAN, are Perry-Morton on the southern shore of\nLake Erie in the United States and Hartlepool-Boulby on the western shore of\nthe North Sea in England. The signal rate from the proximal reactor is about\nfive times greater at the Morton site than at the Boulby site due to shorter\nreactor-site separation distance, larger reactor thermal power, and greater\nneutrino oscillation survival probability. Although the background rate from\nall other reactors is larger at Morton than at Boulby, it is a smaller fraction\nof the signal rate from the proximal reactor at Morton than at Boulby.\nMoreover, the Hartlepool power plant has two cores whereas the Perry plant has\na single core. The Boulby site, therefore, offers an opportunity for remotely\nmonitoring the on/off cycle of a reactor core under more stringent conditions\nthan does the Morton site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Existing segmentation procedures typically detect more than 90% of\noverstory trees, yet they barely detect 60% of understory trees because of the\nocclusion effect of higher canopy layers. Although understory trees provide\nlimited financial value, they are an essential component of ecosystem\nfunctioning by offering habitat for numerous wildlife species and influencing\nstand development. Here we model the occlusion effect in terms of point\ndensity. We estimate the fractions of points representing different canopy\nlayers (one overstory and multiple understory) and also pinpoint the required\ndensity for reasonable tree segmentation (where accuracy plateaus). We show\nthat at a density of ~170 pt/m-sqr understory trees can likely be segmented as\naccurately as overstory trees. Given the advancements of LiDAR sensor\ntechnology, point clouds will affordably reach this required density. Using\nmodern computational approaches for big data, the denser point clouds can\nefficiently be processed to ultimately allow accurate remote quantification of\nforest resources. The methodology can also be adopted for other similar remote\nsensing or advanced imaging applications such as geological subsurface\nmodelling or biomedical tissue analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 01:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

The learned profile can then be\nused to make good recommendations to the cold user. In the absence of a good\ninitial profile, the recommendations are like random probes, but if not chosen\njudiciously, both bad recommendations and too many recommendations may turn off\na user. We formalize the cold-start user problem by asking what are the $b$\nbest items we should recommend to a cold-start user, in order to learn her\nprofile most accurately, where $b$, a given budget, is typically a small\nnumber. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem and present\nmultiple non-trivial results, including NP-hardness as well as hardness of\napproximation. We furthermore show that the objective function, i.e., the least\nsquare error of the learned profile w.r.t. the true user profile, is neither\nsubmodular nor supermodular, suggesting efficient approximations are unlikely\nto exist. Finally, we discuss several scalable heuristic approaches for\nidentifying the $b$ best items to recommend to the user and experimentally\nevaluate their performance on 4 real datasets.
