Non-functional requirements\n(NFRs), like reusability, further play a vital role in software and systems\nengineering, but are often neglected in research and practice. It is still\nunclear how to integrate NFRs in a seamless model-based development. Goal: Our\nlong-term goal is to develop a theory on the specification of NFRs such that\nthey can be integrated in seamless model-based development. Method: Our overall\nstudy design includes a multi-staged procedure to infer an empirically founded\ntheory on specifying NFRs to support seamless modeling. In this short paper, we\npresent the study design and provide a discussion of (i) preliminary results\nobtained from a sample, and (ii) current issues related to the design.

The numerical result shows that at high\ndensities this rate is at the same order of magnitude as usual\ncollisional-radiative rates and even exceed them in certain cases. This\ndemonstrates the potential role of this rate for a better understanding of the\nheating mechanism underlying the evolution of a solid state matter to a plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 16:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

Therefore, selection of an adsorbent that can remove F$^-$ from any\nkind of feed requires models that can predict the adsorption behavior for any\ngiven set of input conditions. From our observations and as also reported by\nmany authors, the adsorption of F$^-$ is affected by the presence of many ions.\nWhen modelling the adsorption of F$^-$, it is usually taken as a single entity\ngetting adsorbed on the adsorbent. As this is not a proper assumption, a model\nwas developed which takes into account all the speciation reactions that take\nplace during adsorption, and all the species like H$^+$, OH$^-$, Na$^+$,\nCl$^-$, and NO$_3^-$ present in the solution along with F$^-$. As an\nelectrolyte system is involved, the Nernst-Planck equations were used to obtain\nthe flux of each species. Using the model, the equilibrium constants and rate\nconstants for the reactions were obtained. For one initial concentration of\nF$^-$, a reasonable fit was obtained to the batch adsorption data, except at\nshort times. Because of an uncertainty in the amount of impurity present in the\ncommercial adsorbent used, there was a significant discrepancy between\npredictions and data at higher initial concentrations of F$^-$. The present\nmodel can be applied to any charged adsorbent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 17:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

However, genomic-scale networks are high-dimensional\nmodels and are usually estimated from a relatively small number of samples.\nTherefore, their usefulness is hampered by estimation instability. In addition,\nthe complexity of the models is controlled by one or more penalization (tuning)\nparameters where small changes to these can lead to vastly different networks,\nthus making interpretation of models difficult. This necessitates the\ndevelopment of techniques to produce robust network models accompanied by\nestimation quality assessments.\n  We introduce Resampling of Penalized Estimates (ROPE): a novel statistical\nmethod for robust network modeling.

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these\ncompact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter-analogs without disrupting the\nobserved orbits. We also consider how these constraints depend on system\nproperties and find that the surface density of the planetary system is one of\nthe most important variables. Finally, we provide specific results for two\nsystems, WASP-47 and Kepler-20, for which this analysis provides interesting\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The scale factor solutions\nprovided by the model are accommodated in several branches defined in four\nregions delimited by the scale factor and the effective energy density. A\nbranch starts from a big bang singularity and describes an expanding\nmatter-dominated universe until the sudden future singularity occurs. Then, an\nexpanding branch emerges from a past singularity, reaches a maximum, reverses\nits expansion and possibly collapses into itself while another expanding branch\nemerges from the latter singularity and has a stable de Sitter phase which is\nintrinsically stable. We obtain a different piecewise scale factor which\ndescribes a contracting de Sitter universe in the distant past until the\nfinite-time future singularity happens. It emerges and continues in a\ncontracting phase, bounces at the minimum, reverses, and enters into a stable\nde Sitter phase without a dramatic final. Also, we explore the aforesaid cosmic\nscenarios by focusing on the leading contributions of some physical quantities\nnear the sudden future singularity and applying the geometric Tipler and\nKr\\'olak criteria in order to inspect the behavior of timelike geodesic curves\naround such singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

Also, within the covariant framework, we\nshow explicitly that the Hartle-Hawking state in the Regge model of quantum\ngravity is necessarily entangled. Our result is potentially relevant for the\nquantum-to-classical transition, taken within the framework of the decoherence\nprogramme: due to the gauge symmetry requirements, the matter does not\ndecohere, it is by default decohered by gravity. Generically, entanglement is a\nconsequence of interaction. This new entanglement could potentially, in form of\nan \"effective interaction\", bring about corrections to the weak equivalence\nprinciple, further confirming that spacetime as a smooth four-dimensional\nmanifold is an emergent phenomenon.

Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to\nthe technology that is collecting the data. However, the choice can make a big\ndifference in the properties of the dynamic network. This is the time scale\ndetection problem. In previous work, this problem is often solved with a\nheuristic as an unsupervised task. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult\nto measure how well a given algorithm performs. In addition, we show that the\nquality of the windowing is dependent on which task an analyst wants to perform\non the network after windowing. Therefore the time scale detection problem\nshould not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the\nnetwork.\n  We introduce a framework that tackles both of these issues: By measuring the\nperformance of the time scale detection algorithm based on how well a given\ntask is accomplished on the resulting network, we are for the first time able\nto directly compare different time scale detection algorithms to each other.\nUsing this framework, we introduce time scale detection algorithms that take a\nsupervised approach: they leverage ground truth on training data to find a good\nwindowing of the test data.

LORRI observed haze up to altitudes of at least 200 km\nabove Pluto's surface at solar phase angles from ~20{\\deg} to ~169{\\deg}. The\nhaze is structured with about ~20 layers, and the extinction due to haze is\ngreater in the northern hemisphere than at equatorial or southern latitudes.\nHowever, more haze layers are discerned at equatorial latitudes. A search for\ntemporal variations found no evidence for motions of haze layers (temporal\nchanges in layer altitudes) on time scales of 2 to 5 hours, but did find\nevidence of changes in haze scale height above 100 km altitude. An ultraviolet\nextinction attributable to the atmospheric haze was also detected by the ALICE\nultraviolet spectrograph on New Horizons.

Having an automated system for surgical skills\nassessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There\nhave been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using\neither video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an\nanalysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer\ndata). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for\nbasic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and\naccelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce \"entropy\nbased\" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy\n(XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of\nfluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to\nexisting methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform\n(DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment.\nResults: We report average performance of different features across all\napplicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows\nthat the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art\nmethods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better\nfor suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features\ncan improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving\nhighest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be\nachieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system\ncan significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical\nschools and teaching hospitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 21:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The\ndata chunk needed for any map task can be in memory, on a local disk, in a\nlocal rack, in the same cluster or even in another data center. Hence, unless\nthere has been much work on improving the speed of data center networks,\ndifferent levels of service rates still exist for a task depending on where its\ndata chunk is saved and from which server it receives service. Most of the\ntheoretical work on load balancing is for systems with two levels of data\nlocality including the Pandas algorithm by Xie et al. and the JSQ-MW algorithm\nby Wang et al., where the former is both throughput and heavy-traffic optimal,\nwhile the latter is only throughput optimal, but heavy-traffic optimal in only\na special traffic load. We show that an extension of the JSQ-MW algorithm for a\nsystem with thee levels of data locality is throughput optimal, but not\nheavy-traffic optimal for all loads, only for a special traffic scenario.\nFurthermore, we show that the Pandas algorithm is not even throughput optimal\nfor a system with three levels of data locality.

That this might be hoped for is based on the\ncommon belief that diversity is advantageous in many settings. We investigate\nthis in the context of routing. Our main result is a sharp characterization of\nthe network settings in which diversity always helps, versus those in which it\nis sometimes harmful. Specifically, we consider routing games, where diversity\narises in the way that users trade-off two criteria (such as time and money,\nor, in the case of stochastic delays, expectation and variance of delay). Our\nmain contributions are the following: 1) A participant-oriented measure of cost\nin the presence of user diversity, together with the identification of the\nnatural benchmark: the same cost measure for an appropriately defined average\nof the diversity. 2) A full characterization of those network topologies for\nwhich diversity always helps, for all latency functions and demands. For\nsingle-commodity routings, these are series-parallel graphs, while for\nmulti-commodity routings, they are the newly-defined \"block-matching\" networks.\nThe latter comprise a suitable interweaving of multiple series-parallel graphs\neach connecting a distinct source-sink pair. While the result for the\nsingle-commodity case may seem intuitive in light of the well-known Braess\nparadox, the two problems are different: there are instances where diversity\nhelps although the Braess paradox occurs, and vice-versa. But the main\ntechnical challenge is to establish the \"only if\" direction of the result for\nmulti-commodity networks. This follows by constructing an instance where\ndiversity hurts, and showing how to embed it in any network which is not\nblock-matching, by carefully exploiting the way the simple source-sink paths of\nthe commodities intersect in the \"non-block-matching\" portion of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 20:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 18:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

To this end, we solve the braneworld generalization of the\nstellar structure equations for a static fluid distribution with spherical\nsymmetry considering that the spacetime outside the star is described by a\nSchwarzschild metric. First, the stellar structure equations are integrated\nemploying the so called causal limit equation of state (EOS), which is\nconstructed using a well established EOS at densities below a fiducial density,\nand the causal EOS $P= \\rho$ above it. It is a standard procedure in general\nrelativistic stellar structure calculations to use such EOS for obtaining a\nlimit in the mass radius diagram, known as causal limit, above which no stellar\nconfigurations are possible if the EOS fulfills that the sound velocity is\nsmaller than the speed of light. We find that the equilibrium solutions in the\nbraneworld model can violate the general relativistic causal limit and, for\nsufficiently large mass they approach asymptotically to the Schwarzschild limit\n$M = 2 R$. Then, we investigate the properties of hadronic and strange quark\nstars using two typical EOSs. For masses below $\\sim 1.5 - 2 M_{\\odot}$, the\nmass versus radius curves show the typical behavior found within the frame of\nGeneral Relativity. However, we also find a new branch of stellar\nconfigurations that can violate the general relativistic causal limit and that\nin principle may have an arbitrarily large mass. The stars belonging to this\nnew branch are supported against collapse by the nonlocal effects of the bulk\non the brane. We also show that these stars are always stable under small\nradial perturbations. These results support the idea that traces of\nextra-dimensions might be found in astrophysics, specifically through the\nanalysis of masses and radii of compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 03:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in\ndifferent appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many\nmedical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in\nimaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired\nwith one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with\ndifferent protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated\nlegacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a\nrecurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the\nfollowing central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image\nanalysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is\nrequired for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion\nof the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number\nof the new domain training samples?

We show that\nquark EOS becomes very stiff in the presence of the strong magnetic field, and\nbecomes stiffest under the causality condition beyond the threshold strength of\n$B_c\\sim O(10^{19})$ G. This is because quarks make the Landau levels in the\npresence of the magnetic field and thereby only the lowest Landau level is\noccupied in the extreme case beyond $B_c$. Thus quarks can freely move along\nthe magnetic field with localization in the perpendicular plane, which\nresembles the quasi-one dimensional systems and gives rise to a stiff EOS.\nConsequently, we may easily produce high-mass stars beyond two solar mass.\n  As another interesting possibility, we discuss the appearance of the third\nfamily of compact stars, succeeding white dwarfs and neutron stars, before\ncollapsing into black holes.

Our starting point is an effective\nSmoluchowski equation governing the distribution function of particle's\npositions, from which we derive a memory function equation for the time\ndependence of density fluctuations in nonequilibrium steady states. With the\nbasic assumption of absence of macroscopic currents and standard mode coupling\napproximation, we can obtain expressions for the irreducible memory function\nand other relevant dynamic terms. With these equations obtained, we study the\nglassy dynamics of this thermal self-propelled particles system by\ninvestigating the Debye-Waller factor f_{q} and relaxation time \\tau_{\\alpha}\nas functions of the persistence time \\tau_{p} of self-propulsion, the single\nparticle effective temperature T_{\\text{eff}} as well as the number density\n\\rho.

Moreover, we find that significant nonaffine\nparticle displacements lead to a vanishing of the nonaffine shear modulus at\nthe transition. We interpret these observations by reformulating the Born-Huang\ntheory to account for nonaffinity, illustrating a scenario of ordered solids\nreaching a state where classical lattice dynamics fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 10:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

This solution is characterized by three\nmass scales : anisotropy $\\rho$, temperature T and chemical potential $\\mu$.

This blackbrane solution corresponds to an anisotropic phase where the\nanisotropy is small compared to the temperature and chemical potential.

Instead of the\ntraditional steady, one-dimensional solution, accretion may be episodic and not\nnecessarily symmetrical, thereby affecting the energy deposited inside the star\nand its interior structure. Given this new framework, we want to understand\nwhat controls the evolution of accreting stars. We use the MESA stellar\nevolution code with various sets of conditions. In particular, we account for\nthe (unknown) efficiency of accretion in burying gravitational energy into the\nprotostar through a parameter, $\\xi$, and we vary the amount of deuterium\npresent. We confirm the findings of previous works that the evolution changes\nsignificantly with the amount of energy that is lost during accretion. We find\nthat deuterium burning also regulates the PMS evolution. In the low-entropy\naccretion scenario, the evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram are\nsignificantly different from the classical tracks and are sensitive to the\ndeuterium content. A comparison of theoretical evolutionary tracks and\nobservations allows us to exclude some cold accretion models ($\\xi\\sim 0$) with\nlow deuterium abundances. We confirm that the luminosity spread seen in\nclusters can be explained by models with a somewhat inefficient injection of\naccretion heat. The resulting evolutionary tracks then become sensitive to the\naccretion heat efficiency, initial core entropy, and deuterium content. In this\ncontext, we predict that clusters with a higher D/H ratio should have less\nscatter in luminosity than clusters with a smaller D/H. Future work on this\nissue should include radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to determine the\nefficiency of accretion heating and further observations to investigate the\ndeuterium content in star-forming regions.

However, without loss of generality, the\napproach has been applied to second order differential equations. The proposed\nmethod has two steps. The first step consists of writing a constrained\nexpression, introduced in Ref. \\cite{Mortari}, that has embedded the\ndifferential equation constraints. These expressions are given in term of a new\nunknown function, $g (t)$, and they satisfy the constraints, no matter what $g\n(t)$ is. The second step consists of expressing $g (t)$ as a linear combination\nof $m$ independent known basis functions, $g (t) = \\mathbf{\\xi}^T \\mathbf{h}\n(t)$. Specifically, Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials of the first kind are\nadopted for the basis functions. This choice requires rewriting the\ndifferential equation and the constraints in term of a new independent\nvariable, $x\\in[-1, +1]$. The procedure leads to a set of linear equations in\nterms of the unknown coefficients vector, $\\mathbf{\\xi},$ that is then computed\nby least-squares. Numerical examples are provided to quantify the solutions\naccuracy for initial and boundary values problems as well as for a control-type\nproblem, where the state is defined in one point and the costate in another\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

We extend the Kolmogorov-Obukhov\ntheory but also narrow its scope. The models are log normal, with verification\nfrom finely resolved large eddy and direct numerical simulations. They are\nparameterized by a mean and a covariance operator. Addressing applications to\nlarge eddy simulations, the mean and the covariance depend on the resolved\nscale solution. Removing this resolved scale dependence by a locally defined\nrescaling of the turbulent statistics yields a universal theory for the subgrid\nstatistics, specifically for the mean and variance of turbulent fluctuations,\ni.e., the log of the energy dissipation rate {\\epsilon}. The variance of the\nvelocity gradient statistics is found to be log normal, in accordance with\nKolmogorov 1962. Rescaling by the resolved scale mean and variance removes the\ninfluence of the resolved scales on the subgrid scales, justifying conceptually\nthe universality we observe. The universality is the basis of new power scaling\nlaws. The new power laws, in turn, allow a simple parameterization of the mean\nand covariance of the subgrid rescaled dissipation rate, i.e., velocity\ngradient volatility. We treat the coarse grid resolved space- time location as\na random variable. A restriction of the theory to a small range of unresolved\nbut stochastically modelled scales is proposed, with renormalization group\nideas offered to overcome this restriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 02:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}
