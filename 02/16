We\ndemonstrate this technique with a detailed case study of judicial decisions to\nrelease or detain defendants while they await trial. In this application, as in\nmany policy settings, the effects of proposed decision rules cannot be directly\nobserved from historical data: if a rule recommends releasing a defendant that\nthe judge in reality detained, we do not observe what would have happened under\nthe proposed action.

To explain their strong flickering X-ray emission,\naccretion has been successfully taken into account. Nevertheless, observations\nsuggest that accretion phenomena could not be the only process behind it. An\nintense flaring activity occurring on the surface of the disk may generate a\ncorona, contribute to the thermal X-ray emission and influence the system\nstability. Our purposes are: investigating the formation of an extended corona\nabove the accretion disk, due to an intense flaring activity occurring on the\ndisk surface; studying its effects on the disk and stellar magnetosphere;\nassessing its contribution to the observed X-ray flux. We have developed a 3D\nMHD model of a IPCV. The model takes into account gravity, disk viscosity,\nthermal conduction, radiative losses and coronal flare heating. To perform a\nparameter space exploration, several system conditions have been considered,\nwith different magnetic field intensity and disk density values. From the\nresults of the evolution of the model, we have synthesized the thermal X-ray\nemission. The simulations show the formation of an extended corona, linking\ndisk and star. The flaring activity is capable of strongly influencing the disk\nconfiguration and its stability, effectively deforming the magnetic field\nlines. Hot plasma evaporation phenomena occur in the layer immediately above\nthe disk. The flaring activity gives rise to a thermal X-ray emission in both\nthe [0.1-2.0] keV and the [2.0-10] keV bands. An intense coronal activity\noccurring on the disk surface of an IPCV can affect the structure of the disk\ndepending noticeably on the density of the disk and the magnetic field of the\ncentral object. Moreover, the synthesis of the thermal X-ray fluxes shows that\nthis flaring activity may contribute to the observed thermal X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 18:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

If the star had a low obliquity, at least two\nadditional spot crossings should have been observed. They were not observed,\ngiving evidence for a high obliquity. We use a simple geometric model to show\nthat the obliquity is likely in the range 40-140$^\\circ$, i.e., both spin-orbit\nalignment and anti-alignment can be ruled out. WASP-107 thereby joins the small\ncollection of relatively low-mass stars hosting a giant planet with a high\nobliquity. Most such stars have been observed to have low obliquities; all the\nexceptions, including WASP-107, involve planets with relatively wide orbits\n(\"warm Jupiters\", with $a_{\\rm min}/R_\\star \\gtrsim 8$). This demonstrates a\nconnection between stellar obliquity and planet properties, in contradiction to\nsome theories for obliquity excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 19:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

It is an\nimportant direction for clinical research, and many statistical methods have\nbeen recently proposed. One of the primary goals of precision medicine is to\nobtain an optimal individual treatment rule (ITR), which can help make\ndecisions on treatment selection according to each patient's specific\ncharacteristics. Recently, outcome weighted learning (OWL) has been proposed to\nestimate such an optimal ITR in a binary treatment setting by maximizing the\nexpected clinical outcome. However, for ordinal treatment settings, such as\nindividualized dose finding, it is unclear how to use OWL. In this paper, we\npropose a new technique for estimating ITR with ordinal treatments. In\nparticular, we propose a data duplication technique with a piecewise convex\nloss function. We establish Fisher consistency for the resulting estimated ITR\nunder certain conditions, and obtain the convergence and risk bound properties.\nSimulated examples and two applications to datasets from an irritable bowel\nproblem and a type 2 diabetes mellitus observational study demonstrate the\nhighly competitive performance of the proposed method compared to existing\nalternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 19:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-17"}

We provide a new calibration of effective temperature vs.\nspectral type for O-type dwarfs in the LMC, based on our homogeneous analysis\nof the largest sample of such objects to date and including all spectral\nsubtypes. Good agreement with previous results is found, although the sampling\nat the earliest subtypes could be improved. Rotation rates and helium\nabundances are studied in an evolutionary context. We find that most of the\nrapid rotators (vsini higher than 300 km/s ) in our sample have masses below 25\nMSun and intermediate rotation-corrected gravities (log gc between 3.9 and\n4.1). Such rapid rotators are scarce at higher gravities (i.e. younger ages)\nand absent at lower gravities (larger ages). This is not expected from\ntheoretical evolutionary models, and does not appear to be due to a selection\nbias in our sample. We compare the estimated evolutionary and spectroscopic\nmasses, finding a trend that the former is higher for masses below 20 MSun.\nThis can be explained as a consequence of limiting our sample to the O-type\nstars, and we see no compelling evidence for a systematic mass discrepancy. For\nmost of the stars in the sample we were unable to estimate the wind-strength\nparameter (hence mass-loss rates) reliably, particularly for objects with\nluminosity lower than logL/LSun about 5.1. Ultraviolet spectroscopy is needed\nto undertake a detailed investigation of the wind properties of these dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 21:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

In\naddition to the standard homogeneous Survey data reduction, a special\nprocessing was applied here because of the bright nebulosity surrounding Carina\nstars. We find about four hundred good candidate members ranging from OB types\ndown to slightly sub-solar masses. About one-hundred heavily-reddened\nearly-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly\nclassified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Their large brightness makes them useful tracers of the obscured Carina\npopulation. The spectroscopically-derived temperatures for nearly 300 low-mass\nmembers allows the inference of individual extinction values, and the study of\nthe relative placement of stars along the line of sight. We find a complex\nspatial structure, with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most\nmassive stars, and spatially-variable extinction.

The identification of\ntens of background giants enables us also to determine the total optical depth\nof the Carina nebula along many sightlines. We are also able to put constraints\non the star-formation history of the region, with Trumpler~14 stars found to be\nsystematically younger than stars in other sub-clusters.

Spontaneous polarization is a crucial ferroelectric\nproperty, and its amplitude is determined by the strength of polar structural\ndistortions. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used\ntheoretical methods to study ferroelectric properties, yet it is limited by the\nlevels of approximations in electron exchange-correlation. On the one hand, the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) is considered to be more accurate for the\nconventional perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 than the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA), which suffers from the so-called\nsuper-tetragonality error.

We consider a\ngeneric black-box approach whereby the forecaster does not control or know the\nlearning dynamics of the experts apart from knowing the following no-regret\nlearning property: the average regret of any expert $j$ vanishes at a rate of\nat least $O(t_j^{\\regretRate-1})$ with $t_j$ learning steps where $\\regretRate\n\\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter.\n  In the spirit of competing against the best action in hindsight in\nmulti-armed bandits problem, our goal here is to be competitive w.r.t. the\ncumulative losses the algorithm could receive by following the policy of always\nselecting one expert.

Prior research has quantified the effects of classical sketch on\nthe strictly simpler least squares regression (LSR) problem. We establish that\nclassical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR\nas it does on those of LSR: namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. By\ncontrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee, instead, the\napproximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the \"mass\" in the\nresponses and the optimal objective value.\n  For both types of approximation, the regularization in the sketched MRR\nproblem results in significantly different statistical properties from those of\nthe sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in\nsketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower\nbounds on the bias and variance of sketched MRR, these bounds show that\nclassical sketch significantly increases the variance, while Hessian sketch\nsignificantly increases the bias. Empirically, sketched MRR solutions can have\nrisks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than those of the optimal MRR\nsolutions.\n  We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly\ndecreases the gap between the risks of the true and sketched solutions to the\nMRR problem. Thus, in parallel or distributed settings, sketching combined with\nmodel averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal\nsolutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the increased statistical\nrisk incurred by sketching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 02:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 02:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 17:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 May 2018 20:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

We\ninvestigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form\ngames through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of\ndistance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the\nextensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated\nentropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the\nstrategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching\nfactor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several\nfirst-order methods by a factor of $\\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching\nfactor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.\n  Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in\npractice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their\ntheoretically inferior convergence rates. Using our new weighting scheme and\npractical tuning we show that, for the first time, the excessive gap technique\ncan be made faster than the fastest counterfactual regret minimization\nalgorithm, CFR+, in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 03:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 02:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

To overcome the shortcoming, aiming at\nthe difficult problem of plant leaf recognition on the large-scale database, a\ntwo-stage local similarity based classification learning method is proposed by\ncombining local mean-based classification method and local WSRC. In the first\nstage, LMC is applied to coarsely classifying the test sample. nearest\nneighbors of the test sample, as a neighbor subset, is selected from each\ntraining class, then the local geometric center of each class is calculated. S\ncandidate neighbor subsets of the test sample are determined with the first\nsmallest distances between the test sample and each local geometric center. In\nthe second stage, LWSRC is proposed to approximately represent the test sample\nthrough a linear weighted sum of all samples of the candidate neighbor subsets.\nThe rationale of the proposed method is as follows: the first stage aims to\neliminate the training samples that are far from the test sample and assume\nthat these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision,\nthen select the candidate neighbor subsets of the test sample. Thus the\nclassification problem becomes simple with fewer subsets; the second stage pays\nmore attention to those training samples of the candidate neighbor subsets in\nweighted representing the test sample. This is helpful to accurately represent\nthe test sample. Experimental results on the leaf image database demonstrate\nthat the proposed method not only has a high accuracy and low time cost, but\nalso can be clearly interpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 04:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-17"}

We find that UV luminosity functions at $z\\sim6-8$ have\nsteep faint-end slopes, $\\alpha\\sim-2$, and likely steeper slopes,\n$\\alpha\\lesssim-2$ at $z\\sim9-10$. We also find that the evolution of UV\nluminosity densities shows a non-accelerated decline beyond $z\\sim8$ in the\ncase of $M_\\mathrm{trunc}=-15$, while an accelerated in the case of\n$M_\\mathrm{trunc}=-17$. We examine whether our results are consistent with the\nThomson scattering optical depth from the Planck satellite and the ionized\nhydrogen fraction $Q_\\mathrm{HII}$ at $z\\lesssim7$ based on the standard\nanalytic reionization model. We find that there exist reionizaiton scenarios\nthat consistently explain all the observational measurements with the allowed\nparameters of $f_{\\rm esc}=0.17^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and $M_\\mathrm{trunc}>-14.0$\nfor $\\log\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}/[\\mathrm{erg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}]=25.34$, where\n$f_{\\rm esc}$ is the escape fraction, $M_\\mathrm{trunc}$ is the faint limit of\nthe UV luminosity function, and $\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}$ is the conversion factor of\nthe UV luminosity to the ionizing photon emission rate.

Our\nobjective is to measure the current practice of the declared SDK versions\n(which we term as DSDK versions afterwards) in real apps, and the consistency\nbetween the DSDK versions and their app API calls. To this end, we perform a\nthree-dimensional analysis. First, we parse Android documents to obtain a\nmapping between each API and their corresponding platform versions.

Besides shedding light on the current DSDK\npractice, our study quantitatively measures the two side effects of\ninappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 1.8K apps have API calls that do not\nexist in some declared SDK versions, which causes runtime crash bugs on those\nplatform versions; (ii) over 400 apps, due to claiming the outdated targeted\nDSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution.

In\nan isotropic Heisenberg system, these disturbances vary in a continuous manner\naround an ordered spin structure, thus requiring infinitesimal energy as a\nwavevector approaches a magnetic zone centre. However, competing anisotropic\ninteractions arising from broken symmetry can favour a distinct static and\ndynamic spin state causing a shift of the minimum point of the magnon\ndispersion to a nonreciprocal wavevector. Here we report the first direct\nevidence of these nonreciprocal magnons in an antiferromagnet. In the\nantiferromagnet we investigated, namely, noncentrosymmetric\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$, they are caused by the incompatibility between\nanisotropic exchange and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions\nresulting in competing collinear and helical spin structures, respectively. The\nnonreciprocity introduces the difference in the phase velocity of the\ncounter-rotating modes, causing the opposite spontaneous magnonic Faraday\nrotation of the left- and right-propagating spin-waves. The breaking of spatial\ninversion and time reversal symmetry is revealed as a magnetic-field-induced\nasymmetric energy shift, which provides a test for the detailed balance\nrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 08:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

It is well-known that for pure states, essentially all\nentanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced state,\nbut for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory,\nbipartite systems are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no\nseparable (normal) states to begin with when the regions touch each other, so\none must leave a finite \"safety-corridor\". Due to this corridor, the normal\nstates of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy\nis not a good entanglement measure in the above sense.\n  In this paper, we study various entanglement measures which vanish on\nseparable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations, and have\nother desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement\nentropy, defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an\narbitrary separable state. We establish rigorous upper and lower bounds in\nvarious quantum field theoretic (QFT) models, as well as also model-independent\nones.

In particular, the\nHall effect has the potential to bring about remarkable changes in the\ndynamical behavior of disks that are without parallel. In this paper, we\nconduct a systematic examination of the linear eigenmodes in a weakly\nmagnetized differentially rotating gas with special focus on Hall diffusion. We\nfirst develop a geometrical representation of the eigenmodes and provide a\ndetailed quantitative description of the polarization properties of the\noscillatory modes under the combined influence of the Coriolis and Hall\neffects. We also analyze the effects of magnetic diffusion on the structure of\nthe unstable modes and derive analytical expressions for the kinetic and\nmagnetic stresses and energy densities associated with the non-ideal MRI. Our\nanalysis explicitly demonstrates that, if the dissipative effects are\nrelatively weak, the kinetic stresses and energies make up the dominant\ncontribution to the total stress and energy density when the equilibrium\nangular momentum and magnetic field vectors are anti-parallel. This is in sharp\ncontrast to what is observed in the case of the ideal or dissipative MRI. We\nconduct shearing box simulations and find very good agreement with the results\nderived from linear analysis. As the modes in consideration are also exact\nsolutions of the non-linear equations, the unconventional nature of the kinetic\nand magnetic stresses may have significant implications for the non-linear\nevolution in some regions of protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 14:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The method then computes\nthe line integrals of the basis set coefficient from measurements with\ndifferent x-ray spectra. This paper shows that the transformation from photon\ncounting detector data with pileup to the line integrals can become\nill-conditioned under some circumstances leading to highly increased noise.\nMethods: An idealized model that includes pileup and quantum noise is used.

We modify RuleFit by replacing the\nL1-regularization by a horseshoe prior, which is well known to give aggressive\nshrinkage of noise predictor while leaving the important signal essentially\nuntouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used\nas predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an\nadditional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules\nwith a large number of splits, and to rules that are only satisfied by a few\nobservations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it\npossible to complement the rules from boosting in Friedman and Popescu (2008)\nwith an additional set of trees from random forest, which brings a desirable\ndiversity to the ensemble.

Leveraging from\ncertain results in sampling and approximation theory, we present a new\nframework for solving a class of inverse source problems for physical fields\ngoverned by linear partial differential equations. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the unknown field sources can be recovered from a sequence of, so called,\ngeneralised measurements by using multidimensional frequency estimation\ntechniques.

These observations have yielded detailed maps of emission-line\nstrength for various nebular lines, as well as physical parameters such as dust\nextinction, stellar age, and oxygen abundance on spatial scales of 160 pc. The\nimmediate environment of GRB 980425 is young (5-8 Myr) and consistent with a\nmildly-extinguished ($A_V\\sim0.1\\ \\mathrm{mag}$) progenitor of zero-age\nmain-sequence mass between 25 $M_{\\odot}$ and 40 $M_{\\odot}$ and oxygen\nabundance 12+log(O/H)~8.2 ($Z\\sim0.3\\ {Z}_\\odot$), which is slightly lower than\nthe one of an integrated measurement of the galaxy (12+log(O/H)~8.3) and a\nprominent nearby HII region (12+log(O/H)~8.4). This region is significantly\nyounger than the explosion site, and we argue that a scenario in which the GRB\nprogenitor formed in this environment and was subsequently ejected appears very\nunlikely. We show that empirical strong-line methods based on [OIII] and/or\n[NII] are inadequate to produce accurate maps of oxygen abundance at the level\nof detail of our MUSE observation as these methods strongly depend on the\nionization state of the gas. The metallicity gradient in ESO184-G82 is -0.06\ndex kpc$^{-1}$, indicating that the typical offsets of at most few kpc for\ncosmological GRBs on average have a small impact on oxygen abundance\nmeasurements at higher redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}
