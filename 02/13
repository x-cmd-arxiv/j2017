The basic concept is to use\none magnet system with a strong and homogeneous (dipolar) magnetic field to\nmagnetize and orient the particles. A second constantly graded field\n(quadrupolar) is superimposed to the first to generate a force. In this\nconfiguration the motion of the particles is driven solely by the component of\nthe gradient field which is parallel to the direction of the homogeneous field.\nThen the particles are guided with constant force in a single direction over\nthe entire volume. The direction can be adjusted by varying the angle between\nquadrupole and dipole. Since a single gradient is impossible, the other\ngradient component determines the angular deviation of the force. The latter\ncan be neglected if the homogeneous field is stronger than the local\ncontribution of the gradient field. A possible realization is a coaxial\narrangement of two Halbach cylinders. A dipole produces a strong and\nhomogeneous field to evenly magnetize the particles, while the second cylinder\nis a quadrupole to generate the force. A simple prototype was constructed to\ndemonstrate the principle on several nano-particles, which were moved along a\nrough square by manually changing the force angle. The observed velocities of\nparticles were always several orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical\nvalue. This discrepancy is attributed to the observed formation of long\nparticle chains as a result of their polarization by the homogeneous field. The\nmagnetic moment of such a chain is then the combination of that of its\nconstituents. A complete system will consist of another quadrupole (third\ncylinder) to additionally scale the strength of the force by another rotation.\nIn this configuration the device could then also be used as a simple MRI\nmachine to image the particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 17:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

We construct an analytic\nframework for modeling the turbulent energy and correlation time as functions\nof SN rate and shear.

The solutions depend separately on the rotation period\nand the eddy turnover time and not just on their ratio (the Rossby number).

Of these\nsignals, 225 have already been published as planet claims, 60 are classified as\nsignificant unpublished planet candidates that await photometric follow-up to\nrule out activity-related causes, and 54 are also unpublished, but are\nclassified as \"significant\" signals that require confirmation by additional\ndata before rising to classification as planet candidates. Of particular\ninterest is our detection of a candidate planet with a minimum mass of 3.9\nEarth masses and an orbital period of 9.9 days orbiting Lalande 21185, the\nfourth-closest main sequence star to the Sun. For each of our exoplanetary\ncandidate signals, we provide the period and semi-amplitude of the Keplerian\norbital fit, and a likelihood ratio estimate of its statistical significance.\nWe also tabulate 18 Keplerian-like signals that we classify as likely arising\nfrom stellar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 20:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

However, due to advances in\ntag technology, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal\nresolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are\ncollected, and which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not\nyet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the\nbasic HMM framework in order to incorporate multiple Markov chains at various\ntime scales.

In the strong-coupling regime, we derive a\nlow-energy Lagrangian suitable to describe the ferrimagnetic phase at half\nfilling and the phases in the hole-doped regime. At half filling, a\nperturbative spin-wave analysis allows us to find the GS energy, sublattice\nmagnetizations, and Lieb total spin per unit cell of the effective quantum\nHeisenberg model, in very good agreement with previous results. In the\nchallenging hole doping regime away from half filling, we derive the\ncorresponding $t\\textrm{-}J$ Hamiltonian. Under the assumption that charge and\nspin quantum correlations are decoupled, the evolution of the second-order\nspin-wave modes in the doped regime unveils the occurrence of spatially\nmodulated spin structures and the emergence of phase separation in the presence\nof resonating-valence-bond states.

Statistical models for such data should capture not only\nthe temporal dependencies between networks observed in time, but also the\nstructural dependencies among the nodes and edges in each network. As a\nconsequence, effectively making inference on dynamic networks is a\ncomputationally challenging task, and many models established for dynamic\nnetworks are intractable even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we\npropose and investigate a family of dynamic network models, known as\nvarying-coefficient exponential random graph models (VCERGMs), that\ncharacterize the evolution of network topology through smoothly varying\nparameters in an exponential family of distributions. The VCERGM provides an\ninterpretable dynamic network model that enables the inference of temporal\nheterogeneity in a dynamic network. We establish how to fit the VCERGM through\nmaximum pseudo-likelihood techniques, and thus provide a computationally\ntractable method for statistical inference of complex dynamic networks. We\nfurthermore devise a bootstrap hypothesis testing framework for testing the\ntemporal heterogeneity of an observed dynamic network sequence. We apply the\nVCERGM to the US Congress co-voting network and a resting-state brain\nconnectivity case study and show that our method provides relevant and\ninterpretable patterns describing each data set.

Most of the studies on the exceptional\npoint appearing in the literature introduce a phenomenological effective\nHamiltonian that essentially reduces the problem to that of a finite\nnon-Hermitian matrix for which it is straightforward to obtain the Jordan form.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate how the Hamiltonian of an open quantum system\nreduces to Jordan block form at an exceptional point in an exact manner that\ntreats the continuum without any approximation. Our method relies on the\nBrillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method according to which we can obtain a\nfinite dimensional effective Hamiltonian that shares the discrete sector of the\nspectrum with the original Hamiltonian. While owing to its eigenvalue\ndependence this effective Hamiltonian cannot be used to write the Jordan block\ndirectly, we show that by formally extending the problem to include eigenstates\nwith complex eigenvalues that reside outside the usual Hilbert space, we can\nobtain the Jordan block form at the exceptional point without introducing any\napproximation. We also introduce an extended Jordan form basis away from the\nexceptional point, which provides an alternative way to obtain the Jordan block\nat an exceptional point. The extended Jordan block connects continuously to the\nJordan block exactly at the exceptional point implying that the observable\nquantities are continuous at the exceptional point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 06:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 00:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

The analysis is focused on the question as to\nwhether developed turbulent flows show universal small scale features. To\nanswer this question, 2-point statistics and joint multi-scale statistics of\nlongitudinal velocity increments are analysed. Evidence of the Markov property\nfor the turbulent cascade is shown, which corresponds to a 3-point closure that\nreduces the joint multi-scale statistics to simple conditional probability\ndensity functions (cPDF). The cPDF are described by the Fokker-Planck equation\nin scale and its Kramers-Moyal coefficients (KMCs). KMCs are obtained by a\nself-consistent optimisation procedure from the measured data and result in a\nFokker-Planck equation for each dataset. The knowledge of these stochastic\ncascade equations enables to make use of the concepts of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics and thus to determine the entropy production along individual\ncascade trajectories.

Since\nlaparoscopic interventions are performed via endoscope, the video signal is an\nobvious sensor modality to rely on for workflow analysis.\n  Image-based workflow analysis tasks in laparoscopy, such as phase\nrecognition, skill assessment, video indexing or automatic annotation, require\na temporal distinction between video frames.

Although these come with polynomial time\nguarantees, they are not practical to apply to image scale data.

Many related applications require\nnanoparticles with tailored magnetic properties. However, despite significant\nefforts undertaken towards this goal, a broad and poorly-understood dispersion\nof magnetic properties is reported, even within mono-disperse samples of the\ncanonical ferromagnetic 3d transition metals. We address this issue by\ninvestigating the magnetism of a large number of size- and shape-selected,\nindividual nanoparticles of Fe, Co, and Ni using a unique set of complementary\ncharacterization techniques. At room temperature only superparamagnetic\nbehavior is observed in our experiments for all Ni nanoparticles within the\ninvestigated sizes, which range from 8 to 20 nm. However, Fe and Co\nnanoparticles can exist in two distinct magnetic states at any size in this\nrange: (i) a superparamagnetic state as expected from the bulk and surface\nanisotropies known for the respective materials and as observed for Ni; and\n(ii) a state with unexpected stable magnetization at room temperature. This\nstriking state is assigned to significant modifications of the magnetic\nproperties arising from metastable lattice defects in the core of the\nnanoparticles as concluded by calculations and atomic structural\ncharacterization. Also related with the structural defects, we find that the\nmagnetic state of Fe and Co nanoparticles can be tuned by thermal treatment\nenabling one to tailor their magnetic properties for applications.

We start by\nderiving analytical criteria for necking within a highly simplified and\ngeneralised scalar constitutive model. Here, we find two different possible\nmodes of necking: one associated with an upward curvature in the stress\nrelaxation function on a log-linear plot, and another related to a carefully\ndefined `elastic' derivative of the tensile force with respect to an imagined\nsudden strain increment. We showed these two criteria to agree fully with\nsimulations of the Oldroyd B and Giesekus models of polymeric solutions, and\nwith the RoliePoly model of more concentrated polymeric solutions and melts,\nwithout polymer chain stretch. With chain stretch included, we find a slightly\nmore complicated analytical criterion for necking during the stress relaxation,\nwith key ingredients that closely mirror counterpart ingredients of the simpler\ncriteria obtained within the scalar model. We show this criterion to agree\nfully with slender filament simulations of the RoliePoly model with chain\nstretch, and with the scenario discussed by the Copenhagen group in Refs. [1,\n2]. In particular, we see delayed necking after strain ramps with an\naccumulated strain exceeding ~ 0.7, for ramp rates exceeding the inverse chain\nstretch relaxation timescale.

We mention the works of several\nmathematicians-geographers done in this period, including Euler, Lagrange,\nLambert, Gauss, Chebyshev, Darboux and others. We highlight in particular the\nwork of Nicolas-Auguste Tissot (1824--1897), a French mathematician and\ngeographer who (according to our knowledge) was the first to introduce the\nnotion of a mapping which transforms infinitesimal circles into infinitesimal\nellipses, studying parameters such as the ratio of the major to the minor axes\nof such an infinitesimal ellipse, its area divided by the area of the\ninfinitesimal circle of which it is the image, and the inclination of its axis\nwith respect to a fixed axis in the plane.

In emerging countries, they may range up to 40% of the total\nelectricity distributed. In order to detect NTLs, machine learning methods are\nused that learn irregular consumption patterns from customer data and\ninspection results. The Big Data paradigm followed in modern machine learning\nreflects the desire of deriving better conclusions from simply analyzing more\ndata, without the necessity of looking at theory and models. However, the\nsample of inspected customers may be biased, i.e. it does not represent the\npopulation of all customers. As a consequence, machine learning models trained\non these inspection results are biased as well and therefore lead to unreliable\npredictions of whether customers cause NTL or not. In machine learning, this\nissue is called covariate shift and has not been addressed in the literature on\nNTL detection yet. In this work, we present a novel framework for quantifying\nand visualizing covariate shift. We apply it to a commercial data set from\nBrazil that consists of 3.6M customers and 820K inspection results. We show\nthat some features have a stronger covariate shift than others, making\npredictions less reliable. In particular, previous inspections were focused on\ncertain neighborhoods or customer classes and that they were not sufficiently\nspread among the population of customers.

Studying such systems probes how the\nplanet's atmosphere redistributes the time-varying heat flux from its host and\nhow the host star responds to transient tidal distortion. Here, we report the\ninsights into the planet-star interactions in HAT-P-2's eccentric planetary\nsystem gained from the analysis of 350 hr of 4.5 micron observations with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. The observations show no sign of orbit-to-orbit\nvariability nor of orbital evolution of the eccentric planetary companion,\nHAT-P-2 b. The extensive coverage allows us to better differentiate\ninstrumental systematics from the transient heating of HAT-P-2 b's 4.5 micron\nphotosphere and yields the detection of stellar pulsations with an amplitude of\napproximately 40 ppm. These pulsation modes correspond to exact harmonics of\nthe planet's orbital frequency, indicative of a tidal origin. Transient tidal\neffects can excite pulsation modes in the envelope of a star, but, to date,\nsuch pulsations had only been detected in highly eccentric stellar binaries.\nCurrent stellar models are unable to reproduce HAT-P-2's pulsations, suggesting\nthat our understanding of the interactions at play in this system is\nincomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

The source was detected with a flux of ~ 4\nx 10^(-9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) (in 0.1 - 120 keV range). The broadband spectrum,\ntypical for accreting pulsars, is well described by a cutoff power law with a\ncyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at ~ 38 keV. This value is\nconsistent with earlier reports based on the observations with Suzaku at factor\nof ten lower luminosity, which implies that the feature is formed close to the\nneutron star surface rather than in the accretion column. Pulsations with P ~\n15.82 s were observed up to ~ 70 keV. The pulse profile strongly depends on\nenergy and is characterised by a \"soft\" and a \"hard\" peaks shifted by half\nperiod, which suggests a strong phase dependence of the spectrum, and that two\ncomponents with roughly orthogonal beam patterns are responsible for the\nobserved pulse shape. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the CRSF,\ndespite its relatively high energy, is only detected in the spectrum of the\nsoft peak of the pulse profile. Along with the absence of correlation of the\nline energy with luminosity, this could be explained in the framework of the\nrecently proposed \"reflection\" model for CRSF formation.

The origin of this radiation, which is\nspectrally broad and depends on applied bias, is controversial given the low\nradiative yields of electronic transitions. Nanoparticle EL is particularly\nintriguing since it involves localized surface-plasmon resonances with large\ndipole moments. Such plasmons enable very efficient non-radiative fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer (FRET) coupling to proximal resonant dipole\ntransitions. We demonstrate nanoscopic FRET-LEDs which exploit the opposite\nprocess, energy transfer from silver nanoparticles to exfoliated monolayers of\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In diffraction-limited hotspots\nshowing pronounced photon bunching, broadband silver EL is focused into the\nnarrow excitonic resonance of the atomically thin overlayer. Such devices may\noffer alternatives to conventional nano-LEDs in on-chip optical interconnects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

When massive neutrinos become nonrelativistic, the\n$Z_2$ symmetry breaks, and the quintessence potential becomes positive from its\ninitially zero value. This positive potential behaves like a cosmological\nconstant at the present era and drives the Universe's acceleration during the\nslow roll evolution of the quintessence. In contrast to $\\Lambda$CDM model, the\ndark energy in our model is dynamical, and the acceleration is not persistent.\nContrary to some of the previous models of dark energy with mass-varying\nneutrinos, we do not use the adiabaticity condition which leads to instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 12:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 03:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 11:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}
