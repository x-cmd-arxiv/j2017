As this may impair performance, social and economic settings need to be\nadapted accordingly. Common tools to reduce the impact of time-inconsistent\nbehavior are penalties and prohibition. Such tools are called commitment\ndevices. In recent work Kleinberg and Oren connect the design of\nprohibition-based commitment devices to a combinatorial problem in which edges\nare removed from a task graph $G$ with $n$ nodes. However, this problem is\nNP-hard to approximate within a ratio less than $\\sqrt{n}/3$. To address this\nissue, we propose a penalty-based commitment device that does not delete edges\nbut raises their cost. The benefits of our approach are twofold.

On the computational side, we significantly improve approximability by\npresenting a $2$-approximation algorithm for allocating the penalties. To\ncomplement this result, we prove that optimal penalties are NP-hard to\napproximate within a ratio of $1.08192$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 16:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

In the photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobaculum\ntepidum (Cba. tepidum), a member of the green sulphur bacteria (GSB) family,\nlight is absorbed by large antenna complexes called chlorosomes. The exciton\ngenerated is transferred to a protein baseplate attached to the chlorosome,\nbefore traveling through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex to the reaction\ncenter. The energy levels of these systems are generally defined by their\nchemical structure. Here we show that by placing bacteria within a photonic\nmicrocavity, we can access the strong exciton-photon coupling regime between a\nconfined cavity mode and exciton states of the chlorosome, whereby a coherent\nexchange of energy between the bacteria and cavity mode results in the\nformation of polariton states. The polaritons have an energy distinct from that\nof the exciton and photon, and can be tuned in situ via the microcavity length.\nThis results in real-time, non-invasive control over the relative energy levels\nwithin the bacteria.

Thanks to that time discretisation, the fully\ndiscrete solution inherits energy estimates from the original gradient flow,\nand these lead to weak compactness of the trajectories in the continuous limit.\nConsistency is analyzed in the planar situation, $d=2$. A variety of numerical\nexperiments for the porous medium equation indicates that the scheme is\nwell-adapted to track the growth of the solution's support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 17:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback. This suggests that current AGN feedback models may be too weak or are\nsimply not capturing the effect of the black hole on the stellar velocity\ndispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 19:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

Adding\nirreversible perturbations to the drift of a Langevin diffusion that maintain\nthe same invariant measure accelerates its convergence to stationarity. Many\nexisting works thus advocate the use of such non-reversible dynamics for\nsampling. When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) using\ntime discretisations of such Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), one can\nappend the discretization with the usual Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step\nand this is often done in practice because the accept--reject step eliminates\nbias. On the other hand, such a step makes the resulting chain reversible. It\nis not known whether adding the accept-reject step preserves the faster mixing\nproperties of the non-reversible dynamics. In this paper, we address this gap\nbetween theory and practice by analyzing the optimal scaling of MCMC algorithms\nconstructed from proposal moves that are time-step Euler discretisations of an\nirreversible SDE, for high dimensional Gaussian target measures. We call the\nresulting algorithm the \\imala, in comparison to the classical MALA algorithm\n(here {\\em ip} is for irreversible proposal). In order to quantify how the cost\nof the algorithm scales with the dimension $N$, we prove invariance principles\nfor the appropriately rescaled chain. In contrast to the usual MALA algorithm,\nwe show that there could be two regimes asymptotically: (i) a diffusive regime,\nas in the MALA algorithm and (ii) a ``fluid\" regime where the limit is an\nordinary differential equation. We provide concrete examples where the limit is\na diffusion, as in the standard MALA, but with provably higher limiting\nacceptance probabilities.

The observer maps\nthe processes into finite-rate packets that are sent over the erasure-prone\nlinks to a state estimator, and are acknowledged upon packet arrivals. The aim\nof the state estimator is to track the processes with zero delay and with\nminimum mean square error (MMSE). We show that, in the limit of many processes,\ngreedy quantization with respect to the squared error distortion is optimal.\nThat is, there is no tension between optimizing the MMSE of the process in the\ncurrent time instant and that of future times. For the case of packet erasures\nwith delayed acknowledgments, we connect the problem to that of compression\nwith side information that is known at the observer and may be known at the\nstate estimator - where the most recent packets serve as side information that\nmay have been erased, and demonstrate that the loss due to a delay by one time\nunit is rather small.

Part I presents\na framework to optimize an ex-ante two-part tariff for a regulated monopolistic\nretailer who faces stochastic wholesale prices on the one hand and stochastic\ndemand on the other. In Part II, the integration of DERs is addressed by\nanalyzing their endogenous effect on the optimal two-part tariff and the\ninduced welfare gains. Two DER integration models are considered: (i) a\ndecentralized model involving behind-the-meter DERs in a net metering setting,\nand (ii) a centralized model involving DERs integrated by the retailer. It is\nshown that DERs integrated under either model can achieve the same social\nwelfare and the net-metering tariff structure is optimal. The retail prices\nunder both integration models are equal and reflect the expected wholesale\nprices. The connection charges differ and are affected by the retailer's fixed\ncosts as well as the statistical dependencies between wholesale prices and\nbehind-the-meter DERs. In particular, the connection charge of the\ndecentralized model is generally higher than that of the centralized model. An\nempirical analysis is presented to estimate the impact of DER on welfare\ndistribution and inter-class cross-subsidies using real price and demand data\nand simulations. The analysis shows that, with the prevailing retail pricing\nand net-metering, consumer welfare decreases with the level of DER integration.\nIssues of cross-subsidy and practical drawbacks of decentralized integration\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 21:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

A bidder with quota cannot respond to more than a certain number of\ncalls per second. In practice, random throttling is the principal solution by\nwhich these constraints are enforced. Given the repeated nature of the\ninteraction with its bidders, the exchange has access to data containing\ninformation about each bidder's segments of interest. This information can be\nutilized to design smarter callout mechanisms --- with the potential of\nimproving the exchange's long-term revenue. In this work, we present a general\nframework for evaluating and comparing the performance of various callout\nmechanisms using historical auction data only. To measure the impact of a\ncallout mechanism on long-term revenue, we propose a strategic model that\ncaptures the repeated interaction between the exchange and bidders. Our model\nleads us to two metrics for performance: immediate revenue impact and social\nwelfare. Next we present an empirical framework for estimating these two\nmetrics from historical data.

For the case of the beam\npassing by a single plate, we derive an analytical expression for the\nbroad-band impedance, and---in Appendix B---numerically confirm recently\ndeveloped, analytical formulas for the short-range wakes. While our theory can\nbe applied to the LCLS-II dechirper with large gaps, for the nominal apertures\nwe are not in the perturbative regime and the reflection contribution to Joule\nlosses is not negligible. With input from computer simulations, we estimate the\nJoule power loss (assuming bunch charge of 300 pC, repetition rate of 100 kHz)\nis 21~W/m for the case of two plates, and 24 W/m for the case of a single\nplate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 22:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a\nmixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by\ncomplex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary\ncharacteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique\ncharacteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one\nlow-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in\nthe recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build\nan online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level\nand a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A\nkey observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data\nlikelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics\ncompared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for\nchange detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data\nlikelihood.

We propose utility-driven partitioning, where we associate\nwith each content provider a utility that is a function of the hit rate\nobserved by the content provider. We consider two scenarios: i)~content\nproviders serve disjoint sets of files, ii)~there is some overlap in the\ncontent served by multiple content providers.

In the second case, It can be\nbeneficial to have separate partitions for overlapped content. In the case of\ntwo providers, it is usually always beneficial to allocate a cache partition to\nserve all overlapped content and separate partitions to serve the\nnon-overlapped contents of both providers. We establish conditions when this is\ntrue asymptotically but also present an example where it is not true\nasymptotically.

In multilayered neural circuits, nonlinear processes such as\nsynaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant obstacle to\nthe creation of accurate computational models of responses to natural stimuli.\nHere we demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture\nretinal responses to natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a\ncell's response, and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear (LN)\nmodels and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover, we find two additional\nsurprising properties of CNNs: they are less susceptible to overfitting than\ntheir LN counterparts when trained on small amounts of data, and generalize\nbetter when tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g. between\nnatural scenes and white noise). Examination of trained CNNs reveals several\nproperties. First, a richer set of feature maps is necessary for predicting the\nresponses to natural scenes compared to white noise. Second, temporally precise\nresponses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward inhibition,\nsimilar to known retinal mechanisms. Third, the injection of latent noise\nsources in intermediate layers enables our model to capture the sub-Poisson\nspiking variability observed in retinal ganglion cells. Fourth, augmenting our\nCNNs with recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast\nadaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing retinal responses\nto natural scenes. These methods can be readily generalized to other sensory\nmodalities and stimulus ensembles. Overall, this work demonstrates that CNNs\nnot only accurately capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes, but\nalso yield information about the circuit's internal structure and function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 23:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

Unfortunately, this\ntask is often stymied by the extremely large dimension of the variables. We\nmight hope to replace each variable by a lower-dimensional representation that\npreserves the relationship with the other variable. The theoretically ideal\nimplementation is the use of minimal sufficient statistics, where it is\nwell-known that either X or Y can be replaced by their minimal sufficient\nstatistic about the other while preserving the mutual information. While\nintuitively reasonable, it is not obvious or straightforward that both\nvariables can be replaced simultaneously. We demonstrate that this is in fact\npossible: the information X's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about Y is\nexactly the information that Y's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about\nX. As an important corollary, we consider the case where one variable is a\nstochastic process' past and the other its future and the present is viewed as\na memoryful channel. In this case, the mutual information is the channel\ntransmission rate between the channel's effective states. That is, the\npast-future mutual information (the excess entropy) is the amount of\ninformation about the future that can be predicted using the past. Translating\nour result about minimal sufficient statistics, this is equivalent to the\nmutual information between the forward- and reverse-time causal states of\ncomputational mechanics. We close by discussing multivariate extensions to this\nuse of minimal sufficient statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 00:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

However, open problems exist in quantifying\nelectromagnetic field fluctuations in these media, complicating typical\napproaches for modeling photonic characteristics. Here, we address this issue\nby linking the identifying traits of hyperbolic response to a coupling between\nlongitudinal and transverse fields that can not occur in isotropic media. This\ndescription allows us to calculate the influence of hyperbolic response on\nelectromagnetic fluctuations without explicitly imposing a characteristic size\n(model of nonlocality), leading to formally bounded expressions so long as\nmaterial absorption is included.

In our\nscenario, dark matter particle mass decreases gradually as function of distance\ntowards the center of a dwarf galaxy due to its interaction with a chameleon\nscalar. At closer distance towards galactic center the strength of attractive\nscalar fifth force becomes much stronger than gravity and is balanced by the\nFermi pressure of dark matter cloud, thus an equilibrium static configuration\nof dark matter halo is obtained. Like the case of soliton star or fermion\nQ-star, the stability of the dark matter halo is obtained as the scalar\nachieves a static profile and reaches an asymptotic value away from the\ngalactic center. For simple scalar-dark matter interaction and quadratic scalar\nself interaction potential, we show that dark matter behaves exactly like cold\ndark matter (CDM) beyond few $\\rm{kpc}$ away from galactic center but at closer\ndistance it becomes lighter and fermi pressure cannot be ignored anymore. Using\nThomas-Fermi approximation, we numerically solve the radial static profile of\nthe scalar field, fermion mass and dark matter energy density as a function of\ndistance. We find that for fifth force mediated by an ultra light scalar, it is\npossible to obtain a flattened dark matter density profile towards galactic\ncenter. In our scenario, the fifth force can be neglected at distance $ r \\geq\n1\\, \\rm{kpc}$ from galactic center and dark matter can be simply treated as\nheavy non-relativistic particles beyond this distance, thus reproducing the\nsuccess of CDM at large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 05:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 12:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

They\ninclude as a special case Brownian motion with darning, which has been studied\nin details in \\cite{Chen, CF, CFR}. When the initial processes have\ndiscontinuous sample paths, the processes constructed in this paper are the\ngenuine extensions of those studied in Chen and Fukushima \\cite{CF}. We further\nshow that, up to a time change, these Markov processes with darning can be\napproximated in the finite dimensional sense by introducing additional large\nintensity jumps among these compact sets to be collapsed into singletons to the\noriginal Markov processes. For diffusion processes, it is also possible to get,\nup to a time change, diffusions with darning by increasing the conductance on\nthese compact sets to infinity.

Despite extensive studies, the stability analyses of FIE\nand MHE for discrete-time nonlinear systems with bounded process and\nmeasurement disturbances, remain an open challenge. This work aims to provide a\nsystematic solution for the challenge. First, we prove that FIE is robustly\nglobally asymptotically stable (RGAS) if the cost function admits a property\nmimicking the incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS) of the\nsystem and has a sufficient sensitivity to the uncertainty in the initial\nstate. Second, we establish an explicit link from the RGAS of FIE to that of\nMHE, and use it to show that MHE is RGAS under enhanced conditions if the\nmoving horizon is long enough to suppress the propagation of uncertainties. The\ntheoretical results imply flexible MHE designs with assured robust stability\nfor a broad class of i-IOSS systems.

Recently,\ntwo-dimensional quantum simulations of the expansion of fermions based on\nnonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) have been presented [Schluenzen et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 93, 035107 (2016)] that showed excellent agreement with the\nexperiments. Here we present an extensive comparison of the NEGF approach to\nnumerically accurate DMRG results. The results indicate that NEGF are a\nreliable theoretical tool for weak to intermediate coupling strengths in\narbitrary dimensions and make long simulations possible. This is complementary\nto DMRG simulations which are particularly efficient at strong coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 11:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

In this paper, we create a technique which\nallows algorithm designers to remove that last assumption. The assumption about\nthe unavailability of the knowledge of the physical coordinates of the nodes\ntruly captures the `ad-hoc' nature of wireless networks.\n  Previous work in this area uses a flavor of a technique called dilution, in\nwhich nodes transmit in a (predetermined) round-robin fashion, and are able to\nreach all their neighbors. However, without knowing the physical coordinates,\nit's not possible to know the coordinates of their containing (pivotal) grid\nbox and seemingly not possible to use dilution (to coordinate their\ntransmissions). We propose a new technique to achieve dilution without using\nthe knowledge of physical coordinates. This technique exploits the\nunderstanding that the transmitting nodes lie in 2-D space, segmented by an\nappropriate pivotal grid, without explicitly referring to the actual physical\ncoordinates of these nodes. Using this technique, it is possible for every weak\ndevice to successfully transmit its message to all of its neighbors in\n$\\Theta(\\lg N)$ rounds, as long as the density of transmitting nodes in any\nphysical grid box is bounded by a known constant.

In the second part we study the phase\nbehavior in the $\\eta_0$-$\\Delta_0$ plane for fixed $\\kappa_0$ while $\\Delta_0$\nis changed. We characterize in detail the orientational ordering of particles\nand the fractionation of different species between the coexisting phases. Also\nwe study the character (second vs. first order) of the Isotropic-Nematic phase\ntransition as a function of polydispersity. We particularly focused on the\nstability of the Tetratic phase as a function of $\\kappa_0$ and $\\Delta_0$. The\nIsotropic-Nematic transition becomes strongly of first order when\npolydispersity is increased: the coexisting gap widens and the location of the\ntricritical point moves to higher values of $\\kappa_0$ while the Tetratic phase\nis slightly destabilized with respect to the Nematic one. The results obtained\nhere can be tested in experiments on shaken monolayers of granular rods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 13:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Locating the sources of this renewable energy on a global scale is\nhowever extremely challenging, given the difficulty to store very large data\nsets generated by modern computer models. We propose a statistical model that\naims at reproducing the data-generating mechanism of an ensemble of runs via a\nStochastic Generator (SG) of global annual wind data.

We apply the proposed model to more than 18 million\npoints of yearly global wind speed. The proposed SG requires orders of\nmagnitude less storage for generating surrogate ensemble members from wind than\ndoes creating additional wind fields from the climate model, even if an\neffective lossy data compression algorithm is applied to the simulation output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 13:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 10:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 10:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In this\nwork, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and\nstrong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\sqrt{F_*/n})$ risk bound when the random function is\nnonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz\ncontinuous, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number\nof samples, and $F_*$ is the minimal risk. Thus, when $F_*$ is small we obtain\nan $\\widetilde{O}(d/n)$ risk bound, which is analogous to the\n$\\widetilde{O}(1/n)$ optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if\nthe objective function is also $\\lambda$-strongly convex, we prove an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\kappa F_*/n )$ risk bound where $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber, and improve it to $O(1/[\\lambda n^2] + \\kappa F_*/n)$ when\n$n=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\kappa d)$.

Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an $O(1/[\\lambda\nn^2] + \\kappa F_*/n)$ risk bound for supervised learning, the\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\kappa d)$ requirement on $n$ can be replaced with\n$\\Omega(\\kappa^2)$, which is dimensionality-independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 14:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

We then propose an efficient solution to the critical nodes\ndetection problem. The severity of such vulnerability is supported by extensive\nexperiments in various simulation settings, from which we observe up to $40\\%$\nreduction in network throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 14:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The main result is that two\ninteracting electrons can form bound states with the energy in the gap of the\nband spectrum. The pairing mechanism can be interpreted as the formation of a\nnegative reduced effective mass of two electrons. The problem is complicated\nbecause the relative motion of the electrons is coupled to the center-of-mass\nmotion. We consider the case of zero total momentum.

We analyze the spectra and electronic\nstructure of the bound states in the case of both topological and trivial\nphases and especially focus on effects originating from the band inversion and\nthe coupling of the electron and hole bands. In the trivial phase and the\ntopological phase with the large coupling parameter $a$, the bound state\nspectra are qualitatively similar.

First, we revisit the theory of transmission\nspectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission\nspectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a\nreference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We\nshow that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius,\nthe assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the\ninferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission\nspectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal\natmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric\nanalytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical\ncalculations and show that the typical errors are ~0.1% (~10 ppm) within the\nWFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we\ngeneralize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small\ntemperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC3 transmission\nspectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the\nretrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius\nand reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional\nrelationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure\nimplies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure\nthat is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone.\nThis degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract\nmolecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone.

One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich\nstage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their\norbits, moving them out of resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 15:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Although the recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be used to model the\ncontext of the time-sequences, in most cases the long-term dependencies of\nmulti-modal data make the back-propagation through time training of RNN tend to\nvanish in the time domain. Recently, inspired from Multiple Time-scale\nRecurrent Neural Network (MTRNN), an extension of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),\ncalled Multiple Time-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (MTGRU), has been proposed to\nlearn the long-term dependencies in natural language processing. Particularly\nit is also able to accomplish the abstraction task for paragraphs given that\nthe time constants are well defined. In this paper, we compare the MTRNN and\nMTGRU in terms of its learning performances as well as their abstraction\nrepresentation on higher level (with a slower neural activation).

We conclude that gated recurrent mechanisms may be necessary for\nlearning long-term dependencies in large dimension multi-modal data-sets (e.g.\nlearning of robot manipulation), even when natural language commands was not\ninvolved. But for smaller learning tasks with simple time-sequences, generic\nversion of recurrent models, such as MTRNN, were sufficient to accomplish the\nabstraction task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 09:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}
