The backbone for modern mapping\ntechniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the\nrobots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this\npaper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather\nthan sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots\nexchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose\ngraph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed\nimplementation of the two-stage approach of Carlone et al., where we use the\nSuccessive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation (JOR) as\nworkhorses to split the computation among the robots. As a second contribution,\nwe extend %and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed distributed\nalgorithms to work with object-based map models. The use of object-based models\navoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g., point clouds) further\nreducing the communication burden.

Both are based on the\nnegative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). In the jittering jets scenario a\ncollapsing core of a single slowly-rotating star can launch jets. The accretion\ndisk or belt (a sub-Keplerian accretion flow concentrated toward the equatorial\nplane) that launches the jets is intermittent with varying directions of the\naxis. Instabilities, such as the standing accretion shock instability (SASI),\nlead to stochastic angular momentum variations that allow the formation of the\nintermittent accretion disk/belt. According to this scenario no failed CCSNe\nexist. According to the fixed axis scenario, the core of the progenitor star\nmust be spun up during its late evolutionary phases, and hence all CCSNe are\ndescendants of strongly interacting binary systems, most likely through a\ncommon envelope evolution (whether the companion survives or not). Due to the\nstrong binary interaction, the axis of the accretion disk that is formed around\nthe newly born neutron star has a more or less fixed direction. According to\nthe fixed axis scenario, accretion disk/belt are not formed around the newly\nborn neutron star of single stars; they rather end in failed CCSNe. I also\nraise the possibility that the jittering jets scenario operates for progenitors\nwith initial mass of 8Mo<M(ZAMS)<18Mo, while the fixed axis scenario operates\nfor M(ZAMS)>18Mo.

This paper proposes\nEvoSPLat, a regression testing technique for configurable systems. EvoSPLat\nbuilds on our previously-developed technique, SPLat, which explores all\ndynamically reachable configurations from a test. EvoSPLat is tuned for two\nscenarios of use in regression testing: Regression Configuration Selection\n(RCS) and Regression Test Selection (RTS). EvoSPLat for RCS prunes\nconfigurations (not tests) that are not impacted by changes whereas EvoSPLat\nfor RTS prunes tests (not configurations) which are not impacted by changes.\nHandling both scenarios in the context of evolution is important. Experimental\nresults show that EvoSPLat is promising. We observed a substantial reduction in\ntime (22%) and in the number of configurations (45%) for configurable Java\nprograms. In a case study on a large real-world configurable system (GCC),\nEvoSPLat reduced 35% of the running time. Comparing EvoSPLat with sampling\ntechniques, 2-wise was the most efficient technique, but it missed two bugs\nwhereas EvoSPLat detected all bugs four times faster than 6-wise, on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 20:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

Open clusters\nallow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution\nover time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day\nradial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type\nmembers of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters\nare therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium\nmetallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young\nregions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc.\nFor the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions\nfarther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through\nsamples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis\nis discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I\nand Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All\nthe pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or\nslightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by\nthese clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having\n[Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older\nclusters located at similar Galactocentric radii.

Our approach\nreduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from\nobserved behavior, and then it selects those behaviors that are maximally\ninformative. The problem of computing a posterior over objectives from observed\nbehavior is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied\nto robots learning human objectives.

It is well known that\nboth the tensor and scalar perturbation equations of the later can always be\nwritten as a supersymmetric Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, so it can be shown that\nthe perturbations are stable at linear level. However, in general it is not\ntrue for multi-scalar field models and especially there is no effective method\nto deal with the stability problem of the scalar perturbations for braneworld\nmodels constructed with non-minimally coupled multi-scalar fields. In this\npaper we present a method to investigate the stability of such braneworld\nmodels. It is easy to find that the tensor perturbations are stable. For the\nstability problem of the scalar perturbations, we present a systematic\ncovariant approach. The covariant quadratic order action and the corresponding\nfirst-order perturbed equations are derived. By introducing the orthonormal\nbases in field space and making the Kaluza-Klein decomposition, we show that\nthe Kaluza-Klein modes of the scalar perturbations satisfy a set of coupled\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-like equations, with which the stability of the scalar\nperturbations and localization of the scalar zero modes can be analyzed\naccording to nodal theorem. The result depends on the explicit models. For\nsuperpotential derived barane models, the scalar perturbations are stable, but\nthere exist normalizable scalar zero modes, which will result in unaccepted\nfifth force on the brane. We also use this method to analyze the $f(R)$\nbraneworld model with an explicit solution and find that the scalar\nperturbations are stable and the scalar zero modes can not be localized on the\nbrane, which ensure that there is no extra long-range force and the Newtonian\npotential on the brane can be recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 07:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 16:30:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 07:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Unlike the traditional multiscale transforms (MSTs)\nthat presume the basis functions, SR learns an over-complete dictionary from a\nset of training images for image fusion, and it achieves more stable and\nmeaningful representations of the source images. By doing so, the SR-based\nfusion methods generally outperform the traditional MST-based image fusion\nmethods in both subjective and objective tests. In addition, they are less\nsusceptible to mis-registration among the source images, thus facilitating the\npractical applications. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the\nSR-based multi-sensor image fusion literature, highlighting the pros and cons\nof each category of approaches. Specifically, we start by performing a\ntheoretical investigation of the entire system from three key algorithmic\naspects, (1) sparse representation models; (2) dictionary learning methods; and\n(3) activity levels and fusion rules. Subsequently, we show how the existing\nworks address these scientific problems and design the appropriate fusion rules\nfor each application, such as multi-focus image fusion and multi-modality\n(e.g., infrared and visible) image fusion. At last, we carry out some\nexperiments to evaluate the impact of these three algorithmic components on the\nfusion performance when dealing with different applications.

Since the basic task of learning such a model\nfrom data is NP-hard, a standard approach is greedy search over the space of\ndirected acyclic graphs or Markov equivalence classes of directed acyclic\ngraphs. As the space of directed acyclic graphs on $p$ nodes and the associated\nspace of Markov equivalence classes are both much larger than the space of\npermutations, it is desirable to consider permutation-based greedy searches.\nHere, we provide the first consistency guarantees, both uniform and\nhigh-dimensional, of a greedy permutation-based search. This search corresponds\nto a simplex-like algorithm operating over the edge-graph of a sub-polytope of\nthe permutohedron, called a DAG associahedron. Every vertex in this polytope is\nassociated with a directed acyclic graph, and hence with a collection of\npermutations that are consistent with the directed acyclic graph ordering. A\nwalk is performed on the edges of the polytope maximizing the sparsity of the\nassociated directed acyclic graphs.

All nodes of a network have to agree on a single node, called the\nleader. If the nodes of the network have distinct labels, then agreeing on a\nsingle node means that all nodes have to output the label of the elected\nleader.\n  If the nodes are anonymous, the task of leader election is formulated as\nfollows: every node of the network must output a simple path starting at it,\nwhich is coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end at\na common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader\nelection in anonymous trees.\n  Our goal is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\\tau$ and the\namount of information that has to be given {\\em a priori} to the nodes of a\nnetwork to enable leader election in time $\\tau$. Following the framework of\n{\\em algorithms with advice}, this information is provided to all nodes at the\nstart by an oracle knowing the entire tree, in form of binary strings assigned\nto all nodes. There are two possible variants of formulating this advice\nassignment. Either the strings provided to all nodes are identical, or strings\nassigned to different nodes may be potentially different, i.e., advice can be\n{\\em customized}. As opposed to previous papers on leader election with advice,\nin this paper we consider the latter option.\n  The maximum length of all assigned binary strings is called the {\\em size of\nadvice}.\n  For a given time $\\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give upper and lower\nbounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform leader election in\ntime $\\tau$.
