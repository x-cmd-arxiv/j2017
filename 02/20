The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR)\nsoftware tool calculates whether a colliding asteroid experiences an airburst\nor surface impact and calculates effect severity as well as reach on the global\nmap. To calculate the consequences of an impact in terms of loss of human life,\nnew vulnerability models are derived that connect the severity of seven impact\neffects (strong winds, overpressure shockwave, thermal radiation, seismic\nshaking, ejecta deposition, cratering and tsunamis) with lethality to human\npopulations. With the new vulnerability models ARMOR estimates casualties of an\nimpact under consideration of the local population and geography. The presented\nalgorithms and models are employed in two case studies to estimate total\ncasualties as well as the damage contribution of each impact effect. The case\nstudies highlight that aerothermal effects are most harmful except for deep\nwater impacts, where tsunamis are the dominant hazard. Continental shelves\nserve a protective function against the tsunami hazard caused by impactors on\nthe shelf. Furthermore, the calculation of impact consequences facilitates\nasteroid risk estimation to better characterize a given threat and the concept\nof risk as well as its applicability to the asteroid impact scenario are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 21:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Since a single maximum $st$-flow can be solved\nin time $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt{n})$ [Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014], we conclude that\nthe all-pairs version might require time equivalent to $\\tilde\\Omega(n^{3/2})$\ncomputations of maximum $st$-flow,which strongly separates the directed case\nfrom the undirected one. Moreover, if maximum $st$-flow can be solved in time\n$\\tilde{O}(m)$,then the runtime of $\\tilde\\Omega(n^2)$ computations is needed.\nThe latter settles a conjecture of Lacki, Nussbaum, Sankowski, and Wulf-Nilsen\n[FOCS 2012] negatively.\n  Specifically, we show that in sparse graphs $G=(V,E,w)$, if one can compute\nthe maximum $st$-flow from every $s$ in an input set of sources $S\\subseteq V$\nto every $t$ in an input set of sinks $T\\subseteq V$ in time $O((|S| |T|\nm)^{1-\\epsilon})$,for some $|S|$, $|T|$, and a constant $\\epsilon>0$,then\nMAX-CNF-SAT with $n'$ variables and $m'$ clauses can be solved in time\n${m'}^{O(1)}2^{(1-\\delta)n'}$ for a constant $\\delta(\\epsilon)>0$,a problem for\nwhich not even $2^{n'}/poly(n')$ algorithms are known.

A leading approach for cryptocurrency\nscaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables\ntwo mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a\nsingle transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked\ntogether to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties\ncan (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them.\nCrucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called\nSprites, that reduces the worst-case \"collateral cost\" that each hop along the\nroute may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network,\na payment across a path of $\\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for\n$\\Theta(\\ell\\Delta)$ time, where $\\Delta$ is the time to commit an on-chain\ntransaction. Sprites reduces this cost to $O(\\ell + \\Delta)$. 2) Unlike prior\nwork, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the\nchannel can continue to operate without interruption.\n  In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our\nsimulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing\nguarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of\na generic abstraction from folklore, called the \"state channel,\" which we are\nthe first to formalize.

Prior neural networks, such as\nResNet, tend to enhance representational power by increasing the depth of\narchitectures and driving the training objective across layers. However, we\nargue that spatial dependencies in different layers, which generally represent\nthe rich contexts among data elements, are also critical to building deep and\ndiscriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to progressively\nbroadcast information over the learned feature maps by inserting a stack of\ninformation diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional\nconvolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Structures). In each LSTM unit, a\nspecial type of atrous filters are designed to capture the short range and long\nrange dependencies from various neighbors to a certain site of the feature map\nand pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive\nexperiments on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing,\nPASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our framework demonstrates the effectiveness\nto substantially improve the performances over the popular existing neural\nnetwork models, and achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet Parsing for large\nscale semantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 02:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

When used in parameter studies (e.g.,\noptimization or uncertainty quantification), ridge approximations allow the low\ndimensional structure to be exploited, reducing the effective dimension. We\nintroduce a new, fast algorithm for constructing a ridge approximation where\nthe nonlinear function is a polynomial. This polynomial ridge approximation is\nchosen to minimize least squared mismatch between the surrogate and the\nquantity of interest on a given set of inputs.

Reflective and refractive metasurfaces are designed using the\ngeneralized reflection and Snell's laws, which tell that local phase shifts at\nthe metasurface supply extra momentum to the wave, presumably allowing\narbitrary control of reflected or transmitted waves. However, as it has been\nrecently shown for the electromagnetic counterpart, conventional metasurfaces\nbased on the generalized laws of reflection and refraction have important\ndrawbacks in terms of power efficiency. This work presents a new synthesis\nmethod of acoustic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection and transmission that\novercomes the fundamental limitations of conventional designs, allowing full\ncontrol of acoustic energy flow. The results show that different mechanisms are\nnecessary in the reflection and transmission scenarios for ensuring perfect\nperformance. Metasurfaces for anomalous reflection require non-local response,\nwhich allows energy channeling along the metasurface. On other hand, for\nperfect manipulation of anomalously transmitted waves, local and non-symmetric\nresponse is required. These conclusions are interpreted through appropriate\nsurface impedance models which are used to find possible physical\nimplementations of perfect metasurfaces in each scenario. We hope that this\nadvance in the design of acoustic metasurfaces opens new avenues not only for\nperfect anomalous reflection and transmission but also for realizing more\ncomplex functionalities, such as focusing, self-bending or vortex generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 06:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 12:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much\nweaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore\nharder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell\nburning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving\nstrong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially\nresolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that\nthey are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of\nnovae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources.

Considering a BS with $N$ antennas, the SDR complexity is more\nthan $\\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$, which prevents its application in large-scale\nantenna systems. To overcome this issue, we present two new classes of\nalgorithms that, not only have significantly lower computational complexity\nthan existing solutions, but also largely outperform the SDR based methods.\nMoreover, we present a novel duality between transformed versions of the QoS\nand the weighted MMF problems. The duality explicitly determines the solution\nto the weighted MMF problem given the solution to the QoS problem, and vice\nversa. Numerical results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolutions and to make comparisons with existing alternatives under different\noperating conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 08:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

This tool was based on the analysis\nof eruptions observed in 1996-2005 with SOHO/EIT and MDI. Empirical\nrelationships were obtained to estimate the probable importance of upcoming\nspace weather disturbances caused by an eruption, which just occurred, without\ndata on the associated coronal mass ejections.

Given a large\nedge-weighted network $G$ with $k$ terminal vertices, compress it into a\nsmaller network $H$ with the same terminals, such that every minimum terminal\ncut in $H$ approximates the corresponding one in $G$, up to a factor $q\\geq 1$\nthat is called the quality. (The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking\nnetwork). We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts,\nleading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. Our first\ncontribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call\nelementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut\nsparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to\nthis factor $q$). This structural characterization lead to improved bounds on\nthe size of $H$. For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network size\nfor planar graphs into a near-optimal one.

In the analysis we break the\nelementary terminal cuts into fragments, and count them carefully.

We apply this formalism to investigate vacuum\ninduced transparency, wherein the different photon number components of a pulse\npropagate with number-dependent group velocity and separate at output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 12:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 09:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 13:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

Originally motivated by pursuing a\ntheoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression\n(MCCR), our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is\nessentially modal regression. We show that nonparametric modal regression\nproblem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some\nefforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing\nmodal regression. For instance, the modal regression function is described, the\nmodal regression risk is defined explicitly and its \\textit{Bayes} rule is\ncharacterized; for the sake of computational tractability, the surrogate modal\nregression risk, which is termed as the generalization risk in our study, is\nintroduced. On the theoretical side, the excess modal regression risk, the\nexcess generalization risk, the function estimation error, and the relations\namong the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that\nunder mild conditions, function estimation consistency and convergence may be\npursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols, such as mean\nregression, median regression, and quantile regression. However, it outperforms\nthese regression models in terms of robustness as shown in our study from a\nre-descending M-estimation view. This coincides with and in return explains the\nmerits of MCCR on robustness. On the practical side, the implementation issues\nof modal regression including the computational algorithm and the tuning\nparameters selection are discussed. Numerical assessments on modal regression\nare also conducted to verify our findings empirically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 13:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 18:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 06:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 05:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

In the scenario tested here the current two-belt architecture stems\nfrom an originally extended protoplanetary disc, in which planets have opened a\ngap separating it into the outer and inner discs which, after the gas\ndispersal, experience a steady-state collisional decay. This idea is explored\nwith an analytic collisional evolution model for a sample of 225 debris discs\nfrom a Spitzer/IRS catalogue that are likely to possess a two-component\nstructure.

To realize this potential, networks\nemploying three-node full-duplex transmissions must deal with self-interference\nand user-to-user interference, which can be managed by frequency channel and\npower allocation techniques. Whereas previous works investigated either\nspectral efficient or fair mechanisms, a scheme that balances these two metrics\namong users is investigated in this paper. This balancing scheme is based on a\nnew solution method of the multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the\nweighted sum of the per-user spectral efficiency and the minimum spectral\nefficiency among users. The mixed integer non-linear nature of this problem is\ndealt by Lagrangian duality. Based on the proposed solution approach, a\nlow-complexity centralized algorithm is developed, which relies on large scale\nfading measurements that can be advantageously implemented at the base station.\nNumerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm increases the spectral\nefficiency and fairness among users without the need of weighting the spectral\nefficiency.

A generative network is trained to minimize the\ngenerated adversarial examples' malicious probabilities predicted by the\nsubstitute detector. The superiority of MalGAN over traditional gradient based\nadversarial example generation algorithms is that MalGAN is able to decrease\nthe detection rate to nearly zero and make the retraining based defensive\nmethod against adversarial examples hard to work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 14:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Confirming the results of Demoulin et\nal. (2013, Sol. Phys. 283, 341), we find that for each AR there is an observed\nlong term evolution of the upflows which is largely due to the solar rotation\nprogressively changing the viewpoint of dominantly stationary upflows. From\nthis projection effect, we estimate the unprojected upflow velocity and its\ninclination to the local vertical. AR upflows typically fan away from the AR\ncore by 40 deg. to near vertical for the following polarity. The span of\ninclination angles is more spread for the leading polarity with flows angled\nfrom -29 deg. (inclined towards the AR center) to 28 deg. (directed away from\nthe AR). In addition to the limb-to-limb apparent evolution, we identify an\nintrinsic evolution of the upflows due to coronal activity which is AR\ndependent. Further, line widths are correlated with Doppler velocities only for\nthe few ARs having the largest velocities. We conclude that for the line widths\nto be affected by the solar rotation, the spatial gradient of the upflow\nvelocities must be large enough such that the line broadening exceeds the\nthermal line width of Fe XII. Finally, we find that upflows occurring in pairs\nor multiple pairs is a common feature of ARs observed by Hinode/EIS, with up to\nfour pairs present in AR 11575. This is important for constraining the upflow\ndriving mechanism as it implies that the mechanism is not a local one occurring\nover a single polarity. AR upflows originating from reconnection along\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between over-pressure AR loops and neighboring\nunder-pressure loops is consistent with upflows occurring in pairs, unlike\nother proposed mechanisms acting locally in one polarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 15:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The KP provides a\nunifying context for the sorites and the liar paradoxes. Any concept is viewed\nas a sorites, i.e. it is impossible to set a boundary between what is, and what\nis not, the entity to which the concept refers. Hence, any statement about\nreality can be reduced to a liar, wherefrom the KP follows in its most general\nform: -If I know, then I do not know-. The KP is self-referential but not\ncontradictory, as it can be referred to two levels of knowledge: -if I\nknow(epistemic), then I do not know(ontic)-, where the ontic level is made\nunachievable by concept vagueness.
