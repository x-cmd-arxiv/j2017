Given that\nthe Dirac equation dynamics including external potentials can be simulated by a\nsuitable four level trapped ion setup, quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic\nstates with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its\nprojection onto the direction of the external magnetic field (used for lift the\nions degeneracy), are recovered by means of a suitable ansatz. This formalism\nallows the inclusion of noise effects, which leads to disentanglement in the\nfour level trapped ion quantum system. Our results indicate the role of\ninteractions in bi-spinor entanglement, as well as the description of\ndisentanglement in ionic states under local noises. For a state prepared\ninitially in one of the ionic levels, local noise induces entanglement sudden\ndeath followed by sudden revivals driven by the noiseless dynamics of the\nstate. Residual quantum correlations are observed in the intervals where such\nstate is separable. Schr\\\"odinger cat and Werner states partially loose their\ninitial entanglement content due to the interaction with the noisy environment\nbut presenting entanglement oscillations without sudden death. Because Dirac\nequation describes low energy excitations of mono layer and bi-layer graphene,\nthe formalism can also be applied to compute, for instance, electron-hole or\nelectron/electron entanglement in various circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 14:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

First, we find very good agreement between the\npolarization orientations in the three wavelength-bands, suggesting that, at\nthe considered common angular resolution of 3.0 arcminutes that corresponds to\na physical scale of approximately 0.61 pc, the inferred magnetic field\norientation is not significantly affected by temperature or dust grain\nalignment effects. Second, we find that the relative orientation between gas\ncolumn density structures and the magnetic field changes progressively with\nincreasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or having no preferred\norientation at low column densities to mostly perpendicular at the highest\ncolumn densities. This observation is in agreement with previous studies by the\nPlanck collaboration towards more nearby molecular clouds.

Orthogonal\ntransformations are more robust to noise, enabling us to learn the\ntransformation without expert bilingual signal by constructing a\n\"pseudo-dictionary\" from the identical character strings which appear in both\nlanguages, achieving 40% precision on the same test set. Finally, we extend our\nmethod to retrieve the true translations of English sentences from a corpus of\n200k Italian sentences with a precision @1 of 68%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the\nmental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire)\ncannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and\ninnovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing\nof those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine\nlearning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD),\nthat exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately\nidentify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in\nSNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the\nperformance. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3126 online\nsocial network users.

To establish a unified\nview, we propose a transport phase diagram. Our results show that, depending\nonly on the degree of correlation, a dielectric material can transition from\nlocalization behavior to a bandgap crossing an intermediate regime dominated by\ntunneling between weakly coupled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 17:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Several tools are being used\nto help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data.

The tool is based\non the principle that stellar activity signals are variable and incoherent.\nMethods.

Accurately modeling the data\ngenerated by each sensor node is essential for correctly simulating network\ntraffic, network congestion, interference between nodes and the energy expended\nby each node.

The main contribution of this article is the\nconstruction of a single convex optimization program which computes the traffic\nflow at a junction over a finite time horizon and decouples the PDEs on\nconnecting links. Compared to discretization schemes which require the\ncomputation of all traffic states on a time-space grid, the proposed convex\noptimization approach computes the boundary flows at the junction using only\nthe initial condition on links and the boundary conditions of the network. The\ncomputed boundary flows at the junction specify the boundary condition for the\nHJ PDE on connecting links, which then can be separately solved using an\nexisting semi-explicit scheme for single link HJ PDE.

Using an effective low-energy\nmodel, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of\nthe various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR)\nline shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy\nlevel when the two MBS overlap.

Obtaining\nnumerical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations of expected survey\nvolumes is expensive, and a cheaper alternative relies on populating large dark\nmatter-only simulations with accurate models of alignments calibrated on\nsmaller hydrodynamical runs. This requires connecting the shapes and\norientations of galaxies to those of dark matter haloes and to the large-scale\nstructure. In this paper, we characterise galaxy-halo alignments in the\nHorizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We compare the shapes and\norientations of galaxies in the redshift range $0<z<3$ to those of their\nembedding dark matter haloes, and to the matching haloes of a twin dark-matter\nonly run with identical initial conditions. We find that galaxy ellipticities\nin general cannot be predicted directly from halo ellipticities. The mean\nmisalignment angle between the minor axis of a galaxy and its embedding halo is\na function of halo mass, with residuals arising from the dependence of\nalignment on galaxy type, but not on environment. Haloes are much more strongly\naligned among themselves than galaxies, and they decrease their alignment\ntowards low redshift. Galaxy alignments compete with this effect, as galaxies\ntend to increase their alignment with haloes towards low redshift. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for current halo models of intrinsic\nalignments and suggest several avenues for improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 18:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 12:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

Since many interesting DIS\nstudies occur at kinematic regions where the hard scale, $Q \\sim$ 1-2 GeV, is\nnot very much greater than the hadron masses involved, and the Bjorken scaling\nvariable $x_{bj}$ is large, $x_{bj} \\gtrsim 0.5$, it is important to examine\nthe boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether\nimproved starting points are needed. Using an idealized field-theoretic model\nthat contains most of the essential elements that a factorization derivation\nmust confront, we retrace the steps of factorization approximations and compare\nwith calculations that keep all kinematics exact. We examine the relative\nimportance of such quantities as the target mass, light quark masses, and\nintrinsic parton transverse momentum, and argue that a careful accounting of\nparton virtuality is essential for treating power corrections to collinear\nfactorization.

This definition has seen intensive study in\nrecent years, particularly with respect to more accurate models of radio\nnetworks such as the SINR model. This paper is motivated by an obvious fact:\nradio antennae are (at least traditionally) omnidirectional, and hence\npoint-to-point connections are not necessarily the best definition of the true\ncapacity of a wireless network. To fix this, we introduce a new definition of\nreception capacity as the maximum number of messages which can be received in\none round, and show that this is related to a new optimization problem we call\nthe Maximum Perfect Dominated Set (MaxPDS) problem. Using this relationship we\ngive a tight lower bound for approximating this capacity which essentially\nmatches a known upper bound. As our main result, we analyze this notion of\ncapacity under game-theoretic constraints, giving tight bounds on the average\nquality achieved at any coarse correlated equilibrium (and thus at any Nash).\nThis immediately gives bounds on the average behavior of the natural\ndistributed algorithm in which every transmitter uses online learning\nalgorithms to learn whether to transmit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 17:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

When observations are hierarchically\nclustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with\nmixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are\nnot included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method\ncalled boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for\nexploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect\npredictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for\nmissing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called\nmetboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the\nstructure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal\nnode means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to\ndifferent predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group\nspecific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for\nthousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing\nvalues.

Existing methods have investigated the problems of\ngroup division and group energy-minimization; however, lacking overall\nobject-group topology modeling limits their ability in handling complex object\nand group dynamics.

The use of models is a ubiquitous practice in undergraduate physics\neducation, but the process of constructing, testing, and refining these models\nis much less common. We focus our attention on a lab course that has been\ntransformed to engage students in this modeling process during lab activities.\nThe design of the lab activities was guided by a framework that captures the\ndifferent components of model-based reasoning, called the Modeling Framework\nfor Experimental Physics. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to\nassess students' written work and to identify how students' model-based\nreasoning differed from activity to activity. Broadly speaking, we were able to\nidentify the different steps of students' model-based reasoning and assess the\ncompleteness of their reasoning. Varying degrees of scaffolding present across\nthe activities had an impact on how thoroughly students would engage in the\nfull modeling process, with more scaffolded activities resulting in more\nthorough engagement with the process. Finally, we identified that the step in\nthe process with which students had the most difficulty was the comparison\nbetween their interpreted data and their model prediction. Students did not use\nsufficiently sophisticated criteria in evaluating such comparisons, which had\nthe effect of halting the modeling process. This may indicate that in order to\nengage students further in using model-based reasoning during lab activities,\nthe instructor needs to provide further scaffolding for how students make these\ntypes of experimental comparisons.

The simulations show good agreement with past theoretical\nresults and with experimentally observed feature in which high energy ions flow\nout along the ion drift orbits and then hit the divertor plates. A measure of\nthe ion direct orbit loss fraction shows that the loss fraction increases with\nthe ion energy for DIII-D in the initial velocity space. Finally, as a further\nverification of the capability of the new code, self-consistent simulations of\nzonal flows in the core region of the DIII-D tokamak were carried out. All\nDIII-D simulations were perfomed in the absence of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 04:25:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 12:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 18:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 10:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

However, among the many data completion techniques available in\nthe literature, studies about mutually completing several incomplete kernel\nmatrices have not been given much attention yet. In this paper, we present a\nnew method, called Mutual Kernel Matrix Completion (MKMC) algorithm, that\ntackles this problem of mutually inferring the missing entries of multiple\nkernel matrices by combining the notions of data fusion and kernel matrix\ncompletion, applied on biological data sets to be used for classification task.\nWe first introduced an objective function that will be minimized by exploiting\nthe EM algorithm, which in turn results to an estimate of the missing entries\nof the kernel matrices involved. The completed kernel matrices are then\ncombined to produce a model matrix that can be used to further improve the\nobtained estimates. An interesting result of our study is that the E-step and\nthe M-step are given in closed form, which makes our algorithm efficient in\nterms of time and memory. After completion, the (completed) kernel matrices are\nthen used to train an SVM classifier to test how well the relationships among\nthe entries are preserved. Our empirical results show that the proposed\nalgorithm bested the traditional completion techniques in preserving the\nrelationships among the data points, and in accurately recovering the missing\nkernel matrix entries. By far, MKMC offers a promising solution to the problem\nof mutual estimation of a number of relevant incomplete kernel matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 04:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 05:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 09:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

We also present simple theoretical models describing\nthe gas at different points of the crossover and compare the data to these and\nmore advanced models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 10:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

When the magnetization direction instead approaches the film\nnormal, the modes transform to the so-called \"bulk\" type, i.e. localized inside\nthe constriction with substantially increased precession volume, consistent\nwith the re-distribution of the magnetic charges from the sides to the top and\nbottom surfaces of the constriction.

A canonically complete language is useful as it is\nfunctionally complete and provides a \"normal form\" for policies.

A number of recent ABAC languages use a fourth value and the\nset of authorization decisions is partially ordered.

This enables us to investigate the\ncanonical completeness of logics having a partially ordered set of truth\nvalues, such as Belnap logic, and show that ABAC languages based on Belnap\nlogic, such as PBel, are not canonically complete.

However, experiments\nhave shown inconsistent results, with many studies reporting significantly\nreduced performance. Recently, it has been proposed that surfactants,\nubiquitous in flow applications, could be responsible, by creating adverse\nMarangoni stresses. Yet, testing this hypothesis is challenging. Careful\nexperiments with purified water show large interfacial stresses and,\nparadoxically, adding surfactants yields barely measurable drag increases. This\nsuggests that other physical processes, such as thermal Marangoni stresses or\ninterface deflection, could explain the lower performance. To test the\nsurfactant hypothesis, we perform the first numerical simulations of flows over\na SHS inclusive of surfactant kinetics. These simulations reveal that\nsurfactant-induced stresses are significant at extremely low concentrations,\npotentially yielding a no-slip boundary condition on the air--water interface\n(the \"plastron\") for surfactant amounts below typical environmental values.\nThese stresses decrease as the streamwise distance between plastron stagnation\npoints increases. We perform microchannel experiments with thermally-controlled\nSHSs consisting of streamwise parallel gratings, which confirm this numerical\nprediction. We introduce a new, unsteady test of surfactant effects. When we\nrapidly remove the driving pressure following a loading phase, a backflow\ndevelops at the plastron, which can only be explained by surfactant gradients\nformed in the loading phase. This demonstrates the significance of surfactants\nin deteriorating drag reduction, and thus the importance of including\nsurfactant stresses in SHS models. Our time-dependent protocol can assess the\nimpact of surfactants in SHS testing and guide future mitigating designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 12:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

The coronagraph manipulates the phase in the pupil to produce three\nbeams yielding two coronagraphic point-spread functions (PSFs) and one faint\nleakage PSF. The phase pattern is imposed through the inherently achromatic\ngeometric phase, enabled by liquid crystal technology and polarization\ntechniques. The coronagraphic optic is manufactured using a direct-write\ntechnique for precise control of the liquid crystal pattern, and multitwist\nretarders for achromatization. By integrating a linear phase ramp to the\ncoronagraphic phase pattern, two separated coronagraphic PSFs are created with\na single pupil-plane optic, which makes it robust and easy to install in\nexisting telescopes. The two coronagraphic PSFs contain a 180$^\\circ$ dark hole\non each side of a star, and these complementary copies of the star are used to\ncorrect the seeing halo close to the star.

The resulting\nformulas are expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the ensemble plane\nwaves: R=WSqrt[K4^3/(12 Pi^4 K2(K4-K2^2))], and B=D=(R/2)-(W/2)Sqrt[9 K2^3/(16\nPi^4)] where W is the standard deviation of angular frequencies, and K2 and K4\nare the second and fourth moments of a wave vector component (say the x one).\nThus reconnections are always more common than births and deaths combined. As\nan expository preliminary, the case of two dimensions, where the vortices are\npoints, is studied and the average rate of pair creation (and likewise\ndestruction) per unit area is calculated to be WSqrt[(K4-K2^2)/(4 Pi^4)].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 15:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

We rigorously answer this question\nfor a range of practically important problems. When each sensor in the network\nmeasures a single parameter, we show that correlations between sensors cannot\nincrease the estimation precision beyond what can be achieved with an\nuncorrelated scheme, regardless of the particular details of the estimation\nproblem in question. We also consider the more general setting whereby each\nsensor may be used to measure multiple parameters, e.g., the three spatial\ncomponents of a magnetic field. In this case, we show that correlations between\nsensors can only provide, at best, a small constant precision enhancement, over\nuncorrelated estimation techniques. Finally, we consider optimizing the network\nfor measuring a single linear function of the unknown parameters, e.g., the\naverage of all of the parameters.

IMEX time integration methods sidestep the constraint imposed by\nthe Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition on explicit methods through corrective\nimplicit solves within each time step. In this work, we implement and evaluate\nthe performance of IMEX on manycore processors relative to explicit methods.\nUsing 3D-IMEX at Courant number C=15 , we obtained a speedup of about 4X\nrelative to an explicit time stepping method run with the maximum allowable\nC=1. In addition, we demonstrate a much larger speedup of 100X at C=150 using\n1D-IMEX due to the unconditional stability of the method in the vertical\ndirection. Several improvements on the IMEX procedure were necessary in order\nto outperform our results with explicit methods: a) reducing the number of\ndegrees of freedom of the IMEX formulation by forming the Schur complement; b)\nformulating a horizontally-explicit vertically-implicit (HEVI) 1D-IMEX scheme\nthat has a lower workload and potentially better scalability than 3D-IMEX; c)\nusing high-order polynomial preconditioners to reduce the condition number of\nthe resulting system; d) using a direct solver for the 1D-IMEX method by\nperforming and storing LU factorizations once to obtain a constant cost for any\nCourant number.

We make use of advanced numerical integration techniques to\nachieve this accuracy using relatively small amounts of training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 23:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 06:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

The decelerator consists of a series of alternating hexapoles and\nsolenoids, that effectively decouple the transverse focusing and longitudinal\ndeceleration properties of the decelerator. It can be operated in a\ndeceleration and acceleration mode, as well as in a hybrid mode that makes it\npossible to guide a particle beam through the decelerator at constant speed.\nThe deceleration features phase stability, with a relatively large\nsix-dimensional phase-space acceptance. The separated focusing and deceleration\nelements result in an unequal partitioning of this acceptance between the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions. This is ideal in scattering\nexperiments, which typically benefit from a large longitudinal acceptance\ncombined with narrow transverse distributions. We demonstrate the successful\nexperimental implementation of this concept using a Zeeman decelerator\nconsisting of an array of 25 hexapoles and 24 solenoids. The performance of the\ndecelerator in acceleration, deceleration and guiding modes is characterized\nusing beams of metastable Helium ($^3S$) atoms. Up to 60 % of the kinetic\nenergy was removed for He atoms that have an initial velocity of 520 m/s. The\nhexapoles consist of permanent magnets, whereas the solenoids are produced from\na single hollow copper capillary through which cooling liquid is passed. The\nsolenoid design allows for excellent thermal properties, and enables the use of\nreadily available and cheap electronics components to pulse high currents\nthrough the solenoids.
