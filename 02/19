Our\nalgorithm is useful in applications where stabilization of the reduced attitude\ntakes precedence over stabilization of the full attitude. A two parameter\nfeedback gain affords further trade-offs between the full and reduced attitude\nconvergence speed. The closed loop kinematics on SO(3) are solved for the\nstates as functions of time and the initial conditions, providing precise\nknowledge of the transient dynamics. The exact solutions also help us to\ncharacterize the asymptotic behavior of the system such as establishing the\nregion of attraction by straightforward evaluation of limits. The geometric\nflavor of these ideas is illustrated by a numerical example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 19:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We unify the results of two approaches. In the first\none, the original system is compared with its copy rotated by the parameter\ndependent dynamics. If the parameter is coupled to the one-body part of the\nHamiltonian the precision of its estimation is known to scale at most as\n$N^{-1}$ (Heisenberg scaling) in terms of the number of elementary subsystems\nused, $N$. The second approach considers fidelity at criticality often leading\nto an apparent super-Heisenberg scaling. However, scaling of time needed to\nensure adiabaticity of the evolution brings back the the Heisenberg limit. We\nillustrate the general theory on a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain which\nexhibits such super-Heisenberg scaling of fidelity around the critical value of\nthe magnetic field. Even an elementary estimator represented by a single-site\nmagnetization already outperforms the Heisenberg behavior providing the\n$N^{-1.5}$ scaling. In this case Fisher information sets the ultimate scaling\nas $N^{-1.75}$ which can be saturated by measuring magnetization on all sites\nsimultaneously.

We first quantify the degree of adaptivity of a testing algorithm\nby considering the number of \"rounds of adaptivity\" it uses.

In this $Letter$,\nwe use multiwavelength data and Doppler factors reported in the literatures for\na sample of 86 flaring blazars detected by Fermi to compute their intrinsic\nmultiwavelength data and intrinsic spectral energy distributions, and\ninvestigate the correlations among observed and intrinsic data. Quite\ninterestingly, intrinsic data show a positive correlation between luminosity\nand peak frequency, in contrast with the behavior of observed data, and a\ntighter correlation between $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and the lower energy ones.\nFor flaring blazars detected by Fermi, we conclude that (1) Observed emissions\nare strongly beamed; (2) The anti-correlation between luminosity and peak\nfrequency from the observed data is an apparent result, the correlation between\nintrinsic data being positive; and (3) Intrinsic $\\gamma$-ray luminosity is\nstrongly correlated with other intrinsic luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 03:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Fuzzy-hashing fingerprints are\nsuitable for capturing malware static features. Moreover, they are more\nresilient to small changes in the actual static content of malware files. On\nthe other hand, dynamic analysis is another technique for malware detection\nthat uses emulation environments to extract behavioral features of Android\nmalware.

The\ntrend in transmission also holds in the presence of the decoherence with the\nsame rate.

VSMP is\npolynomially solvable for grids, trees, permutation graphs and cographs.\nConstruction heuristics play a very important role in the metaheuristic\ntechniques as they are responsible for generating initial solutions which lead\nto fast convergence. In this paper, we have proposed three construction\nheuristics H1, H2 and H3 and performed experiments on Grids, Small graphs,\nTrees and Harwell Boeing graphs, totaling 248 instances of graphs. Experiments\nreveal that H1, H2 and H3 are able to achieve best results for 88.71%, 43.5%\nand 37.1% of the total instances respectively while the best construction\nheuristic in the literature achieves the best solution for 39.9% of the total\ninstances. We have also compared the results with the state-of-the-art\nmetaheuristic GVNS and observed that the proposed construction heuristics\nimproves the results for some of the input instances. It was found that GVNS\nobtained best results for 82.9% instances of all input instances and the\nheuristic H1 obtained best results for 82.3% of all input instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 07:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We utilize different resolutions of feature maps in the network to\ndetect object instances of various sizes.

Deeper feature maps contain region-level semantics which can help\nshallow counterparts to identify small objects. Therefore we design a zoom-in\nsub-network to increase the resolution of high level features via a\ndeconvolution operation. The high-level features with high resolution are then\ncombined and merged with low-level features to detect objects. Furthermore, we\ndevise a recursive training pipeline to consecutively regress region proposals\nat the training stage in order to match the iterative regression at the testing\nstage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on ILSVRC DET\nand MS COCO datasets, where our algorithm performs better than the\nstate-of-the-arts in various evaluation metrics.

Furthermore, we also use certain stuffle products to evaluate\nseveral q-series with q-harmonic numbers. Some interesting new results and\nillustrative examples are considered. Finally, we can obtain some explicit\nrelations for the classical Euler sums when q approaches to 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 12:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 00:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Rather than the fixed location sublayer model\npresently employed, the new method defines thickness and shape parameters that\nare experimentally accessible without differentiation. It is shown\ntheoretically that one of the new length parameters used as a scaling parameter\nis also a similarity parameter for the velocity profile. In fact, we show that\nthis new length scale parameter removes one of the theoretical inconsistencies\npresent in the traditional Prandtl Plus scaling's. Furthermore, the new length\nparameter and the Prandtl Plus scaling parameters perform identically when\noperating on experimental datasets if the Rotta similarity constraint\n(u_tau/u_e = constant) holds. This means that many of the past successes\nascribed to the Prandtl Plus scaling also apply to the new parameter set but\nwithout one of the theoretical inconsistencies. Examples are offered to show\nhow the new description method is useful in exploring the actual physics of the\nboundary layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 18:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 12:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 11:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}
