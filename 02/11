Results show that, for a\ngiven rate, improved performance is achieved when the number of indexed\ntransmission entities is increased. We also explore indexing opportunities in\n{\\em load modulation}, which is a modulation scheme that offers power\nefficiency and reduced RF hardware complexity advantages in multiantenna\nsystems. Results show that indexing space and time in load modulated\nmultiantenna systems can achieve improved performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 17:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

In quantum technologies, the dimension of a\nquantum system (or its corresponding accessible Hilbert space) is an important\nresource, as larger dimensions determine e.g. the performance of quantum\ncomputation protocols or the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Despite being a\ncritical task in quantum system identification, estimating the Hilbert space\ndimension is experimentally challenging. While there have been proposals for\nvarious dimension witnesses capable of putting a lower bound on the dimension\nfrom measuring collective observables that encode correlations, in many\npractical scenarios, especially for multiqubit systems, the experimental\ncontrol might not be able to engineer the required initialization, dynamics and\nobservables.\n  Here we propose a more practical strategy, that relies not on directly\nmeasuring an unknown multiqubit target system, but on the indirect interaction\nwith a local quantum probe under the experimenter's control.

LBC builds on the existing Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and\nadds a \"context modality\" that explores the behaviour of a system when composed\nwith an external process. LBC models are terms of the Continuous {\\pi}-Calculus\n(c{\\pi}), a process algebra with continuous state space. Our previously\npublished LBC model-checking technique required examining many points along the\nbehavioural trajectory of a process; and potentially computing further\ntrajectories branching off at every such point. This raised two difficulties:\nmixing temporal and spatial modalities could require computing a large number\nof trajectories, with costly numerical solution of differential equations; and\nmight still fail to check intermediate values between discrete points on those\ntrajectories. In this paper we make progress against both of these problems\nusing techniques from signal temporal logic and from sensitivity analysis.\nBoolean signals aggressively compress trace information, allowing more\nefficient computation; and sensitivity analysis lets us reliably check formulae\nover a region by calculating a smaller number of sample trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

The energy deposited by the jet may be larger\nthan the binding energy of the envelope. The jet can, thus, play a fundamental\nrole in the CE evolution.

Between these early and late times, the magnetic-parity part\nof the time integral of the gravitational-wave strain can undergo a nonzero\nchange; this difference is the spin memory effect. Families of freely falling\nobservers around an isolated source can measure this effect, in principle, and\nfluxes of angular momentum per unit solid angle (or changes in superspin\ncharges) generate the effect. The spin memory effect had not been computed\nexplicitly for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as compact\nbinaries. In this paper, we compute the spin memory in terms of a set of\nradiative multipole moments of the gravitational-wave strain. The result of\nthis calculation allows us to establish the following results about the spin\nmemory: (i) We find that the accumulation of the spin memory behaves in a\nqualitatively different way from that of the displacement memory effect for\nnonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the post-Newtonian\napproximation: the spin memory undergoes a large secular growth over the\nduration of the inspiral, whereas for the displacement effect this increase is\nsmall. (ii) The rate at which the spin memory grows is equivalent to a\nnonlinear, but nonoscillatory and nonhereditary effect in the gravitational\nwaveform that had been previously calculated for nonspinning, quasicircular\ncompact binaries.

Because this problem is\nnonconvex, we propose two methods to (approximately) solve it and to design the\nreal-time control. In the first method, we present a convex relaxation approach\nto solve an approximate version of the steady-state optimization problem, where\nthe heat transfer between neighboring zones is ignored. We prove the tightness\nof the relaxation and develop a real-time decentralized algorithm to regulate\nthe zone flow rate. In the second method, we introduce a mild assumption under\nwhich the original optimization problem becomes convex, and then a real-time\ndistributed algorithm is developed to regulate the zone flow rate. In both\ncases, the thermal dynamics can be driven to equilibria which are optimal\nsolutions to those associated steady-state optimization problems. Finally,\nnumerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed\ncontrol schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 19:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

A distinctive feature\nof copepods motility is their ability to perform quick displacements, often\ndubbed jumps, by means of powerful swimming strokes. Such a reaction has been\nassociated to an escape behaviour from flow disturbances due to predators or\nother external dangers. In the present study, the encounter rate of copepods in\na developed turbulent flow with intensity comparable to the one found in\ncopepods' habitat is numerically investigated. This is done by means of a\nLagrangian copepod (LC) model that mimics the jump escape reaction behaviour\nfrom localised high-shear rate fluctuations in the turbulent flows. Our\nanalysis shows that the encounter rate for copepods of typical perception\nradius of ~ {\\eta}, where {\\eta} is the dissipative scale of turbulence, can be\nincreased by a factor up to ~ 100 compared to the one experienced by passively\ntransported fluid tracers.

The dependence of the MZ relation on the\nenvironment is small. The metallicity where the MZ relation saturates and the\nslope of the MZ relation are both independent of the local density. The impact\nof the large scale environment is completely parameterized by the\nanti-correlation between local density and the turnover stellar mass where the\nMZ relation begins to saturate. Analytical modeling suggests that the\nanti-correlation between the local density and turnover stellar mass is a\nconsequence of a variation in the gas content of star-forming galaxies. Across\n$\\sim1$ order of magnitude in local density, the gas content at a fixed stellar\nmass varies by $\\sim5\\%$. Variation of the specific star formation rate with\nenvironment is consistent with this interpretation. At a fixed stellar mass,\ngalaxies in low density environments have lower metallicities because they are\nslightly more gas-rich than galaxies in high density environments. Modeling the\nshape of the mass-metallicity relation thus provides an indirect means to probe\nsubtle variations in the gas content of star-forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 20:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The largest chlorophyll attenuation is obtained in\nthe bottom layer, which supports pigment concentrations of about 300 to 1000\nmg/m3 in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. However, chlorophyll concentrations\nfor the ice interior in regions north of 75{\\deg} N and across the Canadian\nArchipelago are less than 0.1 micro g/m3.

We provide a numerical treatment for the main factors playing a role\nin real systems, such as advection, diffusion and the presence of chemical\nspecies with different behaviors. The flow field inside and outside the droplet\nis derived, thus accounting for the two-way coupling between the surrounding\nfluid and the motion of the swimmer. Mass diffusion is also taken into account.\nIn particular, we consider two concentration fields: the surfactant\nconcentration in the bulk, i.e. in the liquid surrounding the droplet, and the\nsurfactant concentration on the surface. The latter is related to the local\nsurface tension, through an equation of state (Langmuir equation). We examine\ndifferent interaction mechanisms between the bulk and the surface concentration\nfields, namely the case of insoluble surfactants attached to the surface (no\nexchange between the bulk and the surface) and soluble surfactants with\nadsorption/desorption at the surface.

The\nunderlying idea of HOAS is to use a meta-language that provides a built-in and\nlogical treatment of binding related notions. By embedding the meta-language\nwithin a larger programming or reasoning framework, it is possible to absorb\nthe treatment of binding structure in the object language into the meta-theory\nof the system, thereby greatly simplifying the overall implementation and\nreasoning processes.\n  We develop the above argument in this thesis by presenting and demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of an approach to the verified implementation of compiler\ntransformations for functional programs that exploits HOAS. In this approach,\ntransformations on functional programs are first articulated in the form of\nrule-based relational specifications. These specifications are rendered into\nprograms in the language lambda Prolog. On the one hand, these programs serve\ndirectly as implementations. On the other hand, they can be used as input to\nthe Abella system which allows us to prove properties about them and thereby\nabout the implementations. Both lambda Prolog and Abella support the use of the\nHOAS approach. Thus, they constitute a framework that can be used to test out\nthe benefits of the HOAS approach in verified compilation. We use them to\nimplement and verify a compiler for a representative functional programming\nlanguage that embodies the transformations that form the core of many compilers\nfor such languages. In both the programming and the reasoning phases, we show\nhow the use of the HOAS approach significantly simplifies the representation,\nmanipulation, analysis and reasoning of binding structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 01:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

Maintaining connectivity\nstands out to be a key design challenge for mmWave networks deployed in urban\nregions due to the blockage effect characterizing mmWave propagation.\nSpecifically, mmWave signals can be blocked by buildings and other large urban\nobjects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the blockage effect on the\nconnectivity of mmWave networks in a Manhattan-type urban region modeled using\na random regular lattice while base stations (BSs) are Poisson distributed in\nthe plane. In particular, we analyze the connectivity probability that a\ntypical user is within the transmission range of a BS and connected by a\nline-of-sight. Using random lattice and stochastic geometry theories, different\nlower bounds on the connectivity probability are derived as functions of the\nbuildings' size and probability of a lattice cell being occupied by a building\nas well as BS density and transmission range. The asymptotic connectivity\nprobability is also derived for cases of dense buildings. Last, the results are\nextended to heterogeneous networks. Our study yields closed-form relations\nbetween the parameters of the building process and the BS process, providing\nuseful guidelines for practical mmWave network deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 02:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 07:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

To handle the\nlarge answer set of skyline queries in high-dimensional datasets, the concept\nof k-dominance was proposed where an object is said to dominate another object\nif it is better (or equal) in at least k attributes. This relaxes the full\ndomination criterion of normal skyline queries and, therefore, produces lesser\nnumber of skyline objects. This is called the k-dominant skyline set. Many\npractical applications, however, require that the preferences are applied on a\njoined relation. Common examples include flights having one or multiple stops,\na combination of product price and shipping costs, etc. In this paper, we\nextend the k-dominant skyline queries to the join paradigm by enabling such\nqueries to be asked on joined relations. We call such queries KSJQ (k-dominant\nskyline join queries). The number of skyline attributes, k, that an object must\ndominate is from the combined set of skyline attributes of the joined relation.\nWe show how pre-processing the base relations helps in reducing the time of\nanswering such queries over the naive method of joining the relations first and\nthen running the k-dominant skyline computation. We also extend the query to\nhandle cases where the skyline preference is on aggregated values in the joined\nrelation (such as total cost of the multiple legs of the flight) which are\navailable only after the join is performed. In addition to these problems, we\ndevise efficient algorithms to choose the value of k based on the desired\ncardinality of the final skyline set. Experiments on both real and synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and practicality of our\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 06:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

In subsonic accretion,\nwhich works at X-ray luminosities $\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{36}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, a\nhot quasi-spherical shell must form around the magnetosphere, and the actual\naccretion rate onto the neutron star is determined by the ability of the plasma\nto enter the magnetosphere due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

However, this is difficult to achieve due to absence of ground truth.\nSegmentation accuracy on clinical data might be different from what is found\nthrough cross-validation because validation data is often used during\nincremental method development, which can lead to overfitting and unrealistic\nperformance expectations. Before deployment, performance is quantified using\ndifferent metrics, for which the predicted segmentation is compared to a\nreference segmentation, often obtained manually by an expert. But little is\nknown about the real performance after deployment when a reference is\nunavailable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reverse classification\naccuracy (RCA) as a framework for predicting the performance of a segmentation\nmethod on new data. In RCA we take the predicted segmentation from a new image\nto train a reverse classifier which is evaluated on a set of reference images\nwith available ground truth. The hypothesis is that if the predicted\nsegmentation is of good quality, then the reverse classifier will perform well\non at least some of the reference images. We validate our approach on\nmulti-organ segmentation with different classifiers and segmentation methods.\nOur results indicate that it is indeed possible to predict the quality of\nindividual segmentations, in the absence of ground truth. Thus, RCA is ideal\nfor integration into automatic processing pipelines in clinical routine and as\npart of large-scale image analysis studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 10:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

From this equivalence, we deduce for a closed symplectic\nmanifold that Tsai-Tseng-Yau's symplectic Aoo-algebras satisfy the Calabi-Yau\nproperty, and importantly, that they can be used to define an intersection\ntheory for coisotropic/isotropic chains. We further demonstrate that these\nsymplectic Aoo-algebras satisfy several functorial properties and lay the\ngroundwork for addressing Weinstein functoriality and invariance in the smooth\ncategory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 14:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

In this regard, a zero-sum\nnetwork interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone\ndelivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to\nfind the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from\nthe vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time.\nMeanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the\npotential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it,\nthus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this\ngame is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the\nvendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the\ngame. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective\nperception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective\nvaluations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery\ntime. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the\nvendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which\ninflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which\nsurpass the target delivery time set by the vendor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 00:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

When an ac bias is applied to the\nwire by means of the reservoirs, the statistics of the charge carriers is\ninfluence by the formed non-equilibrium. The proposed model is derived from\nGreen function formalism. The quasi-particle energy distribution is calculated\nwith a quantum diffusion equation including a collision term accounting for\ninelastic scattering. The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives\nthe wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption\nprocesses create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the\nnumber of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field\neV and the photon energy \\omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field\nregime, \\omega \\tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent. In\nthe fast field regime \\omega \\tau_D > 1 this time-dependency disappears and the\nphoton steps in the distribution have a fixed value. When the wire is extended,\nthe transport becomes incoherent due to interaction processes, like\nelectron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction. These\ninteractions give rise to a redistribution of the quasi-particles with respect\nto the energy. We focused on the fast field regime and concluded that the\nstrong interaction limit for both mechanisms gives the expected result. Strong\nelectron-phonon interaction forces the distribution function on every position\nin the wire to become a Fermi function with the bath temperature, while strong\nelectron-electron interaction causes an effective temperature profile across\nthe wire and the distribution function on every position in the wire is a Fermi\nfunction with an effective temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 19:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}
