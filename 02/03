Yet, the waves detected so far may be but a small subset of the\ntrue existing wave power. Detection is limited by instrumental constraints, but\nalso by wave processes that localise the wave power in undetectable spatial\nscales. In this study we conduct 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling of\nstanding transverse MHD waves in coronal loops with uniform and non-uniform\ntemperature variation in the perpendicular cross-section. The observed\nsignatures are largely dominated by the combination of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI), resonant absorption and phase mixing. In the presence of a\ncross-loop temperature gradient we find that emission lines sensitive to the\nloop core catch different signatures than those more sensitive to the loop\nboundary and the surrounding corona, leading to an out-of-phase intensity\nmodulation produced by the KHI mixing. Common signatures to all considered\nmodels include an intensity and loop width modulation at half the kink period,\nfine strand-like structure, a characteristic arrow-shaped structure in the\nDoppler maps, overall line broadening in time but particularly at the loop\nedges. For our model, most of these features can be captured with a spatial\nresolution of $0.33\\arcsec$ and spectral resolution of 25~km~s$^{-1}$, although\nsevere over-estimation of the line width is obtained. Resonant absorption leads\nto a significant decrease of the observed kinetic energy from Doppler motions\nover time, which is not recovered by a corresponding increase in the line width\nfrom phase mixing and the KHI motions.

For the surface mediated dissociation of H2 and the subsequent\nadsorption of H, an energy barrier of 0.55 eV has to be overcome. The\ncalculated kinetic surface phase diagram indicates that the reaction is\nkinetically hindered at low pressures and low temperatures. At higher\ntemperatures ab-initio thermodynamics show, that the H-free surface is\nenergetically favored. To validate these theoretical predictions experiments at\nroom temperature and under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were performed. They\nreveal that molecular hydrogen does not dissociatively adsorb at the GaN(1-100)\nsurface. Only activated atomic hydrogen atoms attach to the surface. At\ntemperatures above 820 K, the attached hydrogen gets desorbed. The adsorbed\nhydrogen atoms saturate the dangling bonds of the gallium and nitrogen surface\natoms and result in an inversion of the Ga-N surface dimer buckling. The\nsignatures of the Ga-H and N-H vibrational modes on the H-covered surface have\nexperimentally been identified and are in good agreement with the DFT\ncalculations of the surface phonon modes.

RF is a well-established and well-regulated technology that enables\ncommunication over long distances as proven by the Voyager 1 & II missions.\nHowever, RF requires licensing of very limited radio spectrum and this poses a\nchallenge in the future, particularly with spectrum time-sharing. This is of a\nconcern for emergency communication when it is of utmost urgency to contact the\nspacecraft and maintain contact, particularly when there is a major mission\nanomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser\ncommunication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the\nonboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser\nground station to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency.\nAdding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables\ntwo-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser\nbeing located on the spacecraft.

However, it also enables us to obtain the same asymptotic\ndistribution as in Hansen (2000) for the quasi-likelihood ratio statistic for\nthe unknown threshold up to an unknown scale parameter.

In order to plan driving maneuvers effectively, the\nvehicle's control system must infer and predict how humans will behave based on\ntheir latent internal state (e.g., intentions and aggressiveness). This\nresearch uses a simple model for human behavior with unknown parameters that\nmake up the internal states of the traffic participants and presents a method\nfor quantifying the value of estimating these states and planning with their\nuncertainty explicitly modeled. An upper performance bound is established by an\nomniscient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner that has perfect knowledge of\nthe internal states.

This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}.

Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain.

Unfortunately, energy storage may be costly, while\nfrequent switching of loads in the absence of an energy storage system causes\nwear and tear and should be avoided. Yet, the amount of solar energy utilized\nshould be maximized and the problem of finding the optimal static load size of\na finite number of discrete electric loads on the basis of a load response\noptimization is considered in this paper. The objective of the optimization is\nto maximize solar energy utilization without the need for costly energy storage\nsystems in an off-grid system. Conceptual and real data for solar photovoltaic\npower production is provided the input to the off-grid system. Given the number\nof units, the following analytical solutions and computational algorithms are\nproposed to compute the optimal load size of each unit: mixed-integer linear\nprogramming and constrained least squares. Based on the available solar power\nprofile, the algorithms select the optimal on/off switch times and maximize\nsolar energy utilization by computing the optimal static load sizes. The\neffectiveness of the algorithms is compared using one year of solar power data\nfrom San Diego, California and Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that the\nannual system solar energy utilization is optimized to 73% when using two loads\nand can be boosted up to 98% using a six load configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 23:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}

We experiment with two different classes of structured attention\nnetworks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing\nmodel, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural\nnetwork layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for\nincorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform\nbaseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree\ntransduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural\nlanguage inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn\ninteresting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple\nattention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 01:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 16:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-17"}

We\nalso show that the discontinuity in the condensate density predicted by\nprevious formulations of this theory as the temperature $T$ goes past the\ncritical transition temperature $T_c$ is a direct consequence of an\ninappropriate generalization of the Bogoliubov prescription to finite\ntemperatures, and that this discontinuity disappears when this prescription is\neither used as a zero temperature approximation or avoided altogether.

To investigate, we use 70 RQQs from the Spitzer-Herschel\nActive Galaxy Survey.

By exploiting the\nfar-infrared--radio correlation observed for star-forming galaxies, and\ncomparing two independent estimates of the star-formation rate, we show that\nstar formation alone is not sufficient to explain the total radio emission.\nConsidering RQQs above a 2-$\\sigma$ detection level in both the radio and the\nfar-infrared, 92 per cent are accretion-dominated, and the accretion process\naccounts for 80 per cent of the radio luminosity when summed across the\nobjects.

Moreover, the continuously tunable\nconductivity of graphene enables active SPRs and gives rise to a range of\nactive applications. However, the interaction between graphene and metal-based\nresonant metamaterials has not been fully understood. In this work, a\nsimulation investigation on the interaction between the graphene layer and THz\nresonances supported by the two-gap split ring metamaterials is systematically\nconducted. The simulation results show that the graphene layer can\nsubstantially reduce the Fano resonance and even switch it off, while leave the\ndipole resonance nearly unaffected, which phenomenon is well explained with the\nhigh conductivity of graphene. With the manipulation of graphene conductivity\nvia altering its Fermi energy or layer number, the amplitude of the Fano\nresonance can be modulated. The tunable Fano resonance here together with the\nunderlying physical mechanism can be strategically important in designing\nactive metal-graphene hybrid metamaterials. In addition, the \"sensitivity\" to\nthe graphene layer of the Fano resonance is also highly appreciated in the\nfield of ultrasensitive sensing, where the novel physical mechanism can be\nemployed in sensing other graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials or\nbiomolecules with the high conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 06:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 03:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

As training data for\nsemantic correspondence is rather limited, we propose to leverage object\ncandidate priors provided in existing image datasets and also correspondence\nconsistency between object pairs to enable weakly-supervised learning.\nExperiments demonstrate that FCSS outperforms conventional handcrafted\ndescriptors and CNN-based descriptors on various benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 07:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}

A basic degeneration limit of the\nsurface C is when several punctures are brought close to each other. As this\nhappens, a long tube appears in C and a weakly coupled gauge group emerges.\nWhen the corresponding gauge coupling is turned off, we are left with two\nsurfaces. This decoupling leads to a unique result. We explain how to fix the\ngauge group that becomes weakly coupled and the resulting two theories, in\nterms of the types of punctures on the surface C. Each of the resulting\ntheories is given in terms of a class-S theory (plus possibly additional free\nhypermultiplets). Many other more complicated degeneration limits can be\ndescribed by repeatedly using this specification.\n  For questions about weak coupling limits in such theories, it is useful to\nconsider the set of punctures that can appear at the end of a tube. These are\nthe punctures that are created in the resulting surfaces when the gauge\ncoupling is taken to be extremely weak. Not any puncture can be formed in a\ndecoupling process, and this set is described. Each such puncture can be found\ndiagrammatically in terms of the other punctures on C in a particular\ndecoupling limit.

In this paper, we prove, purely\ngeometrically, that any possible foliation of a static spherically symmetric\nspacetime by an arbitrary codimension-one spherical spacelike geometry, up to\ntime translation and rotation, is unique, and we find the algebraic condition\nunder which it exists.

The study of uniqueness and the existence concurrently solves the\nquestion of embeddability of a spherical spacelike geometry in one-dimensional\nhigher static spherically symmetric spacetimes, and this produces known and new\nresults geometrically, without having to go through the momentum and\nHamiltonian constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 10:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 17:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Some models require an above-average\nmagnetic field strength (> 10^13 G) in order to explain super-Eddington mass\naccretion rate in the recently discovered class of pulsating ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULX). The peak luminosity of SMC X-3 during its major outburst\nin 2016-2017 reached ~2.5x10^39 erg/s comparable to that in ULXs thus making\nthis source the nearest ULX-pulsar. SMC X-3 belongs to the class of transient\nX-ray pulsars with Be optical companions, and exhibited a giant outburst in\nJuly 2016 - February 2017. The source has been observed during the entire\noutburst with the Swift/XRT and Fermi/GBM telescopes, as well as the NuSTAR\nobservatory. Collected data allowed us to estimate the magnetic field strength\nof the neutron star in SMC X-3 using several independent methods. Spin\nevolution of the source during and between the outbursts and the luminosity of\nthe transition to so-called propeller regime in the range of (0.3 - 7)x10^35\nerg/s imply relatively weak dipole field of (1 - 5)x10^12 G. On the other hand,\nthere is also evidence for much stronger field in the immediate vicinity of the\nneutron star surface. In particular, transition from super- to sub-critical\naccretion regime associated with cease of the accretion column, absence of\ncyclotron absorption features in the broadband X-ray spectrum of the source\nobtained with NuSTAR and very high peak luminosity favor an order of magnitude\nstronger field. This discrepancy makes SMC X-3 a good candidate to posses\nsignificant non-dipolar components of the field, and an intermediate source\nbetween classical X-ray pulsars and accreting magnetars which may constitute an\nappreciable fraction of ULX population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 10:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 13:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 15:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

In PLC networks, different nodes of the network are interconnected via\npower delivery transmission lines, and the data signal is flowing between them.\nHowever, the attenuation and the harsh environment of the power line\ncommunication channels, makes it difficult to establish a reliable\ncommunication between two nodes of the network which are separated by a long\ndistance. Relaying and cooperative communication has been used to overcome this\nproblem. In this paper a two-hop cooperative PLC has been studied, where the\ndata is communicated between a transmitter and a receiver node, through a\nsingle array node which has to be selected from a set of available arrays. The\nrelay selection problem can be solved by having channel state information (CSI)\nat transmitter and selecting the relay which results in the best performance.\nHowever, acquiring the channel state information at transmitter increases the\ncomplexity of the communication system and introduces undesired overhead to the\nsystem. We propose a class of machine learning schemes, namely multi-armed\nbandit (MAB), to solve the relay selection problem without the knowledge of the\nchannel at the transmitter.

The estimator is used with an\nexpansion of the attenuation coefficient as a linear combination of functions\nof energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on the material composition at\npoints within the object [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med. Biol., 1976,\n733-744]. The estimator computes the line integrals of the coefficients from\nmeasurements with different spectra. Neural network estimators are trained with\nmeasurements of a calibration phantom with the clinical x-ray system. One\nestimator uses low noise training data and another network is trained with data\ncomputed by adding random noise to the low noise data. The performance of the\nestimators is compared to each other and to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).\nMethods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation\nwith an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup\nand quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration\nphantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon\ncounting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are\nconsidered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed\nby averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of\nexposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or\none projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are\ncomputed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed\nby adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are\nmultivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample\ncovariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the\nestimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test\nobjects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural\nnetwork estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the\nbias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each\ncompared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise\ndata and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup\ncases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large\nvariance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with\nhigh noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a\nproperly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator\nfor photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with\nnegligible bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 13:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}

The class of such models under\nconsideration have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points\nthat are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the\ninventory level. The conditions on the cost functions are greatly relaxed from\nthose in \\cite{helm:15b}. Characterization of the cost of a general $(s,S)$\npolicy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear\noptimization problem over the ordering levels $s$ and $S$. Existence of an\noptimizing pair $(s_*,S_*)$ is established for these models under very weak\nconditions; non-existence of an optimizing pair is also discussed. Using\naverage expected occupation and ordering measures and weak convergence\narguments, weak conditions are given for the optimality of the $(s_*,S_*)$\nordering policy in the general class of admissible policies.

Under the\nnatural condition of inf-compactness of the holding cost rate function, the\naverage expected occupation measures are seen to be tight and hence have weak\nlimits. However inf-compactness is not a natural assumption to impose on the\nordering cost function. For example, the cost function composed of a fixed cost\nplus proportional (to the size of the order) cost is not inf-compact.\nIntuitively, it would seem that imposing a requirement that the long-term\naverage cost be finite ought to imply tightness of the average expected\nordering measures; a lack of tightness should mean that the inventory process\nspends large amounts of time in regions that have arbitrarily large holding\ncosts resulting in an infinite long-term average cost.

While the climate\nis represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model\nsocio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A\nwellbeing-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human\npopulation dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic\nstates of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex\ndynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple\nequations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify\npreconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and\nplanet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a\nglobal collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider scenarios\ncorresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The\nnecessity of accounting for the \"human factor\" in Earth system models is\nhighlighted by the fact that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved\nopposing to what would \"naturally\" be expected on a planet without humans. The\nintensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human\nwell-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a\nbiomass-only scenario. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that\ntrajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be\nalmost indistinguishable during a very long transient phase.

These particles then acquire a large\ninflaton VEV-induced mass and decay perturbatively into the MSSM quanta and\ngravitinos, transferring the inflaton energy very efficiently via instant\npreheating. Regarding thermalization, we show that the MSSM degrees of freedom\nthermalize very quickly, yet not immediately by virtue of the large vacuum\nexpectation value of the inflaton, which breaks the $SU(3)_C\\times U(1)_Y$\nsymmetry into a residual $U(1)$.
