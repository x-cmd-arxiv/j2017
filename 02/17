Signaling is typically a cooperative\nprocess which requires the occurrence of multiple binding events so that\nreaction rates have a nonlinear dependence on the amount of signaling molecule.\nIt is this nonlinearity that endows biological signaling networks with robust\nswitch-like properties which are critical to their biological function. In this\nstudy, we investigate how the properties of these signaling systems depend on\nthe network architecture.

Above this transition, the eigenvectors of the\nadjacency matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral\nproperties, which are activated sequentially with increasing network activity.\nWe argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or\ndiscontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or\ndelocalized. Finally, we show that at low network coupling stochastic\ntransitions to the active branch are also driven by the set of nodes that\ncontribute more strongly to the leading eigenvector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The cross correlation functions all show peak amplitudes at zero degrees,\ndecreasing with varying slopes towards zero correlation over a range of one\ndegree. The cross correlation signals include components from point source,\nGalactic, and extragalactic diffuse emission. We use models of the diffuse\nemission from smoothing the density maps with Gaussians of sizes 1-4 Mpc to\nfind limits on the cosmic web components. From these models we find surface\nbrightness 99.7 per cent upper limits in the range of 0.09-2.20 mJy beam$^{-1}$\n(average beam size of 2.6 arcmin), corresponding to 0.01-0.30 mJy\narcmin$^{-2}$. Assuming equipartition between energy densities of cosmic rays\nand the magnetic field, the flux density limits translate to magnetic field\nstrength limits of 0.03-1.98 $\\mu$G, depending heavily on the spectral index.\nWe conclude that for a 3$\\sigma$ detection of 0.1 $\\mu$G magnetic field\nstrengths via cross correlations, image depths of sub-mJy to sub-$\\mu$Jy are\nnecessary. We include discussion on the treatment and effect of extragalactic\npoint sources and Galactic emission, and next steps for building on this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 18:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

More precisely, - We extend the existence result of Guo\nand Wenger [25] for solutions for the Dirichlet problem of Korevaar and Schoen\nto the purely singular setting. - When Y has non-positive curvature in the\nsense of Alexandrov (NPC), we show that the ideas of Jost [40] and Lin [52] can\nbe adapted to the purely singular setting to yield local Holder continuity of\nsolutions. - We extend the Liouville theorem of Sturm [67] for harmonic\nfunctions to harmonic mappings between singular metric spaces. - We extend the\ntheorem of Mayer [57] on the existence of the harmonic mapping flow and solve\nthe corresponding initial boundary value problem.

Our main goal is to initiate a\nsuperconformal bootstrap for long multiplets, one that exploits all constraints\nfrom superprimaries and their descendants. To this end, we work out the Casimir\nequations for four-point correlators of long multiplets of the two-dimensional\nglobal $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra. After constructing the full set\nof conformal blocks we discuss two different applications. The first one\nconcerns two-dimensional (2,0) theories. The numerical bootstrap analysis we\nperform serves a twofold purpose, as a feasibility study of our long multiplet\nbootstrap and also as an exploration of (2,0) theories. A second line of\napplications is directed towards four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFTs.

Much of the difficulty stems from a lack of\na theory that links a physically-realistic model for winds' density, velocity,\nand covering factors to calculations of light emission and absorption. In this\npaper we provide such a model. We consider a wind launched from a turbulent\nregion with a range of column densities, derive the differential acceleration\nof gas as a function of column density, and use this result to compute winds'\nabsorption profiles, emission profiles, and emission intensity maps in both\noptically thin and optically thick species. The model is sufficiently simple\nthat all required computations can be done analytically up to straightforward\nnumerical integrals, rendering it suitable for the problem of deriving physical\nparameters by fitting models to observed data. We show that our model produces\nrealistic absorption and emission profiles for some example cases, and argue\nthat the most promising methods of deducing mass fluxes are based on\ncombinations of absorption lines of different optical depths, or on combining\nabsorption with measurements of molecular line emission. In the second paper in\nthis series, we expand on these ideas by introducing a set of observational\ndiagnostics that are significantly more robust that those commonly in use, and\nthat can be used to obtain improved estimates of wind properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 19:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 23:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Assuming the dark matter (DM) exists, this\nacceleration relation is tantamount to an acceleration relation between DM and\nbaryons. This leads us to a universal maximum acceleration for all halos. Using\nthe latter in DM profiles that predict inner cores implies that the central\nsurface density $\\mu_{DM} = \\rho_s r_s$ must be a universal constant, as\nsuggested by previous studies in selected galaxies, revealing a strong\ncorrelation between the density $\\rho_s$ and scale $r_s$ parameters in each\nprofile.

However, they rarely have detectable debris\naccretion discs, possibly because much of the influx is fast steeply-infalling\ndebris in star-grazing orbits, producing a more tenuous signature than a slowly\naccreting disk. Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius\nand photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here\nanalytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems. We\nfind that the evolution of cm-to-km size (a_0) infallers most strongly depends\non two combinations of parameters, which effectively measure sublimation rate\nand binding strength. We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of\ninfallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of\nhot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky\n(strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the\nphotosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD)\nrange, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow.\n(ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0\n>= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages.\n(iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation,\nyielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs.

Previous work had\nconsidered cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, and\ndemonstrated the existence of circling equilibria for the corresponding\ndynamics. In this work, we propose a beacon-referenced version of the CB\npursuit law, wherein a stationary beacon provides an additional reference for\nthe individual agents in a collective.

In this event, the filament spreads out but gets\nconfined by the surrounding magnetic field. When interacting with the ambient\nmagnetic field, the filament material brightens up and flows along the magnetic\nfield lines through the corona to the chromosphere. We find that some materials\nslide down along the lifting magnetic structure containing the filament and\nimpact the chromosphere to cause two ribbon-like brightenings in a wide\ntemperature range through kinetic energy dissipation. There is evidence\nsuggesting that magnetic reconnection occurs between the filament magnetic\nstructure and the surrounding magnetic fields where filament plasma is heated\nto coronal temperatures. In addition, thread-like brightenings show up on top\nof the erupting magnetic fields at low temperatures, which might be produced by\nan energy imbalance from a fast drop of radiative cooling due to plasma\nrarefaction. Thus, this single event of failed filament eruption shows\nexistence of a variety of plasma brightenings that may be caused by completely\ndifferent heating mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 19:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

In video surveillance, motion detection is an essential accompaniment\nto activity recognition for early warning systems. Robotics also has much to\ngain from motion detection and segmentation, particularly in high speed motion\ntracking for tactile systems. There are a myriad of techniques for detecting\nand masking motion in an image. Successful systems have used Gaussian Models to\ndiscern background from foreground in an image (motion from static imagery).\nHowever, particularly in the case of a moving camera or frame of reference, it\nis necessary to compensate for the motion of the camera when attempting to\ndiscern objects moving in the foreground. For example, it is possible to\nestimate motion of the camera through optical flow methods or temporal\ndifferencing and then compensate for this motion in a background subtraction\nmodel. We selection a method by Yi et al. using Dual-Mode Single Gaussian\nModels which does just this. We implement the technique in Intel's Thread\nBuilding Blocks (TBB) and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries. We then compare\nparallelization improvements with a theoretical analysis of speedups based on\nthe characteristics of our selected model and attributes of both TBB and CUDA.\nWe make our implementation available to the public.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 21:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

In particular, this implies that, in the case that $X$ is the\nCantor set, $f$ has shadowing if and only if $(f,X)$ is the inverse limit of a\nsequence of shifts of finite type. Moreover, in the general compact metric\ncase, where $X$ is not necessarily totally disconnected, we prove that $f$ has\nshadowing if and only if $({f},{X})$ is a factor of (i.e. semi-conjugate to)\nthe inverse limit of a sequence of shifts of finite type by a quotient that\nalmost lifts pseudo-orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 22:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

However, existing concatenation schemes of polar\ncodes with other error correction codes rarely take this coupling effect into\nconsideration. To achieve a better error performance of concatenated systems\nwith polar codes as inner codes, one can divide all bits in an outer block into\ndifferent polar blocks to completely de-correlate the possible coupled errors\nin the transmitter side. We call this interleaving a blind interleaving (BI)\nwhich serves as a benchmark. Two BI schemes, termed BI-DP and BI-CDP, are\nproposed in the paper. To better balance performance, memory size, and the\ndecoding delay from the de-interleaving, a novel interleaving scheme, named the\ncorrelation-breaking interleaving (CBI), is proposed. The CBI breaks the\ncorrelated information bits based on the error correlation pattern proposed and\nproven in this paper. The proposed CBI scheme is general in the sense that any\nerror correction code can serve as the outer code. In this paper, Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes and BCH codes are used as two examples of the outer\ncodes of the interleaving scheme. The CBI scheme 1) can keep the simple SC\npolar decoding while achieving a better error performance than the\nstate-of-the-art (SOA) direct concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes and\nBCH codes; 2) achieves a comparable error performance as the BI-DP scheme with\na smaller memory size and a shorter decoding delay.

Usually, to solve this problem, people try to\nfind an efficient or heuristic fusion algorithm. It is no doubt that an\nanalytical fusion formula should be much significant for rasing accuracy and\nreducing computational burden. However, since it is a more complicated than the\nconvex quadratic optimization problem for linear point estimation fusion, it is\nnot easy to get the analytical fusion formula. In order to overcome the\ndifficulty of this problem, two popular fusion architectures are considered:\ncentralized and distributed set-membership information fusion. Firstly, both of\nthem can be converted into a semidefinite programming problem which can be\nefficiently computed, respectively. Secondly, their analytical solutions can be\nderived surprisingly by using decoupling technique. It is very interesting that\nthey are quite similar in form to the classic information filter. In the two\nanalytical fusion formulae, the information of each sensor can be clearly\ncharacterized, and the knowledge of the correlation among measurement noises\nacross sensors are not required. Finally, multi-algorithm fusion is used to\nminimize the size of the state bounding ellipsoid by complementary advantages\nof multiple parallel algorithms.

In this paper, we adopt ideas from multipath\nrouting and propose a simple decentral scheme for Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET)\nrouting, which handles passive load balancing without requiring additional\ncommunication effort. It can easily be applied to existing routing protocols to\nachieve load balancing without changing the routing process itself.

In addition to\nconstant-emissivity geometric models, we also considered a slot gap (SG)\n$E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole $B$-field and found that its\ninclusion leads to qualitatively different light curves. We therefore find that\nthe assumed $B$-field and especially the $E$-field structure, as well as the\nemission geometry (magnetic inclination and observer angles), have a great\nimpact on the pulsar's visibility and its high-energy pulse shape. We compared\nour model light curves to the superior-quality $\\gamma$-ray light curve of the\nVela pulsar (for energies $>100$ MeV). Our overall optimal light curve fit\n(with the lowest $\\chi^2$ value) is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG\nmodel. We found that smaller values of $\\epsilon$ are favoured for the\noffset-PC dipole field when assuming constant emissivity, and larger $\\epsilon$\nvalues are favoured for variable emissivity, but not significantly so. When we\nincreased the relatively low SG $E$-fields we found improved light curve fits,\nwith the inferred pulsar geometry being closer to best fits from independent\nstudies in this case. In particular, we found that such a larger SG $E$-field\n(leading to variable emissivity) gives a second overall best fit. This and\nother indications point to the fact that the actual $E$-field may be larger\nthan predicted by the SG model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 06:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

The most\nwell-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies\non assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In\nthis paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the\nremarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex\nnon-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of\nboth latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train\nthe deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this\nmethod only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be\napplied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the\nobservation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation\nstudies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal\nperformance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown.\nFurthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and\nnon-Gaussian systems.

In case of semi - elliptic bare density of states disorder\ninfluence upon the coefficients $A$ and $B$ before the square and the fourth\npower of the order - parameter is universal for any value of electron\ncorrelation and is related only to the general disorder widening of the bare\nband (generalized Anderson theorem). Such universality is absent for the\ngradient term expansion coefficient $C$. In the usual theory of \"dirty\"\nsuperconductors the $C$ coefficient drops with the growth of disorder. In the\nlimit of strong disorder in BCS limit the coefficient $C$ is very sensitive to\nthe effects of Anderson localization, which lead to its further drop with\ndisorder growth up to the region of Anderson insulator. In the region of BCS -\nBEC crossover and in BEC limit the coefficient $C$ and all related physical\nproperties are weakly dependent on disorder. In particular, this leads to\nrelatively weak disorder dependence of both penetration depth and coherence\nlengths, as well as of related slope of the upper critical magnetic field at\nsuperconducting transition, in the region of very strong coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 07:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

Carbon\ndioxide, CO2, originating from the atmosphere and exhaled by tree roots into\nthe soil, may be hydrated by soil water within the unsaturated zone (USZ) of\nsemi-arid soils to produce the carbonic acid (H2CO3) solutes HCO3- bicarbonate\nand H+ Hydrogen ion. This H+ may then dissolve relict soil CaCO3 carbonate\n(calcite), to release Ca+2 calcium cations and more HCO3- bicarbonate. When\nconditions allow, one mole of Ca+2 and two moles of HCO3- combine to\nprecipitate one mole of calcite, and to release one mole of CO2: Ca+2 + 2HCO3-\n--> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O. However, it has been claimed that such carbonates do not\nsequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given\nwere that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for\nevery mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the\natmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a\nnon-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these\nassumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel. We found\nthat bicarbonate, originating from root exhalation, is depleted and is\nincorporated within the USZ as carbonates precipitate. Thus, a net\nsequestration of atmospheric CO2 does occur under semi-arid forests. Moreover,\nmost of the CO2 liberated in the precipitation reaction may remain in the soil.\nAnd Ca+2 in the sediment may also be supplied from sources other than\npre-existing calcite. Forestation can therefore augment pedogenic carbonate\nformation. By extrapolating our data globally, we suggest that worldwide\nsemi-arid forests (existing and to be planted) may sequester 5-20% of the\ncurrent annual anthropogenic increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide as\npedogenic carbonate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 08:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 06:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

A common misconception is that the dependence\nrevealed by these measures must be specific to the spectral range of the\nfiltered input signals. Implicitly or explicitly, obtaining analytic phase\ninvolves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear\noperation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates\nbias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase\nlocking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as\na consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can\nbe viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which\nrecenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes\nof the compared signals are correlated.

The cluster Abell 315 is an interesting test\ncase, since it has been claimed to be underluminous in X-ray for its mass\n(determined via kinematics and weak lensing). We have undertaken new\nspectroscopic observations with the aim of improving the cluster mass estimate,\nusing the distribution of galaxies in projected phase space. We identified\ncluster members in our new spectroscopic sample. We estimated the cluster mass\nfrom the projected phase-space distribution of cluster members using the\nMAMPOSSt method. In doing this estimate we took into account the presence of\nsubstructures that we were able to identify. We identify several cluster\nsubstructures. The main two have an overlapping spatial distribution,\nsuggesting a (past or ongoing) collision along the line-of-sight. After\naccounting for the presence of substructures, the mass estimate of Abell 315\nfrom kinematics is reduced by a factor 4, down to M200=0.8 (-0.4,+0.6) x 10^14\nMsun. We also find evidence that the cluster mass concentration is unusually\nlow, c200=r200/r-2 <~ 1. Using our new estimate of c200 we revise the weak\nlensing mass estimate down to M200=1.8 (-0.9,+1.7) x 10^14 Msun. Our new mass\nestimates are in agreement with that derived from the cluster X-ray luminosity\nvia a scaling relation, M200=0.9+-0.2 x 10^14 Msun.

Its mass estimate was inflated by\nthe presence of an undetected subcluster in collision with the main cluster.\nWhether the presence of undetected line-of-sight structures can be a general\nexplanation for all X-ray underluminous clusters remains to be explored using a\nstatistically significant sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 09:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

In this paper, we study the optimal magnetic beamforming design\nin a multi-user MIMO MRC-WPT system. We introduce the multi-user power region\nthat constitutes all the achievable power tuples for all RXs, subject to the\ngiven total power constraint over all TXs as well as their individual peak\nvoltage and current constraints. We characterize each boundary point of the\npower region by maximizing the sum-power deliverable to all RXs subject to\ntheir minimum harvested power constraints. For the special case without the TX\npeak voltage and current constraints, we derive the optimal TX current\nallocation for the single-RX setup in closed-form as well as that for the\nmulti-RX setup. In general, the problem is a non-convex quadratically\nconstrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which is difficult to solve. For the\ncase of one single RX, we show that the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the\nproblem is tight. For the general case with multiple RXs, based on SDR we\nobtain two approximate solutions by applying time-sharing and randomization,\nrespectively. Moreover, for practical implementation of magnetic beamforming,\nwe propose a novel signal processing method to estimate the magnetic MIMO\nchannel due to the mutual inductances between TXs and RXs.

In certain pathologic conditions, expression and\nshedding of HS proteoglycans is overregulated, or enzymatic degradation of HS\nin lysosomes is deficient, both leading to excess circulating free HS chains in\nblood plasma. HS has therefore been suggested as a biomarker for various severe\ndisease states.

So far the graph framework has\nbeen limited to real- and vector-valued functions on Euclidean domains. In this\npaper we generalize this model to the case of manifold-valued data. We\nintroduce the basic calculus needed to formulate variational models and partial\ndifferential equations for manifold-valued functions and discuss the proposed\ngraph framework for two particular families of operators, namely, the isotropic\nand anisotropic graph~$p$-Laplacian operators, $p\\geq1$. Based on the choice of\n$p$ we are in particular able to solve optimization problems on manifold-valued\nfunctions involving total variation ($p=1$) and Tikhonov ($p=2$)\nregularization. Finally, we present numerical results from processing both\nsynthetic as well as real-world manifold-valued data, e.g., from diffusion\ntensor imaging (DTI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 10:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 12:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

Such delay is inconvenient and make the\noffloading unsuitable for real-time applications.

In particular, for an ensemble of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, high conversion efficiencies between\nnitrogen (P1) defects and NV centers are essential, while maintaining long\ncoherence times of an NV ensemble. In this work, we study the effect of\nelectron irradiation on the conversion efficiency and the coherence time of\nvarious types of diamond samples with different initial nitrogen\nconcentrations. The samples were irradiated using a 200 keV transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM). Our study reveals that the efficiency of NV creation\nstrongly depends on the initial conversion efficiency as well as on the initial\nnitrogen concentration. We observe an order of magnitude improvement in the NV\nconcentration (up to $\\sim 10^{11}$ NV/cm^2), without any degradation in their\ncoherence times of $\\sim 180$ \\mu m. We address the potential of this technique\nto pave the way toward the study of many-body physics of ensembles of NV spins,\nand contribute to the creation of non-classical spin states for quantum\nsensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 13:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 08:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 10:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

An equilibrium oscillating potential, which creates different orbit\ntopologies of energetic particles, is included into the bump-on-tail\ninstability problem of a plasma wave. With respect to fast particles dynamics,\nthe extended model captures the range of particles motion (trapped/passing)\nwith energy and thus represents a more realistic 1D picture of the long range\nsweeping events observed for weakly damped modes, e.g. global Alfven\neigenmodes, in tokamaks. The Poisson equation is solved numerically along with\nbounce averaging the Vlasov equation in the adiabatic regime. We demonstrate\nthat the shape and the saturation amplitude of the nonlinear mode structure\ndepends not only on the amount of deviation from the initial eigenfrequency but\nalso on the initial energy of the resonant electrons in the equilibrium\npotential. Similarly, the results reveal that the resonant electrons following\ndifferent equilibrium orbits in the electrostatic potential lead to different\nrates of frequency evolution. As compared to the previous model [Breizman B.N.\n2010 Nucl. Fusion 50 084014], it is shown that the frequency sweeps with lower\nrates. The additional physics included in the model enables a more complete 1D\ndescription of the range of phenomena observed in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 13:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Our aim is to\ngive a homotopy theoretical interpretation of this procedure, which may be\nextended to a relative setting. We work in an arbitrary abelian category A and\nfix a class I of \"injective objects\". We show that Spaltenstein's construction\ncan be captured by a pair of adjoint functors between unbounded chain complexes\nand towers of non-positively graded ones.

These processes are parametrized by a scaling\nparameter $K$ which can be thought as the order of magnitude of the total size\nof the population at time $0$. For any fixed finite time span, it is well-known\nthat such processes, when renormalized by $K$, are close, in the limit\n$K\\to+\\infty$, to the solutions of a certain differential equation in\n$\\mathbb{R}_+^d$ whose vector field is determined by the birth and death rates.\nWe consider the case where there is a unique attractive fixed point (off the\nboundary of the positive orthant) for the vector field (while the origin is\nrepulsive).

This interpretation faces the challenge of an\napparent multi-frequency nature of this signal in the light curves taken days\n180 and 196 after outburst. We show that the multi-sine fit method, based on a\nsuperposition of two sine functions, yields two inherently indistinguishable\nsolutions, i.e. the presence of two close frequencies, or a single signal with\nconstant frequency but variable modulation amplitude. Using a power spectrum\ntime map, we show that on day 180, a reduction of the modulation amplitude of\nthe signal coincides with a substantial overall flux decline while on day 196,\nthe signal was only present during the first half of the observation. Supported\nby simulations, we show that such variations in amplitude can lead to false\nbeating that manifests itself as a multiple signal if computing a periodogram\nover the full light curve. Therefore, the previously proposed double frequency\nnature of both light curves was probably an artefact while we consider a single\nsignal with frequency equal to the white dwarf rotation as more plausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a\nlarge-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000\nresponses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to\nWikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal\ncuriosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey\nresponses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs,\nenabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use\ncases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across\ntopics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using\nWikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on\ntopics such as science. Our findings advance our understanding of reader\nmotivations and behavior on Wikipedia and can have implications for developers\naiming to improve Wikipedia's user experience, editors striving to cater to\ntheir readers' needs, third-party services (such as search engines) providing\naccess to Wikipedia content, and researchers aiming to build tools such as\nrecommendation engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 10:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

In this case, they may\nbe non-thermally produced during inflation, in turn originated by the scalaron\nfield with Starobinsky's potential.Assuming gravitinos as Lightest\nsupersymmetric particles (LSSP), the non-thermal production naturally accounts\nfor the right amount of cold dark matter. Metastability of the gravitino LSSP\nleads to observable effects of their decay, putting constraints on the\ncorresponding Unstable or Decaying Dark Matters scenarios. In this model, the\ngravitino mass is controlled by the inflaton field and it runs with it. This\nimplies that a continuous spectrum of superheavy gravitinos is produced during\nthe slow-roll epoch.

Here, we show that the fundamental\nsetup of two atoms coupled to a single-mode cavity can be distinctly exceeding\nthe free-space superradiant behavior, a phenomenon which we call hyperradiance.\nThe effect is accompanied by strong quantum fluctuations and surprisingly\narises for atoms radiating out-of-phase, an alleged non-ideal condition, where\none expects subradiance. We are able to explain the onset of hyperradiance in a\ntransparent way by a photon cascade taking place among manifolds of Dicke\nstates with different photon numbers under particular out-of-phase coupling\nconditions. The theoretical results can be realized with current technology and\nthus should stimulate future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 12:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

Time-scale independent and\nparameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and\nSPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time-scale parametric measures, since\nby adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time-scales\nof a given dataset.\n  New Method: In data containing multiple time-scales (e.g. regular spiking and\nbursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time-scales and a more\nadaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the\nA-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original\nmeasures by considering the local relative to the global time-scales. For the\nA-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the\nRIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.\n  Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance\nallow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more\nglobal scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an\nunreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally,\nthe RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike\ntrains.\n  Comparison with Existing Methods: We find that compared to the original\nversions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for\nspike trains containing different time-scales without exhibiting any unwanted\nside effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more\nefficiently than SPIKE-Synchronization.\n  Conclusions: With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now\nprovide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to rate only\n(A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same\ntime (A-SPIKE-distance).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 12:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

The stochastic rule is identical for each possible\nedge and may depend on the past $k \\ge 0$ observations of the edge's state. We\nexamine two kinds of random walks for a single agent taking place in such a\ndynamic graph: (i) The \\emph{Random Walk with a Delay} (\\emph{RWD}), where at\neach step the agent chooses (uniformly at random) an incident possible edge,\ni.e., an incident edge in the underlying static graph, and then it waits till\nthe edge becomes alive to traverse it.

The simplest dark energy\ncandidate is a cosmological constant. However, this attempt presents a huge\ndiscrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the theoretical prediction and\nthe observed data. Such a huge disparity motivates physicists to look into a\nmore sophisticated models. This can be done either looking for a deeper\nunderstanding of where the cosmological constant comes from, if one wants to\nderive it from first principles, or considering other possibilities for\naccelerated expansion, such as modifications of general relativity, additional\nmatter fields and so on. Still regarding a dynamical dark energy, there may\nexist a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, since\ntheir densities are comparable and, depending on the coupling used, the\ninteraction can also alleviate the issue of why dark energy and matter\ndensities are of the same order today. Phenomenological models have been widely\nexplored in the literature. On the other hand, field theory models that aim a\nconsistent description of the dark energy/dark matter interaction are still\nfew. In this thesis, we explore either a scalar or a vector field as a dark\nenergy candidate in several different approaches, taking into account a\npossible interaction between the two components of the dark sector.
