A\nsuitable conceptual scheme could be represented by gravity models that\nnaturally generalize Einstein Theory like higher order gravity theories and\nhigher dimensional ones. Both of these two different approaches allow to\ndefine, at the effective level, Einstein field equations equipped with\nsource-like energy momentum tensors of geometrical origin. In this paper, it is\ndiscussed the possibility to develop a five dimensional fourth order gravity\nmodel whose lower dimensional reduction could provide an interpretation of\ncosmological four dimensional matter-energy components. We describe the basic\nconcepts of the model, the complete field equations formalism and the 5-Dim to\n4-Dim reduction procedure.

To\nexecute a complex computing task over a data center, it is natural to\ndistribute computations across many nodes to take advantage of parallel\nprocessing. However, as we allocate more and more computing resources to a\ncomputation task and further distribute the computations, large amounts of\n(partially) computed data must be moved between consecutive stages of\ncomputation tasks among the nodes, hence the communication load can become the\nbottleneck. In this paper, we study the optimal allocation of computing\nresources in distributed computing, in order to minimize the total execution\ntime in distributed computing accounting for both the duration of computation\nand communication phases. In particular, we consider a general MapReduce-type\ndistributed computing framework, in which the computation is decomposed into\nthree stages: \\emph{Map}, \\emph{Shuffle}, and \\emph{Reduce}. We focus on a\nrecently proposed \\emph{Coded Distributed Computing} approach for MapReduce and\nstudy the optimal allocation of computing resources in this framework. For all\nvalues of problem parameters, we characterize the optimal number of servers\nthat should be used for distributed processing, provide the optimal placements\nof the Map and Reduce tasks, and propose an optimal coded data shuffling\nscheme, in order to minimize the total execution time. To prove the optimality\nof the proposed scheme, we first derive a matching information-theoretic\nconverse on the execution time, then we prove that among all possible resource\nallocation schemes that achieve the minimum execution time, our proposed scheme\nuses the exactly minimum possible number of servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 17:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

Based on this insight, a control strategy based on\nvirtual constraints, which imposes coordination between joints rather than a\ntemporal evolution, will be proposed for achieving asymptotic convergence\ntoward a periodic motion. For planar bipeds with one degree of underactuation,\nit is known that a vertical displacement of the center of mass---with downward\nvelocity at the step transition---induces stability of a walking gait. This\npaper concerns the qualitative extension of this type of property to 3D walking\nwith two degrees of underactuation. It is shown that a condition on the\nposition of the center of mass in the horizontal plane at the transition\nbetween steps induces synchronization between the motions in the sagittal and\nfrontal planes. A combination of the conditions for self-synchronization and\nvertical oscillations leads to stable gaits. The algorithm for\nself-stabilization of 3D walking gaits is first developed for a simplified\nmodel of a walking robot (an inverted pendulum with variable length legs), and\nthen it is extended to a complex model of the humanoid robot Romeo using the\nnotion of Hybrid Zero Dynamics.

NDT is an architecture\na la decision tree where each splitting node is an independent multilayer\nperceptron allowing oblique decision functions or arbritrary nonlinear decision\nfunction if more than one layer is used. This way, each MLP can be seen as a\nnode of the tree. We then show that with the weight sharing asumption among\nthose units, we end up with a Hashing Neural Network (HNN) which is a\nmultilayer perceptron with sigmoid activation function for the last layer as\nopposed to the standard softmax. The output units then jointly represent the\nprobability to be in a particular region.

Our objective is to identify the heating mechanisms in one\nsuch galaxy, IZw18, and assess the diagnostic value of fine-structure cooling\nlines. We also seek to constrain the mass of H$_2$, which, despite being an\nimportant catalyst and tracer of star formation, remains elusive in this\nobject. Building on a previous photoionization model within a multi-sector\ntopology, we provide additional constraints from the [CII] and [OI] lines and\nthe dust mass recently measured with Herschel. The heating of the HI region\nappears to be mainly due to photoionization by radiation from a bright X-ray\nbinary source, while photoelectric effect (PE) is negligible. The [CII] and\n[OI] lines imply an average X-ray luminosity of $4\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nwhile the [NeV] upper limits bring strong constraints to the soft X-ray flux\narising from the binary. A negligible amount of H$_2$ is predicted, but\n$\\lesssim10^7$ M$_\\odot$ of H$_2$ may be hidden in sufficiently dense clouds of\norder $\\lesssim10$ pc in size. Regardless of the presence of significant\namounts of H$_2$, [CII] and [OI] do not trace the so-called CO-dark gas, but\nthe almost purely atomic medium. Although the [CII]+[OI]/TIR ratio is close to\nvalues found in more metal-rich sources, it cannot be safely used as a PE\nheating efficiency proxy. This ratio seems to be kept stable due to a\ncorrelation between the X-ray luminosity and the star-formation rate. We\npropose that X-ray heating is an important process in extremely metal-poor\nsources. The weak PE heating due to the low dust-to-gas ratio could be\ncompensated for by the larger occurrence and power of X-ray binaries in\nlow-metallicity galaxies. We speculate that X-ray heating may quench star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 20:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 10:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Strong-tie edges are often readily obtained\nfrom the social network as users often participate in multiple overlapping\nnetworks via features such as following and messaging. These networks may vary\ngreatly in size, density and the information they carry. This setting leads to\na natural strong tie detection task: given a small set of labeled strong tie\nedges, how well can one detect unlabeled strong ties in the remainder of the\nnetwork?\n  This task becomes particularly daunting for the Twitter network due to scant\navailability of pairwise relationship attribute data, and sparsity of strong\ntie networks such as phone contacts. Given these challenges, a natural approach\nis to instead use structural network features for the task, produced by {\\em\ncombining} the strong and \"weak\" edges. In this work, we demonstrate via\nexperiments on Twitter data that using only such structural network features is\nsufficient for detecting strong ties with high precision. These structural\nnetwork features are obtained from the presence and frequency of small network\nmotifs on combined strong and weak ties. We observe that using motifs larger\nthan triads alleviate sparsity problems that arise for smaller motifs, both due\nto increased combinatorial possibilities as well as benefiting strongly from\nsearching beyond the ego network. Empirically, we observe that not all motifs\nare equally useful, and need to be carefully constructed from the combined\nedges in order to be effective for strong tie detection. Finally, we reinforce\nour experimental findings with providing theoretical justification that\nsuggests why incorporating these larger sized motifs as features could lead to\nincreased performance in planted graph models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 20:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Next we\nanalyze the normal operator $\\Fc^*\\Fc$ in both cases (where $\\Fc^{*}$ is the\n$L^{2}$-adjoint of $\\Fc$).

The spherical depth $\\SphD(q;S)$ is\nalso defined for an arbitrary data set $S\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed\nhyper-balls, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The\nsignificant advantage of using the spherical depth in multivariate data\nanalysis is related to its complexity of computation. Unlike most other data\ndepths, the time complexity of the spherical depth grows linearly rather than\nexponentially in the dimension $d$. The straightforward algorithm for computing\nthe spherical depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this\npaper is an optimal algorithm that we present for computing the bivariate\nspherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \\log n)$ time. By reducing the\nproblem of \\textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical\ndepth requires $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical\ndepth are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that\n\\emph{simplicial depth} ($\\SD$) (Liu, 1990) is linearly bounded by spherical\ndepth (in particular, $\\SphD\\geq \\frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate this\nrelationship between the spherical depth and the simplicial depth, some\nexperimental results are provided. The obtained experimental bound ($\\SphD\\geq\n2\\SD$) indicates that, perhaps, a stronger theoretical bound can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 21:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

Identifying the source of food-borne\nzoonoses (e.g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the\nidentification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many\nzoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to sources of\ninfection because there is little epidemiological information on the cases.\nHowever, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised,\nand the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human\ncases allows inference on the likely source of each infection. We introduce\nsourceR, an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne\ndiseases. It implements a fully joint Bayesian model using strain-typed\nsurveillance data from both human cases and source samples, capable of\nidentifying important sources of infection. The model measures the force of\ninfection from each source, allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity\nand virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities of the sources to act\nas vehicles of infection. A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process)\napproach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour,\navoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated\nwith potentially high 'virulence'.\n  sourceR is demonstrated using Campylobacter jejuni isolate data collected in\nNew Zealand between 2005 and 2008.

However, despite the fact that physical\nactivity is essential for a healthy lifestyle, surprisingly little is known\nabout how gamification and in particular competitions shape human physical\nactivity. Here we study how competitions affect physical activity. We focus on\nwalking challenges in a mobile activity tracking application where multiple\nusers compete over who takes the most steps over a predefined number of days.\nWe synthesize our findings in a series of game and app design implications. In\nparticular, we analyze nearly 2,500 physical activity competitions over a\nperiod of one year capturing more than 800,000 person days of activity\ntracking. We observe that during walking competitions, the average user\nincreases physical activity by 23%. Furthermore, there are large increases in\nactivity for both men and women across all ages, and weight status, and even\nfor users that were previously fairly inactive. We also find that the\ncomposition of participants greatly affects the dynamics of the game. In\nparticular, if highly unequal participants get matched to each other, then\ncompetition suffers and the overall effect on the physical activity drops\nsignificantly. Furthermore, competitions with an equal mix of both men and\nwomen are more effective in increasing the level of activities. We leverage\nthese insights to develop a statistical model to predict whether or not a\ncompetition will be particularly engaging with significant accuracy. Our models\ncan serve as a guideline to help design more engaging competitions that lead to\nmost beneficial behavioral changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 01:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

It is found that the existence of mechanical oscil-\nlator does not affect the phase boundary between the normal and superradiant\nphases. However, the superradiant phase collapses by the resonant damping of\nthe oscillator when the atom-field coupling increases to a so-called turning\npoint. As a consequence the system undergoes at this point an additional phase\ntransition from the superradiant phase to a new normal phase of the atomic\npopulation-inversion state. The region of superradiant phase decreases with the\nincrease of photon-phonon coupling. It shrinks to zero at a critical value of\nthe coupling and a direct atomic population transfer appears between two\natom-levels. Moreover we find an unstable nonzero-photon state, which is the\ncounterpart of the superradiant state. In the absence of oscillator our result\nre- duces exactly to that of Dicke model. Particularly the ground-state energy\nfor N = 1 (i.e. the Rabi model) is in perfect agreement with the numerical\ndiagonalization in a wide region of coupling constant for both red and blue\ndetuning.

The token that corresponds to a predicate $f$ can\ndecrypt the ciphertext associated with attributes $x$ if and only if $f(x)=1$.\nHidden vector encryption (HVE) is a special kind of predicate encryption.

We call the weak\ncommunities the hidden community structure.\n  We present a novel approach called HICODE (HIdden COmmunity DEtection) that\nidentifies the hidden community structure as well as the dominant community\nstructure. By weakening the strength of the dominant structure, one can uncover\nthe hidden structure beneath. Likewise, by reducing the strength of the hidden\nstructure, one can more accurately identify the dominant structure.

However, as the TNRD\nmodel is a local model, the diffusion behavior of which is purely controlled by\ninformation of local patches, it is prone to create artifacts in the homogenous\nregions and over-smooth highly textured regions, especially in the case of\nstrong noise levels. Meanwhile, it is widely known that the non-local\nself-similarity (NSS) prior stands as an effective image prior for image\ndenoising, which has been widely exploited in many non-local methods. In this\nwork, we are highly motivated to embed the NSS prior into the TNRD model to\ntackle its weaknesses. In order to preserve the expected property that\nend-to-end training is available, we exploit the NSS prior by a set of\nnon-local filters, and derive our proposed trainable non-local reaction\ndiffusion (TNLRD) model for image denoising. Together with the local filters\nand influence functions, the non-local filters are learned by employing\nloss-specific training. The experimental results show that the trained TNLRD\nmodel produces visually plausible recovered images with more textures and less\nartifacts, compared to its local versions. Moreover, the trained TNLRD model\ncan achieve strongly competitive performance to recent state-of-the-art image\ndenoising methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural\nsimilarity index (SSIM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 06:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

We propose the Seamless Internetwork Flow Mobility (SIFM)\narchitecture that provides seamless flow-mobility support using concepts of\nSoftware Defined Networking (SDN). The SDN paradigm decouples the control and\ndata plane, leading to a centralized network intelligence and state. The SIFM\narchitecture utilizes this aspect of SDN and moves the mobility decisions to a\ncentralized Flow Controller (FC). This provides a global network view while\nmaking mobility decisions and also reduces the complexity at the PGW. We\nimplement and evaluate both basic PMIPv6 and the SIFM architectures by\nincorporating salient LTE and WiFi network features in the ns-3 simulator.\nPerformance experiments validate that seamless mobility is achieved. Also, the\nSIFM architecture shows an improved network performance when compared to the\nbase PMIPv6 architecture. A proof-of-concept prototype of the SIFM architecture\nhas been implemented on an experimental testbed. The LTE network is emulated by\nintegrating USRP B210x with the OpenLTE eNodeB and OpenLTE EPC. The WiFi\nnetwork is emulated using hostapd and dnsmasq daemons running on Ubuntu 12.04.\nAn off-the-shelf LG G2 mobile phone running Android 4.2.2 is used as the user\nequipment.

The cograph editing problem consists in inserting\ninto and deleting from $G$ a set $F$ of edges so that $H=(V,E\\Delta F)$ is a\ncograph and $|F|$ is minimum. This NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem\nhas recently found applications, e.g., in the context of phylogenetics.\nEfficient heuristics are hence of practical importance. The simple\ncharacterization of cographs in terms of their modular decomposition suggests\nthat instead of editing $G$ one could operate directly on the modular\ndecomposition.

In particular, assumption\n(2) is not supported by observational data of the sources and PIC simulation\nyield different spectral indices as well. We present the detailed calculation\nof the electron-to-proton ratio, dropping the assumption of equal spectral\nindices. We distinguish between the ratio of luminosities and the ratio of the\ndifferential spectral behavior, which becomes necessary for cases where the\nspectral indices of the two particle populations are not the same. We discuss\nthe possible range of values when allowing for different spectral indices\nconcerning the spectral behavior of electrons and protons. Additionally, it is\nshown that the minimum energy of the accelerated population can have a large\ninfluence on the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 10:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

Putting the energy and momentum loss rate of the initial partons into\nthe source terms, we obtain hydrodynamic initial conditions dynamically. The\nresultant initial profile of the quark-gluon fluid looks highly bumpy as seen\nin the conventional event-by-event initial conditions. In addition, initial\nrandom flow velocity fields also are generated as a consequence of momentum\ndeposition from the initial partons. We regard the partons that survive after\nthe dynamical initialization process as the mini-jets and find sizable effects\nof both mini-jet propagation in the quark-gluon fluids and initial random\ntransverse flow on the final momentum spectra and anisotropic flow observables.\nWe perform event-by-event $(3+1)$-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic simulations\nwith this new framework that enables us to describe the hydrodynamic bulk\ncollectivity, parton energy loss, and interplay among them in a unified manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 11:19:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 08:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

In information theory and\nBayesian inference, the simplicity of a model is precisely quantified in the\nstochastic complexity, which measures the number of bits needed to encode its\nparameters. In order to understand how simple models look like, we study the\nstochastic complexity of spin models with interactions of arbitrary order. We\nhighlight the existence of invariances with respect to bijections within the\nspace of operators, which allow us to partition the space of all models into\nequivalence classes, in which models share the same complexity. We thus found\nthat the complexity (or simplicity) of a model is not determined by the order\nof the interactions, but rather by their mutual arrangements. Models where\nstatistical dependencies are localized on non-overlapping groups of few\nvariables (and that afford predictions on independencies that are easy to\nfalsify) are simple.

We also demonstrate improved performance over\nbelief propagation on sparser Tanner graph representations of the codes.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the RNN decoder can be used to improve the\nperformance or alternatively reduce the computational complexity of the mRRD\nalgorithm for low complexity, close to optimal, decoding of short BCH codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 12:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

The regeneration of these new UHE photons then provides a second chance\nto produce the muon pairs, enhancing the neutrino flux. We investigate the\nneutrino production in the propagation of UHE photons in the intergalactic\nspace at different redshifts, considering various competing processes such as\npair production, double pair production for UHE photons, and triplet production\nand synchrotron radiation for UHE electrons. Regarding the least energetic\noutgoing particles as energy loss, we obtain the effective penetration length\nof the leading particle, as well as energy loss rate including the neutrino\nemission rate in the cascade process.

As part of the study carried out\nby the Herschel GCC Programme, here we study the filament properties presented\nin GCC.VII in context with theoretical models of filament formation and\nevolution. A conservative sample of filaments at a distance D<500pc was\nextracted with the Getfilaments algorithm. Their physical structure was\nquantified according to two main components: the central (Gaussian) region\n(core component), and the power-law like region dominating the filament column\ndensity profile at larger radii (wing component). The properties and behaviour\nof these components relative to the total linear mass density of the filament\nand its environmental column density were compared with theoretical models\ndescribing the evolution of filaments under gravity-dominated conditions. The\nfeasibility of a transition to supercritical state by accretion is dependent on\nthe combined effect of filament intrinsic properties and environmental\nconditions. Reasonably self-gravitating (high Mline-core) filaments in dense\nenvironments (av\\sim3mag) can become supercritical in timescales of t\\sim1Myr\nby accreting mass at constant or decreasing width. The trend of increasing\nMline-tot (Mline-core and Mline-wing), and ridge Av with background also\nindicates that the precursors of star-forming filaments evolve coevally with\ntheir environment. The simultaneous increase of environment and filament Av\nexplains the association between dense environments and high Mline-core values,\nand argues against filaments remaining in constant single-pressure equilibrium\nstates.

We first present new practical sequential and parallel\nalgorithms for wavelet tree construction. Their unifying characteristics is\nthat they construct the wavelet tree bottomup}, i.e., they compute the last\nlevel first. We also show that this bottom-up construction can easily be\nadapted to wavelet matrices. In practice, our best sequential algorithm is up\nto twice as fast as the currently fastest sequential wavelet tree construction\nalgorithm (Shun [DCC, 2015]), simultaneously saving a factor of 2 in space.\nThis scales up to 32 cores, where we are about equally fast as the currently\nfastest parallel wavelet tree construction algorithm (Labeit et al. [DCC,\n2016]), but still use only about 75 % of the space. An additional theoretical\nresult shows how to adapt any wavelet tree construction algorithm to the\nwavelet matrix in the same (asymptotic) time, using only little extra space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 13:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 10:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 14:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

It is well known that CPLs have negative impedance\neffects, which may cause instability in a DC microgrid. Existing works often\nstudy the stability around a given equilibrium based on some nominal values of\nCPLs. However, in real applications, the equilibrium of a DC microgrid depends\non the loading condition that often changes over time. Different from many\nprevious results, this paper develops a framework that can analyze the DC\nmicrogrid stability for a given range of CPLs. The problem is formulated as a\nrobust stability problem of a polytopic uncertain linear system. By exploiting\nthe structure of the problem, we derive a set of sufficient conditions that can\nguarantee robust stability. The conditions can be efficiently checked by\nsolving a convex optimization problem whose complexity does not grow with the\nnumber of buses in the microgrid. The effectiveness and non-conservativeness of\nthe proposed framework are demonstrated using simulation examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 13:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

As a proof of concept we apply it to\na UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a simulated environment, learning to cross a\nroom containing a number of obstacles. So far only feedforward neural networks\n(FNNs) have been used to train UAV control. To cope with more complex tasks, we\npropose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) instead and successfully\ntrain an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network for controlling UAVs. Vision\nbased control is a sequential prediction problem, known for its highly\ncorrelated input data. The correlation makes training a network hard,\nespecially an RNN. To overcome this issue, we investigate an alternative\nsampling method during training, namely window-wise truncated backpropagation\nthrough time (WW-TBPTT). Further, end-to-end training requires a lot of data\nwhich often is not available. Therefore, we compare the performance of\nretraining only the Fully Connected (FC) and LSTM control layers with networks\nwhich are trained end-to-end.

The built-in spin flip mechanism is a\nconsequence of the spin-vibration interaction resulting from the interplay\nbetween the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the vibrational modes of the\nsuspended carbon nanotube. On the other hand, utilizing thermoelectric effect,\nthe temperature difference between the electron and the thermal bath to which\nthe vibrational modes are coupled provides the driving force. We find that both\nmagnitude and direction of the generated pure spin current are dependent on the\nstrength of spin-vibration interaction, the sublevel configuration in dot, the\ntemperatures of electron and thermal bath, and the tunneling rate between the\ndot and the pole. Moreover, in the linear response regime, the kinetic\ncoefficient is non-monotonic in the temperature $T$ and it reaches its maximum\nwhen $k_BT$ is about one phonon energy. The existence of a strong intradot\nCoulomb interaction is irrelevant for our spin battery, provided that\nhigh-order cotunneling processes are suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 14:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

It includes an interface for expressing complex\ndata reduction pipelines consisting of both data sets and algorithmic\ncomponents and an implementation run-time to execute such pipelines on\ndistributed resources. By mapping the logical view of a pipeline to its\nphysical realisation, DALiuGE separates the concerns of multiple stakeholders,\nallowing them to collectively optimise large-scale data processing solutions in\na coherent manner. The execution in DALiuGE is data-activated, where each\nindividual data item autonomously triggers the processing on itself. Such\ndecentralisation also makes the execution framework very scalable and flexible,\nsupporting pipeline sizes ranging from less than ten tasks running on a laptop\nto tens of millions of concurrent tasks on the second fastest supercomputer in\nthe world. DALiuGE has been used in production for reducing interferometry data\nsets from the Karl E.

The method of\nnormal modes is not applicable due to the time dependence of the nonlinear base\nprofile. Therefore, the instability is quantified either in terms of critical\ntimes at which the boundary layer instability sets in or in terms of long time\nevolution of initial disturbances. This paper adopts an unstably stratified\nbasic profile having a step function density with top heavy carbon saturated\nlayer (boundary layer) overlying a lighter carbon free layer (ambient brine).\nThe resulting configuration resembles that of the Rayleigh-Taylor problem with\nbuoyancy diffusion at the interface separating the two layers. The\ndiscontinuous reference state satisfies the governing system of equations and\nboundary conditions and pertains to an unstably stratified motionless state.\nOur model accounts for anisotropy in both diffusion and permeability and\nchemical reaction between the carbon dioxide rich brine and host mineralogy. We\nproceed by supposing that the carbon dioxide that has accumulated below the top\ncap rock forms a layer of carbon saturated brine of some thickness that\noverlies a carbon-free brine layer. The resulting stratification remains stable\nuntil the thickness of the carbon saturated layer is sufficient to induce the\nfluid to overturn. With this formulation for the reference state, the stability\ncalculations will be in terms of critical boundary layer thickness instead of\ncritical times, although the two formulations are homologous. This approach is\ntractable by the classical normal mode analysis. Even though it yields only\nconservative threshold instability conditions, it offers the advantage for an\nanalytically tractable linear and weakly nonlinear studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 15:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

To satisfy the considerable amount of mobile video requests, video\nservice providers have been pushing their content delivery infrastructure to\nedge networks--from regional CDN servers to peer CDN servers (e.g.,\nsmartrouters in users' homes)--to cache content and serve users with storage\nand network resources nearby. Among the edge network content caching paradigms,\nWi-Fi access point caching and cellular base station caching have become two\nmainstream solutions. Thus, understanding the effectiveness and performance of\nthese solutions for large-scale mobile video delivery is important.

Cloud delivers computing as a utility as it is available to the cloud\nconsumers on demand. It is a simple pay-per-use consumer-provider service\nmodel. It contains large number of shared resources. So Resource Management is\nalways a major issue in cloud computing like any other computing paradigm. Due\nto the availability of finite resources it is very challenging for cloud\nproviders to provide all the requested resources. From the cloud providers\nperspective cloud resources must be allocated in a fair and efficient manner.\nResearch Survey is not available from the perspective of resource management as\na process in cloud computing. So this research paper provides a detailed\nsequential view / steps on resource management in cloud computing. Firstly this\nresearch paper classifies various resources in cloud computing. It also gives\ntaxonomy on resource management in cloud computing through which one can do\nfurther research. Lastly comparisons on various resource management algorithms\nhas been presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 11:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

The modified finite element\nmethod is utilized to model transient heat and fluid flow within an EGS\nreservoir. Three main features are modified to determine their impact on the\nreservoir: the fracture model, the porous model, and the coupling physical\nmodel. For the first feature, the fractures are modeled as a two-dimensional\nsubdomain embedded in a vast three-dimensional rock mass. The fracture model\neliminates the need to create slender fractures with a high aspect ratio by\nallowing reduction of the spatial discretization of the fractures from three-\nto two-dimensional finite elements. In this model, pseudo three-dimensional\nequations are adopted to drive the physics of heat and fluid flow in the\nfractures. In the second feature, a porous subdomain with effective transport\nproperties is modeled to integrate a thermally-shocked region in the reservoir\nsimulation. In the third feature, three-dimensional heat flow in the rock mass\nis coupled to the two-dimensional heat and fluid flow in the fractures.\nNumerical examples are computed to illustrate the computational capability of\nthe proposed model to simulate heat and fluid flow in an EGS. Results show that\nthe proposed model is capable of both effectively integrating thermal fractures\ninto reservoir simulation, as well as efficiently tackling the computational\nburden exerted by high aspect ratio geometries. A parametric analysis is also\nperformed in which the effect of thermal fractures and thermally-shocked region\non reservoir performance is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 18:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

We\ndescribe and discuss the elementary acts of this relaxation. When the grains\npacking density is large, the relaxation is controlled by narrow gaps\nseparating neighboring grains. The electric fields in some gaps are enhanced,\nrelative to the external field, by the factor R/l, R being the grain radius and\nl the width of the gap. These enhanced fields trigger dielectric breakdown in\nthe gaps. Both breakdown events and grain motions increase the permittivity of\nthe composite; advancement of the breakdown process leads to global failure of\ninsulation. The non-linear and hysteretic charge-discharge behavior of the\nsystem is determined by the main parameters characterizing the breakdown, the\ndelay time relative to electric field increase, and the lifetime of breakdown\nconductivity after the supporting current has vanished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 21:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

We begin by developing our approach on code\ncompiled by the GNU C Compiler (GCC) for the ARM Cortex-M3 (CM3) processor; and\nwe show how our method outperforms the industry standard -O3 optimization level\nacross a diverse embedded benchmark suite. First we quantify the potential\ngains by using existing iterative compilation approaches that time-intensively\nsearch for optimal configurations for each benchmark. Then we adapt iterative\ncompilation to output a single configuration that optimizes performance across\nthe entire benchmark suite. Although this is a time-consuming process, our\napproach constructs an optimized variation of -O3, which we call -Ocm3, that\nrealizes nearly two thirds of known available gains on the CM3 and\nsignificantly outperforms a more complex state-of-the-art predictive method in\ncross-validation experiments. Finally, we demonstrate our method on additional\nplatforms by constructing two more optimization levels that find even more\nsignificant speed-ups on the ARM Cortex-A8 and 8-bit AVR processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 17:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}
