It has also been shown that there are persistent individual\ndifferences in this pattern; some individuals allocate their efforts more\nuniformly across their networks, while others strongly focus on their closest\nrelationships. Furthermore, some individuals maintain more stable networks than\nothers. Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this\npicture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile\nTerritorial Lab (MTL) study. In particular, we look at the relationship between\npersonality traits and the (i) persistence of social signatures, namely the\nsimilarity of the social signature shape of an individual measured in different\ntime intervals; (ii) the turnover in egocentric networks, that is, differences\nin the set of alters present at two consecutive temporal intervals; and (iii)\nthe rank dynamics defined as the variation of alter rankings in egocentric\nnetworks in consecutive intervals. We observe that some traits have effects on\nthe stability of the social signatures as well as network turnover and rank\ndynamics.

Ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) are stellar systems displaying colours\nand metallicities between those of globular clusters (GCs) and early-type dwarf\ngalaxies, as well as sizes of Reff <= 100 pc and luminosities in the range\n-13.5 < MV < -11 mag. Although their origin is still subject of debate, the\nmost popular scenarios suggest that they are massive star clusters or the\nnuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies. Aims. NGC 5044 is the central\nmassive elliptical galaxy of the NGC 5044 group. Its GC/UCD system is\ncompletely unexplored. Methods. In Gemini+GMOS deep images of several fields\naround NGC 5044 and in spectroscopic multi-object data of one of these fields,\nwe detected an unresolved source with g'~20.6 mag, compatible with being an\nUCD. Its radial velocity was obtained with FXCOR and the penalized\npixel-fitting (pPXF) code. To study its stellar population content, we measured\nthe Lick/IDS indices and compared them with predictions of single stellar\npopulation models, and we used the full spectral fitting technique. Results.\nThe spectroscopic analysis of the UCD revealed a radial velocity that agrees\nwith the velocity of the elliptical galaxy NGC 5044.

It is a sum of monomial symmetric\nfunctions such that for each vertex coloring of $G$ there is exactly one of\nthese summands. The question, whether $X_{G}(x_1,x_{2},\\ldots)$ distinguishes\nnonisomorphic trees with the same number of vertices, is still open in general.\nFor special trees it has already been shown. In 2008, Martin, Morin and Wagner\nproved it for spiders and some caterpillars.

Backdooring encryption algorithms is considered as the best\nway to enforce cryptographic control. Until now, only implementation backdoors\n(at the protocol/implementation/management level) are generally considered. In\nthis paper we propose to address the most critical issue of backdoors:\nmathematical backdoors or by-design backdoors, which are put directly at the\nmathematical design of the encryption algorithm. While the algorithm may be\ntotally public, proving that there is a backdoor, identifying it and exploiting\nit, may be an intractable problem. We intend to explain that it is probably\npossible to design and put such backdoors. Considering a particular family\n(among all the possible ones), we present BEA-1, a block cipher algorithm which\nis similar to the AES and which contains a mathematical backdoor enabling an\noperational and effective cryptanalysis. The BEA-1 algorithm (80-bit block\nsize, 120-bit key, 11 rounds) is designed to resist to linear and differential\ncryptanalyses. A challenge will be proposed to the cryptography community soon.\nIts aim is to assess whether our backdoor is easily detectable and exploitable\nor not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Remarkably, we find a robust presence and connection with pairs of\ntopologically induced Dirac points in a primitive-rectangular lattice using a\n$p$-type tight-binding approximation. We provide a transparent analysis of\ntwo-dimensional primitive-rectangular and square Bravais lattices whose basic\nimplications generalize to more complex structures. Band warping typically\narises at the onset of a singular transition to a crystal lattice with a larger\nsymmetry group, suddenly allowing the possibility of irreducible\nrepresentations of higher dimensions at special symmetry points in reciprocal\nspace. Band non-parabolicities are altogether different higher-order features,\nalthough they may merge into band warping at the onset of a larger symmetry\ngroup. Quite separately, although still maintaining a clear connection with\nthat merging, band non-parabolicities may produce pairs of conical\nintersections at relatively low-symmetry points. Apparently, such conical\nintersections are robustly maintained by global topology requirements, rather\nthan any local symmetry protection. For two $p$-type tight-binding bands, we\nfind such pairs of conical intersections drifting along the edges of restricted\nBrillouin zones of primitive-rectangular Bravais lattices as lattice constants\nvary relatively, until they merge into degenerate warped bands at high-symmetry\npoints at the onset of a square lattice. The conical intersections that we\nfound appear to have similar topological characteristics as Dirac points\nextensively studied in graphene and other topological insulators, although our\nconical intersections have none of the symmetry complexity and protection\nafforded by the latter more complex structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The\namorphous-Al2O3/MoS2 (a-Al2O3/MoS2) interface has attracted people's attention\nbecause of its unique properties. In this paper, the interface behaviors of\na-Al2O3/MoS2 under non-strain and biaxial strain are investigated by first\nprinciples calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). First of all,\nthe generation process of a-Al2O3 sample is described, which is calculated by\nmolecular dynamics and geometric optimization. Then, we introduce the band\nalignment method, and calculate band offset of a-Al2O3/MoS2 interface. It is\nfound that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO)\nchange with the number of MoS2 layers. The dependence of leakage current on the\nband offset is also illustrated. At last, the band structure of monolayer MoS2\nunder biaxial strain is discussed. The biaxial strain is set in the range from\n-6% to 6% with the interval of 2%. Impact of the biaxial strain on the band\nalignment is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

In this model, the stellar wind plasma is forced to move along the\nclosed field loops of the magnetic field, colliding at the magnetic equator,\nand creating a shock. As the shocked material cools radiatively it will emit\nX-rays. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy is a key tool in detecting and\ncharacterizing the hot wind material confined by the magnetic fields of these\nstars. Some B-type stars are found to have very short rotational periods. The\neffects of the rapid rotation on the X-ray production within the magnetosphere\nhave yet to be explored in detail. The added centrifugal force due to rapid\nrotation is predicted to cause faster wind outflows along the field lines,\nleading to higher shock temperatures and harder X-rays. However, this is not\nobserved in all rapidly rotating magnetic B-type stars. In order to address\nthis from a theoretical point of view, we use the X-ray Analytical Dynamical\nMagnetosphere (XADM) model, originally developed for slow rotators, with an\nimplementation of new rapid rotational physics. Using X-ray spectroscopy from\nESA's XMM-Newton space telescope, we observed 5 rapidly rotating B-type stars\nto add to the previous list of observations. Comparing the observed X-ray\nluminosity and hardness ratio to that predicted by the XADM allows us to\ndetermine the role the added centrifugal force plays in the magnetospheric\nX-ray emission of these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

The goal is to solve the DC optimal\npower flow (DC-OPF) problem: have the generators collectively meet the power\ndemand while minimizing the aggregate generation cost and respecting line flow\nlimits in the network. The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as\ngenerators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each\ngenerator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of\nelectricity at which it is willing to provide power. Based on the bids, the ISO\ndecides how much production to allocate to each generator to minimize the total\npayment while meeting the load and satisfying the line limits. We provide a\nprovably correct, decentralized iterative scheme, termed BID ADJUSTMENT\nALGORITHM, for the resulting Bertrand competition game. Regarding convergence,\nwe show that the algorithm takes the generators' bids to any desired\nneighborhood of the efficient Nash equilibrium at a linear convergence rate. As\na consequence, the optimal production of the generators converges to the\noptimizer of the DC-OPF problem. Regarding robustness, we show that the\nalgorithm is robust to affine perturbations in the bid adjustment scheme and\nthat there is no incentive for any individual generator to deviate from the\nalgorithm by using an alternative bid update scheme.

In this view, the development of tumor cells is in close\ninteraction with their increasingly changing environment: the more cells can\nchange, the more their environment will change.

For example, information divergence\nfunctions measure the dissimilarity between two probability density functions\nand are useful in a number of applications. Typically, estimating these\nquantities requires complete knowledge of the underlying distribution followed\nby multi-dimensional integration. Existing methods make parametric assumptions\nabout the data distribution or use non-parametric density estimation followed\nby high-dimensional integration. In this paper, we propose a new alternative.\nWe introduce the concept of \"data-driven basis functions\" - functions of\ndistributions whose value we can estimate given only samples from the\nunderlying distributions without requiring distribution fitting or direct\nintegration. We derive a new data-driven complete basis that is similar to the\ndeterministic Bernstein polynomial basis and develop two methods for performing\nbasis expansions of functionals of two distributions. We also show that the new\nbasis set allows us to approximate functions of distributions as closely as\ndesired. Finally, we evaluate the methodology by developing data driven\nestimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergences and the Hellinger distance and\nby constructing empirical estimates of tight bounds on the Bayes error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 18:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 21:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

These effects have become widespread in the online\ndomain, where the data offers the potential to study competition among\nconventions at a fine-grained level.\n  In analyzing the dynamics of conventions over time, however, even with\ndetailed on-line data, one encounters two significant challenges. First, as\nconventions evolve, the underlying substance of their meaning tends to change\nas well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of social\neffects. Second, the selection of a convention takes place through the complex\ninteractions of individuals within a community, and contention between the\nusers of competing conventions plays a key role in the convention's evolution.\nAny analysis must take place in the presence of these two issues.\n  In this work we study a setting in which we can cleanly track the competition\namong conventions. Our analysis is based on the spread of low-level authoring\nconventions in the eprint arXiv over 24 years: by tracking the spread of macros\nand other author-defined conventions, we are able to study conventions that\nvary even as the underlying meaning remains constant. We find that the\ninteraction among co-authors over time plays a crucial role in the selection of\nthem; the distinction between more and less experienced members of the\ncommunity, and the distinction between conventions with visible versus\ninvisible effects, are both central to the underlying processes.

In Part II, we explore a simple\nmodel of neural networks with the goal of discovering how network structure\nshapes the behavior of the network.\n  To fully understand how visual information is processed requires an\nunderstanding of the way signals are transformed at the ribbon synapse of\nphotoreceptor neurons. These synapses possess a ribbon-like structure capable\nof storing around 100 synaptic vesicles, allowing graded responses through the\nrelease of different numbers of vesicles in response to visual input. These\nresponses depend critically on the ability of the ribbon to replenish itself as\nribbon sites empty upon release.

We confirm the mean expansion rate (2011 to\n2015) of 0.58% per year, but large spatial variations are present. Using the\nnonparametric \"Demons\" method, we measure the velocity field throughout the\nentire SNR, finding that motions vary by a factor of 5, from 0.09\" to 0.44\" per\nyear. The slowest shocks are at the outer boundary of the bright northern radio\nrim, with velocities $v_s$ as low as 3,600 km/s (for an assumed distance of 8.5\nkpc), much less than $v_s = 12,000 - 13,000$ km/s along the X-ray-bright major\naxis. Such strong deceleration of the northern blast wave most likely arises\nfrom the collision of SN ejecta with a much denser than average ambient medium\nthere. This asymmetric ambient medium naturally explains the radio asymmetry.\nIn several locations, significant morphological changes and strongly nonradial\nmotions are apparent. The spatially-integrated X-ray flux continues to increase\nwith time. Based on Chandra observations spanning 8.3 years, we measure its\nincrease at 1.3% +/- 0.8% per year.

Despite several decades of research on this ubiquitous and\nfundamental phenomenon there is yet no agreed-upon answer to this question.\nRecently, it was realized that all stochastic and deterministic differential\nequations, describing all natural and engineered dynamical systems, possess a\ntopological supersymmetry. It was then suggested that its spontaneous breakdown\ncould be interpreted as the stochastic generalization of deterministic chaos.\nThis conclusion stems from the fact that such phenomenon encompasses features\nthat are traditionally associated with chaotic dynamics such as\nnon-integrability, positive topological entropy, sensitivity to initial\nconditions, and the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. Here, we strengthen and\ncomplete this picture by showing that the hallmarks of set-theoretic chaos --\ntopological transitivity/mixing and dense periodic orbits -- can also be\nattributed to the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry. We also\ndemonstrate that these features, which highlight the noisy character of chaotic\ndynamics, do not actually admit a stochastic generalization. We therefore\nconclude that spontaneous topological symmetry breaking can be considered as\nthe most general definition of continuous-time dynamical chaos. Contrary to the\ncommon perception and semantics of the word \"chaos\", this phenomenon should\nthen be truly interpreted as the low-symmetry, or ordered phase of the\ndynamical systems that manifest it.

Our treatment is intuitive to use and provides fresh\nanalytical insight into the physics of the Raman scattering near metallic\nsurfaces and can be applied to a wide range of geometries including resonators,\nwaveguides, as well as hybrid photonic-plasmonic systems. Our general theory\ndemonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay\nbetween nonlinear light generation and propagation. Counter intuitively, at the\nnonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the\nmolecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the local\ndensity of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency.\nHowever, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the\nStokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes\n(anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly\nknown E^4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic\nsurfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E^8 rule at high pump\npowers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS. Our theory uses a generalized\nquantum master equation where the plasmonic system is treated as an\nenvironmental bath that is described through the photonic Green function of the\nmedium. Therefore, any electrodynamics related physics, such as quenching and\npropagation, are self-consistently included in the model.

The CPS stays\nsafe and stable even under frequent resets because of the inertia present.\nFurther, resets simplify certain diversification mechanisms and makes them\nfeasible to implement in CPSs with limited computing resources.\n  We evaluate our idea on two real-world systems: an engine management unit of\na car and a flight controller of a quadcopter. Roughly speaking, these two\nsystems provide typical and extreme operational requirements for evaluating\nFIRED in terms of stability, algorithmic complexity, and safety requirements.\nWe show that FIRED provides robust security guarantees against hijacking\nattacks and persistent CPS threats. We find that our defense is suitable for\nemerging CPS such as commodity unmanned vehicles that are currently unregulated\nand cost sensitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

This is, however, a competing\nphenomenon to the energy band shifts due to the image charge potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

In particular, indicators of social and economic\nproductivity are expected to have a superlinear relation. This behavior was\nverified for many urban systems, but recent findings suggest that this pattern\nmay not be valid for England and Wales (E&W), where income has a linear\nrelation with city size. This finding raises the question of whether the cities\nof E&W exhibit any superlinear relation with respect to quantities such as the\nlevel of education and occupational groups. In this paper, we evaluate the\nscaling of educational and occupational groups of E&W to see if we can detect\nsuperlinear relations in the number of educated and better-paid persons. As E&W\nmay be unique in its linear scaling of income, we complement our analysis by\ncomparing it to the urban system of the United States (US), a country for which\nsuperlinear scaling of income has already been demonstrated. To make the two\nurban systems comparable, we define the urban systems of both countries using\nthe same method and test the sensitivity of our results to changes in the\nboundaries of cities. We find that cities of E&W exhibit patterns of\nsuperlinear scaling with respect to education and certain categories of\nbetter-paid occupations. However, the tendency of such groups to have\nsuperlinear scaling seems to be more consistent in the US. We show that while\nthe educational and occupational distributions of US cities can partly explain\nthe superlinear scaling of earnings, the distribution leads to a linear scaling\nof earnings in E&W.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:52:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 21:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

One of them is the\n\"Line\" component, which directly annihilates into electron--positron pair.\nAnother one is the \"Continuum\" component, which consists of secondarily\nproduced electrons and positrons via some decay modes. Before reaching Earth,\ndirections of electrons and positrons are randomized by the Galactic magnetic\nfield, and their energies are reduced by energy loss mechanisms.

The backreactions\nof initial Hubble-size inhomogeneities are determined in a fully relativistic\nframework, from a series of simulations using the BSSN formalism of numerical\nrelativity.

Such inferences are crucial to\nunderstand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or\ncontrol the outbreak. However, construction of such line lists requires\nconsiderable human supervision and therefore, difficult to generate in\nreal-time.

However, a\nbasic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are\ncascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While\nversions of this question have been considered from the perspective of the\nproducers of cascades, any answer to this question must also take into account\nthe effect of cascades on their audience. In this work, we seek to fill this\ngap by providing a consumer perspective of cascade.\n  Users on online networks play the dual role of producers and consumers.\nFirst, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with\nretweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home\ntimeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the \"Impressions Paradox\": the\nshare of impressions for cascades of size k decays much slower than frequency\nof cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even\nfor rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet\ncascades in comparison to non-retweeted content. Our results show that cascades\noften rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression.\nThis result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn't opt in to see tweets\nfrom these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular,\none would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be\ninterested in the content. Motivated by our findings, we posit a theoretical\nmodel that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience. Our results on\nthis model highlight the balance between retweeting as a high-quality content\nselection mechanism and the role of network users in filtering irrelevant\ncontent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 04:31:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 20:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 23:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Here we harness a\nquantum-optical effect, the Mollow triplet splitting of a strongly driven\ntwo-level system, to overcome this limitation. We microscopically understand\nthis effect as a pulsed dynamical decoupling protocol and find that it enables\nsensitive detection of fields close to the driven transition.

A block can be down-sampled before being compressed by normal\nintra coding, and then up-sampled to its original resolution. Different from\nprevious studies on down/up-sampling-based coding, the up-sampling methods in\nour scheme have been designed by training CNN instead of hand-crafted. We\nexplore a new CNN structure for up-sampling, which features deconvolution of\nfeature maps, multi-scale fusion, and residue learning, making the network both\ncompact and efficient. We also design different networks for the up-sampling of\nluma and chroma components, respectively, where the chroma up-sampling CNN\nutilizes the luma information to boost its performance. In addition, we design\na two-stage up-sampling process, the first stage being within the\nblock-by-block coding loop, and the second stage being performed on the entire\nframe, so as to refine block boundaries.

The equivalence suggests to describe {\\em\n(affine sphere) spacetimes} with this structure, so that no algebraic-metrical\nconcept enters the definition.

In physical terms, in affine sphere spacetimes the light cone\ndistribution and the spacetime measure determine the motion of massive and\nmassless particles (hence the dispersion relation).

It has proved to be applicable to problems which occur, for example,\nin the geosciences. In the early publications [Fischer2011] and\n[FischerMichel2012], it was shown that the iteration converges in the\nunregularized case to an exact solution. In [Michel2015] and\n[MichelTelschow2016], it was later shown (for two different scenarios) that the\niteration also converges in the regularized case, where the limit of the\niteration is the solution of the Tikhonov-regularized normal equation. However,\nthe condition of these convergence proofs cannot be satisfied and, therefore,\nhas to be weakened, as it was pointed out for the convergence theorem of the\nrelated iterated Regularized Orthogonal Functional Matching Pursuit (ROFMP)\nalgorithm in [MichelTelschow2016].

An advertising option is a contract which\ngives its buyer a right but not obligation to enter into transactions to\npurchase page views or link clicks at one or multiple pre-specified prices in a\nspecific future period. Different from typical guaranteed contracts, the option\nbuyer pays a lower upfront fee but can have greater flexibility and more\ncontrol of advertising. Many studies on advertising options so far have been\nrestricted to the situations where the option payoff is determined by the\nunderlying spot market price at a specific time point and the price evolution\nover time is assumed to be continuous. The former leads to a biased calculation\nof option payoff and the latter is invalid empirically for many online\nadvertising slots. This paper addresses these two limitations by proposing a\nnew advertising option pricing framework. First, the option payoff is\ncalculated based on an average price over a specific future period. Therefore,\nthe option becomes path-dependent. The average price is measured by the power\nmean, which contains several existing option payoff functions as its special\ncases. Second, jump-diffusion stochastic models are used to describe the\nmovement of the underlying spot market price, which incorporate several\nimportant statistical properties including jumps and spikes, non-normality, and\nabsence of autocorrelations. A general option pricing algorithm is obtained\nbased on Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, an explicit pricing formula is\nderived for the case when the option payoff is based on the geometric mean.\nThis pricing formula is also a generalized version of several other option\npricing models discussed in related studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 23:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 21:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The waveform design is based on the\nminimization of the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and weighted ISL (WISL) of\nwaveforms. As the corresponding optimization problems can quickly grow to large\nscale with increasing the code length and number of waveforms, the main issue\nturns to be the development of fast large-scale optimization techniques. The\ndifficulty is also that the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex,\nbut the required accuracy is high. Therefore, we formulate the ISL and WISL\nminimization problems as non-convex quartic optimization problems in frequency\ndomain, and then simplify them into quadratic problems by utilizing the\nmajorization-minimization technique, which is one of the basic techniques for\naddressing large-scale and/or non-convex optimization problems. While designing\nour fast algorithms, we find out and use inherent algebraic structures in the\nobjective functions to rewrite them into quartic forms, and in the case of WISL\nminimization, to derive additionally an alternative quartic form which allows\nto apply the quartic-quadratic transformation. Our algorithms are applicable to\nlarge-scale unimodular waveform design problems as they are proved to have\nlower or comparable computational burden (analyzed theoretically) and faster\nconvergence speed (confirmed by comprehensive simulations) than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.

In particular, every standard\ncombinatorial optimization problem has its shifted counterpart, which is\ntypically much harder. Already with explicitly given input set the shifted\nproblem may be NP-hard. In this article we initiate a study of the\nparameterized complexity of this framework. First we show that shifting over an\nexplicitly given set with its cardinality as the parameter may be in XP, FPT or\nP, depending on the objective function. Second, we study the shifted problem\nover sets definable in MSO logic (which includes, e.g., the well known MSO\npartitioning problems). Our main results here are that shifted combinatorial\noptimization over MSO definable sets is in XP with respect to the MSO formula\nand the treewidth (or more generally clique-width) of the input graph, and is\nW[1]-hard even under further severe restrictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

We show that these measures can be\nestimated from the observed Bell violation in several scenarios and the proofs\nrely only on standard linear algebra. The trade-offs turn out to be tight and,\nin particular, they give non-trivial statements for arbitrarily small\nviolations. On the other extreme, observing the maximal violation allows us to\ndeduce precisely the form of the observables, which immediately leads to a\ncomplete rigidity statement.

The approach generalizes and provides\na new viewpoint on the Mertens-Zamir system coming from the study of zero-sum\nrepeated games with lack of information on both sides. A counterexample shows\nthat under a slightly weaker notion of acyclicity, convergence of (v $\\lambda$)\nmay fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

To illustrate the impact\ndigital cellular solids could make as a replacement to conventional habitat\nsubsystems, we compare recent proposed deep space habitat structural systems\nwith a digital cellular solids pressure vessel design that consists of a carbon\nfiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) digital cellular solid cylindrical framework\nthat is lined with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) skin.\nWe use the analytical treatment of a linear specific modulus scaling cellular\nsolid to find the minimum mass pressure vessel for a structure and find that,\nfor equivalent habitable volume and appropriate safety factors, the use of\ndigital cellular solids provides clear methods for producing structures that\nare not only repairable and reconfigurable, but also higher performance than\ntheir conventionally-manufactured counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

The results are compared with corresponding\nquantities obtained by ab-initio calculations. We identify the difference\nbetween clamped-ion and relaxed-ion contributions with the dependence on inner\nstrains which are due to the relative displacements of the ions in the unit\ncell. Lattice dynamics allows to express the inner strains contributions in\nterms of microscopic quantities such as effective ionic charges and\noptoacoustical couplings, which allows us to clarify differences in the\npiezoelectric behavior between h- BN versus MoS2. Trends in the different\nmicroscopic quantities as functions of atomic composition are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Both kinds of irradiation produce highly excited\nelectrons in a target on extremely short timescales. Transfer of the excess\nelectronic energy into the lattice may lead to observable target modifications\nsuch as phase transitions and damage formation. Transient kinetics of material\nexcitation and relaxation under FEL or SHI irradiation are comparatively\ndiscussed. The same origin for the electronic and atomic relaxation in both\ncases is demonstrated. Differences in these kinetics introduced by the\ngeometrical effects ({\\mu}m-size of a laser spot vs nm-size of an ion track)\nand initial irradiation (photoabsorption vs an ion impact) are analyzed. The\nbasic mechanisms of electron transport and electron-lattice coupling are\naddressed. Appropriate models and their limitations are presented.\nPossibilities of thermal and nonthermal melting of materials under FEL and SHI\nirradiation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 20:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

However, limited by the\nempirical structure topologies, the previously reported hyperbolic elastic\nmetamaterials (HEMMs) suffer from the limitations of relatively narrow\nfrequency width, inflexible adjusting operating subwavelength scale and being\ndifficult to further ameliorate imaging resolution. Here, we develop an\ninverse-design approach for HEMMs by topology optimization based on the\neffective medium theory. We successfully design two-dimensional broadband HEMMs\nsupporting multipolar resonances, and theoretically demonstrate their\ndeep-subwavelength imagings for longitudinal waves. Under different prescribed\nsubwavelength scales, the optimized HEMMs exhibit broadband negative effective\nmass densities. Moreover, benefiting from the extreme enhancement of evanescent\nwaves, an optimized HEMM at the ultra-low frequency can yield a super-high\nimaging resolution (~{\\lambda}/64), representing the record in the field of\nelastic metamaterials. The proposed computational approach can be easily\nextended to design hyperbolic metamaterials for other wave counterparts. The\npresent research may provide a novel design methodology for exploring the HEMMs\nbased on unrevealed resonances and serve as a useful guide for the\nultrasonography and general biomedical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 02:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}
