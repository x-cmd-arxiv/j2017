A space-dependent rate for the creation\nof inhomogeneous particle concentration is derived in terms of local statistics\nof turbulence.

The tandem tunnelling occurs\nthrough the intermediate state in which electron and hole are in different NCs.\nThe corresponding rate for exciton hops is larger than the Dexter rate and for\nSi is even much larger that the F\\\"orster one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 18:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose\nfailure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected\ntriples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important\nbecause connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many\nreal-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable\ndata transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in\nmobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can\ngreatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which\ncan further lead to the corruption of the entire system.

Such an apparently irreversible process is known as spin\ndiffusion and it can lead the system back to \"equilibrium\". Even so, a unitary\nquantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial\ncondition. Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol\nreverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial\nnon-equilibrium state at time $t$. As a matter of fact, the reversal is always\nperturbed by small experimental imperfections and/or uncontrolled internal or\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. This limits the amount of signal $M(t)$\nrecovered locally at time $t$. The degradation of $M(t)$ accounts for these\nperturbations, which can also be seen as the sources of decoherence. This idea\ndefines the Loschmidt echo (LE), which embodies the various time-reversal\nprocedures implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance. Here, we present an\ninvitation to the study of the LE following the pathway induced by the\nexperiments. With such a purpose, we provide a historical and conceptual\noverview that briefly revisits selected phenomena that underlie the LE\ndynamics, ultimately leading to the discussion of irreversibility as an\nemergent phenomenon. In addition, we introduce the LE formalism by means of\nspin-spin correlation functions and we present new results that could trigger\nnew experiments and theoretical ideas. In particular, we propose to transform\nan initially localized excitation into a more complex initial state, enabling a\ndynamically prepared LE.

We note that the HERMES experimental measurement of $b_1$ seems to be\nmuch different from a conventional theoretical prediction. This puzzling\nsituation should be significantly improved in the near future by an approved\nexperiment to measure $b_1$ at JLab. On the other hand, the tensor-polarized\nPDFs, especially antiquark distributions, could be measured by spin asymmetries\nin the Drell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron at Fermilab. In this\nwork, we estimate tensor-polarization asymmetries for the Fermilab Drell-Yan\nexperiment by using a parametrization for the tensor-polarized PDFs to explain\nthe HERMES $b_1$ data. Obtained spin asymmetries are typically a few percent\norder and they could be measured by the Fermilab-E1039 experiment. Since the\ntensor-polarized antiquark distributions will play an important role to solve\nthe puzzle, further theoretical and experimental efforts are needed toward the\nDrell-Yan experiment at Fermilab and other hadron facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 00:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

The salt finger instability is\na form of double diffusive convection where the diffusions of two physical\nquantities---heat and salt concentrations---occur with different diffusion\nrates. The analogous instability in the intracluster medium may result owing to\nthe magnetic field mediated anisotropic diffusions of the heat and the Helium\nions (in the sea of the Hydrogen ions and the free electrons). These two\ndiffusions have inherently different diffusion rates. Hence the convection\ncaused by the onset of this instability is an example of double diffusive\nconvection in the astrophysical settings.

The present paper shows that there are in fact\nobstructions for constructing a strict model for the string 2-group using $LG$.\nWe show that a certain infinite-dimensional manifold of smooth paths admits no\nLie group structure, and that there are no nontrivial Lie crossed modules\nanalogous to the BCSS model using the universal central extension of the free\nloop group. Afterwards, we construct the next best thing, namely a coherent\nmodel for the string 2-group using the free loop group, with explicit formulas\nfor all structure. This is in particular important for the expected\nrepresentation theory of the string group that we discuss briefly in the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 07:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 11:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

As nowadays side information is growing towards high\ndimensionality, the performances of existing methods deteriorate in terms of\nboth effectiveness and efficiency, which imposes a severe technical challenge.\nIn order to take advantage of high-dimensional side information, we propose in\nthis paper an embedded feature selection method to facilitate top-$N$\nrecommendation. In particular, we propose to learn feature weights of side\ninformation, where zero-valued features are naturally filtered out. We also\nintroduce non-negativity and sparsity to the feature weights, to facilitate\nfeature selection and encourage low-rank structure. Two optimization problems\nare accordingly put forward, respectively, where the feature selection is\ntightly or loosely coupled with the learning procedure.

The rods were represented as linear $k$-mers (i.e.,\nparticles occupying $k$ adjacent sites). In the initial state, they were\ndeposited onto a two-dimensional square lattice of size $L\\times L$ up to the\njamming concentration using a random sequential adsorption algorithm. The size\nof the lattice, $L$, was varied from $128$ to $2048$, and periodic boundary\nconditions were applied along both $x$ and $y$ axes, while the length of the\n$k$-mers (determining the aspect ratio) was varied from $2$ to $12$. The\n$k$-mers oriented along the $x$ and $y$ directions ($k_x$-mers and $k_y$-mers,\nrespectively) were deposited equiprobably. In the course of the simulation, the\nnumbers of intraspecific and interspecific contacts between the same sort and\nbetween different sorts of $k$-mers, respectively, were calculated. Both the\nshift ratio of the actual number of shifts along the longitudinal or transverse\naxes of the $k$-mers and the electrical conductivity of the system were also\nexamined. For the initial random configuration, quite different\nself-organization behavior was observed for short and long $k$-mers. For long\n$k$-mers ($k\\geq 6$), three main stages of diffusion-driven spatial segregation\n(self-assembly) were identified: the initial stage, reflecting destruction of\nthe jamming state, the intermediate stage, reflecting continuous cluster\ncoarsening and labyrinth pattern formation and the final stage, reflecting the\nformation of diagonal stripe domains. Additional examination of two\nartificially constructed initial configurations showed that this pattern of\ndiagonal stripe domains is an attractor, i.e., any spatial distribution of\n$k$-mers tends to transform into diagonal stripes. Nevertheless, the time for\nrelaxation to the steady state essentially increases as the lattice size\ngrowth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 07:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The natural SUSY-type sfermion mass spectrum has been\nstudied since the supersymmetric (SUSY) flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC)\nare suppressed because of large sfermion masses of the first two generations,\nand the weak scale is stabilized because of the light stop. However, this type\nof sfermion mass spectrum is severely constrained by CEDM, because the light\nstop contributions to the up quark CEDM are not decoupled in the limit\n$m_0\\rightarrow\\infty$, while the down quark CEDM is decoupled in the limit. It\nis important that the constraints are severe even if SUSY-breaking parameters\n(and Higgsino mass) are taken to be real because complex diagonalizing matrices\nof Yukawa matrices, which are from complex Yukawa couplings, generate\nnonvanishing CP phases in off-diagonal elements of sfermion mass matrices.

Due to its low and homogeneous interstellar\nabsorption it is considered as a calibration field for Galactic bulge studies.\nIn the era of large spectroscopic surveys, calibration fields such as BW are\nnecessary to cross calibrate the stellar parameters and individual abundances\nof the APOGEE survey. We use the APOGEE BW stars to derive their metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) and individual abundances, for $\\alpha$- and\niron-peak elements of the APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (DR13), as well as the age\ndistribution for stars in BW. We determine the MDF of APOGEE stars in BW and\nfind a remarkable agreement with that of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES). Both\nexhibit a clear bimodal distribution. We also find that the Mg-metallicity\nplanes of both surveys agree well, except for the metal-rich part ([Fe/H]\n>0.1), where APOGEE finds systematically higher Mg abundances with respect to\nthe GES. The ages based on the [C/N] ratio reveal a bimodal age distribution,\nwith a major old population at 10 Gyr, with a decreasing tail towards younger\nstars. A comparison between APOGEE estimates and stellar parameters, and those\ndetermined by other sources reveals detectable systematic offsets, in\nparticular for spectroscopic surface gravity estimates. In general, we find a\ngood agreement between individual abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr,\nMn, Co, and Ni from APOGEE with that of literature values.

In the modified discrete element (MDEM) method, the effective\nforces between virtual particles are modified in all regions, without failing\nelements, so that they reproduce the discretization of a first order finite\nelement method (FEM) for linear elasticity. This provides an expression of the\nvirtual forces in terms of general Hook's macro-parameters. Previously, MDEM\nhas been formulated through an analogy with linear elements for FEM. We show\nthe connection between MDEM and the virtual element method (VEM), which is a\ngeneralization of FEM to polyhedral grids. Unlike standard FEM, which computes\nstrain-states in a reference space, MDEM and VEM compute stress-states directly\nin real space. This connection leads us to a new derivation of the MDEM method.\nMoreover, it gives the basis for coupling (M)DEM to domain with linear\nelasticity described by polyhedral grids, which makes it easier to apply\nrealistic boundary conditions in hydraulic-fracturing simulations. This\napproach also makes it possible to combine fine-scale (M)DEM behavior near the\nfracturing region with linear elasticity on complex reservoir grids in the\nfar-field region without regridding. To demonstrate the simulation of hydraulic\nfracturing, the coupled (M)DEM-VEM method is implemented using the Matlab\nReservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) and linked to an industry-standard\nreservoir simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 10:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

A small resistivity or high field\nstrength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion\nstreams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of\nthe system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in\nsimulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of\nthe accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the\ndisk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by\nthe pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both\nwind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent\nfeatures in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and\ngaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the\nmass. Regions with low mass-to-flux ratios accrete quickly, leading to the\ndevelopment of gaps, whereas regions with higher mass-to-flux ratios tend to\naccrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate and form dense rings. In\nsome cases, avalanche accretion streams are observed to produce dense rings\ndirectly through continuous feeding. We discuss the implications of ring and\ngap formation driven by winds and streams on grain growth and planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 11:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 20:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

Recently, the Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information\n(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and\nsynergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose\nto apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in\na Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy\nredundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition\nwhich is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can\nreveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that\nare indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective\nalso shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself\nincludes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships\nbetween the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative\ninformation decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This\nreveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset\nof the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in\npart why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows\nseparate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of\nthe system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between\ninputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The\nnew perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties\nencountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide\nuseful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application\nareas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 12:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

In order to gain a complete understanding of the rheological\nproperties of these novel materials, it is necessary the study in a large\ndeformations regime to alter their internal structure. In this sense, Schmoller\net al. 2010 showed that the reconstituted networks of F-actin crosslinked with\n$\\alpha$-actinin unexpectedly harden when they are subjected to a cyclical\nshear. This observation contradicts the expected Mullins effect observed in\nmost soft materials, such as rubber and living tissues, where a pronounced\nsoftening is observed when they are cyclically deformed.\n  We think that the key to understand this stunning effect is the gelation\nprocess. To define it, the most relevant constituents are the chemical\ncrosslinks -$\\alpha$-actinin-, the physical crosslinks -introduced by the\nentanglement of the semiflexible network- and the interaction between them. As\na consequence of this interaction, a pre-stressed network emerges and\nintroduces a feedback effect, where the pre-stress also regulates the adhesion\nenergy of the $\\alpha$-actinin, setting the structure in a metastable reference\nconfiguration. Therefore, the external loads and the evolvement of the trapped\nstress drive the microstructural changes during the cyclic loading protocol. In\nthis work, we propose a micromechanical model into the framework of nonlinear\ncontinuum mechanics. The mechanics of the F-actin filaments is modeled using\nthe wormlike chain model for semiflexible filaments and the gelation process is\nmodeled as mesoscale dynamics for the $\\alpha$-actinin and physical\ncrosslink.The model has been validated with reported experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 12:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

The cognitive architecture ACT-R\nis popular to develop such models. Although ACT-R has a well-defined\npsychological theory and has been used to explain many cognitive processes,\nthere are two problems that make it hard to reason formally about its cognitive\nmodels: First, ACT-R lacks a formalization of its underlying production rule\nsystem and secondly, there are many different implementations and extensions of\nACT-R with technical artifacts complicating formal reasoning even more.\n  This paper describes a formal operational semantics - the very abstract\nsemantics - that abstracts from as many technical details as possible keeping\nit open to extensions and different implementations of the ACT-R theory. In a\nsecond step, this semantics is refined to define some of its abstract features\nthat are found in many implementations of ACT-R - the abstract semantics. It\nconcentrates on the procedural core of ACT-R and is suitable for analysis of\nthe transition system since it still abstracts from details like timing, the\nsub-symbolic layer or conflict resolution.\n  Furthermore, a translation of ACT-R models to the programming language\nConstraint Handling Rules (CHR) is defined. This makes the abstract semantics\nan executable specification of ACT-R. CHR has been used successfully to embed\nother rule-based formalisms like graph transformation systems or functional\nprogramming. There are many results and tools that support formal reasoning\nabout and analysis of CHR programs. The translation of ACT-R models to CHR is\nproven sound and complete w.r.t. the abstract operational semantics of ACT-R.\nThis paves the way to analysis of ACT-R models through CHR. Therefore, to the\nbest of our knowledge, our abstract semantics is the first formulation of ACT-R\nsuitable for both analysis and execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 13:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

In studies of the\nquantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects, a quantum state, usually an excited state\nof the system, is prepared repeatedly by projecting the quantum state onto the\ninitial state again and again. In this paper, we repeatedly prepare the initial\nquantum state in a different manner. Instead of only performing projective\nmeasurements, we allow unitary operations to be performed, on a very short\ntime-scale, after each measurement. We can then repeatedly prepare the initial\nquantum state by performing some projective measurement and thereafter, after\neach measurement, performing a suitable unitary operation to repeatedly end up\nwith the initial state. Our objective thereafter is to find the projective\nmeasurements that need to repeatedly performed such that we obtain the minimum\npossible effective decay rate of the quantum state. Consequently, the quantum\nstate is maximally protected from its environment. We find that these optimized\nprojective measurements keep on changing depending on the measurement time\ninterval. We explicitly find the projective measurements that need to be\nperformed, as well as the optimized effective decay rate, for a variety of\nsystem-environment models such as the population decay model, the pure\ndephasing model, the spin-boson model, and the large spin-boson model.

However, probabilistic learning often leads to computationally\nchallenging problems. Some problems of this type that were previously\nintractable can now be solved on standard personal computers thanks to recent\nadvances in Monte Carlo methods. In particular, for learning of unknown\nparameters in nonlinear state-space models, methods based on the particle\nfilter (a Monte Carlo method) have proven very useful. A notoriously\nchallenging problem, however, still occurs when the observations in the\nstate-space model are highly informative, i.e. when there is very little or no\nmeasurement noise present, relative to the amount of process noise. The\nparticle filter will then struggle in estimating one of the basic components\nfor probabilistic learning, namely the likelihood $p($data$|$parameters$)$. To\nthis end we suggest an algorithm which initially assumes that there is\nsubstantial amount of artificial measurement noise present. The variance of\nthis noise is sequentially decreased in an adaptive fashion such that we, in\nthe end, recover the original problem or possibly a very close approximation of\nit. The main component in our algorithm is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nsampler, which gives our proposed method a clear resemblance to the SMC^2\nmethod. Another natural link is also made to the ideas underlying the\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We illustrate it with numerical\nexamples, and in particular show promising results for a challenging\nWiener-Hammerstein benchmark problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 14:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Most research to date have focused either on the physical\naspects of energy conversion process or on optimal consumption policy of the\nharvested energy at the system level. However, although intuitively understood,\nto the best of our knowledge, the idea of self-sustainability is yet to be made\nprecise and studied as a performance metric. In this paper, we provide a\nmathematical definition of the concept of self-sustainability of an energy\nharvesting system, based on the complementary idea of eventual outage. In\nparticular, we analyze the harvest-store-consume system with infinite battery\ncapacity, stochastic energy arrivals, and fixed energy consumption rate. Using\nthe random walk theory, we identify the necessary condition for the system to\nbe self-sustainable. General formulas are given for the self-sustainability\nprobability in the form of integral equations. Since these integral equations\nare difficult to solve analytically, an exponential upper bound for eventual\noutage probability is given using martingales. This bound guarantees that the\neventual outage probability can be made arbitrarily small simply by increasing\nthe initial battery energy. We also give an asymptotic formula for eventual\noutage. For the special case when the energy arrival follows a Poisson process,\nwe are able to find the exact formulas for the eventual outage probability. We\nalso show that the harvest-store-consume system is mathematically equivalent to\na $GI/G/1$ queueing system, which allows us to easily find the outage\nprobability, in case the necessary condition for self-sustainability is\nviolated. Monte-Carlo simulations verify our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 15:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 03:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 19:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The core of our method is a 2D-3D ICP pipeline\nwhich estimates the pose of the sensor by registering the projection of a 3D\nsemi-dense map of the reference frame with the 2D semi-dense region extracted\nin the current frame. The processing is speeded up by efficiently implemented\napproximate nearest neighbour fields under the Euclidean distance criterion,\nwhich permits the use of compact Gauss-Newton updates in the optimization. The\nregistration is formulated as a maximum a posterior problem to deal with\noutliers and sensor noises, and consequently the equivalent weighted least\nsquares problem is solved by iteratively reweighted least squares method. A\nvariety of robust weight functions are tested and the optimum is determined\nbased on the characteristics of the sensor model. Extensive evaluation on\npublicly available RGB-D datasets shows that the proposed method predominantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 00:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

In contrast to the many\nresults known for these equations on the real line, with decaying Cauchy data,\none cannot make use of dispersive properties of the linear flow. Instead, our\nmethod is based on a normal forms procedure, in order to eliminate those\ncontributions to the Sobolev energy that are of lower degree of homogeneity in\nthe solution. Since the water waves equations are a quasi-linear system, usual\nnormal forms approaches would face the well known problem of losses of\nderivatives in the unbounded transformations. In this monograph, to overcome\nsuch a difficulty, after a paralinearization of the capillarity-gravity water\nwaves equations, necessary to obtain energy estimates, and thus local existence\nof the solutions, we first perform several paradifferential reductions of the\nequations to obtain a diagonal system with constant coefficients symbols, up to\nsmoothing remainders. Then we may start with a normal form procedure where the\nsmall divisors are compensated by the previous paradifferential\nregularization.The reversible structure of the water waves equations, and the\nfact that we look for solutions even in $x$, guarantees a key cancellation\nwhich prevents the growth of the Sobolev norms of the solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 15:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 12:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

It is assumed that the temperatures\nare sufficiently high so that the thermal wavelength (a few microns at room\ntemperature) is short compared to all geometric length scales of the surface\npatterns. Hence the radiosity method can be employed. A recursive multiple\nscattering method is developed that enables rapid convergence to equilibrium\ntemperatures.

In most common situations, such a CHP is\nheat driven operated, meaning that the CHP will switch on whenever heat is\nneeded, while not taking into account the demand of electricity at that time.\nIn this paper however, an active control strategy is developed, aiming to\nmaximize the profit of the CHP, selling its electricity to the spot market. The\nCHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices.\nNevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat\nand the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the\nnetwork to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the\nnetwork. In this study, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a\ncentral buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over\nthe different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass if the\nbuildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control\nalgorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network\nis described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept\nduring a representative winter week. The results show that the presented\ncontrol algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the\nconnected buildings. As a results, active control of the CHP can drastically\nincrease the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives\nthe best results, however the profit for the thermal mass concept is only\nmarginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs\nare needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass\nof buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very\npromising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 10:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}
