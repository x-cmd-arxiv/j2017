However, considering that all giant planets should have been\ncaptured in mean motion resonances among themselves during the gas-disk phase,\nit is not clear whether such a very specific evolution for Neptune is possible,\nnor whether the instability could have happened at late times. Here, we first\ninvestigate which initial resonant configuration of the giant planets can be\ncompatible with Neptune being extracted from the resonant chain and migrating\nto $\\sim$28 au before that the planetary instability happened. We address the\nlate instability issue by investigating the conditions where the planets can\nstay in resonance for about 400 My. Our results indicate that this can happen\nonly in the case where the planetesimal disk is beyond a specific minimum\ndistance $\\delta_{stab}$ from Neptune. Then, if there is a sufficient amount of\ndust produced in the planetesimal disk, that drifts inwards, Neptune can enter\nin a slow dust-driven migration phase for hundreds of Mys until it reaches a\ncritical distance $\\delta_{mig}$ from the disk. From that point, faster\nplanetesimal-driven migration takes over and Neptune continues migrating\noutward until the instability happens.

Streaming instability is a promising mechanism to directly\nform planetesimals from pebble-sized particles, provided a high enough\nsolids-to-gas ratio. However, local enhancements of the solids-to-gas ratio are\ndifficult to realize in a smooth disk, which motivates the consideration of\nspecial disk locations such as the snowline. In this article we investigate the\nviability of planetesimal formation by streaming instability near the snowline\ndue to water diffusion and condensation. We adopt a viscous disk model, and\nnumerically solve the transport equations for vapor and solids on a\ncylindrical, 1D grid. We take into account radial drift of solids, gas\naccretion on to the central star, and turbulent diffusion. We study the\nimportance of the back-reaction of solids on the gas and of the radial\nvariation of the mean molecular weight of the gas. We find that water diffusion\nand condensation can locally enhance the ice surface density by a factor 3--5\noutside the snowline. Assuming that icy pebbles contain many micron-sized\nsilicate grains that are released during evaporation, the enhancement is\nincreased by another factor $\\sim$$2$. In this `many-seeds' model, the\nsolids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as\nmuch as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the\ndiffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the\nturbulence parameter $\\alpha$ ($10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$). Therefore, assuming young\ndisks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the\nsnowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks,\ntens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which\ncan be identified with recent ALMA observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Here, we investigate the strikingly\nlow radial-velocity dispersion measured for a sample of 11 massive pre- and\nnear-main-sequence stars (sigma_rv = 5.6 +/- 0.2 km/s) in the young massive\nstar forming region M17 to obtain first constraints on the multiplicity\nproperties of young massive stellar objects. Methods: We compute the RV\ndispersion of synthetic populations of massive stars for various multiplicity\nproperties and we compare the simulated sigma_rv distributions to the observed\nvalue. We specifically investigate two scenarios: a low binary fraction and a\ndearth of short-period binary systems. Results: Simulated populations with low\nbinary fractions (f_bin = 0.12_{-0.09}^{+0.16}) or with truncated period\ndistributions (P_cutoff > 9 months) are able to reproduce the low sigma_rv\nobserved within their 68%-confidence intervals. Parent populations with f_bin >\n0.42 or P_cutoff < 47 d can however be rejected at the 5%-significance level.\nBoth constraints are contrast with the high binary fraction and plethora of\nshort-period systems found in few Myr-old, OB-type populations. To explain the\ndifference, the first scenario requires a variation of the outcome of the\nmassive star formation process. In the the second scenario, compact binaries\nmust form later on, and the cut-off period may be related to physical\nlength-scales representative of the bloated pre-main-sequence stellar radii or\nof their accretion disks. Conclusions: If the obtained constraints are\nrepresentative of the overall properties of massive young stellar objects, our\nresults may provide support to a formation process in which binaries are\ninitially formed at larger separations, then harden or migrate to produce the\ntypical (untruncated) power-law period distribution observed in few Myr-old OB\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

In addition, recent practice in word\nembeddings points towards importance of learning specialized representations.\nWe argue that focus of word representation evaluation should reflect those\ntrends and shift towards evaluating what useful information is easily\naccessible. Specifically, we propose that evaluation should focus on data\nefficiency and simple supervised tasks, where the amount of available data is\nvaried and scores of a supervised model are reported for each subset (as\ncommonly done in transfer learning).\n  In order to illustrate significance of such analysis, a comprehensive\nevaluation of selected word embeddings is presented.

In two stars, previously identified as RRab, V3\nand V34, we detect additional periodicity identified as radial first overtone\nmode. Lower than usual period ratios (0.730 and 0.728), dominant pulsation in\nthe radial fundamental mode and presence of a long-period modulation indicate,\nthat these two variables are not classical RRd stars, but are new members of\nthe recently identified class of anomalous RRd variables.

Hence, they\nare still poorly understood one hundred years after their discovery as\nrelatively few have been observed. They are crucial to the understanding of\nseveral fundamental properties of the Galaxy {\\mdash} the geometry, kinematics\nand star formation history, as well as to the study of the end-stage of stellar\nevolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars. White dwarfs were traditionally\nidentified by their ultraviolet (UV) excess, however, if they have cooled for a\nlong time, they become so faint in that part of the spectrum that they cannot\nbe seen by the most sensitive modern detectors. Proper motion was then used as\na means to identify white dwarf candidates, due to their relatively large space\nmotions compared to other objects with the same colour. The use of proper\nmotion as a selection criterion has proven effective and has yielded large\nsamples of candidates with the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey and Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey.

Furthermore, the\nresonator includes a nano-scale spiral inductor to spatially focus the magnetic\nfield from the photons at the location of the implanted donor. The design\npromises approximately two orders of magnitude increase in the local magnetic\nfield, and thus the spin to photon coupling rate $g$, compared to the estimated\ncoupling rate to the magnetic field of coplanar transmission-line resonators.\nWe show that by using niobium (aluminum) as the resonator's superconductor and\na single phosphorous (bismuth) atom as the donor, a coupling rate of\n$g/2\\pi$=0.24 MHz (0.39 MHz) can be achieved in the single photon regime.

By\nmodelling these spot signatures, it is possible to determine the physical\nproperties of the spots such as size, temperature, and location. In turn, the\nmonitoring of the spots longitude provides estimates of the stellar rotation\nand differential rotation. This technique was applied to the star Kepler-17, a\nsolar--type star orbited by a hot Jupiter. The model yields the following spot\ncharacteristics: average radius of $49 \\pm 10$ Mm, temperatures of $5100 \\pm\n300$ K, and surface area coverage of $6 \\pm 4$ \\%. The rotation period at the\ntransit latitude, $-5^\\circ$, occulted by the planet was found to be $11.92 \\pm\n0.05$ d, slightly smaller than the out--of--transit average period of $12.4 \\pm\n0.1$ d.

We show that the latter limit\ncan be well constrained by combining information from the observed far\ninfrared, 24 {\\mu}m, 33 GHz and H{\\alpha} luminosities. Another interesting\nproperty derived from the fits is that, while in a normal galaxy the\nattenuation in the lines is significantly higher than that in the nearby\ncontinuum, in individual star bursting regions they are similar, supporting the\nnotion that this effect is due to an age selective extinction. Since in these\nconditions the Balmer decrement method may not be accurate, we provide\nrelations to estimate the attenuation from the observed 24 {\\mu}m or 33 GHz\nfluxes. These relations can be useful for the analysis of young high redshift\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 00:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

We\nuse recent results showing that a magnetic field at the surface of a massive\nstar can significantly reduce its effective mass-loss rate to compute magnetic\nmodels of very massive stars (VMSs) at solar metallicity and explore the\npossibility that such stars end as PISNe. We implement the quenching of the\nmass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar\nevolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of\n$200\\,M_\\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably\nreduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life.

Its\nderivation is based on detailed balance relations between local absorption and\nemission rates in optically isotropic media with non-degenerate\nquasi-equilibrium carrier distributions. In many cases, the dependence of\ndensity and spatial variation of electronic and optical device states on the\npoint of operation is modest and the reciprocity relation holds. In\nnanostructure-based photovoltaic devices exploiting confined modes, however,\nthe underlying assumptions are no longer justifiable. In the case of ultrathin\nabsorber solar cells, the modification of the electronic structure with applied\nbias is significant due to the large variation of the built-in field.\nStraightforward use of the external quantum efficiency as measured at short\ncircuit conditions in the photovoltaic reciprocity theory thus fails to\nreproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias voltage. This\nfailure is demonstrated here by numerical simulation of both spectral\nquantities at normal incidence and emission for an ultrathin GaAs p-i-n solar\ncell using an advanced quantum kinetic formalism based on non-equilibrium\nGreen's functions of coupled photons and charge carriers. While coinciding with\nthe semiclassical relations under the conditions of their validity, the theory\nprovides a consistent microscopic relationship between absorption, emission and\ncharge carrier transport in photovoltaic devices at arbitrary operating\nconditions and for any shape of optical and electronic density of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 09:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 17:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

Using COLA for these comparisons is validated using a suite of full\nN-body simulations for the same theories. The two theoretical templates\ncorrespond to the standard general relativistic perturbation equations and\nthose same equations modelled within nDGP. Gravitational clustering non-linear\neffects are accounted for by modelling the power spectrum up to one loop order\nand redshift space clustering anisotropy is modelled using the Taruya,\nNishimichi and Saito (TNS) RSD model. Using this approach, we attempt to\nrecover the simulation's fiducial logarithmic growth parameter $f$. By\nassigning the simulation data with errors representing an idealised survey with\na volume of $10\\mbox{Gpc}^3/h^3$, we find the GR template is unable to recover\nfiducial $f$ to within 1$\\sigma$ at $z=1$ when we match the data up to $k_{\\rm\nmax}=0.195h$/Mpc.

Moreover, the sum-rate tends to zero as\nwell. This makes scheduling necessary in order to maintain the superior\nabilities CF provides. Indeed, under scheduling, we show that non-trivial\nlinear combinations are chosen, and the sum-rate does not decay, even without\nstate information at the transmitters and without interference alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 10:39:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 06:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Predictive modeling thus requires multiphysics frameworks capable\nof modeling and simulating both the phase and defect microstructures.

The simulated $\\gamma/\\gamma'$ phase\nmicrostructure with four $\\gamma'$ variants and co-evolving dislocation\nmicrostructure is found to be in good agreement with experimental observations.\nThe creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the\nmicrostructure evolution equations without the need for additional parameter\nfitting.

Together with comparisons between\nsimulated and experimental creep curves this investigation reveals the\nmechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and\ndemonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on\ncharacteristics of the dislocation microstructure.

Using detailed X-ray scattering and\nspectroscopy, we find that Rh-doped Ca$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ does\nnot undergo a first-order phase transition and that local Fe moments persist\ndespite the formation of interlayer As-As bonds. Our density functional theory\ncalculations reveal that the Fe-As bond geometry is critical for stabilizing\nmagnetism and that the pressure-induced drop in the $c$ lattice parameter\nobserved in pure CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is mostly due to a constriction within the\nFeAs planes. These phenomena are best understood using an often overlooked\nexplanation for the equilibrium Fe-As bond geometry, which is set by a\ncompetition between covalent bonding and exchange splitting between strongly\nhybridized Fe $3d$ and As $4p$ states. In this framework, the collapsed\ntetragonal phase emerges when covalent bonding completely wins out over\nexchange splitting. Thus the collapsed tetragonal phase is properly understood\nas a strong, covalent phase that is fully nonmagnetic with the As-As bond\nforming as a byproduct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 12:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

We introduce SEA, an abstract interpreter for automatic sound string\nexecutability analysis of dynamic languages employing bounded (i.e, finitely\nnested) reflection and dynamic code generation. Strings are statically\napproximated in an abstract domain of finite state automata with basic\noperations implemented as symbolic transducers.

The analysis of a call to\nreflection determines a call to the same abstract interpreter over a code which\nis synthesised directly from the result of the static string executability\nanalysis at that program point. The use of regular languages for approximating\ndynamically generated code structures allows SEA to soundly approximate safety\nproperties of self modifying programs yet maintaining efficiency.

The\ncurrent explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into\nactive regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.\nWhen these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they\ncontribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.\nThe behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains\nlargely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to\ncapture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of\nintegration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection\nzone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this\nwork we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a\n3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and\nquantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection\nzone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable\nstrength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and\namplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of\nmagnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature\ninduced by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow\nat mid latitudes in the lower convection zone that occurs near the equatorward\nedge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during cycle maximum. Globally, the\ndynamo-generated large-scale magnetic field drives variations in the meridional\nflow, in stark contrast to the conventional kinematic flux transport view of\nthe magnetic field being advected passively by the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 13:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 12:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

Purpose: We study the effects of relativity and nucleon-nucleon\nshort-range correlations on the nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\\nu}$ by assuming\nthe mechanism of exchanging light or heavy neutrinos for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay. Methods: The nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\\nu}$ are calculated within\nthe framework of covariant density functional theory, where the\nbeyond-mean-field correlations are included in the nuclear wave functions by\nconfiguration mixing of both angular-momentum and particle-number projected\nquadrupole deformed mean-field states.

Once a\nbackbone is created for a network, it can be utilized for fast communication\namongst the nodes of the network.\n  The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model has become the\nstandard for modeling communication among devices in wireless networks. For\nthis model, the community has pondered what the most realistic solutions for\ncommunication problems in wireless networks would look like. Such solutions\nwould have the characteristic that they would make the least number of\nassumptions about the availability of information about the participating\nnodes. Solving problems when nothing at all is known about the network and\nhaving nodes just start participating would be ideal. However, this is quite\nchallenging and most likely not feasible. The pragmatic approach is then to\nmake meaningful assumptions about the available information and present\nefficient solutions based on this information.\n  We present a solution for creation of backbone in the SINR model, when nodes\ndo not have access to their physical coordinates or the coordinates of other\nnodes in the network. This restriction models the deployment of nodes in\nvarious situations for sensing hurricanes, cyclones, and so on, where only\ninformation about nodes prior to their deployment may be known but not their\nactual locations post deployment.

Mode coupling of the incident\nand transversally scattered light with the periodic plasma structures is\nsufficient to initiate the growth and the self-organization of the\ncharacteristic pattern with a periodicity of a half-wavelength in the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 15:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 20:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 19:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Since the discovery of the CMB dipole, the implicit\nassumption was that excesses in the abundance of galaxies induce the Local\nGroup motion. Yet, underdense regions push as much as overdensities attract but\nthey are deficient of light and consequently difficult to chart. It was\nsuggested a decade ago that an underdensity in the northern hemisphere roughly\n15,000 km s-1 away is a significant actor in the local flow.

We map the large scale 3D velocity\nfield using a Wiener filter reconstruction from the Cosmicflows-2 dataset of\npeculiar velocities, and identify the attractors and repellers that dominate\nthe local dynamics. We show here that the local flow is dominated by a single\nattractor -associated with the Shapley Concentration- and a single previously\nunidentified repeller.

Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to\nautomatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for\npopulations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain\nactivity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be\nunder-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm\ninfants reaching term ages (PMA $\\geq$ 36 weeks) using multi-feature\nclassification on a single EEG channel. Five EEG burst detectors relying on\ndifferent machine learning approaches were compared: Logistic regression (LR),\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector\nmachines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually\nlabeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of\ngestation) with 36 - 41 weeks PMA. The most performing classifiers reached\nabout 95\\% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84\\%.

First, we\ndescribe a pipeline for translating three-dimensional (3D) density structures\nfrom N-body simulations into solid surfaces suitable for 3D printing, and\npresent prints of a cosmological volume and of the infall region around a\nmassive cluster halo. In these models, we discover wall-like features that are\ninvisible in two-dimensional projections. Going beyond the sheer visualization\nof simulation data, we undertake an exploration of the cosmic web as a\nthree-dimensional woven textile. To this end, we develop experimental 3D\nweaving techniques to create sphere-like and filamentary shapes and radically\nsimplify a region of the cosmic web into a set of filaments and halos. We\ntranslate the resulting tree structure into a series of commands that can be\nexecuted by a digital weaving machine, and present a large-scale textile\ninstallation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 19:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 01:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

If\nno bit of information in the Universe is lost, than the sum of the entropies of\nthe geometric and the matter fields should be conserved. We propose a local\ninvariant expression for the entropy of the geometric field and formulate a\nvariational principle on the entropic functional which produces entropic field\nequations. This information-theoretic approach implies that the geometric field\ndoes not exist in an empty of matter Universe, the material entropy is geometry\ndependent, matter can exchange information (entropy) with the geometric field\nand a quantum condensate can channel energy into the geometric field at a\nparticular coherent state. The entropic field equations feature a non-intuitive\ndirect coupling between the material fields and the geometric field, which acts\nas an entropy reservoir. Cosmological consequences such as the emergence of the\ncosmological constant as well as experimental consequences involving\ngravity-quantum condensate interaction are discussed. The energetic aspect of\nthe theory restores the repertoire of the classical General Relativity up to a\ndifferent coupling constant between the fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 10:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

The\ntransverse functions $Z_n$ are determined by solving local Sturm-Liouville\nproblems (reference waveguides). In most cases, the boundary conditions\nassigned to $Z_n$ cannot be compatible with the physical boundary conditions of\n$\\Phi$, leading to slowly convergent series, and rendering CMTs mild-slope\napproximations. In the present paper, the heuristic approach introduced in\n(Athanassoulis & Belibassakis 1999, J. Fluid Mech. 389, 275-301) is generalized\nand justified. It is proved that an appropriately enhanced series expansion\nbecomes an exact, rapidly-convergent representation of the field $\\Phi$, valid\nfor any smooth, nonplanar boundaries and any smooth enough $\\Phi$. This series\nexpansion can be differentiated termwise everywhere in the domain, including\nthe boundaries, implementing an exact semi-separation of variables for\nnon-separable domains. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by solving a\nboundary value problem for the Laplace equation, and computing the\ncorresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, involved in Hamiltonian equations\nfor nonlinear water waves. The present method provides accurate results with\nonly a few modes for quite general domains. Extensions to general waveguides\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 18:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Also, it has been observed\nthat there exists complex interdependent relationships between individual\nentities of the power grid and the communication network that further\nobfuscates the analysis, and mitigation of faults in such multi-layered\nnetworks. In recent years, the research community has made significant efforts\ntowards gaining insight and understanding of the interdependency relations in\nsuch multi-layered networks, and accordingly, a number of models have been\nproposed and analyzed towards realizing this goal. In this chapter we study\nexisting interdependency models proposed in the recent literature and discuss\ntheir approach, and inherent features, towards modeling interdependent\nmulti-layer networks. We also provide a brief discussion into the drawbacks of\neach of these models and propose an alternate model that addresses these\ndrawbacks by capturing the interdependency relationships using a combination of\nconjunctive and disjunctive relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 19:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

The harvested energy is used for data\ntransmission, including the circuit energy consumption. As in practical\nscenarios, the system state, comprised by the harvested energy, battery levels,\ndata buffer levels, and channel gains, is only partially observable by the EH\nnodes. Moreover, the EH nodes have only outdated knowledge regarding the\nchannel gains for their own transmit channels. Our goal is to find distributed\ntransmission policies aiming at maximizing the throughput. A channel predictor\nbased on a Kalman filter is implemented in each EH node to estimate the current\nchannel gain for its own channel. Furthermore, to overcome the partial\nobservability of the system state, the EH nodes cooperate with each other to\nobtain information about their parameters during a signaling phase. We model\nthe problem as a Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning\nalgorithm to find the transmission policies. We show the trade-off between the\nachievable throughput and the signaling required, and provide convergence\nguarantees for the proposed algorithm. Results show that even when the\nsignaling overhead is taken into account, the proposed algorithm outperforms\nother approaches that do not consider cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 13:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 12:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}
