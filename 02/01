Tighter constraints on metal-poor stars we observe are needed to\nbetter understand the chemical processes of the early Universe. Computing a\nstellar spectrum in 3D allows one to model complex stellar behaviours, which\ncannot be replicated in 1D. Aims. We examine the effect that the intrinsic CNO\nabundances have on a 3D model structure and the resulting 3D spectrum\nsynthesis. Methods. Model atmospheres were computed in 3D for three distinct\nCNO chemical compositions using the CO 5 BOLD model atmosphere code, and their\ninternal structures were examined. Synthetic spectra were computed from these\nmodels using Linfor3D and they were compared. New 3D abundance corrections for\nthe G-band and a selection of UV OH lines were also computed. Results. The\nvarying CNO abundances change the metal content of the 3D models. This had an\neffect on the model structure and the resulting synthesis. However, it was\nfound that the C/O ratio had a larger effect than the overall metal content of\na model. Conclusions. Our results suggest that varying the C/O ratio has a\nsubstantial impact on the internal structure of the 3D model, even in the hot\nturn-off star models explored here. This suggests that bespoke 3D models, for\nspecific CNO abundances should be sought. Such effects are not seen in 1D at\nthese temperature regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

The procedure relies on the fact that of all the\ninitial disturbances on a constant-energy hypersphere, the optimisation\nprocedure will naturally select the one which lies nearest to the stable\nmanifold of a nearby solution in phase space if $T$ is large enough. Then, when\nin its subsequent evolution, the optimal disturbance transiently approaches the\nnew solution, a flow state at this point can be used as an initial guess to\nconverge the solution to machine precision. We illustrate this approach in\nplane Couette flow by: a) rediscovering the spanwise-localised `snake'\nsolutions of Schneider et al.

We present a study of a CXS of the SOL2011-10-22T11:10 long-duration\nflare observed simultaneously with RHESSI and SDO/AIA. We focus our attention\non the following questions: What was responsible for the CXS presence and long\nduration? Was there any fine structure in the CXS? Available data enables us to\nstudy a relation between the CXS and structures observed in EUV during the\ndecay phase of the flare. X-ray emission recorded by RHESSI during the decay\nphase of the flare came from about 10 MK hot CXS. The source was observable for\n5 hours. This long presence of the source could be supported by magnetic\nreconnection ongoing during the decay phase. Supra-arcade downflows, which are\nconsidered to be a manifestation of magnetic reconnection, were observed at the\nsame time as the CXS. The source was co-spatial with the part of the hot\nsupra-arcade region that had the highest emission measure and simultaneously\nthe temperature within the range of RHESSI thermal-response. However, while the\nsupra-arcade region was a dynamic region consisting of small-scale structures,\nthe CXS seemed to be smooth, structureless. We run simulations using real and\nsynthetic RHESSI data, but we did not find any strong evidence that the CXS had\nany small-scale structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Using a sample with a Moir\\'e superlattice, we next show that a\nFP cavity can also be formed by interfaces that mimic a pn-junction, but are\ndefined through a satellite Dirac point due to the superlattice. We carefully\nanalyse the FP resonances, which can provide insight into the\nband-reconstruction due to the superlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

It was\nrevealed that both of these two parameters can significantly change the\nstructural composition and physicochemical properties of resultant products.\nUsing PEG with MW of 6000 has led to the formation of RHO and CHA structural\nframeworks i.e. DNL-6 and SAPO-34, simultaneously, while addition of PEG with\nMW of 4000 resulted the formation of pure SAPO-34 phase. Altering the PEG/Al\nmolar ratio in the precursor significantly influenced the porosity and acidity\nof the synthesized silicoaluminophosphate products. SAPO-34 impregnated with\nPEG molecular weight of 4000 and PEG/Al molar ratio of 0.0125 showed superior\ncatalytic stability in MTO reaction because of the tuned bi-modal porosity and\ntailored acidity pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

A\ncompletely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we\npresent a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training\nvery deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to\nthe singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such\nsingularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities\ncaused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination\nsingularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation,\nof nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes.\nThese singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow\ndown learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by\nbreaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node\nelimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for\ntypical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the\n\"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to\nalleviate the learning slow-down.

Several keyhole and ConA targets preceeded\na DT layered shot. In addition to backscatter subtraction, laser drive\nmultipliers were needed to match observed X-ray drives. Those for the picket\n(0.95), trough (1.0) and second pulse (0.80) were determined by VISAR\nmeasurements. The time dependence of the Dante total x-ray flux and its\nfraction > 1.8 keV reflect the time dependence of the multipliers. A two step\ndrive multiplier for the main pulse can match implosion times, but Dante\nmeasurements suggest the drive multiplier must increase late in time. With a\nsingle set of time dependent, multi-level multipliers the Dante data are well\nmatched. These same third pulse drive multipliers also match the implosion\ntimes and Dante signals for two CH capsule DT. One discrepancy in the\ncalculations is the X-ray flux in the picket. Calculations over-estimate the\nflux > 1.8 keV by a factor of ~100, while getting the total flux correctly.\nThese harder X-rays cause an expansion of the Be/fuel interface of 2-3 km/s\nbefore the arrival of the first shock. VISAR measurements show only 0.2 to 0.3\nkm/s. The X-ray drive on the DT Be capsule was further degraded by a random\ndecrease of 9% in the total picket flux. This small change caused the capsule\nfuel to change from an adiabat of 1.8 to 2.3 by mistiming of the first and\nsecond shocks. With this shock tuning and adjustments to the calculation, the\nfirst NIF Be capsule implosion achieved 29% of calculated yield, comparable to\nthe CH DT capsules of 68% and 21%. Inclusion of a large M1 asymmetry in the DT\nice layer and mixing from instability growth may help explain this final\ndegradation. In summary when driven similarly the Be capsules performed like CH\ncapsules. Performance degradation for both seems to be dominated by drive and\ncapsule asymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

This model\npredicts a high gamma-ray flux which should be detectable by the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) for many sources.

Using the M\\\"obius inversion\nduality between multivariable entropies and multivariable interaction\ninformation, we express the divergence as an additive series in the number of\ninteracting variables, which provides a restricted and simplified set of\ndistributions to use as approximation and with which to model data. Truncations\nof this series yield approximations based on the number of interacting\nvariables. The first few terms of the expansion-truncation are illustrated and\nshown to lead naturally to familiar approximations, including the well-known\nKirkwood superposition approximation. Truncation can also induce a simple\nrelation between the multi-information and the interaction information. A\nmeasure of distance between distributions, based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence, is then described and shown to be a true metric if properly\nrestricted. The expansion is shown to generate a hierarchy of metrics and\nconnects this work to information geometry formalisms. We give an example of\nthe application of these metrics to a graph comparision problem that shows that\nthe formalism can be applied to a wide range of network problems, provides a\ngeneral approach for systematic approximations in numbers of interactions or\nconnections, and a related quantitative metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 19:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 14:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

Using a simpler model\nsystem, we analyze the underlying dipolar physics and show how a characteristic\nlength scale arising from the magnetic dipolar coupling interacts with the\nhierarchy of healing lengths of the s-wave scattering, and leads to simple\ncriteria for the core structure: When the interactions both energetically favor\nthe ground-state spin condition, such as in the spin-1 ferromagnetic phase, the\nsize of singular vortices is restricted to the shorter spin-dependent healing\nlength. Conversely, when the interactions compete (e.g., in the spin-1 polar\nphase), we find that the core of a singular vortex is enlarged by increasing\ndipolar coupling. We further demonstrate how the spin-alignment arising from\nthe interaction anisotropy is manifest in the appearance of a ground-state\nspin-vortex line that is oriented perpendicularly to the condensate axis of\nrotation, as well as in potentially observable internal core spin textures. We\nalso explain how it leads to interaction-dependent angular momentum in\nnonsingular vortices as a result of competition with rotation-induced spin\nordering.

However, optical flow is typically\nestimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This\nrequires processing full images on-board, limiting the update rate of\ndivergence measurements, and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot.\nEvent-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level\nbrightness changes at microsecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an\nefficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow\nestimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing\n'local plane fitting' algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally\nefficient optical flow estimation method, valid for a wide range of optical\nflow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In\naddition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow\nis introduced, which accounts for the aperture problem. The developed\nalgorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller on-board\nof a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate\ndivergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables\nthe quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 21:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 09:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 09:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

In this\ncontext, the concept of preadaptation refers to a common type of bet-hedging\nprotection strategy in which a relatively small number of individuals in a\npopulation stochastically switch their phenotypes to a `dormant' metabolic\nstate in which they increase their probability of survival against potential\nenvironmental shocks. Hence, if an environmental shock took place at some point\nin time, preadapted organisms would be better adapted to survive and\nproliferate once the shock is over. In many biological populations, the\nmechanisms of preadaptation and proliferation present delays whose influence in\nthe fitness of the population are not well-understood. In this paper, we\npropose a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze the role of delays in both\npreadaptation and proliferation mechanisms in the survival of biological\npopulations, with an emphasis on bacterial colonies. Our theoretical framework\nallows us to analytically quantify the average growth rate of a bet-hedging\nbacterial colony with stochastically delayed reactions with arbitrary\nprecision. We verify the accuracy of the proposed method by numerical\nsimulations and conclude that the growth rate of a bet-hedging population shows\na non-trivial dependency on their preadaptation and proliferation delays.\nContrary to the current belief, our results show that faster reactions do not,\nin general, increase the overall fitness of a biological population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 00:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The existing HSI denoising methods mainly focus on specific spectral\nand spatial prior knowledge in HSIs, and share a common underlying assumption\nthat the embedded noise in HSI is independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.). In real scenarios, however, the noise existed in a natural HSI is\nalways with much more complicated non-i.i.d. statistical structures and the\nunder-estimation to this noise complexity often tends to evidently degenerate\nthe robustness of current methods. To alleviate this issue, this paper attempts\nthe first effort to model the HSI noise using a non-i.i.d. mixture of Gaussians\n(NMoG) noise assumption, which is finely in accordance with the noise\ncharacteristics possessed by a natural HSI and thus is capable of adapting\nvarious noise shapes encountered in real applications. Then we integrate such\nnoise modeling strategy into the low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) model and\npropose a NMoG-LRMF model in the Bayesian framework. A variational Bayes\nalgorithm is designed to infer the posterior of the proposed model. All\ninvolved parameters can be recursively updated in closed-form.

In a first\npart, I discuss new aspects of the QCD phase diagram like the possible\nexistence of a critical endpoint of first-order phase transitions from the\nperspective of generalizations of the 3-flavor PNJL model including the\nconjecture of a universal pressure for the onset of deconfinement in heavy-ion\ncollisions and astrophysics. A second part is devoted to first results of the\nnewly constructed event simulator (THESEUS) which is based on the\nparticlization of the former three-fluid hydrodynamics code by Ivanov, Russkikh\nand Toneev that allows also to study the role of hadronic final state\ninteractions. Possible signals of the mixed phase accessible at NICA are\nconsidered. In particular, the robustness of the baryon-stopping signal of\ndeconfinement and the occurrence of antiflow for protons have been investigated\nfor Au+Au collisions in the range of the NICA-MPD energy scan for $\\sqrt{s}\n\\sim 6 \\dots 8$ GeV. This signal is reflected also in the flow pattern of light\nnuclear clusters, in particular deuterons. The sharp peak for the $K^+/\\pi^+$\nratio at $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 8$ GeV (the \"horn\" effect) is not obtained in the\npresent version of THESEUS and calls for improvement of the equation of state\ninput. I report the recent progress in developing a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck\napproach to a unified description of quark-hadron matter which includes now\nstrangeness and reveals a new mechanism for explaining the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio\ndue to the pronounced occurrence of an anomalous mode in the $K^+$ at finite\nbaryochemical potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 04:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

Visco-Energetic solutions have been recently obtained by\npassing to the time-continuous limit in a time-incremental scheme, akin to that\nfor Energetic solutions, but perturbed by a `viscous' correction term, as in\nthe case of Balanced Viscosity solutions. However, for Visco-Energetic\nsolutions this viscous correction is tuned by a fixed parameter $\\mu$. The\nresulting solution notion is characterized by a stability condition and an\nenergy balance analogous to those for Energetic solutions, but, in addition, it\nprovides a fine description of the system behavior at jumps as Balanced\nViscosity solutions do. Visco-Energetic evolution can be thus thought as\n`in-between' Energetic and Balanced Viscosity evolution. Here we aim to\nformalize this intermediate character of Visco-Energetic solutions by studying\ntheir singular limits as $\\mu\\downarrow 0$ and $\\mu\\uparrow \\infty$.

With a fixed thickness (1\nnm) of the Ta layer, the magnitude and sign of current induced spin-orbit\neffective fields can be continuously tuned by changing the Pt layer thickness,\nconsistent with the current induced magnetization switching data. The ratio of\nlongitudinal to transverse spin-orbit effective fields is found to be\ndetermined by the Ta/CoFeB interface and can be continuously tuned by changing\nthe Pt layer thickness. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to\nbe weak and shows an insignificant variation with the Pt thickness. The results\ndemonstrate an effective method to tune SOTs utilizing bilayer heavy metals\nwithout affecting the DMI, a desirable feature which will be useful for the\ndesign of SOT-based devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 06:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

One natural approach to this problem is to first\ncreate a list of sensitive keywords, and then identify Twitter accounts that\nuse these words in their tweets. But such an approach may overlook sensitive\naccounts that are not covered by the subjective choice of keywords. In this\npaper, we instead explore finding sensitive accounts by examining the\npercentage of anonymous and identifiable followers the accounts have. This\napproach is motivated by an earlier study showing that sensitive accounts\ntypically have a large percentage of anonymous followers and a small percentage\nof identifiable followers.\n  To this end, we first considered the problem of automatically determining if\na Twitter account is anonymous or identifiable. We find that simple techniques,\nsuch as checking for name-list membership, perform poorly. We designed a\nmachine learning classifier that classifies accounts as anonymous or\nidentifiable. We then classified an account as sensitive based on the\npercentages of anonymous and identifiable followers the account has. We applied\nour approach to approximately 100,000 accounts with 404 million active\nfollowers. The approach uncovered accounts that were sensitive for a diverse\nnumber of reasons. These accounts span across varied themes, including those\nthat are not commonly proposed as sensitive or those that relate to socially\nstigmatized topics. To validate our approach, we applied Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) topic analysis to the tweets in the detected sensitive and\nnon-sensitive accounts. LDA showed that the sensitive and non-sensitive\naccounts obtained from the methodology are tweeting about distinctly different\ntopics. Our results show that it is indeed possible to objectively identify\nsensitive accounts at the scale of Twitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 08:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

Routing between\ndomains/ASes is realised in a distributed way, over the Border Gateway Protocol\n(BGP). Despite its global adoption, BGP has several shortcomings, like slow\nconvergence after routing changes, which can cause packet losses and interrupt\ncommunication even for several minutes. To accelerate convergence, inter-domain\nrouting centralization approaches, based on Software Defined Networking (SDN),\nhave been recently proposed. Initial studies show that these approaches can\nsignificantly improve performance and routing control over BGP. In this paper,\nwe complement existing system-oriented works, by analytically studying the\ngains of inter-domain SDN. We propose a probabilistic framework to analyse the\neffects of centralization on the inter-domain routing performance. We derive\nbounds for the time needed to establish data plane connectivity between ASes\nafter a routing change, as well as predictions for the control-plane\nconvergence time.

Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours. However,\nit also turns out that the signals mainly come from galaxies residing in the\nfilamentary structures and the contribution from the WHIM is too small to\ndetect with the SKA1-mid. Our results suggest that about 10 times higher\nsensitivity than the SKA1-mid is possibly enough to detect the WHIM at z=0.5-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 10:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

The metallicity distribution functions of stars in the inner- and\nouter-halo regions of the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to\narise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks\nat [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively.

This elastic\nproperty of DNA also changes with small interacting ligands. The\nsingle-molecule force spectroscopy technique shows different interaction modes\nby measuring the mechanical properties of DNA bound with small ligands. When a\nds-DNA molecule is overstretched in the presence of ligands, it undergoes a\nco-operative structural transition based on the externally applied force, the\nmode of binding of the ligands, the binding constant of the ligands to the DNA,\nthe concentration of the ligands and the ionic strength of the supporting\nmedium. This leads to the changes in the regions- upto 60 pN, cooperative\nstructural transition region and the overstretched region, compared to that of\nthe FEC in the absence of any binding ligand. The cooperative structural\ntransitions were studied by the extended and twistable worm-like chain model.\nHere we have depicted these changes in persistence length and the elastic\nmodulus constant as a function of binding constant and the concentration of the\nbound ligands, which vary with time. Therefore, besides ionic strength,\ninteracting proteins and content of AT and GC base pairs, the ligand binding or\nintercalation with the ligands is an important parameter which changes the\nstiffness of DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 10:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

This model assumes that there is an underlying latent\nspace in which the actors follow a finite mixture distribution.

This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors\nwhich consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative\ninformation. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying\nlatent components in the mixture distribution is a complex task. The current\nstate-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose, where\nan approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true\nlog-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to\nanalytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a\nposterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture\nmodel.

The onboard Framing Camera has\nacquired thousands of clear filter and narrow band images, which, with the\navailability of high-resolution global shape models, allows for a photometric\ncharacterization of the surface in unprecedented detail. We analyze clear\nfilter images to retrieve the photometric properties of the regolith. In the\nfirst part of the paper we evaluate different photometric models for the global\naverage. In the second part we use these results to study variations in albedo\nand steepness of the phase curve over the surface. Maps of these two\nphotometric parameters show large scale albedo variations, which appear to be\nassociated with compositional differences. They also reveal the location of\nphotometrically extreme terrains, where the phase curve is unusually shallow or\nsteep. We find that shallow phase curves are associated with steep slopes on\ncrater walls and faults, as calculated from a shape model. On the other hand,\nthe phase curve of ejecta associated with young impact craters is steep. We\ninterpret these variations in phase curve slope in terms of physical roughness\nof the regolith. The lack of rough ejecta around older craters suggests that\ninitially rough ejecta associated with impact craters on Vesta are smoothed\nover a relatively short time of several tens of Myr. We propose that this\nprocess is the result of impact gardening, and as such represents a previously\nunrecognized aspect of Vesta space weathering (Pieters et al., 2012). If this\ntype of space weathering is common, we may expect to encounter this photometric\nphenomenon on other main belt asteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 11:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

It has a deep combinatorial structure which one seeks\nto understand. For each sequence $J$ of reduced decompositions of elements of\nthe Weyl group $W$, it has a realization as a subset $B_J(\\infty)$ of a crystal\n$B_J$ which as a set is just $J$ copies of the natural numbers. The goal is to\ndetermine $B_J(\\infty)$ and in particular to show that it is a polyhedral\nsubset of $B_J$. In earlier work this led to the notion of an $S$-graph\nassociated to a given simple root $\\alpha$. Here the notion of a giant\n$S$-graph depending on a fixed simple root is introduced. It is essentially a\nunion of $S$-graphs for each simple root with one distinguished vertex\ndepending on $\\alpha$. Its vertices, which forms a giant $S$-set, determine a\nset of dual Kashiwara functions. These are linear functions on $B_J$, whose\ncommon maximum determines the dual Kashiwara parameter with respect to\n$\\alpha$. From these parameters one may compute $B_J(\\infty)$ as an explicit\npolyhedral subset of $B_J$.\n  For $W$ finite, Berenstein and Zelevinsky had studied this problem by\nintroducing the notion of a trail in a fundamental module. The functions they\ndefine may also be viewed as a set of dual Kashiwara functions. The goal is to\nrelate these two approaches and without restriction on $W$. It is shown under\nthe hypothesis that no \"false\" trails exist, that the set of trails determines\nthe \"$Z$-convex envelope\" of a giant $S$-set.

Experimental evidences have\nshown that graphene oxide can be impermeable to liquids, vapors and gases,\nwhile allowing a fast permeation of water molecules. This phenomenon has been\nattributed to the formation of a network of nano capillaries that allow nearly\nfrictionless water flow while blocking other molecules by steric hindrance\neffects. It is supposed that water molecules are transported through the\npercolated two-dimensional channels formed between graphene-based sheets.\nAlthough these channels allow fast water permeation in such materials, the flow\nrates are strongly dependent on how the membranes are fabricated. Also, some\nfundamental issues regarding the nanoscale mechanisms of water permeation are\nstill not fully understood and their interpretation remains controversial. In\nthis work, we have investigated the dynamics of water permeation through\npristine graphene and graphene oxide model membranes. We have carried out fully\natomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations of systems composed of\nmultiple layered graphene-based sheets into contact with a water reservoir\nunder controlled thermodynamics conditions (e. g., by varying temperature and\npressure values). We have systematically analyzed how the transport dynamics of\nthe confined nanofluids depend on the interlayer distances and the role of the\noxide functional groups. Our results show the water flux is much more effective\nfor graphene than for graphene oxide membranes. These results are attributed to\nthe H-bonds formation between oxide functional groups and water, which traps\nthe water molecules and precludes ultrafast water transport through the\nnanochannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 13:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

However, the processes\nregulating the gas energetics have not been well constrained by observations so\nfar. We aim at studying the processes involved in disk photoevaporation when it\nis driven by far-UV photons. We present a unique Herschel survey and new ALMA\nobservations of four externally-illuminated photoevaporating disks (a.k.a.\nproplyds). For the analysis of these data, we developed a 1D model of the\nphotodissociation region (PDR) of a proplyd, based on the Meudon PDR code and\ncomputed the far infrared line emission. We successfully reproduce most of the\nobservations and derive key physical parameters, i.e. densities at the disk\nsurface of about $10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and local gas temperatures of about 1000 K.\nOur modelling suggests that all studied disks are found in a transitional\nregime resulting from the interplay between several heating and cooling\nprocesses that we identify. These differ from those dominating in classical\nPDRs, i.e. grain photo-electric effect and cooling by [OI] and [CII] FIR lines.\nThis energetic regime is associated to an equilibrium dynamical point of the\nphotoevaporation flow: the mass-loss rate is self-regulated to set the envelope\ncolumn density at a value that maintains the temperature at the disk surface\naround 1000 K. From our best-fit models, we estimate mass-loss rates - of the\norder of $10^{-7}$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$/yr - that are in agreement with earlier\nspectroscopic observation of ionised gas tracers. This holds only if we assume\nan evaporation flow launched from the disk surface at sound speed\n(supercritical regime).

They manifest themselves in the form of\nnon-analyticities in the large deviation function of those observables. In this\npaper, we look at bulk-driven exclusion processes with open boundaries. It is\nknown that the standard asymmetric simple exclusion process exhibits a\ndynamical phase transition in the large deviations of the current of particles\nflowing through it. That phase transition has been described thanks to specific\ncalculation methods relying on the model being exactly solvable, but more\ngeneral methods have also been used to describe the extreme large deviations of\nthat current, far from the phase transition. We extend those methods to a large\nclass of models based on the ASEP, where we add arbitrary spatial\ninhomogeneities in the rates and short-range potentials between the particles.\nWe show that, as for the regular ASEP, the large deviation function of the\ncurrent scales differently with the size of the system if one considers very\nhigh or very low currents, pointing to the existence of a dynamical phase\ntransition between those two regimes: high current large deviations are\nextensive in the system size, and the typical states associated to them are\nCoulomb gases, which are correlated ; low current large deviations do not\ndepend on the system size, and the typical states associated to them are\nanti-shocks, consistently with a hydrodynamic behaviour. Finally, we illustrate\nour results numerically on a simple example, and we interpret the transition in\nterms of the current pushing beyond its maximal hydrodynamic value, as well as\nrelate it to the appearance of Tracy-Widom distributions in the relaxation\nstatistics of such models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 14:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 09:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Due to the difficulty of\nmodeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing\nmethods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image\nnoise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep\nlearning, here we combine the autoencoder, the deconvolution network, and\nshortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural\nnetwork (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the\nproposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to\nthe-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases.

Controllers in V-formation games utilize\na new formulation of model-predictive control we call Adaptive-Horizon MPC\n(AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain\ncontrollability assumptions, an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation\nwith probability 1.\n  We define several classes of attackers, including those that in one move can\nremove R birds from the flock, or introduce random displacement into flock\ndynamics. We consider both naive attackers, whose strategies are purely\nprobabilistic, and AMPC-enabled attackers, putting them on par strategically\nwith the controllers. While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every\ngame with probability 1, in practice, it is resource-constrained: its maximum\nprediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.\nUnder these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a\nV-formation game.\n  Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical\nmodel checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the\ncontroller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1, the\ncontroller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2,\nthe game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the\ndisplacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker,\ni.e. one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive\ncounterpart that randomly executes its attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 14:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

It is shown that sub-Kolmogorov particles/droplets modify the energy\nspectrum leading to a scaling law, $E(k)\\propto k^{-4}$, that emerges at small\nscales where the particle forcing balances the viscous dissipation. This regime\nis confirmed by Direct Numerical Simulation data of a particle-laden\nstatistically steady homogeneous shear flow, demonstrating the ability of the\nregularised model to capture the relevant small-scale physics. The energy\nbudget in spectral space, extended to account for the inter-phase momentum\nexchange, highlights how the particle provide an energy sink in the production\nrange that turns into a source at small scales. Overall, the dissipative\nfluid-particle interaction is found to stall the energy cascade processes\ntypical of Newtonian turbulent flows. In terms of particle statistics,\nclustering at small scale is depleted, with potential consequences for\ncollision models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 11:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

A two-scale\nhomogenization method, coupling meso-scale discrete particle models to macro-\nscale finite element models, is formulated into an adaptive framework. A\ncontinuum multiaxial failure criterion for concrete is calibrated on the basis\nof fine-scale simulations, and it serves as the adaptive criterion in the\nmultiscale framework. Thus, in this approach, simulations start without\nassigning any material Representative Volume Element (RVE) to the macro-scale\nfinite elements. The finite elements that meet the adaptive criterion and must\nbe entered into the multiscale homogenization framework are detected on the\nfly. This leads to a substantial reduction of the computational cost especially\nfor loading conditions leading to damage localization in which only a small\nportion of the FE mesh is enriched with the homogenized RVE. Several numerical\nsimulations are carried out to investigate the capability of the developed\nadaptive homogenization method.
