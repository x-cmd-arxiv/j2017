The transition is\nexpected to be first-order for massless quarks, and to remain so for a range of\nquark masses until it turns second-order at a critical quark mass. But this\ncritical quark mass and resulting \"pion\" mass disagree violently between Wilson\nand staggered fermions at finite lattice spacing, and decrease sharply with the\nlattice spacing, for staggered fermions at least. To clarify this puzzle and\neliminate potential systematic effects from rooting, we study the 4-flavor\ntheory with staggered fermions, on lattices with 4 to 10 time-slices. Our\nresults are qualitatively similar to the 3-flavor case, so that rooting is not\nan issue. However, dramatic cutoff effects are visible, even on our finest\nlattices. Universality implies that cutoff effects for Wilson fermions are even\nmore dramatic. In order to obtain a first-order thermal transition in the\ncontinuum theory, extremely light quarks are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 16:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

In the\nwell-studied cooperative, or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is\nknown that there is a tile set to simulate any Turing machine and an\nintrinsically universal tile set that simulates the shapes and dynamics of any\ninstance of the model, up to spatial rescaling. It has been an open question as\nto whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is\ncapable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing\nthat there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically\nuniversal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a\nbounded region of the plane.\n  Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity\nand power of the cooperative model it was not obvious how to prove this. One\nreason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of\ncomplicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A\nsecond reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the\nmodel (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles\nthat repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great\ncomputational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all\nof these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation\npower. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic\nnoncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the\nfact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D\nnoncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal\ntilesets.

In physical networks, these interactions often occur\nalong structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection\ntopology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviors such as\nsynchronization. While descriptions of these behaviors are important, they are\nonly a first step towards understanding the relationship between network\ntopology and system behavior, and harnessing that relationship to optimally\ncontrol the system's function. Here, we use linear network control theory to\nanalytically relate the topology of a subset of structural connections (those\nlinking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to\ncontrol networked systems. As opposed to the numerical computations of control\nenergy, our accurate closed-form expressions yield general structural features\nin networks that require significantly more or less energy to control,\nproviding topological principles for the design and modification of network\nbehavior. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach\nto high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from drosophila, mouse,\nand human brains.

The performance of in-situ\nprocessing across a query workload is, however, limited by the speed of full\nscan, tokenizing, and parsing of the entire data. Online aggregation (OLA) has\nbeen introduced as an efficient method for data exploration that identifies\nuninteresting patterns faster by continuously estimating the result of a\ncomputation during the actual processing---the computation can be stopped as\nearly as the estimate is accurate enough to be deemed uninteresting. However,\nexisting OLA solutions have a high upfront cost of randomly shuffling and/or\nsampling the data. In this paper, we present OLA-RAW, a bi-level sampling\nscheme for parallel online aggregation over raw data. Sampling in OLA-RAW is\nquery-driven and performed exclusively in-situ during the runtime query\nexecution, without data reorganization. This is realized by a novel\nresource-aware bi-level sampling algorithm that processes data in random chunks\nconcurrently and determines adaptively the number of sampled tuples inside a\nchunk.

In such a unified framework, we explore the utility of\nthe $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals. We give the physical interpretation of the\n$M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocations, connecting them with established\nquantities in dislocation theory such as the interaction energy and the\n$J$-integral of dislocations, which is equivalent to the well-known\nPeach-Koehler force. The $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocations have\nbeen studied in the framework of three-dimensional, incompatible, linear\nelasticity. First of all, the general formulas of the $J$-, $M$-, and\n$L$-integrals for dislocations are given. Next, the examined integrals are\nspecified for straight dislocations. Finally, the explicit formulas of the\n$J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals are calculated for straight (screw and edge)\ndislocations in isotropic materials. The obtained results reveal the physical\ninterpretation and significance of the $M$-, and $L$-integrals for straight\ndislocations. The $M$-integral between two straight dislocations (per unit\ndislocation length) is equal to the half of the interaction energy of the two\ndislocations (per unit dislocation length) depending on the distance and on the\nangle, plus twice the corresponding pre-logarithmic energy factor. The\n$L_3$-integral between two straight dislocations is the $z$-component of the\nconfigurational vector moment or the rotational moment about the $z$-axis\ncaused by the interaction between the two dislocations. Fundamental relations\nbetween the $J$-, $M$-, and $L_3$-integrals are derived showing the inherent\nconnection between them. The relations connecting directly the $J$-, $M$-, and\n$L_3$-integrals with the interaction energy are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 17:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 11:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

A set of 20 extremely red galaxies at 2.5<z<3.8 with photometric\nfeatures of old passive-evolving galaxies without dust, with stellar masses of\n~10^{11} M_sun, have colors that could be related to passive-evolving galaxies\nwith mean ages larger than 1 Gyr. This suggests they have been formed, on\naverage, when the Universe was very young (<1 Gyr).\n  AIMS. We provide new estimates for the stellar content of these 20 galaxies,\nwith a deeper analysis for two of them that includes spectroscopy.\n  METHODS. We obtained, with the GRANTECAN-10.4 m, ultraviolet rest-frame\nspectra of two galaxies and analyzed them together with photometric data. The\nremaining 18 galaxies are analyzed only with photometry. We fit the data with\nmodels of a single-burst stellar population (SSP), combinations of two SSPs, as\nwell as with extended star formation.\n  RESULTS. Fits based on one SSP do not provide consistent results for the blue\nand red wavelengths. Moreover, the absence in the spectra of a break at ~2,000\nangstroms indicates that a rather young component is necessary. Using two SSPs\nwe can match the photometric and spectroscopic data, with the bulk of the\nstellar population being very old (several Gyr) and the remaining contribution\n(<5% of stellar mass fraction) from a young, likely residual star formation\ncomponent with age <~0.1 Gyr. Exponentially decaying extended star formation\nmodels improve slightly the fits with respect to the single burst model, but\nthey are considerably worse than the two SSP based fits, further supporting the\nresidual star formation scenario.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The fact that one SSP cannot match these early-type galaxies\nhighlights the limitations for the use of age estimators based on single lines\nor breaks, such as the Balmer break used in cosmic chronometers, thus\nquestioning this approach for cosmological purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 18:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 14:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

Starting from the\ncharacterization of the isospin, color, and spin states for the pentaquark\nconfiguration, we construct the total wave function composed of the spatial\nwave function, which we take to be symmetric and in S-wave, and the four\northogonal isospin $\\otimes$ color $\\otimes$ spin states that satisfy the Pauli\nprinciple. We then use the variational method to find a compact stable\nconfiguration. While there are compact configurations where the hyperfine\npotential is more attractive than the sum of $p$ and $J/\\psi$ hyperfine\npotentials, we find that the ground state is the isolated $p$ and $J/\\psi$\nstate. Furthermore, the mass of the excited state lies far above the observed\npentaquark state leading us to conclude that the observed states can not be a\ncompact multiquark configuration with $J^p$=$3/2^-$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 18:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Pairwise measurements usually consider local attributes but disregard\ncontextual information involved in graph structures. We address this issue by\nproposing contextual similarities between pairs of nodes. This is done by\nconsidering the tensor product graph (TPG) of two graphs to be matched, where\neach node is an ordered pair of nodes of the operand graphs. Contextual\nsimilarities between a pair of nodes are computed by accumulating weighted\nwalks (normalized pairwise similarities) terminating at the corresponding\npaired node in TPG. Once the contextual similarities are obtained, we formulate\nsubgraph matching as a node and edge selection problem in TPG. We use\ncontextual similarities to construct an objective function and optimize it with\na linear programming approach. Since random walk formulation through TPG takes\ninto account higher order information, it is not a surprise that we obtain more\nreliable similarities and better discrimination among the nodes and edges.\nExperimental results shown on synthetic as well as real benchmarks illustrate\nthat higher order contextual similarities add discriminating power and allow\none to find approximate solutions to the subgraph matching problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 18:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

We describe one way how the global boundary onsite symmetries can be\ngauged within the formalism of the multi-scale renormalization ansatz (MERA),\nin light of the ongoing discussion between tensor networks and holography. We\ndescribe how to \"lift\" the MERA representation of the ground state of a generic\none dimensional (1D) local Hamiltonian, which has a global onsite symmetry, to\na dual quantum state of a 2D \"bulk\" lattice on which the symmetry appears\ngauged. The 2D bulk state decomposes in terms of spin network states, which\nlabel a basis in the gauge-invariant sector of the bulk lattice. This\ndecomposition is instrumental to obtain expectation values of gauge-invariant\nobservables in the bulk, and also reveals that the bulk state is generally\nentangled between the gauge and the remaining (\"gravitational\") bulk degrees of\nfreedom that are not fixed by the symmetry. We present numerical results for\nground states of several 1D critical spin chains to illustrate that the bulk\nentanglement potentially depends on the central charge of the underlying\nconformal field theory. We also discuss the possibility of emergent topological\norder in the bulk using a simple example, and also of emergent symmetries in\nthe non-gauge (\"gravitational\") sector in the bulk.

Three of the point sources (A,B,D) have\nSEDs compatible with the discovery quasar spectra, while the faintest\npoint-like image (G2/C) shows significant reddening and a `grey' dimming of\n$\\approx0.8$mag. In order to understand the lens configuration, we fit\ndifferent models to the relative positions of A,B,D.

The addition of a small satellite galaxy ($R_{\\rm\nE}\\approx0.2$\") in the lens plane near the position of G2/C suppresses the flux\nof the fourth image and can explain both the reddening and grey dimming.

X-rays absorbed inside the host galaxy are unable to escape into the\nIGM and contribute to the EoH.

For\nsuch systems, the evolution of the moments of the state can be described via a\nsystem of linear ordinary differential equations. Typically, however, the\nmoments are not closed and an infinite system of equations is required to\ncompute statistical moments exactly. Existing methods for stochastic analysis,\nknown as closure methods, focus on approximating this infinite system of\nequations with a finite dimensional system. This work develops an alternative\napproach in which the higher order terms, which are approximated in closure\nmethods, are viewed as inputs to a finite-dimensional linear control system.\nUnder this interpretation, upper and lower bounds of statistical moments can be\ncomputed via convex linear optimal control problems with semidefinite\nconstraints. For analysis of steady-state distributions, this optimal control\nproblem reduces to a static semidefinite program. These same optimization\nproblems extend automatically to stochastic optimal control problems. For\nminimization problems, the methodology leads to guaranteed lower bounds on the\ntrue optimal value. Furthermore, we show how an approximate optimal control\nstrategy can be constructed from the solution of the semidefinite program.

When this spilling out is\nincluded in the analysis, agreement with computation is restored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 21:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

While there are many\nways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where\nthere is a \"ground truth\" community structure built into the graph somehow. The\ntask is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph.\n  Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then\nrigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase\ntransition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too\nsparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no\nalgorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or\neven tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely\nrandom one with high probability.

However, how to\nevaluate and compare the quality of different solution sets remains\nchallenging. Existing measures typically require additional problem knowledge\nand information, such as a reference point or a substituted set of the\nPareto-optimal frontier. In this paper, we propose a quality measure, called\ndominance move (DoM), to compare solution sets generated by multiobjective\noptimizers. Given two solution sets, DoM measures the minimum sum of move\ndistances for one set to weakly Pareto dominate the other set. DoM can be seen\nas a natural reflection of the difference between two solutions, capturing all\naspects of solution sets' quality, being compliant with Pareto dominance, and\ndoes not need any additional problem knowledge and parameters. We present an\nexact method to calculate the DoM in the biobjective case. We show the\nnecessary condition of constructing the optimal partition for a solution set's\nminimum move, and accordingly propose an efficient algorithm to recursively\ncalculate the DoM. Finally, DoM is evaluated on several groups of artificial\nand real test cases as well as by a comparison with two well-established\nquality measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 22:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

This paper proposes an adaptive multi-step prediction (AMSP) approach\nto improve the extended Kalman filter s (EKF) performance in estimating the\ndynamic states of a synchronous machine. The proposed approach consists of\nthree major steps. First, two indexes are defined to quantify the non-linearity\nlevels of the state transition function and measurement function, respectively.\nSecond, based on the non-linearity indexes, a multi prediction factor (Mp) is\ndefined to determine the number of prediction steps. And finally, to mitigate\nthe non-linearity impact on dynamic state estimation (DSE) accuracy, the\nprediction step repeats a few time based on Mp before performing the correction\nstep.

Our integrated approach is\nparticularly valuable when performing photometric stereo using as few as 4-6\nimages, since the integrability constraint is capable of improving estimation\nof the linear subspace of possible solutions. We show good improvements over\nprior work in these cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 00:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

The uncertainty in absolute line energies is\ngenerally less than 0.4 eV in the energy range of 4.5 keV to 7.5 keV. Of the\nseventeen line energies of neodymium, samarium, and holmium, thirteen are found\nto be consistent with the available x-ray reference data measured after 1990;\nonly two of the four lines for which reference data predate 1980, however, are\nconsistent with our results.

In this system, we propose a novel MIMO detection\nframework, which is inspired by coding theory. The key idea of the proposed\nframework is to create a non-linear code $\\Cc$ of length $n_r$ and rate $K/n_r$\nusing the encoding function that is completely characterized by a non-linear\nMIMO channel matrix. From this, a multiuser MIMO detection problem is converted\ninto an equivalent channel coding problem, in which a codeword of the $\\Cc$ is\nsent over $n_r$ parallel binary symmetric channels, each with different\ncrossover probabilities. Levereging this framework, we develop a maximum\nlikelihood decoding method, and show that the minimum distance of the $\\Cc$ is\nstrongly related to a diversity order. Furthermore, we propose a practical\nimplementation method of the proposed framework when the channel state\ninformation is not known to the BS. The proposed method is to estimate the code\n$\\Cc$ at the BS using a training sequence. Then, the proposed {\\em weighted}\nminimum distance decoding is applied.

Generally, larger and more\nstable treatment effects are insensitive to larger biases from unmeasured\ncovariates, so a causal conclusion may be considerably firmer if this pattern\nis noted if it occurs. We propose a new strategy, called the submax-method,\nthat combines exploratory and confirmatory efforts to determine whether there\nis stronger evidence of causality - that is, greater insensitivity to\nunmeasured confounding - in some subgroups of individuals. It uses the joint\ndistribution of test statistics that split the data in various ways based on\ncertain observed covariates. For $L$ binary covariates, the method splits the\npopulation $L$ times into two subpopulations, perhaps first men and women,\nperhaps then smokers and nonsmokers, computing a test statistic from each\nsubpopulation, and appends the test statistic for the whole population, making\n$2L+1$ test statistics in total. Although $L$ binary covariates define $2^{L}$\ninteraction groups, only $2L+1$ tests are performed, and at least $L+1$ of\nthese tests use at least half of the data. The submax-method achieves the\nhighest design sensitivity and the highest Bahadur efficiency of its component\ntests. Moreover, the form of the test is sufficiently tractable that its large\nsample power may be studied analytically. The simulation suggests that the\nsubmax method exhibits superior performance, in comparison with an approach\nusing CART, when there is effect modification of moderate size. Using data from\nthe NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Survey, an observational study of the\neffects of physical activity on survival is used to illustrate the method.

However,\nsharing threat-related information have posed various risks to an organization\nthat pertains to its security, privacy, and competitiveness. Given the\ncoinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have\nadopted an elusive behavior of \"free-riding\" so that they can acquire the\nbenefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far,\nunderstanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective\nof the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this\npaper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\\qoi) for the\nassessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing\nfor threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics,\nincluding correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators. In\norder to realize the notion of \\qoi, we conducted an empirical study and taken\na benchmark approach to define quality metrics, then we obtained a reference\ndataset and utilized tools from the machine learning literature for quality\nassessment.

Using atom-atom potential function method the\nestimations of Watson-Crick base pairs opening energies are made. On the basis\nof this results two possible scenarios of the DNA double helix unzipping\nprocess are proposed. According to the first scenario DNA unzipping takes place\nslowly and as equilibrium process, with small difference between two plateaus\non the unzipping curve. In this case firstly base pairs transit into the\n'pre-opened' metastable state along the 'opening' pathway and then open along\nthe 'stretch' pathway. Our estimations show that an important factor for the\nrealization of this scenario is the existence of double-stranded DNA coil in\nthe unopened part of DNA. The second scenario is characterized by higher\nopening force. In this scenario base pairs open directly along the 'stretch'\npathway as non-equilibrium process. The conditions of the first scenario\nrealization show that it can play a key role in the understanding of the DNA\nunzipping in vivo during transcription and genetic information transfer\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 07:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 12:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

As on-line data may be out-of-date\nand errors in the data may propagate with copying and referring between\nsources, it is hard to achieve satisfying results with merely applying existing\ndata fusion methods to fuse Web data. In this paper, we make use of the crowd\nto achieve high-quality data fusion result. We design a framework selecting a\nset of tasks to ask crowds in order to improve the confidence of data. Since\ndata are correlated and crowds may provide incorrect answers, how to select a\nproper set of tasks to ask the crowd is a very challenging problem. In this\npaper, we design an approximation solution to address this challenge since we\nprove that the problem is at NP-hard. To further improve the efficiency, we\ndesign a pruning strategy and a preprocessing method, which effectively improve\nthe performance of the proposed approximation solution. Furthermore, we find\nthat under certain scenarios, we are not interested in all the facts, but only\na specific set of facts. Thus, for these specific scenarios, we also develop\nanother approximation solution which is much faster than the general\napproximation solution.

The Fermi-LAT observations are associated with\nflares from active regions originating behind both the eastern and western\nlimbs, as determined by STEREO. All three flares are associated with very fast\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) and strong solar energetic particle events. We\npresent updated localizations of the >100 MeV photon emission, hard X-ray\n(HXR)and EUV images, and broadband spectra from 10 keV to 10 GeV, as well as\nmicrowave spectra. We also provide a comparison of the BTL flares detected by\nFermi-LAT with three on-disk flares and present a study of some of the\nsignificant quantities of these flares as an attempt to better understand the\nacceleration mechanisms at work during these occulted flares. We interpret the\nHXR emission to be due to electron bremsstrahlung from a coronal thin-target\nloop top with the accelerated electron spectra steepening at semirelativistic\nenergies. The >100 MeV gamma-rays are best described by a pion-decay model\nresulting from the interaction of protons (and other ions) in a thick-target\nphotospheric source. The protons are believed to have been accelerated (to\nenergies >10 GeV) in the CME environment and precipitate down to the\nphotosphere from the downstream side of the CME shock and landed on the front\nside of the Sun, away from the original flare site and the HXR emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 08:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

Often these analyses require that the position of one\nor more animal landmarks are annotated (marked) in numerous images. The process\nof annotating landmarks can require a significant amount of time and tedious\nlabor, which motivates the need for algorithms that can automatically annotate\nlandmarks. In the community of scientists that use image and video analysis to\nstudy the 3D flight of animals, there has been a trend of developing more\nautomated approaches for annotating landmarks, yet they fall short of being\ngenerally applicable. Inspired by the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on\nmany problems in the field of computer vision, we investigate how suitable DNNs\nare for accurate and automatic annotation of landmarks in video datasets\nrepresentative of those collected by scientists studying animals.\n  Our work shows, through extensive experimentation on videos of hawkmoths,\nthat DNNs are suitable for automatic and accurate landmark localization. In\nparticular, we show that one of our proposed DNNs is more accurate than the\ncurrent best algorithm for automatic localization of landmarks on hawkmoth\nvideos. Moreover, we demonstrate how these annotations can be used to\nquantitatively analyze the 3D flight of a hawkmoth.

Instead, they exploit critical surfaces poised at\ntransitions in their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality in\nnatural systems suggests that there may be general principles inducing this\nbehaviour. However, there is a lack of conceptual models explaining how\nembodied agents propel themselves towards these critical points. In this paper,\nwe present a learning model driving an embodied Boltzmann Machine towards\ncritical behaviour by maximizing the heat capacity of the network.

It is an essential application requirement for\nthe saliency detection task. However, contemporary detection methods often\nutilize some complicated procedures to pursue feeble improvements on the\ndetection precession, which always take hundreds of milliseconds and make them\nnot easy to be applied practically. In this paper, we tackle this problem by\nproposing a fast and compact saliency score regression network which employs\nfully convolutional network, a special deep convolutional neural network, to\nestimate the saliency of objects in images. It is an extremely simplified\nend-to-end deep neural network without any pre-processings and\npost-processings. When given an image, the network can directly predict a dense\nfull-resolution saliency map (image-to-image prediction).

The efficiency of an mRNA can be tuned\nby varying the ribosome binding sites controlling the recruitment of the\nribosomes, or the codon usage establishing the speed of protein elongation. In\nthis work we propose transcript length as a further key determinant of\ntranslation efficiency. Based on a physical model that considers the kinetics\nof ribosomes advancing on the mRNA and diffusing in its surrounding, as well as\nmRNA circularisation and ribosome drop-off, we explain how the transcript\nlength may play a central role in establishing ribosome recruitment and the\noverall translation rate of an mRNA.

It is\nincreasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along\nthe genome -- so-called `epialleles' -- offers greater insight into epigenetic\ndynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm marks individually.\n  Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are\npresent in multiple regions of the same tumour.

Upon impact, Huygens created a 12 cm\ndeep hole in the surface of Titan. It bounced back, out of the hole onto the\nflat surface, after which it commenced a 30-40 cm long slide in the southward\ndirection. The slide ended with the probe out of balance, tilted in the\ndirection of DISR by around 10 degrees. The probe then wobbled back and forth\nfive times in the north-south direction, during which it probably encountered a\n1-2 cm sized pebble. The SSP provides evidence for movement up to 10 s after\nimpact. This scenario puts the following constraints on the physical properties\nof the surface. For the slide over the surface we determine a friction\ncoefficient of 0.4. While this value is not necessarily representative for the\nsurface itself due to the presence of protruding structures on the bottom of\nthe probe, the dynamics appear to be consistent with a surface consistency of\ndamp sand.

Indeed, the\nability to independently engineer both lattice parameter and band gap holds the\npremise to develop enhanced or novel photonic, optoelectronic, and electronic\ndevices. With this perspective, we present detailed investigations of the\ninfluence of Ge1-y-xSixSny layers on the optical properties of Si- and Ge-based\nheterostructures and nanowires. We found that adding a thin Ge1-x-ySixSny\ncapping layer on Si or Ge greatly enhances light absorption especially in the\nnear IR range leading to an increase in short-circuit current density. For the\nGe1-y-xSixSny structure at thicknesses below 30 nm, a 14-fold increase in the\nshort-circuit current is predicted with respect to bare Si. This enhancement\ndecreases by reducing the capping layer thickness. Conversely, decreasing the\nshell thickness was found to improve the short-circuit current in\nSi/Ge1-y-xSixSny and Ge/Ge1-y-xSixSny core/shell nanowires. The optical\nabsorption becomes very important when increasing the Sn content. Moreover, by\nexploiting optical antenna effect, these nanowires show an extreme light\nabsorption reaching an enhancement factor, with respect to Si or Ge nanowires,\non the order of ~104 in Si/Ge0.84Si0.04Sn0.12 and ~12 in Ge/Ge0.84Si0.04Sn0.12\ncore/shell nanowires.

The canted moments, which are induced\nby the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, anti-align for $H_{c1}<H<H_{c2}$ due\nto the anisotropic exchange interaction that favors the antiferromagnetic\narrangement along the $a$-axis.

The Incremental\nQuasi-Newton (IQN) method proposed here belongs to the family of stochastic and\nincremental methods that have a cost per iteration independent of $n$. IQN\niterations are a stochastic version of BFGS iterations that use memory to\nreduce the variance of stochastic approximations. The convergence properties of\nIQN bridge a gap between deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods.\nDeterministic quasi-Newton methods exploit the possibility of approximating the\nNewton step using objective gradient differences. They are appealing because\nthey have a smaller computational cost per iteration relative to Newton's\nmethod and achieve a superlinear convergence rate under customary regularity\nassumptions. Stochastic quasi-Newton methods utilize stochastic gradient\ndifferences in lieu of actual gradient differences. This makes their\ncomputational cost per iteration independent of the number of objective\nfunctions $n$. However, existing stochastic quasi-Newton methods have sublinear\nor linear convergence at best. IQN is the first stochastic quasi-Newton method\nproven to converge superlinearly in a local neighborhood of the optimal\nsolution. IQN differs from state-of-the-art incremental quasi-Newton methods in\nthree aspects: (i) The use of aggregated information of variables, gradients,\nand quasi-Newton Hessian approximation matrices to reduce the noise of gradient\nand Hessian approximations. (ii) The approximation of each individual function\nby its Taylor's expansion in which the linear and quadratic terms are evaluated\nwith respect to the same iterate. (iii) The use of a cyclic scheme to update\nthe functions in lieu of a random selection routine.

Since feature maps have\ndifferent spatial distribution and amplitude dynamic ranges, determining their\ncontributions to overall saliency remains an open problem. Most\nstate-of-the-art models do not take time into account and give feature maps\nconstant weights across the stimulus duration. However, visual exploration is a\nhighly dynamic process shaped by many time-dependent factors.

In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised\nSpam Detection (S3D) framework for spam detection at tweet-level. The proposed\nframework consists of two main modules: spam detection module operating in\nreal-time mode, and model update module operating in batch mode. The spam\ndetection module consists of four light-weight detectors: (i) blacklisted\ndomain detector to label tweets containing blacklisted URLs, (ii)\nnear-duplicate detector to label tweets that are near-duplicates of confidently\npre-labeled tweets, (iii) reliable ham detector to label tweets that are posted\nby trusted users and that do not contain spammy words, and (iv)\nmulti-classifier based detector labels the remaining tweets. The information\nrequired by the detection module are updated in batch mode based on the tweets\nthat are labeled in the previous time window. Experiments on a large scale\ndataset show that the framework adaptively learns patterns of new spam\nactivities and maintain good accuracy for spam detection in a tweet stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 04:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Biosensors capture physiological signals in addition\nto kinesthetic data to draw intimate inferences about individuals' mental\nstates. The proliferation of sensors makes detection, interpretation, and\ninference of these previously subtle - or otherwise invisible - emotional and\nphysiological signals possible from proximate and remote locations. These\nsensors pose unprecedented challenges to individual privacy in public through\nremote, precise, and passively collected data. This paper examines the unique\nnature and inferential potential of biosensed data by creating a taxonomy of\nsignals that may be collected remotely, via casual contact, or from traces left\nbehind, and considers how these data may be collected and used to create novel\nprivacy concerns - particularly in public. Since biosignals may often be\ndeduced from visual data, this paper uses historic and recent photography cases\nto explore how social norms evolved in response to remote collection in public.\nA contextual integrity privacy heuristic is then used to probe the need for new\nnorms and remedies specifically for biosensing privacy threats.
