This iterative,\nmanual process is tedious when attempting to make new discoveries and does not\neasily scale with the number of stations. Addressing this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel approach based on a computer-aided discovery system that\nfacilitates the discovery of such potential transient events. The advantages of\nthis approach are demonstrated by actual detections of transient deformation\nevents at volcanoes selected from the Alaska Volcano Observatory database using\ndata recorded by GPS stations from the Plate Boundary Observatory network. Our\ntechnique successfully reproduces the analysis of a transient signal detected\nin the first half of 2008 at Akutan volcano and is also directly applicable to\n3 additional volcanoes in Alaska, with the new detection of 2 previously\nunnoticed inflation events: in early 2011 at Westdahl and in early 2013 at\nShishaldin. This study also discusses the benefits of our computer-aided\ndiscovery approach for volcanology in general. Advantages include the rapid\nanalysis on multi-scale resolutions of transient deformation events at a large\nnumber of sites of interest and the capability to enhance reusability and\nreproducibility in volcano studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 16:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Hybrid models\ncan abstract away short transient behaviour (thus introducing discontinuities)\nin order to simplify the study of such systems. For example, when modelling a\nbouncing ball, the bounce can be abstracted as a discontinuous change of the\nvelocity, instead of resorting to the physics of the ball (de-)compression to\nkeep the velocity signal continuous. Impulsive differential equations can be\nused to model and simulate hybrid systems such as the bouncing ball. In this\napproach, the force acted on the ball by the floor is abstracted as an\ninfinitely large function in an infinitely small interval of time, that is, an\nimpulse. Current simulators cannot handle such approximations well due to the\nlimitations of machine precision.\n  In this paper, we explore the simulation of impulsive differential equations,\nwhere impulses are first class citizens.

The first is viewpoint\nselection as has been proposed earlier using a greedy search over a\nprobabilistic occupancy grid representation. The second is top-down\nobject-based attention using a histogram backprojection method, also previously\ndescribed. The third is visual saliency. This is novel in the sense that it is\nnot used as a region-of-interest method for the current image but rather as a\nnoncombinatorial form of look-ahead in search for future viewpoint selection.\nAdditionally, the integration of these three attentional schemes within a\nsingle framework is unique and not previously studied.

For this type\nof problems, existing necessary conditions often rely on the notion of\nsubdifferential or become non-trivially weaker than the KKT condition in the\n(twice-)differentiable counterpart problems. In contrast, this paper presents a\nnew set of first- and second-order necessary conditions that are derived\nwithout the use of subdifferential and reduces to exactly the KKT condition\nwhen (twice-)differentiability holds.

Magnetometry, on the one hand, reveals a\npeak in the zero field cooled (ZFC) magnetization curves at low temperatures\n(~25K) but no feature around the N\\'eel temperature at 118K. On the other hand,\npolarized neutron scattering shows the expected behavior of the AF order\nparameter vanishing around 118K. Moreover, hysteresis curves measured at\nvarious temperatures reveal an exchange bias effect indicating a coupling of an\nAF core to a ferromagnetic (FM)-like shell.

We conclude that the\nmagnetic behavior of MnO particles can be explained by a superposition of\nSPM-like thermal fluctuations of the AF-N\\'eel vector inside the AF core and a\nstrong magnetic coupling to a ferrimagnetic Mn$_2$O$_3$ or Mn$_3$O$_4$ shell.\nIn addition, we have studied heterodimer ('Janus') particles, where a FM FePt\nparticle is attached to the AF MnO particle.

If mechanical work is extracted from this ring system, either\nby bringing closer the rings during an attraction or by separating them as the\nresult of a repulsion, the energy of the rings, the only existing source of\nenergy in the system, decreases: $\\frac{1}{2}LI_{a}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}LI_{b}^{2}$\nIf an energy either of attraction or repulsion is communicated to the system,\n(working against the forces) its energy increases, i.e. the currents in the\nrings increase. This happens because the currents existing in the rings are\nfree, i.e. not linked to any device which imposes a current (power supply,\nconstant current). Similarly, the effect of electromagnetic induction can\nincrease or decrease the currents with the corresponding mechanical work linked\nto these developments. Not only does the current in the rings decrease as they\nget closer during the attraction, but it also can be cancelled and, if the\neffect continues, it may even change its direction. An application that already\nexists is the levitation train. It is attracted by the rail and held on it, but\nif it is very close to this due to the weight of the goods a strong repulsion\n(levitation) occurs. Another application would be the accumulation of energy in\nthese rings, where they can spend large amounts of current, not only because of\nits high critical currents but also by the fact that the magnetic flux remains\nconstant, cannot increase. Another advantage in this storage system is its\nreversibility in the exchange of electromagnetic energy and mechanical work. In\nthe energy storage system, the greater the current flowing through the ring,\nthe greater its energy is. In order to attain this, there has been made a study\nof the ideal conditions to store as much energy as possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 18:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

In this setting,\nwe observe that the resource vs. time trade-off enabled by memory elasticity\nbecomes a task queuing time vs task runtime trade-off. Tasks may complete\nfaster when scheduled with less memory because their waiting time is reduced.\nWe show that a scheduler can turn this task-level trade-off into improved job\ncompletion time and cluster-wide memory utilization.

The origin of these flares is\nstill debated, and often associated with a late activity of the central engine.\nWe discuss an alternative scenario where the central engine remains short-lived\nand flares are produced by the propagation of a long-lived reverse shock in a\nstratified ejecta. Here we focus on the hydrodynamics of the shock\ninteractions. We perform one-dimensional ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations with different initial internal structure in the gamma-ray burst\nejecta. We use them to extract bolometric light curves and compare with a\nprevious study based on a simplified ballistic model. We find a good agreement\nbetween both approaches, with similar slopes and variability in the light\ncurves, but identify several weaknesses in the ballistic model: the density is\nunderestimated in the shocked regions, and more importantly, late shock\nreflections are not captured. With accurate dynamics provided by our\nhydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that internal shocks in the ejecta lead to\nthe formation of dense shells. The interaction of the long-lived reverse shock\nwith a dense shell then produces a fast and intense increase of the dissipated\npower. Assuming that the emission is due to the synchrotron radiation from\nshock-accelerated electrons, and that the external forward shock is radiatively\ninefficient, we find that this results in a bright flare in the X-ray\nlightcurve, with arrival times, shapes, and duration in agreement with the\nobserved properties of X-ray flares in GRB afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 19:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 14:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Human face\ndetection plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing\napplications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database\nmanagement, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an\ninconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different\nillumination, poses, and occlusion. These variations can decrease face\ndetection rate noticeably. Most existing face detection approaches are not\naccurate, as they have not been able to resolve unstructured images due to\nlarge appearance variations and can only detect human faces under one\nparticular variation. Existing frameworks of face detection need enhancements\nto detect human faces under the stated variations to improve detection rate and\nreduce detection time. In this study, an enhanced face detection framework is\nproposed to improve detection rate based on skin color and provide a validation\nprocess.

We thus propose with final uncertainty of about 20\nkJ mol$^{-1}$ standard enthalpies of formation of TBP, HDBP, and H$_2$MBP which\namounts to -1281.7$\\pm$24.4, -1229.4$\\pm$19.6 and -1176.7$\\pm$14.8 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$, respectively, in the gas phase. In the liquid phase, the predicted\nvalues are -1367.3$\\pm$24.4, -1348.7$\\pm$19.6 and -1323.8$\\pm$14.8 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$, to which we may add about -22 kJ mol$^{-1}$ error from the COSMO-RS\nsolvent model. From these data, we predict the complete hydrolysis of TBP to be\nnearly thermoneutral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 20:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 08:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 17:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass.

As a group,\nSaturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethys\nitself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer\nneighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a\nmassive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring\nmaterial spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring\nwith an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the\nRoche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,\nincluding tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation\nfactor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons\ninto mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends\noutward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively\nslow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis\ndistribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.\nWe estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary\nimpactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive\na mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and\nRhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content.\nThis suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of\nrock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more\nrock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the\ncurrent inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors\nstochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 21:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

To prevent the majority labels\nfrom dominating the result of MCar, we generalize MCar to a weighted MCar\n(WMCar) that handles label imbalance. Since WMCar outputs a soft labeling\nvector of reduced ambiguity for each instance, we can iteratively refine it by\nfeeding it as the input to WMCar. Nevertheless, such an iterative\nimplementation can be affected by the noisy soft labeling vectors, and thus the\nperformance may degrade.

The most representative\nwork is nuclear norm minimization (NNM), which can recover the matrix rank\nexactly under some restricted and theoretical guarantee conditions. However,\nfor many real applications, NNM is not able to approximate the matrix rank\naccurately, since it often tends to over-shrink the rank components. To rectify\nthe weakness of NNM, recent advances have shown that weighted nuclear norm\nminimization (WNNM) can achieve a better matrix rank approximation than NNM,\nwhich heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular values.\nHowever, it still lacks a sound mathematical explanation on why WNNM is more\nfeasible than NNM. In this paper, we propose a scheme to analyze WNNM and NNM\nfrom the perspective of the group sparse representation. Specifically, we\ndesign an adaptive dictionary to bridge the gap between the group sparse\nrepresentation and the rank minimization models. Based on this scheme, we\nprovide a mathematical derivation to explain why WNNM is more feasible than\nNNM. Moreover, due to the heuristical set of the weight, WNNM sometimes pops\nout error in the operation of SVD, and thus we present an adaptive weight\nsetting scheme to avoid this error.

Thus, in this work, we propose\na deep heterogeneous feature fusion network to exploit the complementary\ninformation present in features generated by different deep convolutional\nneural networks (DCNNs) for template-based face recognition, where a template\nrefers to a set of still face images or video frames from different sources\nwhich introduces more blur, pose, illumination and other variations than\ntraditional face datasets. The proposed approach efficiently fuses the\ndiscriminative information of different deep features by 1) jointly learning\nthe non-linear high-dimensional projection of the deep features and 2)\ngenerating a more discriminative template representation which preserves the\ninherent geometry of the deep features in the feature space.

The measurements exploit\ncoherent population transfer between the $35$s and $35$p Rydberg states of\nhelium atoms in a pulsed supersonic beam.

However, the\nrelationships between AGN activity, radiation, winds, and star-formation are\ncomplex and still far from being understood. We study scaling relations between\nAGN properties, host galaxy properties and AGN winds. We then evaluate the wind\nmean impact on the global star-formation history, taking into account the short\nAGN duty cycle with respect to that of star-formation. We first collect AGN\nwind observations for 94 AGN with detected massive winds at sub-pc to kpc\nspatial scales. We then fold AGN wind scaling relations with AGN luminosity\nfunctions, to evaluate the average AGN wind mass-loading factor as a function\nof cosmic time. We find strong correlations between the AGN molecular and\nionised wind mass outflow rates and the AGN bolometric luminosity. The power\nlaw scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29+/-0.38) than for molecular\nwinds (0.76+/-0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric\nluminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas\nfraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN winds are 3-10 times shorter and\nsmaller than those of main-sequence galaxies with similar SFR, stellar mass and\nredshift. These findings suggest that, at high AGN bolometric luminosity, the\nreduced molecular gas fraction may be due to the destruction of molecules by\nthe wind, leading to a larger fraction of gas in the atomic ionised phase. The\nAGN wind mass-loading factor $\\eta=\\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is systematically higher\nthan that of starburst driven winds. Our analysis shows that AGN winds are, on\naverage, powerful enough to clean galaxies from their molecular gas only in\nmassive systems at z<=2, i.e. a strong form of co-evolution between SMBHs and\ngalaxies appears to break down for the least massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Although the theoretical basis of\nalternative models such as Fokker-Planck diffusion is not less convincing,\nmovement of populations is commonly modelled using the diffusion law due to\nFick. It is an interesting feature of Fokker-Planck diffusion that for\nspatially varying diffusion coefficients the stationary solution is not a\nhomogeneous distribution; in contrast to Fickian diffusion. Instead,\nconcentration accumulates in regions of low diffusivity and tends to lower\nlevels for areas of high diffusivity. Thus, we may interpret the stationary\ndistribution of the Fokker-Planck diffusion as a reflection of different levels\nof habitat quality. Moreover, the most common model for environmental\nfluctuations, linear multiplicative noise, is based on the assumption that\nindividuals respond independently to stochastic environmental fluctuations. For\nlarge population densities the assumption of independence is debatable and the\nmodel further implies that noise intensities can increase to arbitrarily high\nlevels. Therefore, instead of the commonly used linear multiplicative noise\nmodel, we implement environmental variability by an alternative nonlinear noise\nterm which never exceeds a certain maximum noise intensity. With Fokker-Planck\ndiffusion and the nonlinear noise model replacing the classical approaches we\ninvestigate a simple invasive system based on the Lotka-Volterra competition\nmodel. We observe that the heterogeneous stationary distribution generated by\nFokker-Planck diffusion generally facilitates the formation of segregated\nhabitats of resident and invader. However, this segregation can be broken by\nnonlinear noise leading to coexistence of resident and invader across the whole\nspatial domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

Recently, various methods for augmenting neural\nlanguage models with an attention mechanism over a differentiable memory have\nbeen proposed. For predicting the next token, these models query information\nfrom a memory of the recent history which can facilitate learning mid- and\nlong-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms used in\nmemory-augmented neural language models produce a single output vector per time\nstep. This vector is used both for predicting the next token as well as for the\nkey and value of a differentiable memory of a token history. In this paper, we\npropose a neural language model with a key-value attention mechanism that\noutputs separate representations for the key and value of a differentiable\nmemory, as well as for encoding the next-word distribution. This model\noutperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora.\nYet, we found that our method mainly utilizes a memory of the five most recent\noutput representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much\nsimpler model based only on the concatenation of recent output representations\nfrom previous time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented\nneural language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

The effective rates can be\ncomputed, in the case of periodic media, from three-dimensional microscopic\nsimulations of the periodic cell. Several computational and semi-analytical\nmodels have been studied in the field of colloid filtration to describe this\nproblem. They often rely on effective deposition rates defined by simple linear\nreaction ODEs, neglecting the advection-diffusion interplay, and assuming slow\nreactions. Therefore, when these rates are inserted into general macroscopic\ntransport equations, they can lead to conceptual inconsistencies and,\ntherefore, often qualitatively wrong results. In this work, we study the\nupscaling of Brownian deposition on face-centred spherical arrangements using a\nlinear effective reaction rate, defined by volume averaging, and a macroscopic\nadvection-diffusion-reaction equation. The case of partial deposition, defined\nby an attachment probability, is studied and the limit of ideal deposition is\nretrieved as a particular case. We make use of a particularly convenient\ncomputational setup that allows the direct computation of the asymptotic\nstationary value of effective rates. This allows to drastically reduce the\ncomputational domain down to the scale of the single repeating periodic unit:\nthe savings are ever more noticeable in the case of higher Peclet numbers, when\nlarger physical times are needed to reach the asymptotic regime, and thus,\nequivalently, a much larger computational domain and simulation time would be\nneeded in a traditional setup. We show how this new definition of deposition\nrate is more robust and extendable to the whole range of P\\'eclet numbers; it\nalso is consistent with the classical heat and mass transfer literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 10:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

With the advent of high\nprecision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the\nkinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation\nscenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish\nwhether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the\nkinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics\nof distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach\nfor analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos\nstars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars\nfrom the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,\ncovering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the\nprobability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the\nsystematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is\nused to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions\nfrom both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby\nOB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more\ndistant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young\nOB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be\nexplained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may\neither be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the\ngaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that\nare masking the expected warp signal. A larger and deeper sample of stars with\nGaia astrometry will be needed to constrain the dynamical nature of the\nGalactic warp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 11:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

The\nselective characteristic of spectral response in multispectral imaging raises\ntwo challenges to image registration. First, the intensity levels of a local\nregion may be different in individual channel images. Second, the local\nintensity may vary rapidly in some channel images while keeps stationary in\nothers. Conventional multimodal measures, such as mutual information,\ncorrelation coefficient, and correlation ratio, can register images with\ndifferent regional intensity levels, but will fail in the circumstance of\nsevere local intensity variation. In this paper, a new measure, namely\nnormalized total gradient (NTG), is proposed for multispectral image\nregistration. The NTG is applied on the difference between two channel images.\nThis measure is based on the key assumption (observation) that the gradient of\ndifference image between two aligned channel images is sparser than that\nbetween two misaligned ones. A registration framework, which incorporates image\npyramid and global/local optimization, is further introduced for rigid\ntransform.

It is found that once\ncalculating the perturbations in the interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario,\nfor most cases the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales is divergent,\nwhich is a catastrophe for the IDE cosmology. We found a solution to this\nissue, which is to establish an effective theory to treat the dark energy\nperturbations totally based on the basic facts of dark energy. This scheme\ngeneralizes the parametrized post-Friedmann framework of uncoupled dark energy\nand can be used to cure the instability of the IDE cosmology. The whole\nparameter space of IDE models can henceforward be explored by observational\ndata. The IDE scenario can thus be tested or falsified with current and future\nobservational data by using the PPF approach. We expect that the future highly\naccurate observational data would offer the certain answer to the question\nwhether there is a direct coupling between dark energy and dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 11:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 04:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 05:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

For an object facing the front, it may yield various fates, from\ntrapping to rejection, with large implications regarding the solidification\npattern. However, whereas most situations involve multiple particles\ninteracting with each other and the front, attention has focused almost\nexclusively on the interaction of a single, isolated object with the front.\nHere we address experimentally the interaction of multiple particles with a\nsolidification front by performing solidification experiments of a monodisperse\nparticle suspension in a Hele-Shaw cell, with precise control of growth\nconditions and real-time visualization. We evidence the growth of a particle\nlayer ahead of the front at a close-packing volume fraction and we document its\nsteady state value at various solidification velocities. We then extend single\nparticle models to the situation of multiple particles by taking into account\nthe additional force induced on an entering particle by viscous friction in the\ncompacted particle layer. By a force balance model, this provides an indirect\nmeasure of the repelling mean thermomolecular pressure over a particle entering\nthe front. The presence of multiple particles is found to increase it following\na reduction of the thickness of the thin liquid film that separates particles\nand front.

These time discretizations preserve the\nmonotonicity properties satisfied by the spatial discretization when coupled\nwith the first order forward Euler, under a certain time-step restriction.\nWhile the allowable time-step depends on both the spatial and temporal\ndiscretizations, the contribution of the temporal discretization can be\nisolated by taking the ratio of the allowable time-step of the high order\nmethod to the forward Euler time-step. This ratio is called the strong\nstability coefficient. The search for high order strong stability time-stepping\nmethods with high order and large allowable time-step had been an active area\nof research. It is known that implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods exist only up to\nsixth order. However, if we restrict ourselves to solving only linear\nautonomous problems, the order conditions simplify and we can find implicit SSP\nRunge-Kutta methods of any linear order. In the current work we aim to find\nvery high linear order implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods that are optimal in\nterms of allowable time-step.

In\naddition to the conventional type-I fermions with a tilted Weyl cone and\ntype-II fermions with an overtilted Weyl cone for $g^{00}>0$ and respectively\n$g_{00}>0$ or $g_{00}<0$, we find additional \"type-III\" and \"type-IV\" Weyl\nfermions with instabilities (complex frequencies) for $g^{00}<0$ and $g_{00}>0$\nor $g_{00}<0$, respectively. While the type-I and type-II Weyl points allow us\nto simulate the black hole event horizon at an interface where $g^{00}$ changes\nsign, the type-III Weyl point leads to effective spacetimes with closed\ntimelike curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 14:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 17:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 17:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

Here we demonstrate that saccadic models are a flexible\nframework that can be tailored to emulate observer's viewing tendencies. More\nspecifically, we use the eye data from 101 observers split in 5 age groups\n(adults, 8-10 y.o., 6-8 y.o., 4-6 y.o. and 2 y.o.) to train our saccadic model\nfor different stages of the development of the human visual system.

Our age-dependent saccadic model not only outputs human-like,\nage-specific visual scanpath, but also significantly outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art saliency models.

The Solution is to use large external memory. Still, it\nposes many challenges like, how to train neural networks for discrete memory\nrepresentation, how to describe long term dependencies in sequential data etc.\nMost prominent neural architectures for such tasks are Memory networks:\ninference components combined with long term memory and Neural Turing Machines:\nneural networks using external memory resources. Also, additional techniques\nlike attention mechanism, end to end gradient descent on discrete memory\nrepresentation are needed to support these solutions. Preliminary results of\nabove neural architectures on simple algorithms (sorting, copying) and Question\nAnswering (based on story, dialogs) application are comparable with the state\nof the art. In this paper, I explain these architectures (in general), the\nadditional techniques used and the results of their application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 17:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 09:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

It is thus important to characterize and model the\ninfluence of common shadowing objects like cars properly when designing these\nVANETs. Despite the fact that for multilink systems it is essential to model\nthe joint effects on the different links, the multilink shadowing effects of\nV2V channels on VANET simulations are not yet well understood. In this paper we\npresent a measurement based analysis of multilink shadowing effects in a V2V\ncommunication system with cars as blocking objects. In particular we analyze,\ncharacterize and model the large scale fading, both regarding the\nautocorrelation and the joint multilink cross-correlation process, for\ncommunication at 5.9 GHz between four cars in a highway convoy scenario. The\nresults show that it is essential to separate the instantaneous propagation\ncondition into line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed LOS (OLOS), by other cars,\nand then apply an appropriate pathloss model for each of the two cases. The\nchoice of the pathloss model not only influences the autocorrelation but also\nchanges the cross-correlation of the large scale fading process between\ndifferent links. By this, we conclude that it is important that VANET\nsimulators should use geometry based models, that distinguish between LOS and\nOLOS communication. Otherwise, the VANET simulators need to consider the\ncross-correlation between different communication links to achieve results\nclose to reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 16:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}
