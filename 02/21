Its physical interpretation, however, is unclear, although\nit has been used as a metric for the sensing performance of the downstream\nsubsystem. In this paper, we explore the behaviour of the learning rate for a\nnumber of simple model systems, establishing when and how its behaviour is\ndistinct from the instantaneous mutual information between subsystems. In the\nsimplest case, the two are almost equivalent. In more complex steady-state\nsystems, the mutual information and the learning rate behave qualitatively\ndistinctly, with the learning rate clearly now reflecting the rate at which the\ndownstream system must update its information in response to changes in the\nupstream system. It is not clear whether this quantity is the most natural\nmeasure for sensor performance, and, indeed, we provide an example in which\noptimising the learning rate over a region of parameter space of the downstream\nsystem yields an apparently sub-optimal sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 14:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

However, such\nexperiments manipulating gravity would require to compactly store large amounts\nof energy while using ultra-sensitive detection techniques and hence can be\nexpected to be very difficult to realise. In this paper, we first propose new\ndesigns of electromagnetic (EM) generators allowing directional emission of\nGWs. They are based on the resonant amplification of GWs occuring when EM\nstanding waves couple to an external static magnetic field. The interplay\nbetween the EM polarizations, the orientation of the boosting magnetic field\nand the emitted GW polarizations is studied, as well as the gravitational\nradiation patterns of the different generators.

Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential\nproblems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student\nnetwork learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the\ntask-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a\npromising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision\nfrom large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time\nfor training. In this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning\nframework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without\nthe need for expert supervision.

The key property of this environment\nis a rapid decline of density and pressure along the jet, which promotes its\nrapid expansion. Such an expansion can suppress global instabilities, which\nrequire communication across the jet, and hence ensure its survival over huge\ndistances.

It is\nbased on the inflection points in the elastic-scattering intensity at the\nenergy-resolution value corresponding to the overall system relaxation-time. A\nConstant wavelength (CW) option, more suitable for reactor sources, and the\ntime-of-flight (TOF) option, more suitable for spallation sources, have already\nbeen proposed, and here we examine the concept of a third option based on\nneutron spin-echo (NSE), called ESS-NSE. In principle, this consists of simply\nmeasuring depolarisation at the relatively-intense elastic echo-condition, as a\nfunction of resolution, with the basic set-up being similar to standard\nspin-echo. In its basic set-up, ESS spin-echo can access 5 orders of magnitude\nin time from nanoseconds to tens of picoseconds, reaching slower relaxation\nprocesses than the CW and TOF options recently presented. However, spatial\nfocussing is important for the small sample-sizes of biological systems, so we\nalso explore how the fields may be shaped to enable a small neutron beam to be\nfocussed on the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 17:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

To resolve these structurally dominated\nprocesses, there is a need to develop discretization strategies that also limit\ncomputational effort. In this paper we present an upscaling methodology for\ngeothermal heat transport with fractures represented explicitly in the\ncomputational grid. The heat transport is modeled by an advection-conduction\nequation for the temperature, and solved on a highly irregular coarse grid that\npreserves the fracture heterogeneity. The upscaling is based on different\nstrategies for the advective term and the conductive term, respectively. The\ncoarse scale advective term is constructed from sums of fine scale fluxes,\nwhereas the coarse scale conductive term is constructed based on numerically\ncomputed basis functions. The method naturally incorporates a coupling between\nthe matrix and the fractures via the discretization, so that explicit transfer\nterms that couple solution variables in the fractures and the matrix are\navoided. Numerical results show that the upscaling methodology performs well,\nin particular for large upscaling ratios, and that it is applicable also to\nhighly complex fracture networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 17:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Spatial-frequency\nmultiplexing interferometry with several spatial-carriers having\nnon-overlapping spatial-spectra is also well known and productive in optical\nmetrology. In this paper we propose temporal-multiplexing phase-shifting\ninterferometry applied to profilometry. That is, instead of having\nfringe-patterns with well separated spatial-spectra, we propose instead to\nseparate the fringe information in the temporal-spectra. In other words, we may\nhave overlapping spatial-spectra, but separated in the temporal-spectra by\nfrequency multiplexing. Using 1-camera and several fringe-projectors one\nminimizes the object shadows and specular reflections from the digitizing\nsolid. Temporal multiplexing profilometry allows us to illuminate the object\nfrom several projectors turned-on simultaneously. In previous phase-shifting\nco-phased profilometry, the projectors were turned-on and off sequentially. As\nseen in this work temporal-multiplexing allow us to demodulate the several\nfringe-patterns without crosstalk from other simultaneously projected fringes.\nThis is entirely analogous to having several television stations broadcasting\nsimultaneously, each TV-transmitter having its own broadcasting frequency. A\ngiven TV-receiver tunes into a single TV-station and filter-out all other\nbroadcasters. Following this analogy, each fringe-projector must have its own\ntemporal broadcasting frequency to remain well separated from all other\nprojectors in the time-spectra domain. In addition to the general theory\npresented, we assess its feasibility with experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 18:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Recent space observations suggest that the reconnection rate can be\nhigher than the Hall-reconnection rate and turbulent dissipation is required.\nIn this paper, using particle-in-cell simulations, we present a case study of\nhow AR produced by Buneman instability accelerates magnetic reconnection. We\nfirst show that the AR/drag produced by Buneman instability in a thin electron\ncurrent layer 1) can dissipate magnetic energy stored in the current layer\nthrough dissipation of the kinetic energy of electron beams; 2) The\ninhomogeneous drag caused by wave couplings spontaneously breaks the magnetic\nfield lines and causes impulsive fast non-Hall magnetic reconnection on\nelectron-scales with a mean rate reaching 0.6 $V_A$. We then show that a\nBuneman instability driven by intense electron beams around the x-point in a 3D\nmagnetic reconnection significantly enhances the dissipation of the magnetic\nenergy. Electron-scale magnetic reconnections driven by the inhomogeneous drag\naround the x-line enhances the reconnection electric field and the in-plane\nperpendicular magnetic field. About 40\\% of the released magnetic energy is\nconverted into the electron thermal energy by AR while 50\\% is converted into\nthe kinetic energy of the electron beams through the acceleration by the\nreconnection electric field. The enhanced magnetic energy dissipation is\nbalanced by a net Poynting flux in-flow. About 10\\% of the released magnetic\nenergy is brought out by an enhanced Poynting flux out-flow. These results\nsuggest that AR with sufficient intensity and electron-scale inhomogeneity can\nsignificantly accelerate magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 18:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Direct measurement of the time variations of these\nparameters is very difficult or impossible to achieve. By contrast,\nmeasurements of fundamental constants are relatively easy to achieve, both in\nthe laboratory and by astronomical spectra of atoms and molecules in the early\nuniverse. In this work measurements of the proton to electron mass ratio $\\mu$\nand the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ are combined to place mildly model\ndependent limits on the fractional variation of the Quantum Chromodynamic Scale\nand the sum of the fractional variations of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value\nand the Yukawa couplings on time scales of more than half the age of the\nuniverse. The addition of another model parameter allows the fractional\nvariation of the Higgs VEV and the Yukawa couplings to be computed separately.\nLimits on their variation are found at the level of less than $5 \\times\n10^{-5}$ over the past seven gigayears. A model dependent relation between the\nexpected fractional variation of $\\alpha$ relative to $\\mu$ tightens the limits\nto $10^{-7}$ over the same time span. Limits on the present day rate of change\nof the constants and parameters are then calculated using slow roll\nquintessence. A primary result of this work is that studies of the\ndimensionless fundamental constants such as $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$, whose values\ndepend on the values of the physics parameters, are excellent monitors of the\nlimits on the time variation of these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The protocol involves two operations: (i) free evolution of\nthe probe; and (ii) a swap gate between one spin in the probe and the thermal\nqubit we wish to cool. We show that if the initial state of the probe falls\nwithin a suitable range, and the free evolution of the probe is both unital and\nconserves the excitation in the $z$-direction, then the cooling protocol will\nalways succeed, with an efficiency that depends on the rate of spin dephasing\nand the swap gate fidelity. Furthermore, measuring the probe after it has\ncooled many qubits provides an estimate of their temperature. We provide a\nspecific example where the probe is a Heisenberg spin chain, and suggest a\nphysical implementation using electronic spins in diamond. Here the probe is\nconstituted of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, while the thermal qubits are dark\nspins. By using a novel pulse sequence, a chain of NV centers can be made to\nevolve according to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. This proposal allows for a range\nof applications, such as NV-based nuclear magnetic resonance of photosensitive\nmolecules kept in a dark spot on a sample, and it opens up possibilities for\nthe study of quantum thermodynamics, environment-assisted sensing, and\nmany-body physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 19:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 11:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 16:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Carbon projectiles of kinetic energies\nbetween 175 eV and 2.8 keV are shot across liquid water. Apart from\ntranslational, rotational and vibrational excitation, they produce water\ndissociation. The most abundant products are H and OH fragments. We find that\nthe maximum spatial production of radiolysis products, not only occurs at low\nvelocities, but also well below the maximum of energy deposition, reaching one\nH every 5 Ang at the lowest speed studied (1 Bohr/fs), dissociative collisions\nbeing more significant at low velocity while the amount of energy required to\ndissociate water is constant and much smaller than the projectile's energy. A\nsubstantial fraction of the energy transferred to fragments, especially for\nhigh velocity projectiles, is in the form of kinetic energy, such fragments\nbecoming secondary projectiles themselves. High velocity projectiles give rise\nto well-defined binary collisions, which should be amenable to binary\napproximations. This is not the case for lower velocities, where multiple\ncollision events are observed. H secondary projectiles tend to move as radicals\nat high velocity, as cations when slower. We observe the generation of new\nspecies such as hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. The former occurs when an O\nradical created in the collision process attacks a water molecule at the O\nsite. The latter when the C projectile is completely stopped and reacts with\ntwo water molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 20:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

Efficiency of these protocols is measured by how many forced checkpoints\nare needed to ensure no checkpoint will be useless to the application; the\nfewer forced checkpoints the better. For many years, HMNR, also called Fully\nInformed (FI), was the most complex and efficient protocol of this family. The\nLazy-FI protocol applies a lazy strategy that defers the increase of logical\nclocks, resulting in a protocol with better efficiency for distributed systems\nwhere processes can take basic checkpoints at different rates. Recently, the\nFully Informed aNd Efficient (FINE) protocol was proposed using the same\ncontrol structures as FI, but with a stronger and, presumably better,\ncheckpoint-inducing condition.

This paper reviews this family of protocols, proves a theorem on a\ncondition that must be enforced by all stronger versions of FI, and proves that\nboth FINE and Lazy-FINE do not guarantee the absence of useless checkpoints.

Reconnection drives a\nrotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction\nand propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The\nconsequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width\nband upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles\n($\\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations\nto support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while\nallowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection\nsuppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\\beta$ (the plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks\nbecause the heliosheath $\\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.\nLarge-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the\nflanks. Simulation data suggest that $B_{ISM}$ will return to its pristine\nvalue $10-15~AU$ past the HP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 21:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

The theory of debiased estimators\ncan be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed\nquantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on\nthe quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more\nstable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires\nestimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown\ndensity of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the\nuniform testing problem.

Most approaches use a fixed size sliding window over\nconsecutive samples to extract features---either handcrafted or learned\nfeatures---and predict a single label for all samples in the window. Two key\nproblems emanate from this approach: i) the samples in one window may not\nalways share the same label. Consequently, using one label for all samples\nwithin a window inevitably lead to loss of information; ii) the testing phase\nis constrained by the window size selected during training while the best\nwindow size is difficult to tune in practice.

Subsequent to taking a first year physics course, female\nstudents were more likely to take further courses in life science subjects,\nwhile male students were more likely to take physical science subjects. In\nfirst year courses, gender differences were not present among highly\nacademically prepared students, for whom school type (single-sex or\ncoeducational) was a better predictor of course outcome.

Most of the solution techniques in SO\nestimate gradients from the noise corrupted observations of the objective and\nadjust parameters of the objective along the direction of the estimated\ngradients to obtain locally optimal solutions. Two prominent algorithms in SO\nnamely Random Direction Kiefer-Wolfowitz (RDKW) and Simultaneous Perturbation\nStochastic Approximation (SPSA) obtain noisy gradient estimate by randomly\nperturbing all the parameters simultaneously. This forces the search direction\nto be random in these algorithms and causes them to suffer additional noise on\ntop of the noise incurred from the samples of the objective. Owing to this\nadditional noise, the idea of using deterministic perturbations instead of\nrandom perturbations for gradient estimation has also been studied. Two\nspecific constructions of the deterministic perturbation sequence using\nlexicographical ordering and Hadamard matrices have been explored and\nencouraging results have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the class of deterministic perturbation sequences that can be\nutilized in the RDKW algorithm. This class expands the set of known\ndeterministic perturbation sequences available in the literature. Using our\ncharacterization we propose a construction of a deterministic perturbation\nsequence that has the least possible cycle length among all deterministic\nperturbations.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel motion averaging\nalgorithm for multi-view registration. Firstly, it utilizes the pair-wise\nregistration algorithm to estimate the relative motion and overlapping\npercentage of each scan pair with a certain degree of overlap. With the\noverlapping percentage available, it views the overlapping percentage as the\ncorresponding weight of each scan pair and proposes the weight motion averaging\nalgorithm, which can pay more attention to reliable and accurate relative\nmotions. By treating each relative motion distinctively, more accurate\nregistration can be achieved by applying the weighted motion averaging to\nmulti-view range scans.

Specifically, we\naugment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained\nto classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple\nadversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and\nsaliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical test flags sample\nsets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and\n100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial\nexamples as outliers with high accuracy (> 80%) or increases the adversary's\ncost - the perturbation added - by more than 150%. In this way, we show that\nstatistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 07:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 11:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

The proposed four-parameter affine motion model can not\nonly handle most of the complex motions in natural videos but also save the\nbits for two parameters. Second, to efficiently encode the affine motion\nparameters, we propose two motion prediction modes, i.e., advanced affine\nmotion vector prediction combined with a gradient-based fast affine motion\nestimation algorithm and affine model merge, where the latter attempts to reuse\nthe affine motion parameters (instead of the motion vectors) of neighboring\nblocks. Third, we propose two fast affine motion compensation algorithms. One\nis the one-step sub-pixel interpolation, which reduces the computations of each\ninterpolation.

We show that this difference, which we call the \"perception gap\", relates\nto a number of health outcomes observed at the county level. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that image recognition is being used to study\nthe \"misalignment\" of how people describe food images vs. what they actually\ndepict.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 10:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized to be\npromising for specifying such tasks in a relatively simple manner. However, the\nstrong dependency between the learning method and the task to learn is a\nwell-known problem that restricts practical implementations of RL in robotics,\noften requiring major modifications of parameters and adding other techniques\nfor each particular task. In this paper we present a practical core\nimplementation of RL which enables the learning process for multiple robotic\ntasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods,\nthis implementation includes a novel approach for action selection, called\nQ-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), which avoids poor performance of the\nlearning process when the robot reaches new unexplored states. Our approach\ntakes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical\nvariables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, X,Y,{\\theta} pose, etc.),\nthus experienced sets of states may favor the decision-making process of\nunexplored or rarely-explored states. This improvement has a relevant role in\nreducing the tuning of the algorithm for particular tasks. Experiments with\nreal and simulated robots, performed with the software framework also\nintroduced here, show that our implementation is effectively able to learn\ndifferent robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. Results also\nsuggest that the combination of true online SARSA({\\lambda}) with QBIASSR can\noutperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 11:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Such parallel performance is\nbecoming a critical requirement for methods to reconstruct the tracks of\ncharged particles at the Large Hadron Collider and, in the future, at the High\nLuminosity LHC. This is because the steady increase in luminosity is causing an\nexponential growth in the overall event reconstruction time, and tracking is by\nfar the most demanding task for both online and offline processing. Many past\nand present collider experiments adopted Kalman filter-based algorithms for\ntracking because of their robustness and their excellent physics performance,\nespecially for solid state detectors where material interactions play a\nsignificant role. We report on the progress of our studies towards a Kalman\nfilter track reconstruction algorithm with optimal performance on manycore\narchitectures. The combinatorial structure of these algorithms is not\nimmediately compatible with an efficient SIMD (or SIMT) implementation; the\nchallenge for us is to recast the existing software so it can readily generate\nhundreds of shared-memory threads that exploit the underlying instruction set\nof modern processors. We show how the data and associated tasks can be\norganized in a way that is conducive to both multithreading and vectorization.\nWe demonstrate very good performance on Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi architectures,\nas well as promising first results on Nvidia GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 12:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

In particular, the hardness of the X-ray continuum is found\nto depend on luminosity. In a few sources, the correlation between the energy\nof the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and the luminosity is\nclear. Different types (signs) of the correlation are believed to reflect\ndifferent accretion modes. We analyse two NuSTAR observations of the transient\naccreting pulsar Cep X-4 during its 2014 outburst. Our analysis is focused on a\ndetailed investigation of the dependence of the CRSF energy and of the spectral\nhardness on X-ray luminosity, especially on short timescales. To investigate\nthe spectral changes as a function of luminosity within each of the two\nobservations, we used the intrinsic variability of the source on the timescale\nof individual pulse cycles (tens of seconds), the so-called pulse-to-pulse\nvariability. We find that the NuSTAR spectrum of Cep X-4 contains two CRSFs:\nthe fundamental line at ~30 keV and its harmonic at ~55 keV. We find for the\nfirst time that the energy of the fundamental CRSF increases and the continuum\nbecomes harder with increasing X-ray luminosity not only between the two\nobservations, that is, on the long timescale, but also within an individual\nobservation, on the timescale of a few tens of seconds. We investigate these\ndependencies in detail including their non-linearity. We discuss a possible\nphysical interpretation of the observed behaviour in the frame of a simple\none-dimensional model of the polar emitting region with a collisionless shock\nformed in the infalling plasma near the neutron star surface. With this model,\nwe are able to reproduce the observed variations of the continuum hardness\nratio and of the CRSF energy with luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 12:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Furthermore, the use of the\nfull angle-dependent virial coefficients in the Onsager-Parsons-Lee formalism\nincreases its numerical efficiency by several orders of magnitude over that of\nthese previous methods. The comparison of our results with numerical\nsimulations however reveals some shortcomings of the Parsons-Lee approximation\nfor systems of strongly non-convex particles, notwithstanding the accurate\ninclusion of their full effective molecular volume. Further potential\nlimitations of our theory in terms of phase symmetry assumptions are also\nexamined, and prospective directions for future improvements discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 12:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 10:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 23:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

A comparison with MiniBooNE and T2K data is presented.\n[Conclusions] In the 1p1h channel, the effects of the MECs tend to cancel each\nother, resulting in a small effect on the double differential cross section.\n$2N$ knockout processes provide a small contribution to the inclusive double\ndifferential cross section, ranging from the $2N$ knockout threshold into the\ndip region. A fair agreement with the MiniBooNE and T2K data is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 14:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

One key challenge in CIP is\nthe ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical\ninfrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this\nwork, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of\nresource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A\ncontrol center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to\ninfrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC\nand infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in\nreturn. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and\nmotivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources\nfor its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels\nand criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each\ninfrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain\nmore resources. A novel mechanism is developed to handle such an asymmetric\ninformation while providing the optimal contract that motivates each\ninfrastructure to reveal its actual type. The necessary and sufficient\nconditions for such resource allocation contracts under asymmetric information\nare derived. Simulation results show that the proposed contract-theoretic\napproach maximizes the CC's utility while ensuring that no infrastructure has\nan incentive to ask for another contract, despite the lack of exact information\nat the CC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

In this paper, we give an analytical proof that in this\ncase considering POVMs does indeed not give any additional power with respect\nto projective measurements. To do so, we first make without loss of generality\nsome assumptions about the structure of an optimal POVM. The justification of\nthese assumptions involves arguments based on convexity, rank and symmetry\nproperties. We show then that any pure states perfectly excluded by such a POVM\nmeet the conditions identified in arXiv:quant-ph/0206110 for perfect exclusion\nby a projective measurement of three pure states in three dimensions. We also\ndiscuss possible generalizations of our work, including an application of\nQuadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming that might be of special\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2017 02:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 21:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

This facility is based on the 'modular\nfree energy' approach in which the phase-field equations are implemented in a\ngeneral form that is logically separated from model-specific data such as the\nthermodynamic free energy density and mobility functions. Free energy terms\ncontributing to a phase-field model are abstracted into self-contained objects\nthat can be dynamically combined at simulation run time. Combining multiple\nchemical and mechanical free energy contributions expedites the construction of\ncoupled phase-field, mechanics, and multiphase models. This approach allows\ncomputational material scientists to focus on implementing new material models,\nand to reuse existing solution algorithms and data processing routines. A key\nnew aspect of the rapid phase-field development approach that we discuss in\ndetail is the automatic symbolic differentiation capability. Automatic symbolic\ndifferentiation is used to compute derivatives of the free energy density\nfunctionals, and removes potential sources of human error while guaranteeing\nthat the nonlinear system Jacobians are accurately approximated. Through\njust-in-time compilation, we greatly reduce the computational expense of\nevaluating the differentiated expressions.

The paper first shows how to express the\nmost general explicit function passing through a single point in three distinct\nways: linear, additive, and rational. Then, functions with constraints on\nsingle, two, or multiple points are introduced as well as those satisfying\nrelative constraints. This capability allows to obtain general expressions to\nsolve linear differential equations with no need to satisfy constraints (the\n\"subject to:\" conditions) as the constraints are already embedded in the\nconstrained expression. In particular, for expressions passing through a set of\npoints, a generalization of the Waring's interpolation form, is introduced. The\ngeneral form of additive constrained expressions is introduced as well as a\nprocedure to derive its coefficient functions, requiring the inversion of a\nmatrix with dimensions as the number of constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 17:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

The novel CF-ROM framework consists of two steps: (i) In the\nfirst step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of the nonlinear PDE to\nconstruct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is low-dimensional, but is not\nclosed (because of the nonlinearity in the given PDE). (ii) In the second step,\nwe use a calibration procedure to close the filtered ROM, i.e., to model the\ninteraction between the resolved and unresolved modes. To this end, we use a\nlinear or quadratic ansatz to model this interaction and close the filtered\nROM. To find the new coefficients in the closed filtered ROM, we solve an\noptimization problem that minimizes the difference between the full order model\ndata and our ansatz. Although we use a fluid dynamics setting to illustrate how\nto construct and use the CF-ROM framework, we emphasize that it is built on\ngeneral ideas of spatial filtering and optimization and is independent of\n(restrictive) phenomenological arguments. Thus, the CF-ROM framework can be\napplied to a wide variety of PDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 21:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

In this article, we\nsolve it and show that Rubel's statement holds for polynomial ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), and since polynomial ODEs have a unique solution\ngiven an initial data, this positively answers Rubel's open problem.
