We generalize that result by showing that the same conclusion\nholds for non-uniform versions of Bowen's hypotheses in which constant\nparameters are replaced by any increasing unbounded functions f(n) and g(n)\nwith sublogarithmic growth (in n). We prove results for two weakenings of\nspecification; the first is non-uniform specification, based on a definition of\nMarcus in ([14]), and the second is a significantly weaker property which we\ncall non-uniform transitivity. We prove uniqueness of the equilibrium state in\nthe former case under the assumption that liminf (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0, and in\nthe latter case when lim (f(n) + g(n))/ln n = 0. In the former case, we also\nprove that the unique equilibrium state has the K-property. It is known that\nwhen f(n)/ln n or g(n)/ln n is bounded from below, equilibrium states may not\nbe unique, and so this work shows that logarithmic growth is in fact the\noptimal transition point below which uniqueness is guaranteed. Finally, we\npresent some examples for which our results yield the first known proof of\nuniqueness of equilibrium state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 16:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 17:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

For WASP-13, observations have shown that\nthe apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the\nintervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying\nat a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the\nlogR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the\ntypical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter.

Further\ncalculations of the isotensor axial polarizability, in particular near and at\nthe physical values of the light-quark masses, are required for precise\ndeterminations of both two-neutrino and neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay rates\nin heavy nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 18:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Based on these complementary magnetic field diagnostic\nresults we suggest that the dissimilar radio and X-ray variability of GJ65A and\nB is linked to their different global magnetic field topologies. However, this\ndifference appears to be restricted to the upper atmospheric layers but does\nnot encompass the bulk of the stars and has no influence on the fundamental\nstellar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

Here, we consider a\nprobabilistic approach for modeling un-resolved scales using the Multiscale\nFinite Element Method (cf., [1, 2]). By representing dominant modes using the\nGeneralized Multiscale Finite Element, we propose a Bayesian framework, which\nprovides multiple inexpensive (computable) solutions for a deterministic\nproblem.

As winds\nextract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be\ntransported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, the observational\nevidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We present\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the young star MWC349A in the\nH26$\\alpha$ and H30$\\alpha$ recombination lines. The high signal-to-noise\nratios made possible by the maser emission process allow us to constrain the\nrelative astrometry of the maser spots to a milli-arcsecond precision. Previous\nobservations of the H30$\\alpha$ line with the SMA and the Plateau de Bure\ninterferometer (PdBI) showed that masers are distributed in the disk and wind.\nOur new high resolution observations of the H26$\\alpha$ line reveal differences\nin spatial distribution from that of the H30$\\alpha$ line. H26$\\alpha$ line\nmasers in the disk are excited in a thin annulus with a radius of about 25 AU,\nwhile the H30$\\alpha$ line masers are formed in a slightly larger annulus with\na radius of 30 AU. This is consistent with expectations for maser excitation in\nthe presence of an electron density variation of approximately $R^{-4}$. In\naddition, the H30$\\alpha$ and H26$\\alpha$ line masers arise from different\nparts in the wind. This difference is also expected from the maser theory. The\nwind component of both masers exhibits line-of-sight velocities that closely\nfollow a Keplerian law.

The ejecta of neutron\nstar mergers are expected to produce such electromagnetic transients, called\nmacronovae. Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients and\nthe presence of heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges\nto the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For\nexample, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising\nfrom near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements. Here we investigate the use\nof fine-structure, line-smeared opacities that preserve the integral of the\nopacity over frequency, which is an alternative approach to the\nexpansion-opacity formalism. The use of area-preserving line profiles produces\nfrequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater\nthan those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev\napproximation. Opacities are calculated for four $r$-process elements (cerium,\nneodymium, samarium and uranium) using fully and semi-relativistic methods, as\nwell as different amounts of configuration interaction in the atomic structure,\nin order to test the sensitivity of the emission to the underlying atomic\nphysics. We determine the effect of these new opacities on simulated spectra\nand broad-band light curves by applying a multi-dimensional ray-trace method to\nthe ejecta predicted from 3-dimensional merger calculations. With our\nsubstantially larger opacities the simulations yield slightly lower\nluminosities that peak in the mid-IR.

Because of the disparate\nspatial scales involved, direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the\nsolar wind represent an arduous task, especially if one wants to go beyond the\nincompressible approximation. Indeed, most simulations neglect solar wind\nexpansion effects entirely. Here we develop a numerical model to simulate\nturbulent fluctuations from the outer corona to 1 AU and beyond, including the\nsub-Alfv\\'enic corona. The accelerating expanding box (AEB) extends the\nvalidity of previous expanding box models by taking into account both the\nacceleration of the solar wind and the inhomogeneity of background density and\nmagnetic field. Our method incorporates a background accelerating wind within a\nmagnetic field that naturally follows the Parker spiral evolution using a\ntwo-scale analysis in which the macroscopic spatial effect coupling\nfluctuations with background gradients becomes a time-dependent coupling term\nin a homogeneous box. In this paper we describe the AEB model in detail and\ndiscuss its main properties, illustrating its validity by studying Alfv\\'en\nwave propagation across the Alfv\\'en critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 23:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 16:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

If the discriminant group never stabilizes\nas the diameter of the clopen set $U$ tends to zero, then we say that the\naction is unstable, and the weak solenoid which defines it is said to be wild.\nIn this work, we show two main results in the course of our study of the\nproperties of the discriminant group for Cantor actions. First, the tail\nequivalence class of the sequence of discriminant groups obtained for the\nrestricted action on a neighborhood basis system of a point in $X$ defines an\ninvariant of the return equivalence class of the action, called the asymptotic\ndiscriminant, which is consequently an invariant of the homeomorphism class of\nthe weak solenoid. Second, we construct uncountable collections of wild\nsolenoids with pairwise distinct asymptotic discriminant invariants for a fixed\nbase manifold $M$, and hence fixed finitely-presented group $G$, which are thus\npairwise non-homeomorphic. The study in this work is the continuation of the\nseminal works on homeomorphisms of weak solenoids by Rogers and Tollefson in\n1971, and is dedicated to the memory of Jim Rogers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

Because of highly anisotropic transmission of the massless\nDirac fermions at n-p junction boundaries (the so-called Klein tunneling in\ngraphene), charge carries incident at large oblique angles will be reflected\nfrom one edge of the junction with high probability and continue to bounce from\nthe opposite edge. Consequently, these electrons are trapped for a finite time\nto form quasi-bound states in the quasi-1D npn junction.

Unlike existing methods which\nare struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve\nthis issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three\ninterdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and\nre-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each\nlayer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the\nfirst group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are\nquantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group\nare responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus\nthey are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations\nare repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all\nthe weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental\nnetwork quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments\non the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN\narchitectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the\nefficacy of the proposed method.

To address the challenge of large-scale\nprocessing, multiprocessor (MP) versions of AMP have been developed. We provide\nan overview of two such MP-AMP variants. In row-MP-AMP, each computing node\nstores a subset of the rows of the matrix and processes corresponding\nmeasurements. In column- MP-AMP, each node stores a subset of columns, and is\nsolely responsible for reconstructing a portion of the signal. We will discuss\npros and cons of both approaches, summarize recent research results for each,\nand explain when each one may be a viable approach.

The refractory nature of TiN could enable\npractical plasmonic devices operating at elevated temperatures for energy\nconversion and harsh-environment industries such as gas and oil.

Many\neffects of dark sector models are most prominent at very large scales and will\nrely on future galaxy surveys to elucidate. In this paper we compare the\ntopological properties of the large scale dark matter distribution in a number\nof cosmological models using hydrodynamical simulations and the cosmological\ngenus statistic. Genus curves are computed from z = 11 to z = 0 for\n{\\Lambda}CDM, Quintessence and Warm Dark Matter models, over a scale range of 1\nto 20 Mpc/h. The curves are analysed in terms of their Hermite spectra to\ndescribe the power contained in non-Gaussian deformations to the cosmological\ndensity field. We find that the {\\Lambda}CDM and {\\Lambda}WDM models produce\nnearly identical genus curves indicating no topological differences in\nstructure formation. The Quintessence model, which differs solely in its\nexpansion history, produces significant differences in the strength and\nredshift evolution of non-Gaussian modes associated with higher cluster\nabundances and lower void abundances. These effects are robust to cosmic\nvariance and are characteristically different from those produced by tweaking\nthe parameters of a {\\Lambda}CDM model.

We analyzed the thermal emission from IDPs that\nwas observed by the first Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, AKARI. The\nobserved surface brightness in the trailing direction of the Earth orbit is\n3.7% greater than that in the leading direction in the $9{\\rm \\mu m}$ band and\n3.0% in the $18{\\rm \\mu m}$ band. In order to reveal dust properties causing\nthe leading-trailing surface brightness asymmetry, we numerically integrated\norbits of the Sun, the Earth, and a dust particle as a restricted three-body\nproblem including radiation from the Sun. The initial orbits of particles are\ndetermined according to the orbits of main-belt asteroids or Jupiter-family\ncomets. The orbital trapping in mean motion resonances results in a significant\nleading-trailing asymmetry so that intermediate sized dust (~10-100${\\rm \\mu\nm}$) produces a greater asymmetry than the zodiacal light has. The\nleading-trailing surface brightness difference integrated over the size\ndistribution of the asteroidal dust is obtained to be the values of 27.7% and\n25.3% in the $9{\\rm \\mu m}$ and $18{\\rm \\mu m}$ bands, respectively.

If the recurrence time of such superbursts is $\\sim10,000$\nyr and $\\sim10$% of the ejected mass feeds a CB disk, the abrupt\nangular-momentum loss causes a temporary orbital shrink, and the donor's radius\nand its Roche-lobe radius do not keep in step. Driven by mass transfer and\nangular-momentum loss, the binary would adjust its orbital parameters to\nrecover a new stable stage. Based on the theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulation, we find that the required feed mass at the CB disk is approximately\n$\\sim 10^{-8}$ ${\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 08:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Purpose: The aim of this\npaper is to compare on a quantitative basis the single-particle spectral\nfunction generated by different nuclear hamiltonians in symmetric nuclear\nmatter using the first three energy-weighted moments. Method: The spectral\nfunctions are calculated in the framework of the self-consistent Green's\nfunction approach at finite temperature within a ladder resummation scheme. We\nanalyze the first three moments of the spectral function and connect these to\nthe correlations induced by the interactions between the nucleons. In\nparticular, the variance of the spectral function is directly linked to the\ndispersive contribution of the self-energy. The discussion is centred around\ntwo- and three-body chiral nuclear interactions, with and without\nrenormalization, but we also provide results obtained with the traditional\nphase-shift-equivalent CD-Bonn and Av18 potentials. Results: The variance of\nthe spectral function is particularly sensitive to the short-range structure of\nthe force, with hard-core interactions providing large variances. Chiral forces\nyield variances which are an order of magnitude smaller and, when tamed using\nthe similarity renormalization group, the variance reduces significantly and in\nproportion to the renormalization scale.

In particular, the second-order moment\nprovides a direct insight into dispersive contributions to the self-energy and\nits value is indicative of the fragmentation of single-particle states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 09:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 05:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We clarify also the role of the\nclosed-channels often ignored in the description of breakup reactions. Methods:\nWe calculate the ($d,p$) cross sections with the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels method (CDCC) for 128 reactions systems and compare the\nresults with those obtained by the CDCC calculation with the AD approximation.\nEffect of the closed channels are investigated by ignoring the closed channels\nin CDCC. Results: The AD approximation affects in general the ($d,p$) cross\nsection by less than 20 %, but some exceptional nonadiabatic cases for which\nthe AD approximation breaks down are found. The closed channels turn out to\ngive significant effects on the cross section at deuteron energies less than\nabout 10 MeV.

The neglect of the closed channels without confirming the\nconvergence of the CDCC result is not recommended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 11:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:11:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

Hutter published an algorithm that solves any\nwell-defined problem $\\pi$ as quickly as the fastest algorithm $p^*$ computing\na solution for $\\pi$ in time bounded by $5.t_{p}(x)+d_p.time_{t_{p}}(x)+c_p$,\nwhere $d_p=40.2^{l(p)+l(t_{p})}$ and $c_p=40.2^{l(f)+1}.O(l(f)^2)$, where\n$l(f)$ is the length of the binary encoding of a proof $f$ that produces a pair\n$(p,t_p)$, where $t_p(x)$ is a provable time bound on the runtime of the\nfastest program $p$ provably equivalent to $p^*$. In this paper, we rewrite\nLevin Search using the ideas of Hutter so that we have a new simple algorithm\nthat solves any well-defined problem $\\pi$ as quickly as the fastest algorithm\n$p^*$ computing a solution for $\\pi$ in time bounded by $O(l(f)^2).t_p(x)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 12:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

To probe the relationship between the coronal properties with a\nspectral type of ultra-fast rotators with rotation period P < 1d, we analyse\nthe K3 rapid-rotator LO Peg observed with XMM-Newton and compare it with other\nlow-mass rapid rotators of spectral types G9-M1. We investigate the temporal\nevolution of coronal properties like the temperatures, emission measures,\nabundances, densities and the morphology of the involved coronal structures. We\nfind two distinguishable levels of activity in the XMM-Newton observation of\nLO~Peg, which shows significant X-ray variability both in phase and amplitude,\nimplying the presence of an evolving active region on the surface. The X-ray\nflux varies by 28%, possibly due to rotational modulation. During our\nobservation, a large X-ray flare with a peak X-ray luminosity of 2E30 erg/s and\nan energy of 7.3E33 erg was observed. At the flare onset we obtain clear\nsignatures for the occurrence of the Neupert effect. The flare plasma also\nshows an enhancement of iron by a factor of 2 during the rise and peak phase of\nthe flare. Our modeling analysis suggests that the scale size of the flaring\nX-ray plasma is smaller than 0.5 R_star. Further, the flare loop length appears\nto be smaller than the pressure scale height of the flaring plasma. Our studies\nshow that the X-ray properties of the LO~Peg are very similar to those of other\nlow-mass ultrafast rotators, i.e., the X-ray luminosity is very close to\nsaturation, its coronal abundances follow a trend of increasing abundance with\nincreasing first ionisation potential, the so-called inverse FIP effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

To date, most considerations of this important hypothetical\nprocess have been restricted to Lorentz-violating photons, as the necessary\ntheoretical tools for the SME fermion sector have not been available. With\ntheir development in a very recent paper, we are now in a position to compute\nthe decay rates based on a modified Dirac theory. Two realizations of the\nCherenkov process are studied. In the first scenario, the spin projection of\nthe incoming fermion is assumed to be conserved, and in the second, the spin\nprojection is allowed to flip. The first type of process is shown to be still\nforbidden for the dimensionful $a$ and $b$ coefficients where there are strong\nindications that it is energetically disallowed for the $H$ coefficients, as\nwell. However, it is rendered possible for the dimensionless $c$, $d$, $e$,\n$f$, and $g$ coefficients. For large initial fermion energies, the decay rates\nfor the $c$ and $d$ coefficients were found to grow linearly with momentum and\nto be linearly suppressed by the smallness of the Lorentz-violating coefficient\nwhere for the $e$, $f$, and $g$ coefficients this suppression is even\nquadratic. The decay rates vanish in the vicinity of the threshold, as\nexpected. The decay including a fermion spin flip plays a role for the\nspin-nondegenerate operators and it was found to occur for the dimensionful $b$\nand $H$ coefficients as well as for the dimensionless $d$ and $g$. The\ncharacteristics of this process differ much from the properties of the\nspin-conserving one, e.g., there is no threshold. Based on experimental data of\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays, new constraints on Lorentz violation in the\nquark sector are obtained from the thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 13:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 15:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 14:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

A specific pressure-temperature phase diagram of\nEu(Fe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is established. The structural phase\ntransition, as well as the spin-density-wave order of Fe sublattice, is\nsuppressed gradually with increasing pressure and disappears completely above\n2.0 GPa. In contrast, the magnetic order of Eu sublattice persists over the\nwhole investigated pressure range up to 14 GPa, yet displaying a non-monotonic\nvariation with pressure. With the increase of the hydrostatic pressure, the\nmagnetic state of Eu evolves from the canted antiferromagnetic structure in the\nground state, via a pure ferromagnetic structure under the intermediate\npressure, finally to a possible \"novel\" antiferromagnetic structure under the\nhigh pressure.

Our theory suggests metrics that can be\nused to compare the efficiency of one market with another, to find\ninefficiencies that may be profitable to exploit, and to evaluate the impact of\npolicy and regulations on market efficiency.\n  A market's efficiency is tied to its ability to communicate information\nrelevant to market participants. Market connectivity calculates the speed and\nreliability with which this communication is carried out via trade in the\nmarket. We model the market by a network called the trade network, which can be\ncomputed by recording transactions in the market over a fixed interval of time.\nThe nodes of the network correspond to participants in the market. Every pair\nof nodes that trades in the market is connected by an edge that is weighted by\nthe rate of trade, and associated with a vector that represents the type of\nitem that is bought or sold.\n  We evaluate the ability of the market to communicate by considering how it\ndeals with shocks. A shock is a change in the beliefs of market participants\nabout the value of the products that they trade. We compute the effect of every\npotential significant shock on trade in the market.

This is carried out by numerically simulating two-dimensional systems of\nliquid and vapour using the recently developed dynamic van der Waals theory, in\nwhich the two-phase hydrodynamics is coupled with liquid-vapour transition. It\nis confirmed that Leidenfrost drops experience a remarkably strong short-range\nrepulsion, due to a build-up of vapour in the common space under both drops.\nThis resistive force scales in a similar manner to the pressure-sourced force\nfrom the vapour layer under a single drop, in concurrence with intuition, with\ngood agreement seen in the simulation results. A threshold drop size therefore\nexists in order for an applied horizontal acceleration to overcome the\nrepulsion, while only very small drops are predicted to experience significant\nviscous effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

We focus on a minimal toy model of a\nrank 2 tensor gauge field, consisting of fractons coupled to an emergent\ngraviton (massless spin-2 excitation). We show how to reconcile the immobility\nof fractons with the expected gravitational behavior of the model. First, we\nreformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass\nquantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the\nprinciples of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction\nbetween fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,\nwith a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of\na gravitational force. This force will generically be short-ranged, but we\ndiscuss how the power-law behavior of Newtonian gravity can arise under certain\nconditions. We then show that, while an isolated fracton is immobile, fractons\nare endowed with finite inertia by the presence of a large-scale distribution\nof other fractons, in a concrete manifestation of Mach's principle. Our\nformalism provides suggestive hints that matter plays a fundamental role, not\nonly in perturbing, but in creating the background space in which it\npropagates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 13:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 02:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}
