The field of Complex\nEvent Processing (CEP) relates to the techniques and tools developed to\nefficiently process these queries. However, most CEP systems developed so far\nhave concentrated on relatively narrow types of queries, which consist of\nsliding windows, aggregation functions, and simple sequential patterns computed\nover events that have a fixed tuple structure. Many of them boast throughput,\nbut in counterpart, they are difficult to setup and cumbersome to extend with\nuser-defined elements.\n  This paper describes a variety of use cases taken from real-world scenarios\nthat present features seldom considered in classical CEP problems. It also\nprovides a broad review of current solutions, that includes tools and\ntechniques going beyond typical surveys on CEP. From a critical analysis of\nthese solutions, design principles for a new type of event stream processing\nsystem are exposed. The paper proposes a simple, generic and extensible\nframework for the processing of event streams of diverse types; it describes in\ndetail a stream processing engine, called BeepBeep, that implements these\nprinciples. BeepBeep's modular architecture, which borrows concepts from many\nother systems, is complemented with an extensible query language, called eSQL.\nThe end result is an open, versatile, and reasonably efficient query engine\nthat can be used in situations that go beyond the capabilities of existing\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 16:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The number of backlogged packets at the transmitter\nis known to a scheduler, who has to determine how many backlogged packets to\ntransmit during each time slot. The power consumption is assumed to be convex\nin transmission rates. Hence, if the scheduler transmits faster, the delay will\nbe reduced but with higher power consumption. To obtain the optimal delay-power\ntradeoff and the corresponding optimal policy, we model the problem as a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where we minimize the average delay\ngiven an average power constraint. By steady-state analysis and Lagrangian\nrelaxation, we can show that the optimal tradeoff curve is decreasing, convex,\nand piecewise linear, and the optimal policy is threshold-based. Based on the\nrevealed properties of the optimal policy, we develop an algorithm to\nefficiently obtain the optimal tradeoff curve and the optimal policy with full\ninformation of the system. The complexity of our proposed algorithm is much\nlower than a general algorithm based on Linear Programming.

The problem formulation involves\nexpectations with respect to a collection of random variables with unknown\ndistributions, representing exogenous quantities such as channel gain, user\ndensity, or spectrum occupancy. We consider the constant step-size stochastic\ndual subgradient descent (SDSD) method that has been widely used for online\nresource allocation in networks. The problem is solved in dual domain which\nresults in a primal resource allocation subproblem at each time instant. The\ngoal here is to characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of such stochastic\nresource allocations in an almost sure sense.\n  It is well known that with a step size of $\\epsilon$, {SDSD} converges to an\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$-sized neighborhood of the optimum. In practice however,\nthere exists a trade-off between the rate of convergence and the choice of\n$\\epsilon$. This paper establishes a convergence rate result for the SDSD\nalgorithm that precisely characterizes this trade-off. {Towards this end, a\nnovel stochastic bound on the gap between the objective function and the\noptimum is developed.

People\nare willing to share their selfies in various social media platforms such as\nFacebook, Instagram and Flicker. The popularity of selfie have caught\nresearchers' attention, especially psychologists. In computer vision and\nmachine learning areas, little attention has been paid to this phenomenon as a\nvaluable data source. In this paper, we focus on exploring the deeper personal\npatterns behind people's different kinds of selfie-posting behaviours. We\ndevelop this work based on a dataset of WeChat, one of the most extensively\nused instant messaging platform in China. In particular, we first propose an\nunsupervised approach to classify the images posted by users. Based on the\nclassification result, we construct three types of user-level features that\nreflect user preference, activity and posting habit. Based on these features,\nfor a series of selfie related tasks, we build classifiers that can accurately\npredict two sets of users with opposite selfie-posting behaviours. We have\nfound that people's interest, activity and posting habit have a great influence\non their selfie-posting behaviours. For example, the classification accuracy\nbetween selfie-posting addict and nonaddict reaches 89.36%. We also prove that\nusing user's image information to predict these behaviours achieve better\nperformance than using text information. More importantly, for each set of\nusers with a specific selfie-posting behaviour, we extract and visualize\nsignificant personal patterns about them. In addition, we cluster users and\nextract their high-level attributes, revealing the correlation between these\nattributes and users' selfie-posting behaviours. In the end, we demonstrate\nthat users' selfie-posting behaviour, as a good predictor, could predict their\ndifferent preferences toward these high-level attributes accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

However, the atomic thickness\nof these 2D materials results in low photo absorption limiting the achievable\nphoto luminescence intensity. Such emission can, in principle, be enhanced via\nnanoscale antennae resulting in; a. an increased absorption cross-section\nenhancing pump efficiency, b. an acceleration of the internal emission rate via\nthe Purcell factor mainly by reducing the antennas optical mode volume beyond\nthe diffraction limit, and c. improved impedance matching of the emitter dipole\nto the freespace wavelength. Plasmonic dimer antennae show orders of magnitude\nhot-spot field enhancements when an emitter is positioned exactly at the\nmidgap. However, a 2D material cannot be grown, or easily transferred, to\nreside in mid-gap of the metallic dimer cavity. In addition, a spacer layer\nbetween the cavity and the emissive material is required to avoid non-radiative\nrecombination channels. Using both computational and experimental methods, in\nthis work we show that the emission enhancement from a 2D emitter- monomer\nantenna cavity system rivals that of dimers at much reduced lithographic\neffort. We rationalize this finding by showing that the emission enhancement in\ndimer antennae does not specifically originate from the gap of the dimer\ncavity, but is an average effect originating from the effective cavity\ncrosssection taken below each optical cavity where the emitting 2D film is\nlocated. In particular, we test an array of different dimer and monomer antenna\ngeometries and observe a representative 3x higher emission for both monomer and\ndimer cavities as compared to intrinsic emission of Chemical Vapor Deposition\nsynthesized WS2 flakes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 22:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

This study addresses these\nquestions, by focusing on a specific underlying neural mechanism involved in\nour visual experiences that affects our final perception. Among many types of\nvisual illusion, Geometrical and, in particular, Tilt Illusions are rather\nimportant, being characterized by misperception of geometric patterns involving\nlines and tiles in combination with contrasting orientation, size or position.\nOver the last decade, many new neurophysiological experiments have led to new\ninsights as to how, when and where retinal processing takes place, and the\nencoding nature of the retinal representation that is sent to the cortex for\nfurther processing. Based on these neurobiological discoveries, we provide\ncomputer simulation evidence from modelling retinal ganglion cells responses to\nsome complex Tilt Illusions, suggesting that the emergence of tilt in these\nillusions is partially related to the interaction of multiscale visual\nprocessing performed in the retina. The output of our low-level filtering model\nis presented for several types of Tilt Illusion, predicting that the final tilt\npercept arises from multiple-scale processing of the Differences of Gaussians\nand the perceptual interaction of foreground and background elements.

The standard method\nto assess the water quality of a catchment, or a group of catchments, usually\ninvolves collecting point measurements of water quality and other additional\ninformation such as the date and time of measurements, rainfall amounts, the\nland-use and soil-type of the catchment and the elevation. Some of this\nauxiliary information will be point data, measured at the exact location,\nwhereas other such as land-use will be areal data often in a compositional\nformat. Two problems arise if analysts try to incorporate this information into\na statistical model in order to predict (for example) the influence of land-use\non water quality. First is the spatial change of support problem that arises\nwhen using areal data to predict outcomes at point locations. Secondly, the\nphysical process driving water quality is not compositional, rather it is the\nobservation process that provides compositional data. In this paper we present\nan approach that accounts for these two issues by using a latent variable to\nidentify the land-use that most likely influences water quality. This latent\nvariable is used in a spatial mixture model to help estimate the influence of\nland-use on water quality.

Existing primary deduplication techniques either use\ninline caching to exploit locality in primary workloads or use post-processing\ndeduplication running in system idle time to avoid the negative impact on I/O\nperformance. However, neither of them works well in the cloud servers running\nmultiple services or applications for the following two reasons: Firstly, the\ntemporal locality of duplicate data writes may not exist in some primary\nstorage workloads thus inline caching often fails to achieve good deduplication\nratio. Secondly, the post-processing deduplication allows duplicate data to be\nwritten into disks, therefore does not provide the benefit of I/O deduplication\nand requires high peak storage capacity. This paper presents HPDedup, a Hybrid\nPrioritized data Deduplication mechanism to deal with the storage system shared\nby applications running in co-located virtual machines or containers by fusing\nan inline and a post-processing process for exact deduplication. In the inline\ndeduplication phase, HPDedup gives a fingerprint caching mechanism that\nestimates the temporal locality of duplicates in data streams from different\nVMs or applications and prioritizes the cache allocation for these streams\nbased on the estimation. HPDedup also allows different deduplication threshold\nfor streams based on their spatial locality to reduce the disk fragmentation.\nThe post-processing phase removes duplicates whose fingerprints are not able to\nbe cached due to the weak temporal locality from disks. Our experimental\nresults show that HPDedup clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art primary\nstorage deduplication techniques in terms of inline cache efficiency and\nprimary deduplication efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 05:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 05:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

In this work, we use clinical CT to image\nlung cancer patients before partial pneumonectomy (resection of pathological\nlung tissue). The resected specimen is prepared for $\\mu$CT imaging at a voxel\nresolution of 50 $\\mu$m (0.05 mm).

The need for corresponding numerical simulations has\nled, in recent years, to the development of a discrete biharmonic calculus. The\nprimary object of this calculus is a high-order compact discrete biharmonic\noperator (DBO). The numerical results have been remarkably accurate, and have\nbeen corroborated by some rigorous proofs. However, there remained the\n\"mystery\" of the \"underlying reason\" for this success. This paper is a\ncontribution in this direction, expounding the strong connection between cubic\nspline functions (on an interval) and the DBO. It is shown in particular that\nthe (scaled) fourth-order distributional derivative of the cubic spline is\nidentical to the action of the DBO on grid functions. The DBO is constructed in\nterms of the discrete Hermitian derivative. A remarkable fact is that the\nkernel of the inverse of the discrete operator is (up to scaling) equal to the\ngrid evaluation of the kernel of $\\Big[\\Big(\\frac{d}{dx}\\Big)^4\\Big]^{-1} .$\nExplicit expressions are presented for both kernels.

Another remarkable consequence is the validity of\na comparison principle. It is well known that there is no maximum principle for\nthe fourth-order equation.

With this\nsimplified theory, we implement the conventional procedure in the construction\nof the horizon thermodynamics in 3 and 4 dimensional spacetime. We find that\nthe field equations in the fourth-order gravity can also be written as the\nthermodynamic identity. Moreover, we can use this approach to derive the same\nblack hole mass as that by other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation\nthat jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class\nclassification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only\npredict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated\nas multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two\nnetworks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from\nbackground, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the\nforeground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with\ncoordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of\nthe brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As\nnetwork architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch\nnormalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with\ndropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of\nthe network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures\nlabel agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the\nnetwork are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that\nDeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely\nlearning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young,\nold, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small\ntraining sample on the target application, where the availability of larger\ndatasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

A\nsearch strategy is required to locate an unknown target node $t$ in a given\ntree $T$.

The cost of querying each node is given by a known non-negative\nweight function, and the considered objective is to minimize the total query\ncost for a worst-case choice of the target. Designing an optimal strategy for a\nweighted tree search instance is known to be strongly NP-hard, in contrast to\nthe unweighted variant of the problem which can be solved optimally in linear\ntime.

In this paper, the method behind Ariadne is further developed and\napplied to the research question of the special issue \"Same data, different\nresults\" - the better understanding of topic (re-)construction by different\nbibliometric approaches. For the case of the Astro dataset of 111,616 articles\nin astronomy and astrophysics, a new instantiation of the interactive exploring\ntool, LittleAriadne, has been created. This paper contributes to the overall\nchallenge to delineate and define topics in two different ways.

Second, we discuss how LittleAriadne can be\nused to browse through the network of topical terms, authors, journals,\ncitations and various cluster solutions of the Astro dataset. More\nspecifically, we treat the assignment of an article to the different clustering\nsolutions as an additional element of its bibliographic record. Keeping the\nprinciple of semantic indexing on the level of such an extended list of\nentities of the bibliographic record, LittleAriadne in turn provides a\nvisualization of the context of a specific clustering solution. It also conveys\nthe similarity of article clusters produced by different algorithms, hence\nrepresenting a complementary approach to other possible means of comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 10:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Based on\nanalyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131 third party apps, we\ndiscover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39% higher\nthan what users themselves cause. We take a step toward minimizing this loss by\nintroducing the concept of History-based decisions. Simply put, users are\ninformed at decision time about the vendors which have been previously granted\naccess to their data. Thus, they can reduce their privacy loss by not\ninstalling apps from new vendors whenever possible. Next, we realize this\nconcept by introducing a new privacy indicator, which can be integrated within\nthe cloud apps' authorization interface. Via a web experiment with 141\nparticipants recruited from CrowdFlower, we show that our privacy indicator can\nsignificantly increase the user's likelihood of choosing the app that minimizes\nher privacy loss.

Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS) yielded the most uniform\nobservation scan of the inner Milky Way in the TeV gamma-ray band to date. The\nsky maps and source catalogue of the HGPS allow for a systematic study of the\npopulation of TeV pulsar wind nebulae found throughout the last decade. To\ninvestigate the nature and evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, for the first time\nwe also present several upper limits for regions around pulsars without a\ndetected TeV wind nebula. Our data exhibit a correlation of TeV surface\nbrightness with pulsar spin-down power $\\dot{E}$. This seems to be caused both\nby an increase of extension with decreasing $\\dot{E}$, and hence with time,\ncompatible with a power law $R_\\mathrm{PWN}(\\dot{E}) \\sim \\dot{E}^{-0.65 \\pm\n0.20}$, and by a mild decrease of TeV gamma-ray luminosity with decreasing\n$\\dot{E}$, compatible with $L_{1-10\\,\\mathrm{TeV}} \\sim \\dot{E}^{0.59 \\pm\n0.21}$. We also find that the offsets of pulsars with respect to the wind\nnebula centres with ages around 10 kyr are frequently larger than can be\nplausibly explained by pulsar proper motion and could be due to an asymmetric\nenvironment. In the present data, it seems that a large pulsar offset is\ncorrelated with a high apparent TeV efficiency\n$L_{1-10\\,\\mathrm{TeV}}/\\dot{E}$. In addition to 14 HGPS sources considered as\nfirmly identified pulsar wind nebulae and 5 additional pulsar wind nebulae\ntaken from literature, we find 10 HGPS sources that form likely TeV pulsar wind\nnebula candidates. Using a model that subsumes the present common understanding\nof the very high-energy radiative evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, we find\nthat the trends and variations of the TeV observables and limits can be\nreproduced to a good level, drawing a consistent picture of present-day TeV\ndata and theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 15:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Recently, its extension to complex networks has been\nattracting a growing attention, but a deep characterization of quantum\nbehaviour is still missing for this novel context. In this work we analyze\nquantum correlations arising in the bilocality scenario, that is a tripartite\nquantum network where the correlations between the parties are mediated by two\nindependent sources of states. First, we prove that non-bilocal correlations\nwitnessed through a Bell-state measurement in the central node of the network\nform a subset of those obtainable by means of a separable measurement. This\nleads us to derive the maximal violation of the bilocality inequality that can\nbe achieved by arbitrary two-qubit quantum states and arbitrary projective\nseparable measurements. We then analyze in details the relation between the\nviolation of the bilocality inequality and the CHSH inequality. Finally, we\nshow how our method can be extended to n-locality scenario consisting of n\ntwo-qubit quantum states distributed among n+1 nodes of a star-shaped network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 15:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

In the meanwhile, the cloud server is also\nreluctant to leak any parameters of the trained object detectors. 10 years ago,\nAvidan & Butman introduced Blind Vision, which is a method for securely\nevaluating a Viola-Jones type object detector. Blind Vision uses standard\ncryptographic tools and is painfully slow to compute, taking a couple of hours\nto scan a single image. The purpose of this work is to explore an efficient\nmethod that can speed up the process. We propose the Random Base Image (RBI)\nRepresentation.

First, we study the evolution of the number of distinct\nclasses. Reconstructed time series based on the current classification scheme\nare very different from historical data. This suggests that using the current\nclassification to analyze the past produces a distorted view of the evolution\nof the system. Second, we study the relative sizes of classes. The size\ndistribution is exponential so classes are of quite different sizes, but the\nlargest classes are not necessarily the oldest. To explain this pattern with a\nsimple stochastic growth model, we introduce the assumption that classes have a\nregular chance to be split. Third, we study reclassification.
