Our work\nbuilds on a number of scalable algorithms that have been proposed in recent\nyears, ranging from methods that approximate the complex or real pseudospectral\nabscissa and radius of large sparse matrices (and generalizations of these\nmethods for pseudospectra to spectral value sets) to algorithms for\napproximating the complex stability radius (the reciprocal of the $H_\\infty$\nnorm). Although our algorithm is guaranteed to find only upper bounds to the\nreal stability radius, it seems quite effective in practice. As far as we know,\nthis is the first algorithm that addresses the Frobenius-norm version of this\nproblem. Because the cost mainly consists of computing the eigenvalue with\nmaximal real part for continuous-time systems (or modulus for discrete-time\nsystems) of a sequence of matrices, our algorithm remains very efficient for\nlarge-scale systems provided that the system matrices are sparse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 16:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

From this point of view,\nWeyl and nodal-line semimetals can be classified in two types depending on the\nway surface states decay.

The difference between both types reflects in the\nway the branch cuts in the spectrum accommodate in the complex plane. The\nstability of the surface states stems in this approach from the complex\nstructure that develops around the exceptional points, with a topological\nprotection which is based on the fact that the branch cuts cannot be closed by\nsmall perturbations. We check this property when nodal-line semimetals are\nplaced under circularly polarized light, where we observe that the exceptional\npoints survive the effect of such a perturbation, though appropriate boundary\nconditions for zero-energy surface states cannot be satisfied in general due to\nthe breakdown of time-reversal invariance by the radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 16:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

The asymptotic equilibrium eventually attained by the system, and\nits associated stability, can be assessed by employing standard nonlinear\ndynamics tools. For many practical applications, it is however important to\nexternally drive the system towards a desired equilibrium, which is resilient,\nhence stable, to external perturbations. To this end we here consider a system\nmade up of $N$ interacting populations which evolve according to general rate\nequations, bearing attributes of universality. One species is added to the pool\nof interacting families and used as a dynamical controller to induce novel\nstable equilibria. Use can be made of the root locus method to shape the needed\ncontrol, in terms of intrinsic reactivity and adopted protocol of injection.\nThe proposed method is tested on both synthetic and real data, thus enabling to\ndemonstrate its robustness and versatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 17:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Moreover, our work explains the origin of certain optical\ntransitions observed in the experimental studies. Unexpectedly, as a\nconsequence of different bond distortions, the results on the band alignments\nshow electron accumulation in the left shell of TiO2 rather than the right one.\nSuch behavior provides more choice for the sensitization and functionalization\nof TiO2 surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 17:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 11:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

This was done by\nsetting four constraints on metric variations in the action principle, which is\nreasonable because the gravity's physical degrees of freedom are at most six.\nHowever, there are two problems about this theory; the three constraints in\naddition to the unimodular condition were introduced without clear physical\nmeanings, and the flat Minkowski spacetime is unstable against perturbations.\nHere a new set of gravitational field equations is derived by replacing the\nthree constraints with new ones requiring that geodesic paths remain geodesic\nagainst metric variations.

Then galaxies are formed\nonly in small $\\Lambda$ regions, and the cosmological constant problem is\nsolved by the anthropic argument.

These data,\ncombined with observations at 1400 MHz from MAGPIS were used to investigate the\nproperties of its radio emission. Additionally, we reprocessed XMM-Newton and\nChandra archival data. G29.37+0.1 mainly consists of a bright twisted\nstructure, named the S-shaped feature. The high sensitivity of the new GMRT\nobservations allowed the identification of potential lobes, jets, and a nuclear\ncentral region in the S-shaped morphology of G29.37+0.1.

Borrowing the\nconcept of lazy instantiation from functional programming, we evaluate proof\nlinks locally allowing reductive cut-elimination to proceed past them. Though,\nthis method cannot be used to obtain cut-free proof schemata, we nonetheless\nobtain important results concerning the schematic CERES method, that is a\nmethod of cut-elimination for proof schemata based on resolution. In \"Towards a\nclausal analysis of cut-elimination\", it was shown that reductive\ncut-elimination transforms a given LK-proof in such a way that a subsumption\nrelation holds between the pre- and post-transformation characteristic clause\nsets, i.e. the clause set representing the cut-structure of an LK-proof.

Then CL(A') is subsumed by all characteristic clause sets\nextractable from any application of reductive cut-elimination to A. Such a\nnormal form is referred to as an ACNF top and plays an essential role in\nmethods of cut-elimination by resolution. These results can be extended to\nproof schemata through our \"lazy instantiation\" of proof links, and provides an\nessential step toward a complete cut-elimination method for proof schemata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 19:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

This simulation contains a chain of processes including:\nactivities generation, decision point choices, and assignment.

These considerations transform the problem into a convergence\nproblem. A Metropolitan Hasting algorithm is then adapted to identify the\noptimal solution. This framework can be used to fill the lack of data or to\nmodel the reactions of demand to exogenous changes in the scenario.

The app collected Bluetooth and mental health data\nin 63 participants. Social networks of proximity were estimated from Bluetooth\ndata and 95% of the edges were scanned at least every 30 minutes. The majority\nof participants found this method of data collection acceptable and reported\nthat they would be likely to participate in future studies using this app.\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a smartphone app that\nparticipants can install on their own phone to investigate the relationship\nbetween social connectivity and mental health.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 22:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 07:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

The\nstudy of these structures can contribute to a better understanding of this new\nmicro/nano technology and the cytoskeleton like structural building blocks.\nInside the cell the actin network is regulated by tens of actin-binding\nproteins (ABP's), which makes for a highly complex system with several emergent\nbehavior. In particular Calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin\nstabiliser, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Recent experiments using an\nin vitro model system of cross-linked actin with Calponin and large deformation\nbulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin exhibited a delayed\nonset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before softening.\n  In this work we propose a mathematical model into the framework of nonlinear\ncontinuum mechanics to explain the observation of Jansen, where we introduce\nthe hypothesis by which the difference between the two networks, with and\nwithout Calponin, is interpreted as a alterations in the pre-strain developed\nby the network entanglement and the regulation of the crosslinks adhesion\nenergy. The mechanics of the F-actin is modelled using the wormlike chain model\nfor semi-flexible filaments and the gelation process is described as mesoscale\ndynamics for the crosslinks.

Under suitable conditions on the nature of\nthe system, of the perturbation, and of the observables of interest, response\ntheories allow to construct operators describing the smooth change of the\ninvariant measure of the system of interest as a function of the small\nparameter controlling the intensity of the perturbation. In particular,\nresponse theories can be developed both for stochastic and chaotic\ndeterministic dynamical systems, where in the latter case stricter conditions\nimposing some degree of structural stability are required.

Here we propose a method to generate a new type of quantum entangled\nstates, $(|NN00\\rangle+|00NN\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ called \"double NOON\" states,\nwith a setup of two superconducting flux qutrits and five circuit cavities.\nThis scheme operates essentially by employing a two-photon process, i.e., two\nphotons are simultaneously and separately emitted into two cavities when each\ncoupler qutrit is initially in a higher-energy excited state. As a consequence,\nthe \"double\" NOON state creation needs only $N$+2 operational steps. One\napplication of double NOON states is to get a phase error of $1/(2N)$ in phase\nmeasurement. In comparison, to achieve the same error, a normal NOON state of\nthe form $(|2N,0\\rangle+|0,2N\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ is needed, which requires at\nleast $2N$ operational steps to prepare by using the existing schemes. Our\nnumerical simulation demonstrates that high-fidelity generation of the double\nNOON states with $N\\leq 10$ even for the imperfect devices is feasible with the\npresent circuit QED technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 02:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

We consider the\nproblems of estimation and of constructing component-wise confidence intervals\nin a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model when some covariates of\nthe design matrix are missing completely at random. We analyze a variant of the\nDantzig selector [9] for estimating the regression model and we use a\nde-biasing argument to construct component-wise confidence intervals.

In the presence of missing data, inference is\ncomplicated by the fact that the de-biasing matrix is correlated with the pilot\nestimator and this necessitates the design of a new estimator and a novel\nanalysis.

A novel Multichannel Immediate Multiple Access (MIMA)\nphysical layer is developed such that each SU can monitor all the channels\nsimultaneously for incoming signals and achieve fast rendezvous within the\nmultiple channels. The spectrum utilized by an SU pair can be changed\ndynamically based upon spectrum sensing at the transmitter and tracking\nsynchronization and control messages at the receiver. Although information\nabout the number of active SUs can be used to improve the spectrum sharing\nefficiency, the improvement is small relative to the cost of obtaining such\ninformation. Therefore, the architecture adopts Multichannel Carrier Sense\nMultiple Access (CSMA) for medium access control regardless of the number of\nactive SUs. A prototype implementation of the architecture has been developed\nusing an advanced software defined radio (SDR) platform. System tests\ndemonstrate that the spectrum sharing efficiency of the prototype is close to\nan upper bound if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. Among\nother practical issues, imaged interference caused by hardware IQ imbalance\nlimits system performance. In the prototype, the MIMA is based on an LTE\nwaveform. Therefore, the spectrum sharing radio can be potentially applied to\nthe 3.5 GHz radar band for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 04:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

To understand the users' realistic trading behaviors,\na prospect theory (PT) model from behavioral economics is proposed, which\nincludes the widely adopted expected utility theory (EUT) as a special case.\nAlthough the PT modeling leads to a challenging non-convex optimization\nproblem, the optimal solution can be characterized by exploiting the unimodal\nstructure of the objective function.

It is shown in our simulation that the risk preferences have a\nsignificant impact on the user's decision and outcome: a risk-averse dominant\nuser can guarantee a higher minimum profit in the trading, while a risk-seeking\ndominant user can achieve a higher maximum profit. By comparing with the EUT\nbenchmark, it is shown that a PT user with a low reference point is more\nwilling to buy mobile data. Moreover, when the probability of high future data\ndemand is low, a PT user is more willing to buy mobile data due to the\nprobability distortion comparing with an EUT user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 06:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

Although a number\nof studies have reported the properties of individual LLOs, the reasons for\ntheir low luminosity remain uncertain. To answer this question, we need to know\nthe evolutionary status of LLOs. Protostellar outflows are found to widen as\ntheir parent cores evolve, and therefore, the outflow opening angle could be\nused as an evolutionary indicator. The infrared scattered light escapes out\nthrough the outflow cavity and highlights the cavity wall, giving us the\nopportunity to measure the outflow opening angle. Using the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we detected outflows toward eight LLOs out of\n20 at Ks band, and based on archival Spitzer IRAC1 images, we added four\noutflow-driving sources from the remaining 12 sources. By fitting these images\nwith radiative transfer models, we derive the outflow opening angles and\ninclination angles. To study the widening of outflow cavities, we compare our\nsample with the young stellar objects from Arce & Sargent 2006 and Velusamy et\nal. 2014 in the plot of opening angle versus bolometric temperature taken as an\nevolutionary indicator.Our LLO targets match well the trend of increasing\nopening angle with bolometric temperature reported by Arce & Sargent and are\nbroadly consistent with that reported by Velusamy et al., suggesting that the\nopening angle could be a good evolutionary indicator for LLOs. Accordingly, we\nconclude that at least 40% of the outflow-driving LLOs in our sample are young\nClass 0 objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 07:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

However, the automated analysis of ultrasound\nimages is complicated because they are patient-specific, operator-dependent,\nand machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate\nestimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform\nautomatically because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings,\nnon-uniform contrast, and irregular shape compared to other parameters.We\npropose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal AC from 2D\nultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network\n(CNN), which takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure,\nand the characteristics of the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN\nto classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical\nvein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed method\nusing clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental\nresults show that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN\nprovides sufficient classification results for AC estimation through the Hough\ntransformation. The proposed method automatically estimates AC from ultrasound\nimages. The method is quantitatively evaluated, and shows stable performance in\nmost cases and even for ultrasound images deteriorated by shadowing artifacts.\nAs a result of experiments for our acceptance check, the accuracies are 0.809\nand 0.771 with the expert 1 and expert 2, respectively, while the accuracy\nbetween the two experts is 0.905.

Therefore, the gap distribution in DD events has some\ndiscrete structure in the region of large gaps. Moreover, the string-junction\nconglomerate could be released after DD interaction as a metastable particle.\nThere is another multiparticle process with the pomeron loop configuration that\ngives an event with doubled multiplicity in the central rapidity gap. It\ncorresponds to the cut along the pomeron loop. The events with the gap in DD as\nwell as the events with doubled multiplicity, each go on the level of 1.2% of\nthe inclusive production cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 09:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 08:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 08:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 08:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

This is done by solving an optimization\nproblem that minimizes a linear combination of the expected estimation error\ncovariance and the negative of the expected eavesdropper error covariance.\nStructural results on the optimal transmission policy are derived, and shown to\nexhibit thresholding behaviour in the estimation error covariances.

Here, we use weighted stochastic blockmodels to\nuncover the meso-scale architecture of \\emph{Drosophila}, mouse, rat, macaque,\nand human connectomes.

In an already\ncrowded radio spectrum, it becomes increasingly difficult to meet ever growing\napplication demands of wireless bandwidth. It has been shown that the allocated\nspectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrum\nholes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication. As\nwe enter the Internet Of Things (IoT) era in which appliances of common use\nwill become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements (such as\nlow latency, energy efficiency, etc.), current networks face the vexing problem\nof how to create sufficient capacity for such applications.

Interestingly, 65% of m-to-DH type II bursts associated\nwith CMEs and flares produced SEP events. The SEP-associated CMEs have higher\nsky-plane mean speed, projection corrected speed, and sky-plane peak speed than\nthose of non-SEP-associated CMEs respectively by 30%, 39%, and 25%, even though\nthe two sets of CMEs achieved their sky-plane peak speeds at nearly similar\nheights within LASCO field of view. We found Pearson's correlation coefficients\nbetween the speeds of CMEs speeds and logarithmic peak intensity of SEP events\nare cc = 0.62 and cc = 0.58, respectively. We also found that the\nSEP-associated CMEs are on average of three times more decelerated (-21.52\nm/s2) than the non-SEP-associated CMEs (-5.63 m/s2). The SEP-associated m type\nII bursts have higher frequency drift rate and associated shock speed than\nthose of the non-SEP-associated events by 70% and 25% respectively. The average\nformation heights of m and DH type II radio bursts for SEP-associated events\nare lower than for non-SEP-associated events. 93% of SEP-associated events\noriginate from the western hemisphere and 65% of SEP-associated events are\nassociated with interacting CMEs. The obtained results indicate that, at least\nfor the set of CMEs associated with m-to-DH type II bursts, SEP-associated CMEs\nare more energetic than those not associated with SEPs, thus suggesting that\nthey are effective particle accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 13:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

In these reactions we are far from the\nthermodynamical limit. In small colliding systems, such as electron-positron or\nnuclear collisions, the number of particles is several orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the Avogadro number; therefore, finite-size and fluctuation\neffects strongly influence the final-state one-particle energy distributions.\nDue to the simple characterization, the description of the identified hadron\nspectra with the Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamical approach is insufficient.\nThese spectra can be described very well with Tsallis-Pareto distributions\ninstead, derived from non-extensive thermodynamics. Using the $q$-entropy\nformula, we interpret the microscopic physics in terms of the Tsallis $q$ and\n$T$ parameters.
