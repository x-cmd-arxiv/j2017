Plasmon in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)\nhas long been pursued as a type of promising active medium for terahertz\nemitters. However, a high wall-plug efficiency sufficient for high-power\noperation has not been achieved. Here we report spontaneous terahertz emission\ntunable in a frequency range from 0.3 to 2.5 THz through electrical excitation\nof plasmon or plasmon-polariton modes in a grating-gate coupled AlGaN/GaN 2DEG\nat 7 K. A wall-plug efficiency ranging from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-1}$ is found by\ntuning the energy (4.5 eV to 0.5 eV) of tunneling electrons between the grating\ngates and the 2DEG. The total emission power, albeit below 15 nW, is already\ndetectable by using a direct terahertz field-effect transistor detector based\non the same type of 2DEG.

Later, in 2010, a\nHubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found\nfar-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious\noffset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be\nresponsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that\npremise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide\nField Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but\nwithout success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and\ncoincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha\nPersei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint\nprogram, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic\nto the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G\nsupergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the\nfundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a\nhyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an\nalternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.\nResolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy\nsolution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated.

The grain\nstructure is idealized as a lattice of identical hexagonal cells - a honeycomb\npattern. Reactions with the environment constitute the boundary conditions and\ndrive the transport between the surfaces. Time-dependent simulations solving\nthe Poisson equation self-consistently with the Nernst-Planck flux equations\nfor the mobile species are performed. In the resulting Poisson-Nernst-Planck\nsystem of equations, the electrostatic potential is obtained from the Poisson\nequation in its integral form by summation. The model is used to interpret\nalumina membrane oxygen permeation experiments, in which different oxygen gas\npressures are applied at opposite membrane surfaces and the resulting flux of\noxygen molecules through the membrane is measured. Simulation results involving\nfour mobile species, charged aluminum and oxygen vacancies, electrons, and\nholes, provide a complete description of the measurements and insight into the\nmicroscopic processes underpinning the oxygen permeation of the membrane. Most\nnotably, the hypothesized transition between p-type and n-type ionic\nconductivity of the alumina grain boundaries as a function of the applied\noxygen gas pressure is observed in the simulations. The range of validity of a\nsimple analytic model for the oxygen permeation rate, similar to the Wagner\ntheory of metal oxidation, is quantified by comparison to the numeric\nsimulations.

Wadsworth on Krull dimension of tensor products of\nalgebras over a field $k$ into the general setting of algebras over an\narbitrary ring $R$. For this sake, we introduce and study the notion of a\nfibred AF-ring over a ring $R$. This concept extends naturally the notion of\nAF-ring over a field introduced by A. Wadsworth in \\cite{W} to algebras over\narbitrary rings. We prove that Wadsworth theorems express local properties\nrelated to the fibre rings of tensor products of algebras over a ring.

To address this problem, we develop a\nsensing algorithm for 3D-WSN based on dodecahedron topology which we call Three\nDimensional Distributed Clustering (3D-DC) algorithm. Using 3D-DC algorithm in\n3D-WSN, accurate information extraction appears to be a major challenge due to\nthe environmental noise where a Cluster Head (CH) node gathers and estimates\ninformation in each dodecahedron cluster. Hence, to extract precise information\nin each dodecahedron cluster, we propose Three Dimensional Information\nEstimation (3D-IE) algorithm. Moreover, Node deployment strategy also plays an\nimportant factor to maximize information accuracy in 3D-WSN. In most cases,\nsensor nodes are deployed deterministically or randomly. But both the\ndeployment scenario are not aware of where to exactly place the sensor nodes to\nextract more information in terms of accuracy. Therefore, placing nodes in its\nappropriate positions in 3D-WSN is a challenging task. We propose a Three\nDimensional Node Placement (3D-NP) algorithm which can find the possible nodes\nand their deployment strategy to maximize information accuracy in the network.\nWe perform simulations using MATLAB to validate the 3D-DC, 3D-IE and 3D-NP,\nalgorithms respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 21:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

We theoretically propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a general framework to manifest nonclassicality by observing a\nsingle marginal distribution only, which provides a novel insight into\nnonclassicality and a practical applicability to various quantum systems. Our\napproach maps the 1-dim marginal distribution into a factorized 2-dim\ndistribution by multiplying the measured distribution or the vacuum-state\ndistribution along an orthogonal axis. The resulting fictitious Wigner function\nbecomes unphysical only for a nonclassical state, thus the negativity of the\ncorresponding density operator provides an evidence of nonclassicality.\nFurthermore, the negativity measured this way yields a lower bound for\nentanglement potential---a measure of entanglement generated using a\nnonclassical state with a beam splitter setting that is a prototypical model to\nproduce continuous-variable (CV) entangled states. Our approach detects both\nGaussian and non-Gaussian nonclassical states in a reliable and efficient\nmanner. Remarkably, it works regardless of measurement axis for all\nnon-Gaussian states in finite-dimensional Fock space of any size, also\nextending to infinite-dimensional states of experimental relevance for CV\nquantum informatics. We experimentally illustrate the power of our criterion\nfor motional states of a trapped ion confirming their nonclassicality in a\nmeasurement-axis independent manner. We also address an extension of our\napproach combined with phase-shift operations, which leads to a stronger test\nof nonclassicality, i.e. detection of genuine non-Gaussianity under a CV\nmeasurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 11:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

One of the possible approaches to this problem is to\nenrich these methods (which are almost exclusively based on statistical\nalgorithms) with some intrinsically deterministic add-ons borrowed from\ntheoretical physics. The idea proposed in this note is to divide the set of Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) characterizing an individual business into the\nfollowing two distinct groups: 1) highly volatile KPIs mostly determined by\nexternal factors and thus poorly controllable by a business, and 2) relatively\nstable KPIs identified and controlled by a business itself. It looks like,\nwhereas the dynamics of the first group can, as before, be studied using\nstatistical methods, for studying and optimizing the dynamics of the second\ngroup it is better to use deterministic principles similar to the Principle of\nLeast Action of classical mechanics. Such approach opens a whole bunch of new\ninteresting opportunities in business analytics, with numerous practical\napplications including diverse aspects of operational and strategic planning,\nchange management, ROI optimization, etc. Uncovering and utilizing dynamical\nlaws of the controllable KPIs would also allow one to use dynamical invariants\nof business as the most natural sets of risk and performance indicators, and\nfacilitate business growth by using effects of parametric resonance with\nnatural business cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 04:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

By applying these formulas, we can prove that multiple zeta star values\nwhose indices are the sequences $(\\bar 1,\\{1\\}_m,\\bar 1)$ and $(2,\\{1\\}_m,\\bar\n1)$ can be expressed polynomially in terms of zeta values, polylogarithms and\n$\\ln2$. Finally, we also evaluate several restricted sum formulas involving\nmultiple zeta values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 13:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

A singular integral equation, also known as Possio\nequation, that relates the pressure jump along the airfoil to its downwash is\nderived. The derivation of the equation utilizes Laplace transform, Fourier\ntransform, method of images, and theory of Mikhlin multipliers. The existence\nand uniqueness of solution to the Possio equation is verified for the steady\nstate case and an approximate solution is obtained. The aerodynamic loads are\nthen calculated based on the approximate solution. Moreover, the divergence\nspeed of a continuum wing structure located near the ground is obtained based\non the derived expressions for the aerodynamic loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 09:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}
