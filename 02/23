This calls for increased scrutiny of all\naspects of typical iceberg models. An important component of iceberg models is\nthe representation of iceberg capsizing, or rolling. Rolling occurs\nspontaneously when the ratio of iceberg width to height falls below a critical\nthreshold. Here we examine previously proposed representations of this\nthreshold, and we find that there have been crucial errors in the\nrepresentation of rolling in many modeling studies to date. We correct these\nerrors and identify an accurate model representation of iceberg rolling. Next,\nwe assess how iceberg rolling influences simulation results in a hierarchy of\nmodels. Rolling is found to substantially prolong the lifespan of individual\nicebergs and allow them to drift farther offshore, although it is found to have\nrelatively small impacts on the large-scale freshwater distribution in\ncomprehensive model simulations. The results suggest that accurate\nrepresentations of iceberg rolling may be of particular importance for\noperational forecast models of iceberg drift, as well as for regional changes\nin high-resolution climate model simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In\norder to achieve more power efficiency, we design a directional modulation\nprecoder by considering an $M$-QAM constellation, particularly with\n$M=4,8,16,32$. First, extended detection regions are defined for desired\nconstellations using analytical geometry. Then, constellation points are placed\nin the optimal positions of these regions while the minimum Euclidean distance\nto adjacent constellation points and detection region boundaries is kept as in\nthe conventional $M$-QAM modulation. For further power efficiency and symbol\nerror rate similar to that of fixed design in high SNR, relaxed detection\nregions are modeled for inner points of $M=16,32$ constellations. The modeled\nextended and relaxed detection regions as well as the modulation\ncharacteristics are utilized to formulate symbol-level precoder design problems\nfor directional modulation to minimize the transmission power while preserving\nthe minimum required SNR at the destination. In addition, the extended and\nrelaxed detection regions are used for precoder design to minimize the output\nof each power amplifier.

I argue that in practice, they\ncompliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by\nthe Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in\nclassical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist\nview of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on\nthe understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was\nunknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not\nunderstand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an\nunderstanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus\nbe likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism.

Forcing is\napplied by a synthetic jet at the edge of the step at Strouhal numbers ranging\nfrom $0.21<St_H<1.98$ ($St_H = f H/U_\\infty$) at a Reynolds number of $Re_H =\nHU_\\infty/\\nu = 41000$. In the literature, the effect of Strouhal number on the\nreattachment length is often divided into low- and high frequency actuation,\nreferring to different frequency modes in the unforced flow. In the present\npaper, variations with Strouhal number are explained based on entrainment\nrather than frequency modes. The reattachment length is shown to decrease\nlinearly with entrainment. Entrainment is driven by vortices generated by the\nforcing and locally entrainment is shown to be qualitatively similar to\ncirculation for all cases considered. Total circulation (and therewith\nentrainment and the effect on the reattachment length) is shown to decrease\nwith Strouhal number whereas this is not predicted by models based on frequency\nmodes. An empirical model for the (decay of) circulation is derived by tracking\nvortices in phase-locked data. This model is used to decipher relevant scaling\nparameters that explain the variations in circulation, entrainment and\nreattachment length. A low-Strouhal-number regime is observed for which\nvortices are formed at a late stage relative to the recirculation region,\ncausing a decrease in effectiveness. For high Strouhal numbers vortices are\nbeing re-ingested into the actuator or are packed so close together that they\ncancel each other, both decreasing the effectiveness of forcing. In the\nintermediate regime a vortex train is formed of which the decay of circulation\nincreases for increasing Strouhal number. The scaling of this decay fully\nexplains the observed variation in reattachment length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 17:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

In particular, the\nstatistical occurrence of their surface magnetism has been established (~10%)\nand the field origin is now understood to be fossil. However, fundamental\nquestions remain: how do these fossil fields evolve during the post-main\nsequence phases, and how do they influence the evolution of hot stars from the\nmain sequence to their ultimate demise? Filling the void of known magnetic\nevolved hot (OBA) stars, studying the evolution of their fossil magnetic fields\nalong stellar evolution, and understanding the impact of these fields on the\nangular momentum, rotation, mass loss, and evolution of the star itself, is\ncrucial to answering these questions, with far reaching consequences, in\nparticular for the properties of the precursors of supernovae explosions and\nstellar remnants. In the framework of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey and\nLIFE project, we have discovered the first few magnetic hot supergiants. Their\nlongitudinal surface magnetic field is very weak but their configuration\nresembles those of main sequence hot stars.

The turbulence directly\naffects the dynamics of the explosion, but there is also the possibility of an\nadditional, indirect, feedback mechanism due to the effect turbulence can have\nupon neutrino flavor evolution and thus the neutrino heating. In this paper we\nconsider the effect of turbulence during the accretion phase upon neutrino\nevolution, both numerically and analytically. Adopting representative supernova\nprofiles taken from the accretion phase of a supernova simulation, we find the\nnumerical calculations exhibit no effect from turbulence. We explain this\nabsence using two analytic descriptions: the Stimulated Transition model and\nthe Distorted Phase Effect model. In the Stimulated Transition model turbulence\neffects depend upon six different lengthscales, and three criteria must be\nsatisfied between them if one is to observe a change in the flavor evolution\ndue to Stimulated Transition. We further demonstrate that the Distorted Phase\nEffect depends upon the presence of multiple semi-adiabatic MSW resonances or\ndiscontinuities that also can be expressed as a relationship between three of\nthe same lengthscales. When we examine the supernova profiles used in the\nnumerical calculations we find the three Stimulated Transition criteria cannot\nbe satisfied, independent of the form of the turbulence power spectrum, and\nthat the same supernova profiles lack the multiple semi-adiabatic MSW\nresonances or discontinuities necessary to produce a Distorted Phase Effect.\nThus we conclude that even though large amplitude turbulence is present in\nsupernova during the accretion phase, it has no effect upon neutrino flavor\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 17:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 14:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

The quantum\ncircuit model is applicable for at most 140 $e$-folds of inflationary and\npost-inflationary expansion: we argue that no geometric description was\npossible before the time $t_1$ when our comoving region was one Planck length\nacross, and contained one pair of entangled degrees of freedom. This approach\ncould provide a framework for modeling the initial state of inflationary\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 01:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

Recent upper\nlimits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background obtained by PTAs are\nstarting being in marginal tension with theoretical models for the pairing and\norbital evolution of these systems. This tension can be resolved by assuming\nthat these binaries are more eccentric or interact more strongly with the\nenvironment (gas and stars) than expected, or by accounting for possible\nselection biases in the construction of the theoretical models. However,\nanother (pessimistic) possibility is that these binaries do not merge at all,\nbut stall at large ($\\sim$ pc) separations.

Moreover, we\nargue that this scenario is too pessimistic, because our model predicts the\nexistence of a sub-population of binaries with small mass ratios ($q \\lesssim\n10^{-3}$) that should merge within a Hubble time simply as a result of\ngravitational-wave emission.

Most existing algorithms are provably efficient only\nwhen each $S_i$ has finite and moderately valued fourth moment. However, there\nare practical applications where this assumption need not be true, such as\nspeech and finance. Algorithms have been proposed for heavy-tailed ICA, but\nthey are not practical, using random walks and the full power of the ellipsoid\nalgorithm multiple times. The main contributions of this paper are:\n  (1) A practical algorithm for heavy-tailed ICA that we call HTICA. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees and show that it outperforms other algorithms in some\nheavy-tailed regimes, both on real and synthetic data. Like the current\nstate-of-the-art, the new algorithm is based on the centroid body (a first\nmoment analogue of the covariance matrix). Unlike the state-of-the-art, our\nalgorithm is practically efficient. To achieve this, we use explicit analytic\nrepresentations of the centroid body, which bypasses the use of the ellipsoid\nmethod and random walks.\n  (2) We study how heavy tails affect different ICA algorithms, including\nHTICA. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that some algorithms that use the\ncovariance matrix or higher moments can successfully solve a range of ICA\ninstances with infinite second moment. We study this theoretically and\nexperimentally, with both synthetic and real-world heavy-tailed data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 19:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

The critical phase gradient (analog of the Landau critical\nvelocity in superfluids) is proportional to intensity of the coherent spin wave\n(number of condensed magnons). The conclusion is that although spin\nsuperfluidity in YIG films is possible in principle, the published claim of its\nobservation is not justified.\n  The analysis revealed that the widely accepted spin-wave spectrum in YIG\nfilms with magnetostatic and exchange interaction required revision. This led\nto revision of non-linear corrections, which determine stability of the magnon\ncondensate with and without spin supercurrents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 20:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 12:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

In these beams,\npower and orbital angular momentum are permanently transferred to matter in the\ninner, nonlinear rings, at the same time that they are refueled by spiral\ninward currents of energy and angular momentum coming from the outer linear\nrings, acting as an intrinsic reservoir. Unlike vortex solitons and dissipative\nvortex solitons, the existence of these vortex beams does not critically depend\non the precise form of the dispersive nonlinearities, as Kerr self-focusing or\nself-defocusing, and do not require a balancing gain. They have been shown to\nplay a prominent role in \"tubular\" filamentation experiments with powerful,\nvortex-carrying Bessel beams, where they act as attractors in the beam\npropagation dynamics. Nonlinear Bessel vortex beams provide indeed a new\nsolution to the problem of the stable propagation of ring-shaped vortex light\nbeams in homogeneous self-focusing Kerr media. A stability analysis\ndemonstrates that there exist nonlinear Bessel vortex beams with single or\nmultiple vorticity that are stable against azimuthal breakup and collapse, and\nthat the mechanism that renders these vortexes stable is dissipation.

To date pedestrian dynamics have\nbeen primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences.

However, pedestrians in crowds also\nbehave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as\nhuman subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies.\nTo show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the\nnatural sciences we propose the application of three categories: phenomena,\nbehavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in\nwhich minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in\nwhich sociological and psychological concepts are needed.\n  To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a\nlarge group of people (n=270) enters a concert hall through two different\nspatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to\neveryday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks.\nMethods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical\nmeasurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the\nentrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large\nvariations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n=60) reveals how people perceive\nand evaluate these entrance situations.

However, to reap\nthe benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi\ndeployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is\nproposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base\nstations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively\nperform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum\naccess while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other\nLTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future\ndelay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction\nwindow ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of\nthe unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served\nLTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in\nwhich SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence\nof future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with\nWLAN and other LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep\nlearning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium\n(NE), when it converges.

The second essay investigates bidders' anticipated winner\nand loser regret in the context of the eBay online auction platform.

However, big\ndata is mostly structured but can be semi-structured or unstructured. It is\nnormally so large that it is not only difficult but also slow to process using\ntraditional computing systems. One of the solutions is to format the data as\ngraph data structures and process them on shared memory architecture to use\nfast and novel policies such as transactional memory. In most graph\napplications in big data type problems such as bioinformatics, social networks,\nand cyber security, graphs are sparse in nature. Due to this sparsity, we have\nthe opportunity to use Transactional Memory (TM) as the synchronization policy\nfor critical sections to speedup applications. At low conflict probability TM\nperforms better than most synchronization policies due to its inherent\nnon-blocking characteristics. TM can be implemented in Software, Hardware or a\ncombination of both. However, hardware TM implementations are fast but limited\nby scarce hardware resources while software implementations have high overheads\nwhich can degrade performance. In this paper, we develop a low overhead, yet\nsimple, dynamically adaptive (i.e. at runtime) hybrid (i.e. combines hardware\nand software) TM (DyAdHyTM) scheme that combines the best features of both\nHardware TM (HTM) and Software TM (STM) while adapting to application\nrequirements.

Well-known approaches include multi-continuum techniques, which have\nbeen commonly used in approximating subgrid effects for flow and transport in\nfractured media. Our goal in this paper is to (1) show a relation between\nmulti-continuum approaches and Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method\n(GMsFEM) and (2) to discuss coupling these approaches for solving problems in\ncomplex multiscale fractured media. The GMsFEM, a systematic approach,\nconstructs multiscale basis functions via local spectral decomposition in\npre-computed snapshot spaces. We show that GMsFEM can automatically identify\nseparate fracture networks via local spectral problems. We discuss the relation\nbetween these basis functions and continuums in multi-continuum methods. The\nGMsFEM can automatically detect each continuum and represent the interaction\nbetween the continuum and its surrounding (matrix). For problems with\nsimplified fracture networks, we propose a simplified basis construction with\nthe GMsFEM. This simplified approach is effective when the fracture networks\nare known and have simplified geometries. We show that this approach can\nachieve a similar result compared to the results using the GMsFEM with spectral\nbasis functions. Further, we discuss the coupling between the GMsFEM and\nmulti-continuum approaches. In this case, many fractures are resolved while for\nunresolved fractures, we use a multi-continuum approach with local\nRepresentative Volume Element (RVE) information. As a result, the method deals\nwith a system of equations on a coarse grid, where each equation represents one\nof the continua on the fine grid.

With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure\nthree of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of\nsystematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of\northogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large\naperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum\nhalf-wave plate diameter of $\\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between\nthe primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address\nthe intensity to polarization ($I{\\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which\nbecomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics\nthat arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the\nperformance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a\nGregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is\nplaced near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors. We find\nthat the $I{\\rightarrow}P$ leakage is larger than the expectation from the\nphysical properties of our primary mirror, resulting in a 1/f knee of 100 mHz.\nThe excess leakage could be due to imperfections in the detector system, i.e.\ndetector non-linearity in the responsivity and time-constant. We demonstrate,\nhowever, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,\nthe 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\\ell \\sim$39 for our scan\nstrategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal. We\nalso discuss methods for further noise subtraction in future projects where the\nprecise temperature control of instrumental components and the leakage\nreduction will play a key role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 06:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2017 07:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

Two different research groups have proposed\nmodified Bloch equation for anomalous diffusion. However, these equations have\ndifferent forms and, therefore, yield inconsistent results. The discrepancy in\nthese reported modified Bloch equations may arise from different ways of\ncombining the fractional diffusion equation with the precession equation where\nthe time derivatives have different derivative orders and forms. Moreover, to\nthe best of my knowledge, the general PFG signal attenuation expression\nincluding finite gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect for time-space fractional\ndiffusion based on the fractional derivative has yet to be reported by other\nmethods. Here, based on different combination strategy, two new modified Bloch\nequations are proposed, which belong to two significantly different types: a\ndifferential type based on the fractal derivative and an integral type based on\nthe fractional derivative. The merit of the integral type modified Bloch\nequation is that the original properties of the contributions from linear or\nnonlinear processes remain unchanged at the instant of the combination. The\ngeneral solutions including the FGPW effect were derived from these two\nequations as well as from two other methods: a method observing the signal\nintensity at the origin and the recently reported effective phase shift\ndiffusion equation method. The relaxation effect was also considered. It is\nfound that the relaxation behavior influenced by fractional diffusion based on\nthe fractional derivative deviates from that of normal diffusion. The general\nsolution agrees perfectly with continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulations\nas well as reported literature results. The new modified Bloch equations is a\nvaluable tool to describe PFG anomalous diffusion in NMR and MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 07:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

The difficulty in filter-based observations, contrary to spectral\nobservations, is to determine which processes contribute to the observed\nbrightening during flares. Here we determine the contribution of the Balmer\ncontinuum and the spectral line emission to IRIS' SJI 2832 emission by\nanalyzing the appropriate passband in simultaneous IRIS NUV spectra. We find\nthat spectral line emission can contribute up to 100% to the observed SJI\nemission, that the relative contributions usually temporally vary, and that the\nhighest SJI enhancements that are observed are most likely because of the\nBalmer continuum. We conclude that care should be taken when calling SJI 2832 a\ncontinuum filter during flares, because the influence of the lines on the\nemission can be significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 10:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

The extreme\nabstractness of creativity makes it harder to quantify in its entirety. Yet, a\nlot of efforts have been made both by psychologists and neurobiologists to\nidentify its signature. A general conformity is expressed in the Free\nassociation theory, i.e. the more freely a persons conceptual nodes are\nconnected, the more divergent thinker (also, creative) he or she is. Also,\ntolerance of ambiguity is found to be related to divergent thinking. In this\nstudy, we approach the problem of creativity from a theoretical physics\nstandpoint. Theoretically, for the initial conceptual state, the next jump to\nany other node is equally probable and non-deterministic. Repeated intervention\nof external stimulus (analogous to a measurement) is responsible for such\njumps. And to study such a non-deterministic system with continuous\nmeasurements, Quantum theory has been proven the most successful, time and\nagain. We suggest that this collection of nodes form a system which is likely\nto be governed by quantum physics and specify the transformations which could\nhelp explain the conceptual jump between states. Our argument, from the point\nof view of physics is that the initial evolution of the creative process is\nidentical, person or field independent. To answer the next obvious question\nabout individual creativity, we hypothesize that the quantum system, under\ncontinuous measurements (in the form of external stimuli) evolves with chaotic\ndynamics, hence separating a painter from a musician. Possible experimental\nmethodology of these effects has also been suggested using ambiguous figures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 13:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Numerical models are powerful and necessary\ntools to optimize their design and predict their performance. The\nelectromagnetic modeling of superconductors by finite-element method (FEM) is\nusually based on a power-law resistivity for their electrical behavior. The\nimplementation of such constitutive law in conventional models of electrical\nmachines is quite problematic: the magnetic vector potential directly gives the\nelectric field and requires using a power-law depending on it. This power-law\nis a non-bounded function that can generate enormous uneven values in low\nelectric field regions that can destroy the reliability of solutions. The\nmethod proposed here consists in separating the model of an electrical machine\nin two parts, where the magnetic field is calculated with the most appropriate\nformulation: the H-formulation in the part containing the superconductors and\nthe A-formulation in the part containing conventional conductors (and possibly\npermanent magnets). The main goal of this work is to determine and to correctly\napply the continuity conditions on the boundary separating the two regions.\nDepending on the location of such boundary -- in the fixed or rotating part of\nthe machine -- the conditions that one needs to apply are different. In\naddition, the application of those conditions requires the use of Lagrange\nmultipliers satisfying the field transforms of the electromagnetic quantities\nin the two reference systems, the fixed and the rotating one. In this article,\nseveral exemplary cases for the possible configurations are presented. In order\nto emphasize and capture the essential point of this modeling strategy, the\ndiscussed examples are rather simple. Nevertheless, they constitute a solid\nstarting point for modeling more complex and realistic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 12:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}
