Sharing through secure\ncomputation and differential privacy allows these partners to perform private\ncomputations on their sensitive data in controlled ways. However, in reality,\nthere exist complex relationships among members. Politics, regulations,\ninterest, trust, data demands and needs are one of the many reasons. Thus,\nthere is a need for a mechanism to meet these conflicting relationships on data\nsharing. This paper presents Curie, an approach to exchange data among members\nwhose membership has complex relationships. The CPL policy language that allows\nmembers to define the specifications of data exchange requirements is\nintroduced. Members (partners) assert who and what to exchange through their\nlocal policies and negotiate a global sharing agreement. The agreement is\nimplemented in a multi-party computation that guarantees sharing among members\nwill comply with the policy as negotiated. The use of Curie is validated\nthrough an example of a health care application built on recently introduced\nsecure multi-party computation and differential privacy frameworks, and policy\nand performance trade-offs are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 16:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 04:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Big Data for Social Good: Through prediction algorithms the results show\nhow mobile phone data can be useful to predict important socio-economic\nindicators, such as income, illiteracy and poverty in developing countries.\nSuch knowledge can be used to identify where vulnerable groups in society are,\nreduce economic shocks and is a critical component for monitoring poverty rates\nover time.

One remarkable example is surface\ngravimetry, where frequencies from Earth tides correspond to time-series\nfluctuations up to a thousand times larger than the phenomena of major\ninterest, such as hydrological gravity effects or co-seismic gravity changes.\nThis work discusses general methods for removal of unwanted dominating signals\nby applying them to 8 long-period gravity time-series of the International\nGeodynamics and Earth Tides Service, equivalent to the acquisition from 8\ninstruments in 5 locations representative of the network. We compare three\ndifferent conceptual approaches for tide removal: frequency filtering, physical\nmodelling and data-based modelling. Each approach reveals a different\nlimitation to be considered depending on the intended application. Vestiges of\ntides remain in the residues for the modelling procedures, whereas the signal\nwas distorted in different ways by the filtering and data-based procedures. The\nlinear techniques employed were power spectral density, spectrogram,\ncross-correlation and classical harmonics decomposition, while the system\ndynamics was analysed by state-space reconstruction and estimation of the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent. Although the tides could not be completely\neliminated, they were sufficiently reduced to allow observation of geophysical\nevents of interest above the $10 \\text{ nm s}^{-2}$ level, exemplified by a\nhydrology-related event of $60 \\text{ nm s}^{-2}$.

This process is prone to fitting\ninstability and partial information loss due to model simplicity. We reveal\nunexplored potentials of the signal by integrating all data processing\ncomponents into a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is\ndesigned to propagate clinical target information down to the raw input images.\nThis approach enables simultaneous and target-specific optimization of image\nnormalization, signal exploitation, global representation learning and\nclassification. Using a multicentric data set of 222 patients, we demonstrate\nthat our approach significantly improves clinical decision making with respect\nto the current state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 17:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 09:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 08:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

It is important to apply such models to different\ndomains because collecting many labeled samples in various domains is\nexpensive. In unsupervised domain adaptation, one needs to train a classifier\nthat works well on a target domain when provided with labeled source samples\nand unlabeled target samples. Although many methods aim to match the\ndistributions of source and target samples, simply matching the distribution\ncannot ensure accuracy on the target domain. To learn discriminative\nrepresentations for the target domain, we assume that artificially labeling\ntarget samples can result in a good representation. Tri-training leverages\nthree classifiers equally to give pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, but the\nmethod does not assume labeling samples generated from a different domain.In\nthis paper, we propose an asymmetric tri-training method for unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and train\nneural networks as if they are true labels. In our work, we use three networks\nasymmetrically. By asymmetric, we mean that two networks are used to label\nunlabeled target samples and one network is trained by the samples to obtain\ntarget-discriminative representations.

We define\nthe geoid as a level surface of a time-independent redshift potential. Such a\nredshift potential exists in any stationary spacetime. Therefore, our geoid is\nwell defined for any rigidly rotating object with constant angular velocity and\na fixed rotation axis that is not subject to external forces. Our definition is\noperational because the level surfaces of a redshift potential can be realized\nwith the help of standard clocks, which may be connected by optical fibers.\nTherefore, these surfaces are also called isochronometric surfaces.

All previous\nconstructions on spectral sparsification require either super-linear number of\nedges or $m^{1+\\Omega(1)}$ time.\n  In this work we answer this question affirmatively by presenting an algorithm\nthat, for any undirected graph $G$ and $\\varepsilon>0$, outputs a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spectral sparsifier of $G$ with $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ edges in\n$\\tilde{O}(m/\\varepsilon^{O(1)})$ time. Our algorithm is based on three novel\ntechniques: (1) a new potential function which is much easier to compute yet\nhas similar guarantees as the potential functions used in previous references;\n(2) an efficient reduction from a two-sided spectral sparsifier to a one-sided\nspectral sparsifier; (3) constructing a one-sided spectral sparsifier by a\nsemi-definite program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 18:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The accompanying information loss implies that\ngoal-oriented behavior is in one-to-one correspondence with an open subsystem\nwhose entropy decreases in time. Yet ultimately, the laws of physics are\nreversible, so systems capable of yielding goal-directed behavior must transfer\nthe information about initial conditions to other degrees of freedom outside\nthe boundaries of the agent. To operate steadily, they must consume ordered\ndegrees of freedom provided as input, and be dispensed of disordered outputs\nthat act as wastes from the point of view of the aimed objective. Here I argue\nthat a physical system may or may not display goal-directed behavior depending\non what exactly is defined as the agent.

In this paper, we look at the\nproblem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is\nrequired. In addition, given an unlabeled image, the generative model can\ndirectly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional\nadversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold, traversing on which\nsmooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE,\nthe face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder,\nand then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age\nthrough a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized\nface features (i.e., personality) and the age condition controls progression\nvs. regression. Two adversarial networks are imposed on the encoder and\ngenerator, respectively, forcing to generate more photo-realistic faces.\nExperimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of\nthe proposed framework by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 18:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 20:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

The\ntheory relies on a separation of length scales to describe transport in the\nelectrode coupled to intercalation within small active material particles.\nTypically, the active materials are described as solid solution particles with\ntransport and surface reactions driven by concentration fields, and the\nthermodynamics are incorporated through fitting of the open circuit potential.\nThis approach has fundamental limitations, however, and does not apply to\nphase-separating materials, for which the voltage is an emergent property of\ninhomogeneous concentration profiles, even in equilibrium. Here, we present a\ngeneral theoretical framework for \"multiphase porous electrode theory\"\nimplemented in an open-source software package called \"MPET\", based on\nelectrochemical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Cahn-Hilliard-type phase field\nmodels are used to describe the solid active materials with suitably\ngeneralized models of interfacial reaction kinetics. Classical concentrated\nsolution theory is implemented for the electrolyte phase, and Newman's porous\nelectrode theory is recovered in the limit of solid-solution active materials\nwith Butler-Volmer kinetics. More general, quantum-mechanical models of\nFaradaic reactions are also included, such as Marcus-Hush-Chidsey kinetics for\nelectron transfer at metal electrodes, extended for concentrated solutions. The\nfull equations and numerical algorithms are described, and a variety of example\ncalculations are presented to illustrate the novel features of the software\ncompared to existing battery models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 18:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the\ncolumn density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any\ncombination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.\nFurthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single\nsources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction\nvector to (extinction-free) control field observations.

Interactions between DM and\nneutrinos have also been proposed to address the long-standing \"missing\nsatellites\" problem in the field of large scale structure formation. Motivated\nby these considerations, in this paper we discuss realistic scenarios with\nlight steriles coupled to DM. We point out that within this framework active\nneutrinos acquire an effective coupling to DM that manifests itself as a new\nmatter potential in the propagation within a medium of asymmetric DM.

All dimensionless ratios of\nfundamental dimensional quantities, e.g. particle masses and the Planck mass,\nas well as the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions, are fixed\nconstants. An interplay between the positive energy density associated with\nrelativistic matter (and possibly with negative spatial curvature) and the\nnegative energy associated with dynamical dilaton phase results in a\nnon-singular, flat cosmological model with no horizon, and -- as a direct\nconsequence of absence of phase transitions in the early universe -- with no\nproduction of topological defects. The (logarithmic) time-derivative of the\nfield modulus is degenerate with the Hubble function, and all cosmological\nepochs of the standard model are unchanged except at the very early universe.\nWe demonstrate that both linear order perturbation theory and the spherical\ncollapse model are equivalent to those in the standard model, up to\nmodifications caused by the phase of the (complex) scalar field and its\nperturbations. Consequently, our alternative theory automatically passes the\nmain classical cosmological tests. Quantum excitations of the phase of the\nscalar field generate a slightly red-tilted spectrum of adiabatic and gaussian\nscalar perturbations on the largest scales. However, this framework does not\nprovide a similar mechanism for producing primordial gravitational waves on\nthese scales. A spherically symmetric vacuum solution that approximately\ndescribes the exterior of gravitationally bound systems (e.g., stars and\ngalaxies) by a modified Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, augmented with an\nadditional linear potential term, could possibly explain galactic rotation\ncurves and strong gravitational lensing with no recourse to dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 19:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 15:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

In\naddition, we find the equilibration time of the two-point function to be\nlinearly increasing with respect to the separation of the two points with a\nfixed slope, regardless of the initial configuration that we start with.\nFinally we observe that, for larger separations the geodesic connecting two\npoints on the boundary crosses the event horizon after it has reached its final\nequilibrium value, meaning that the two-point function can probe behind the\nevent horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 19:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 12:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This phenomenon is often referred to as all optical switching (AOS).\nHowever, so far, GdFeCo remains the only material system where such\ndeterministic switching has been observed.

One approach has been to\ntest whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny\ndistributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given\nnumber of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is\nthe distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model we show\nthat these distributions consist of two phases: a power law phase with a\nconstant exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with\nvery large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model\nparameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical\npatterns are consistent with neutral evolution.

The other two are less trivial and tend to be larger; they are due to\ndifferences in how the background sky is estimated and what model is fit to the\nsurface brightness profile. We show that PyMorph sky estimates are fainter than\nthose of the SDSS DR7 or DR9 pipelines, but are in excellent agreement with the\nestimates of Blanton et al. (2011). Using the SDSS sky biases luminosities by\nmore than a few tenths of a magnitude for objects with half-light radii > 7\narcseconds. In the SDSS main galaxy sample these are typically luminous\ngalaxies, so they are not necessarily nearby.

Our experiments with 2-, 3-, and 4-mode large real-world networks\nshow that this type of patterns is suitable for community detection in\nmulti-mode cases within reasonable time even though the number of corresponding\n$n$-cliques is still unknown due to computation difficulties. An interpretation\nof OA-biclusters for 1-mode networks is provided as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 22:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Second, assuming:\n(i) narrowband channels and a fully digital architecture at sub-6 GHz; and (ii)\nwideband frequency selective channels, OFDM signaling, and an analog\narchitecture at mmWave, we outline strategies to incorporate sub-6 GHz spatial\ninformation in mmWave compressed beam selection. We formulate compressed\nbeam-selection as a weighted sparse signal recovery problem, and obtain the\nweighting information from sub-6 GHz channels. In addition, we outline a\nstructured precoder/combiner design to tailor the training to out-of-band\ninformation. We also extend the proposed out-of-band aided compressed\nbeam-selection approach to leverage information from all active OFDM\nsubcarriers. The simulation results for achievable rate show that out-of-band\naided beam-selection can reduce the training overhead of in-band only\nbeam-selection by 4x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 22:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Based on the luminosity from the core components ($L_{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~narrow}$) and from the extended components ($L_{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~ext}$), we confirm that the correlation of $L_{{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~ext}}~-~L_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\AA}}}$ is more stronger and\ntighter than the correlations on the total \\oiii luminosity and on the\nluminosity of the core components of the \\oiii lines. Therefore, the luminosity\nof the extended components should be better applied to trace AGN intrinsic\nluminosity. Meanwhile, we have found strong line width correlation and line\nluminosity correlation between the core components and the extended components,\nindicating the extended components of the \\oiii lines should be not due to\ncommonly considered radial flows in the common \\oiii line clouds. And virial\neffects due to gravity of central black holes naturally lead to the wider\nextended components from regions more nearer to central black holes. Finally,\nwe can say that the reported correlation of $L_{{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~narrow}}~-~L_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\AA}}}$ on the core components\nof the \\oiii lines should be more better to estimate AGN intrinsic luminosity\nin Type-2 narrow line AGN, because of totally/partly obscured extended\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 02:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

It\ncan therefore be difficult to predict what agent behaviors might emerge. In\nthis paper, we consider an information-theoretic cost function for performing\nconstrained stochastic searches that promote the formation of risk-averse to\nrisk-favoring behaviors. This cost function is the value of information, which\nprovides the optimal trade-off between the expected return of a policy and the\npolicy's complexity; policy complexity is measured by number of bits and\ncontrolled by a single hyperparameter on the cost function. As the policy\ncomplexity is reduced, the agents will increasingly eschew risky actions. This\nreduces the potential for high accrued rewards. As the policy complexity\nincreases, the agents will take actions, regardless of the risk, that can raise\nthe long-term rewards. The obtainable reward depends on a single, tunable\nhyperparameter that regulates the degree of policy complexity.\n  We evaluate the performance of value-of-information-based policies on a\nstochastic version of Ms. Pac-Man. A major component of this paper is the\ndemonstration that ranges of policy complexity values yield different game-play\nstyles and explaining why this occurs.

In particular, we provide conditions for a generalization of the\ngeneric model theorem to metric sheaves. The essentials of the model theory of\nmetric sheaves appeared in the form of Conference Proceedings. We provide a\nversion of those results, for the sake of completeness, and then build metric\nsheaves for physical systems in the second part of the paper. Specifically,\nmetric sheaves for quantum mechanical systems with pure point and continuous\nspectra are constructed. In the former case, every fiber is a finite projective\nHilbert space determined by the family of invariant subspaces of a given\noperator with pure point spectrum, and we also consider unitary transformations\nin a finite-dimensional space. For an operator with continuous spectrum, every\nfiber is a two sorted structure of subsets of the Schwartz space of rapidly\ndecreasing functions that includes imperfect representations of position and\nmomentum states. The imperfection character is parametrically determined by the\nelements on the base space and refined in the generic model.

However, its\nuse for action recognition, especially in the context of convolutional neural\nnetworks (ConvNets), has not been previously studied. In this paper, we propose\nthe extraction and use of scene flow for action recognition from RGB-D data.\nPrevious works have considered the depth and RGB modalities as separate\nchannels and extract features for later fusion. We take a different approach\nand consider the modalities as one entity, thus allowing feature extraction for\naction recognition at the beginning. Two key questions about the use of scene\nflow for action recognition are addressed: how to organize the scene flow\nvectors and how to represent the long term dynamics of videos based on scene\nflow. In order to calculate the scene flow correctly on the available datasets,\nwe propose an effective self-calibration method to align the RGB and depth data\nspatially without knowledge of the camera parameters. Based on the scene flow\nvectors, we propose a new representation, namely, Scene Flow to Action Map\n(SFAM), that describes several long term spatio-temporal dynamics for action\nrecognition. We adopt a channel transform kernel to transform the scene flow\nvectors to an optimal color space analogous to RGB.

However, as existing works on\nlearning using PI only consider instance-level PI (privileged instances), they\nfail to make use of bag-level PI (privileged bags) available in MIML learning.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stream fully convolutional network,\nnamed MIML-FCN+, unified by a novel PI loss to solve the problem of MIML\nlearning with privileged bags. Compared to the previous works on PI, the\nproposed MIML-FCN+ utilizes the readily available privileged bags, instead of\nhard-to-obtain privileged instances, making the system more general and\npractical in real world applications. As the proposed PI loss is convex and SGD\ncompatible and the framework itself is a fully convolutional network, MIML-FCN+\ncan be easily integrated with state of-the-art deep learning networks.\nMoreover, the flexibility of convolutional layers allows us to exploit\nstructured correlations among instances to facilitate more effective training\nand testing.

An exact equation describing the evolution is derived.\nContinualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is\ncarried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The\nsolution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two\nterms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At\nshort times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by\nredistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process).\nCharacteristic time of this process is of order of ten periods of atomic\nvibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused by ballistic\nheat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a\nsuperposition of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and\npropagating with group velocities dependent on the wave vector.

This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the\ndiscrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be\nviewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of\nsuch equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of\nLagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar\nfunctions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of\nindependent variables. The variational principle involves variations not only\nwith respect to the field variables, but also with respect to the geometry in\nthe space of independent variables. In this paper we consider a quantum\nanalogue of this new variational principle by means of quantum propagators (or\nequivalently Feynman path integrals). In the case of quadratic Lagrangians\nthese can be evaluated in terms of Gaussian integrals.

Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia).

We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets.

While GPUs excel at\ndata-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that\nexpose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the\nmemory hierarchy.\n  We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55% of theoretical\npeak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x\nfaster than prior GPU state of the art. We apply it in different similarity\nsearch scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate\nand compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these\nsetups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins.

In the context of Multi-agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource\nabstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource\nabstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource\nallocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance\nand applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented\nassumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the\nliterature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both\nsettings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource\nand keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can\npromote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a\nreal-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what\nknowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network\nDomain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of\na network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the\nload on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application\nof state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse\ntheir performance.

The method is able to provide all the kinetic details of the process\nalongside the fluid-level quantities self consistently. Solitons are produced\nnaturally by utilizing the chain formation phenomenon, then are arranged in a\nnew simulation box to test different scenarios of overtaking collisions. Three\nachievements are reported here. Firstly, simulations prove the long-time life\nspan of the ion-acoustic solitons in the presence of trapping effect of\nelectrons (kinetic effects), which serves as the benchmark of the simulation\ncode. Secondly, their stability against overtaking mutual collisions is\nestablished by creating collisions between solitons with different number and\nshapes of trapped electrons, i.e. different trapping parameter. Finally,\ndetails of solitons during collisions for both ions and electrons are provided\non both fluid and kinetic levels. These results show that on the kinetic level,\ntrapped electron population accompanying each of the solitons are exchanged\nbetween the solitons during the collision. Furthermore, the behavior of\nelectron holes accompanying solitons contradicts the theory about the electron\nholes interaction developed based on kinetic theory. They also show behaviors\nmuch different from other electron holes witnessed in processes such as\nnonlinear Landau damping (Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal -BGK- modes) or beam-plasma\ninteraction (like two-beam instability).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 12:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

One way to do so is through\ncompositional models, which are formed by combining blocks consisting of\nsimpler models. One can increase the complexity of the compositional model by\neither stacking more blocks or by using a not-so-simple model as a building\nblock. This thesis is an example of the latter. One first aim is to expand the\nchoice of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) blocks for constructing tractable\ncompositional models. So far, most of the models that have a Bayesian\nnonparametric component use a Dirichlet Process or a Pitman-Yor process because\nof the availability of tractable and compact representations. This thesis shows\nhow to overcome certain intractabilities in order to obtain analogous compact\nrepresentations for the class of Poisson-Kingman priors which includes the\nDirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes.\n  A major impediment to the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric building\nblocks is that inference is often costly, intractable or difficult to carry\nout. This is an active research area since dealing with the model's infinite\ndimensional component forbids the direct use of standard simulation-based\nmethods. The main contribution of this thesis is a variety of inference schemes\nthat tackle this problem: Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo\nmethods, which are exact inference schemes since they target the true\nposterior. The contributions of this thesis, in a larger context, provide\ngeneral purpose exact inference schemes in the flavour or probabilistic\nprogramming: the user is able to choose from a variety of models, focusing only\non the modelling part. Indeed, if the wide enough class of Poisson-Kingman\npriors is used as one of our blocks, this objective is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 13:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

A key\nfeature of the model is that in high density regimes all non-trivial minimisers\nare zero on a set of positive measure so that L^infinity variations cannot\ngenerally be taken about minimisers. In particular, it is unclear if the\nEuler-Lagrange equation is well defined, and if local minimisers satisfy it. It\nwill be shown that there exists an analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equation that\nis satisfied by L^p local minimisers by reducing the minimisation problem to an\nequivalent finite-dimensional saddle-point problem, obtained by observing that\non certain subsets of the domain the free-energy functional is convex so that\nduality methods can be applied. This analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equation is\nthen shown to be equivalent to a vanishing variation criteria on a certain\nfamily of non-linear curves on which the free- energy functional is\nsufficiently smooth. All critical points of the finite-dimensional saddle-point\nproblem also correspond to all probability distributions where these non-linear\nvariations vanish.

A baseline scenario is considered in which IoT sensor data\nare shared directly with an untrustworthy central aggregator. A grouping\nmechanism is introduced that improves privacy by sharing data aggregated first\nat a group level compared as opposed to sharing data directly to the central\naggregator. Group-level aggregation obfuscates sensor data of individuals, in a\nsimilar fashion as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption schemes,\nthus inference of privacy-sensitive information from single sensors becomes\ncomputationally harder compared to the baseline scenario.

Since the formation of such compact remnants releases\nover hundred times more energy in neutrinos than the SN in the explosion,\nneutrinos can be the decisive agents for powering the SN outburst. According to\nthe standard paradigm of the neutrino-driven mechanism, the energy transfer by\nthe intense neutrino flux to the medium behind the stagnating core-bounce\nshock, assisted by violent hydrodynamic mass motions (sometimes subsumed by the\nterm \"turbulence\"), revives the outward shock motion and thus initiates the SN\nblast.

In this\ncontribution, we ask the question of how people actually respond to ordinal\nscales. The main problem observed is that users tend to be volatile in their\nchoices, i.e. complex cognitions do not always lead to the same decisions, but\nto distributions of possible decision outputs. This human uncertainty may\nsometimes have quite an impact on common data mining approaches and thus, the\nquestion of effective modelling this so called human uncertainty emerges\nnaturally.\n  Our contribution introduces two different approaches for modelling the human\nuncertainty of user responses. In doing so, we develop techniques in order to\nmeasure this uncertainty at the level of user inputs as well as the level of\nuser cognition. With support of comprehensive user experiments and large-scale\nsimulations, we systematically compare both methodologies along with their\nimplications for personalisation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that\nsignificant amounts of users do submit something completely different (action)\nthan they really have in mind (cognition). Moreover, we demonstrate that\nstatistically sound evidence with respect to algorithm assessment becomes quite\nhard to realise, especially when explicit rankings shall be built.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Excitation is provided by an\nintegrated UV LED (370 nm) and detection obtained using the in-built CMOS\ncamera. A Peltier is integrated to allow measurements of the intensity over T =\n10 to 40 C with a maximum temperature resolution of DELTA T ~ 0.1 C. All\ncomponents are controlled using a smartphone battery powered Arduino\nmicrocontroller and a customised Android application that allows sequential\nfluorescence imaging and quantification every DELTA t = 4 seconds. The\ntemperature dependence of fluorescence intensity for four emitters (Rhodamine\nB, Rhodamine 6G, 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin and\n6-(1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)2-ethyl-naphthalimide) are characterised.\nThe normalised fluorescence intensity over time of the latter chemosensor dye\ncomplex in the presence of Zn ion is observed to accelerate with an increasing\nrate constant, k = 1.94 min-1 at T = 15 C and k = 3.64 min-1 at T = 30 C,\napproaching a factor of ~ 2 with only a change in temperature of DELTA T = 15\nC. Thermally tuning these twist and bend associated rates to optimise sensor\napproaches and device applications is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 07:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

We\ndifferentiate two types of censoring in medical studies (dropout and\nadministrative), and we explain their importance in examining the existence of\nthe random censorship model. We show that in order to presume the random\ncensorship model it is not enough to have a design study which conforms to it,\nbut that one needs to provide evidence for its presence in the results. Blindly\npresuming the random censorship model might lead to the Kaplan-Meier estimator\nproducing biased results, which might have serious consequences when estimating\nsurvival in medical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 18:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}
