The need to study\ncosmic rays, with energies thousands of times larger than those encountered in\nparticle accelerators, led to the development of modern detection hardware and\nexperimental methodologies. We present a low power, low complexity data\nacquisition (DAQ) system with 100 ps resolution, suitable for particle and\nradiation detection experiments. The system uses a Multiple-Time-over-Threshold\n(MToT) technique for the treatment of the output signal of Photo Multiplier\nTubes (PMTs). The use of three thresholds compensates for the slewing effects\nand offers a more accurate measurement of the PMT pulses' width. For the\nevaluation of the pulse the system uses comparators and a Time-to-Digital (TDC)\nconverter, whereas the pulses are time-stamped using the GPS signal. The\nprototype card is analyzed for its noise behavior and is tested to verify its\nperformance. The system has been designed for the HEllenic LYceum Cosmic\nObservatories Network (HELYCON) Extensive Air Showers (EAS) detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 16:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}

In this investigation, this problem is\nrevisited in view of the recent progresses on the phase field approach to\nbrittle fracture. In this concern, a novel formulation combining the phase\nfield approach for modeling brittle fracture in the bulk and a cohesive zone\nmodel for pre-existing adhesive interfaces is herein proposed to investigate\nthe competition between crack penetration and deflection at an interface. The\nmodel, implemented within the finite element method framework using a\nmonolithic fully implicit solution strategy, is applied to provide a further\ninsight into the understanding of the role of model parameters on the above\ncompetition. In particular, in this study, the role of the fracture toughness\nratio between the interface and the adjoining bulks and the characteristic\nfracture-length scales of the dissipative models are analyzed. In the case of a\nbrittle interface, the asymptotic predictions based on linear elastic fracture\nmechanics criteria for crack penetration, single deflection or double\ndeflection are fully captured by the present method. Moreover, by increasing\nthe size of the process zone along the interface, or by varying the internal\nlength scale of the phase field model, new complex phenomena are emerging, such\nas simultaneous crack penetration and deflection and the transition from single\ncrack penetration to deflection and penetration with subsequent branching into\nthe bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 18:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Dissipative\neffects such as heat conduction and viscosity can be important in a\ncollisionless plasma and will potentially alter the dynamics and radiative\nproperties of the flow from that in ideal fluid models; we refer to models that\ninclude these processes as Extended GRMHD. Here we describe a new conservative\ncode, grim, that enables all the above and additional physics to be efficiently\nincorporated. grim combines time evolution and primitive variable inversion\nneeded for conservative schemes into a single step using an algorithm that only\nrequires the residuals of the governing equations as inputs. This algorithm\nenables the code to be physics agnostic as well as flexibility regarding\ntime-stepping schemes. grim runs on CPUs, as well as on GPUs, using the same\ncode. We formulate a performance model, and use it to show that our\nimplementation runs optimally on both architectures. grim correctly captures\nclassical GRMHD test problems as well as a new suite of linear and nonlinear\ntest problems with anisotropic conduction and viscosity in special and general\nrelativity.

Intermediate-age and old open clusters\nare less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar\nGalactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction\ninside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)\nobserved by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements\nfrom $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence\ndwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as\ncluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\n[Fe/H] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex.

We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC\n6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about\nIOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs\npreviously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and\nBerkeley 81.

For this\npurpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining\nmolecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy\ndistributions, and ~1mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star forming\ngalaxies (SFGs) between z=0 and 4.

Our most important finding is\nthat all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used,\nfollow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero point offsets are\nminimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas\ndepletion time t_depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star\nformation rate, scales as (1+z)^{-0.6}x(delta_MS)^{-0.44}, and is only weakly\ndependent on stellar mass.

We compare the level-1 logical error rates under\ntwo noise models: the standard Pauli symmetric depolarizing error model and an\nanisotropic error model. The anisotropic model is motivated by control errors\non two-qubit gates commonly applied to trapped ion qubits. We find that one\nancillary qubit per syndrome measurement is sufficient for fault-tolerance for\nthe anisotropic error, but is not sufficient for the standard depolarizing\nerrors. We then show how to achieve fault tolerance for the standard\ndepolarizing errors by adding flag qubits to check for errors on select\nancilary qubits.

However, practical deployment\nof reinforcement learning methods must contend with the fact that the training\nprocess itself can be unsafe for the robot. In this paper, we consider the\nspecific case of a mobile robot learning to navigate an a priori unknown\nenvironment while avoiding collisions. In order to learn collision avoidance,\nthe robot must experience collisions at training time. However, high-speed\ncollisions, even at training time, could damage the robot. A successful\nlearning method must therefore proceed cautiously, experiencing only low-speed\ncollisions until it gains confidence. To this end, we present an\nuncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm that estimates the probability\nof collision together with a statistical estimate of uncertainty. By\nformulating an uncertainty-dependent cost function, we show that the algorithm\nnaturally chooses to proceed cautiously in unfamiliar environments, and\nincreases the velocity of the robot in settings where it has high confidence.\nOur predictive model is based on bootstrapped neural networks using dropout,\nallowing it to process raw sensory inputs from high-bandwidth sensors such as\ncameras. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively\nminimizes dangerous collisions at training time in an obstacle avoidance task\nfor a simulated and real-world quadrotor, and a real-world RC car.

The spatial structure of the normal modes suggests that\nmeasures of collectivity and energy dissipation in the gels are fundamentally\naltered by long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions, while hydrodynamic\nlubrication affects only the relaxation rates of short wavelength modes. Models\naccounting for long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions exhibit a microscopic\nrelaxation rate for each normal mode, $\\lambda$ that scales as $\\lambda\\sim\nl^{-2}$, where $l$ is the spatial correlation length of the mode.

First, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to study\nevent-by-event fluctuations in the spectrum of harmonic flow, $v_n(p_T)$ for\n$n=0\\text{--}5$, in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\\,{\\rm TeV}$). The PCA procedure\nfinds two dominant contributions to the two-particle correlation function: the\nleading component is identified with the standard event plane $v_n(p_T)$ and\nthe subleading component is responsible for factorization breaking and reflects\nthe radial excitation in the initial state. Second, we use leading order\neffective kinetic theory (accurate at weak coupling) to simulate the\npre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow perturbations. We\nconstruct the linear response Green functions, which map initial perturbations\nto the energy momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable.\nFinally, we develop a set of kinetic equations for thermal noise correlators\nwhich are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise.

Filaments are about one hundred times cooler and denser than\nthe coronal material, and physical understanding of their material origin\nremains controversial. Two types of scenarios have been proposed: one argues\nthat the filament plasma is brought into the corona from photosphere or\nchromosphere through a siphon or evaporation/injection process, while the other\nsuggests that the material condenses from the surrounding coronal plasma due to\nthermal instability. The elemental abundance analysis is a reasonable clue to\nconstrain the models, as the siphon or evaporation/injection model would\npredict that the filament material abundances are close to the photospheric or\nchromospheric ones, while the condensation model should have coronal\nabundances.

If driven by accretion rate\nfluctuations, the variability could be isotropic. If dominated by relativistic\nDoppler modulation, the variability should instead be anisotropic, resembling a\nrotating forward-beamed lighthouse. We consider the infrared (IR) reverberation\nof either type of periodic emission by pc-scale circumbinary dust tori. We\npredict the phase and amplitude of IR variability as a function of the ratio of\ndust light crossing time to the source variability period, and of the torus\ninclination and opening angle. We enumerate several differences between the\nisotropic and anisotropic cases. Interestingly, for a nearly face-on binary\nwith an inclined dust torus, the Doppler boost can produce IR variability\nwithout any observable optical/UV variability.

The key\nidea of FD is to serve multiple users over the same bandwidth with a base\nstation (BS) that can simultaneously transmit and receive the signals. The most\nchallenging issue in designing an FD system is to address both the harmful\neffects of residual self-interference caused by the transmit-to-receive\nantennas at the BS as well as the co- channel interference from an uplink user\n(ULU) to a downlink user (DLU). An efficient solution to these problems is to\nassign the ULUs/DLUs in different groups/slots, with each user served in\nmultiple groups. Hence, this paper studies the joint design of transmit\nbeamformers, ULUs/DLUs group assignment, and time allocation for each group.\nThe specific aim is to maximize the sum rate under the ULU/DLU minimum\nthroughput constraints. The utility function of interest is a difficult\nnonconcave problem, and the involved constraints are also nonconvex, and so\nthis is a computationally troublesome problem. To solve this optimization\nproblem, we propose a new path-following algorithm for compu- tational\nsolutions to arrive at least the local optima. Each iteration involves only a\nsimple convex quadratic program. We prove that the proposed algorithm\niteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence.

That work used techniques designed for deterministic data, PCA\nwas used for the basis function generation and $L_2$ projection was used to\ncreate the reconstructions. In this work, probabilistic approaches are used.\nThe probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is used to generate the basis, which then allows\nthe noise in the training data to be estimated. PPCA has also been improved so\nthat the derived basis vectors are orthonormal and the variance of the basis\nexpansion coefficients over the training data set can be estimated. The\nstandard approach assumes a unit variance for these coefficients. Based on the\nresults of the PPCA, model selection criteria are applied to automatically\nchoose the dimension of the ROM. In our previous work, a heuristic approach was\nused to pick the dimension. Lastly, a new statistical approach is used for the\nprojection step where the variance information obtained from the improved PPCA\nis used as a prior to improve the projection. This gives improved accuracy over\n$L_2$ projection when the projected data is noisy. In addition, the noise\nstatistics for the projected data are not assumed to be the same as that of the\ntraining data, but are estimated in the projection process.

For each local feature in the\nquery image, we find its approximate nearest neighbors in the reference set.\nNext, we cluster the features from reference images using Dominant Set\nclustering, which affords several advantages over existing approaches. First,\nit permits variable number of nodes in the cluster which we use to dynamically\nselect the number of nearest neighbors (typically coming from multiple\nreference images) for each query feature based on its discrimination value.\nSecond, as we also quantify in our experiments, this approach is several orders\nof magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Yet, the\ngeneric modeling of such networks as typical MANETs and isolated systems has\nleft various vulnerabilities out of the investigative focus of the research\ncommunity. This paper aims to emphasize on some of the critical challenges in\nsecuring UAV networks against attacks targeting vulnerabilities specific to\nsuch systems and their cyber-physical aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 08:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

However, a key property\nof networks is often neglected: many real-world networks exhibit spatial\nstructure, the tendency of a node to select neighbors with a probability\ndepending on physical distance. Here, we introduce a class of random spatial\nnetworks (RSNs) which generalizes many existing random network models but adds\nspatial structure. In these networks, nodes are placed randomly in space and\njoined in edges with a probability depending on their distance and their\nindividual expected degrees, in a manner that crucially remains analytically\ntractable. We use this network class to propose a new generalization of\nsmall-world networks, where the average shortest path lengths in the graph are\nsmall, as in classical Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, but with close\nspatial proximity of nodes that are neighbors in the network playing the role\nof large clustering. Small-world effects are demonstrated on these spatial\nsmall-world networks without clustering. We are able to derive partial\nintegro-differential equations governing susceptible-infectious-recovered\ndisease spreading through an RSN, and we demonstrate the existence of traveling\nwave solutions. If the distance kernel governing edge placement decays slower\nthan exponential, the population-scale dynamics are dominated by long-range\nhops followed by local spread of traveling waves. This provides a theoretical\nmodeling framework for recent observations of how epidemics like Ebola evolve\nin modern connected societies, with long-range connections seeding new focal\npoints from which the epidemic locally spreads in a wavelike manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 08:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

Owing to the high directivity of the plasma emission\nthe region from which the emission escapes can be very small.

A long line of work on the\nsparse FFT has resulted in algorithms with $O(k\\log n\\log (n/k))$ runtime\n[Hassanieh et al., STOC'12] and $O(k\\log n)$ sample complexity [Indyk et al.,\nFOCS'14]. These results are proved using non-adaptive algorithms, and the\nlatter $O(k\\log n)$ sample complexity result is essentially the best possible\nunder the sparsity assumption alone.\n  This paper revisits the sparse FFT problem with the added twist that the\nsparse coefficients approximately obey a $(k_0,k_1)$-block sparse model. In\nthis model, signal frequencies are clustered in $k_0$ intervals with width\n$k_1$ in Fourier space, where $k= k_0k_1$ is the total sparsity. Signals\narising in applications are often well approximated by this model with $k_0\\ll\nk$.\n  Our main result is the first sparse FFT algorithm for $(k_0, k_1)$-block\nsparse signals with the sample complexity of $O^*(k_0k_1 + k_0\\log(1+ k_0)\\log\nn)$ at constant signal-to-noise ratios, and sublinear runtime.

Here the decision maker must know the numerical value of each arriving\nelement, which can be a demanding informational assumption. In this paper, we\ninitiate the study of combinatorial secretary problems with ordinal\ninformation, in which the decision maker only needs to be aware of a preference\norder consistent with the values of arrived elements. The goal is to design\nonline algorithms with small competitive ratios.\n  For a variety of combinatorial problems, such as bipartite matching, general\npacking LPs, and independent set with bounded local independence number, we\ndesign new algorithms that obtain constant competitive ratios.\n  For the matroid secretary problem, we observe that many existing algorithms\nfor special matroid structures maintain their competitive ratios even in the\nordinal model. In these cases, the restriction to ordinal information does not\nrepresent any additional obstacle. Moreover, we show that ordinal variants of\nthe submodular matroid secretary problems can be solved using algorithms for\nthe linear versions by extending [Feldman and Zenklusen, 2015]. In contrast, we\nprovide a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}/(\\log n))$ for algorithms that are\noblivious to the matroid structure, where $n$ is the total number of elements.\nThis contrasts an upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ in the cardinal model, and it\nshows that the technique of thresholding is not sufficient for good algorithms\nin the ordinal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 14:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 18:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 13:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

The\nAIRs of each individual channel have been evaluated for DP-64QAM, DP-256QAM,\nand DP-1024QAM modulation formats. The impact of full-field nonlinear\ncompensation (FF-NLC) and probabilistically shaped constellations using a\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution were studied and compared to electronic\ndispersion compensation. It is found that a probabilistically shaped DP-1024QAM\nconstellation combined with FF-NLC yields AIRs of ~75 Tbit/s for the EDFA\nscheme and ~223 Tbit/s for the Raman amplification scheme over 2000 km standard\nsingle mode fibre transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 16:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}
