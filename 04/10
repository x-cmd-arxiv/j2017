A hybrid\nscheme with entropy-stable flux correction is formulated to robustly represent\nlarge density ratios. The thermodynamics for ideal-gas values is modeled by a\nlinearized specific heat ratio model. Parameters needed for the cubic EoS are\npre-tabulated for the evaluation of departure functions and a quadratic\nexpression is used to recover the attraction parameter. The novelty of the\nproposed approach lies in the ability to account for pressure and temperature\nvariations from the baseline table. Cryogenic LOX/GH2 mixing and reacting cases\nare performed to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in\nmultidimensional simulations.

First, we numerically solve the non-Boussinesq Taylor-Goldstein\nequation for smooth velocity and density profiles of a model shear layer with a\nfree surface. When the depth of the fluid is relatively shallow compared to the\nshear layer thickness, the surface gravity waves existing at the free surface\ncome closer to the waves existing in the shear layer. This can lead to resonant\nwave interactions, making the flow unstable to more varieties of modal\ninstabilities. To obtain a deeper understanding of the instability mechanisms,\nwe have performed analytical studies with broken-line profiles. Furthermore,\nreduced order broken-line profiles have also been developed, based on which\ndispersion diagrams are constructed. Through these diagrams we have underpinned\nthe resonantly interacting waves leading to each type of instability. Two new\ninstabilities have been found; one of them, referred to as the surface gravity\n- interfacial gravity (SG-IG) mode, arises due to the interaction between a\nsurface gravity wave and an interfacial gravity wave, and would be absent if\nthere is no internal density stratification. The other one - the surface\ngravity - lower vorticity (SG-LV) mode, which arises due to the interaction\nbetween a surface gravity wave and the lower vorticity wave, surpasses\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability to become the most unstable mode. Except for\nHolmboe instability, remarkable differences are observed in all other\ninstabilities occurring in shallow domains when the air-water interface is\nreplaced by a rigid lid. We infer that the rigid-lid approximation is valid for\nlarge vertical domains.

The underlying challenges to group key\nagreement are scalability, efficiency, and security. In a dynamic group\nenvironment, the rekeying process is more frequent; therefore, it is more\ncrucial to design an efficient group key agreement protocol. Moreover, with the\nemergence of various group-based services, it is becoming common for several\nmulticast groups to coexist in the same network. These multicast groups may\nhave several shared users; a join or leave request by a single user can trigger\nregeneration of multiple group keys. Under the given circumstances the rekeying\nprocess becomes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethodology for group key agreement which exploits the state vectors of group\nmembers. The state vector is a set of randomly generated nonce instances which\ndetermine the logical link between group members and which empowers the group\nmember to generate multiple cryptographic keys independently. Using local\nknowledge of a secret nonce, each member can generate and share a large number\nof secure keys, indicating that SGRS inherently provides a considerable amount\nof secure subgroup multicast communication using subgroup multicasting keys\nderived from local state vectors. The resulting protocol is secure and\nefficient in terms of both communication and computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 01:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

Traditional segmentation approaches depend heavily upon hand-crafted\nfeatures and a priori knowledge of the user. As such, these methods are\ndifficult to adopt within a clinical environment. Recently, deep learning\nmethods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have been successful in\nmany segmentation problems primarily because they leverage a large labelled\ndataset to hierarchically learn the features that best correspond to the\nshallow visual appearance as well as the deep semantics of the areas to be\nsegmented.

Therefore, it is challenging to learn more\ndiscriminative features among different classes for FCNs. In this study, we\novercome these limitations using deep residual networks (ResNet) to segment\nliver lesions. ResNet contain skip connections between convolutional layers,\nwhich solved the problem of the training degradation of training accuracy in\nvery deep networks and thereby enables the use of additional layers for\nlearning more discriminative features. In addition, we achieve more precise\nboundary definitions through a novel cascaded ResNet architecture with\nmulti-scale fusion to gradually learn and infer the boundaries of both the\nliver and the liver lesions.

The lack of such a method limits the accuracy of the\ndetection of inflationary gravitational waves, the constraining power on the\nneutrino sector through measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, the\npossibility of detecting Cosmic Birefringence, and the ability to measure\nprimordial magnetic fields.

Self-calibration methods provide better accuracy, but may be affected by\nforeground signals and rely heavily on model assumptions. The POLarization\nOrientation CALibrator for Cosmology, POLOCALC, will dramatically improve\ninstrumental accuracy by means of an artificial calibration source flying on\nballoons and aerial drones. A balloon-borne calibrator will provide far-field\nsource for larger telescopes, while a drone will be used for tests and smaller\npolarimeters. POLOCALC will also allow a unique method to measure the\ntelescopes' polarized beam. It will use microwave emitters between 40 and 150\nGHz coupled to precise polarizing filters. The orientation of the source\npolarization plane will be registered to sky coordinates by star cameras and\ngyroscopes with arcsecond accuracy.

Fractionalized excitations have their own dynamics in\ndifferent energy scales, and hence, affect finite-temperature ($T$) properties\nin a peculiar manner even in the paramagnetic state harboring the quantum spin\nliquid state. We here present a comprehensive theoretical study of the spin\ndynamics in a wide $T$ range for the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice, whose\nground state is such a quantum spin liquid. In this model, the\nfractionalization occurs to break up quantum spins into itinerant matter\nfermions and localized gauge fluxes, which results in two crossovers at very\ndifferent $T$ scales.

The\nmeasure, complete local integration (CLI), is formally investigated in general\nBayesian networks. It is based on the specific local integration (SLI) which is\nmeasured with respect to a partition. CLI is the minimum value of SLI over all\npartitions. We prove that $\\iota$-entities are blocks in specific partitions of\nthe global trajectory. These partitions are the finest partitions that achieve\na given SLI value.

Tilt Brush and Oculus Quill are widely accepted among artists as\ntools that pave the way to a new form of art - 3D emmersive painting. Current\n3D painting systems are only a start, emitting textured triangular geometries.\nIn this paper, we advance this new art of 3D painting to 3D volumetric painting\nthat enables an artist to draw a huge scene with full control of spatial color\nfields. Inspired by the fact that 2D paintings often use vast space to paint\nbackground and small but detailed space for foreground, we claim that\nsupporting a large canvas in varying detail is essential for 3D painting. In\norder to help artists focus and audiences to navigate the large canvas space,\nwe provide small artist-defined areas, called rooms, that serve as beacons for\nartist-suggested scales, spaces, locations for intended appreciation view of\nthe painting. Artists and audiences can easily transport themselves between\ndifferent rooms. Technically, our canvas is represented as an array of deep\noctrees of depth 24 or higher, built on CPU for volume painting and on GPU for\nvolume rendering using accurate ray casting. In CPU side, we design an\nefficient iterative algorithm to refine or coarsen octree, as a result of\nvolumetric painting strokes, at highly interactive rates, and update the\ncorresponding GPU textures. Then we use GPU-based ray casting algorithms to\nrender the volumetric painting result. We explore precision issues stemming\nfrom ray-casting the octree of high depth, and provide a new analysis and\nverification. From our experimental results as well as the positive feedback\nfrom the participating artists, we strongly believe that our new 3D volume\npainting system can open up a new possibility for VR-driven digital art medium\nto professional artists as well as to novice users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 06:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

While it is well known that tracer transport through fractured\nmedia can be anomalous and particle injection modes can have major impact on\ndispersion, the incorporation of injection modes into effective transport\nmodelling has remained an open issue. The fundamental reason behind this\nchallenge is that---even if the Eulerian fluid velocity is steady---the\nLagrangian velocity distribution experienced by tracer particles evolves with\ntime from its initial distribution, which is dictated by the injection mode, to\na stationary velocity distribution.

In this work, we study the assignation of a single weighted sample\nwhich compresses the information contained in a population of weighted samples.\nPart of the theory that we present as Group Importance Sampling (GIS) has been\nemployed implicitly in different works in the literature. The provided analysis\nyields several theoretical and practical consequences.

We also\nintroduce two novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques based on GIS.\nThe first one, named Group Metropolis Sampling method, produces a Markov chain\nof sets of weighted samples. All these sets are then employed for obtaining a\nunique global estimator. The second one is the Distributed Particle\nMetropolis-Hastings technique, where different parallel particle filters are\njointly used to drive an MCMC algorithm. Different resampled trajectories are\ncompared and then tested with a proper acceptance probability. The novel\nschemes are tested in different numerical experiments such as learning the\nhyperparameters of Gaussian Processes, two localization problems in a wireless\nsensor network (with synthetic and real data) and the tracking of vegetation\nparameters given satellite observations, where they are compared with several\nbenchmark Monte Carlo techniques.

Instead of treating hydrogen bonds as\nnon-bonded interaction subjected to electrostatic and Lennard-Jones potentials,\nwe introduce an explicit bond with negligible bond order, thus maintaining the\nstructural integrity of the H-bonded complexes and avoiding the necessity to\nassign arbitrary charges to the system. The explicit hydrogen bond changes the\ncoordination number of the acceptor site and the approach is thus most suitable\nfor systems with under-coordinated atoms, such as many metal-organic\nframeworks, however, it also shows excellent performance for other systems\ninvolving a hydrogen-bonded framework.

There has therefore been considerable attention given to the design\nof pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for such models.\nHowever, these methods are typically computationally intensive, often require\ncareful tuning and must be restarted from scratch upon receipt of new\nobservations. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods on the other hand aim to\nefficiently reuse posterior samples at each time point. Despite their appeal,\napplying SMC schemes in scenarios with both dynamic states and static\nparameters is made difficult by the problem of particle degeneracy. A\nprincipled approach for overcoming this problem is to move each parameter\nparticle through a Metropolis-Hastings kernel that leaves the target invariant.\nThis rejuvenation step is key to a recently proposed SMC$^2$ algorithm, which\ncan be seen as the pseudo-marginal analogue of an idealised scheme known as\niterated batch importance sampling.

Cosmological backreaction describes how the mean global evolution of the\nUniverse deviates from the Friedmannian evolution. The analysis is based on\nmodels of a single cosmological environment and the global ensemble of the\nSzekeres models (of the Swiss-Cheese-type and Styrofoam-type). The obtained\nresults show that non-linear growth of cosmic structures is associated with the\ngrowth of the spatial curvature $\\Omega_{\\cal R}$ (in the FLRW limit\n$\\Omega_{\\cal R} \\to \\Omega_k$). If averaged over global scales the result\ndepends on the assumed global model of the Universe. Within the Swiss-Cheese\nmodel, which does have a fixed background, the volume average follows the\nevolution of the background, and the global spatial curvature averages out to\nzero (the background model is the $\\Lambda$CDM model, which is spatially flat).\nIn the Styrofoam-type model, which does not have a fixed background, the mean\nevolution deviates from the spatially flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and the mean\nspatial curvature evolves to from $\\Omega_{\\cal R} =0 $ at the CMB to\n$\\Omega_{\\cal R} \\sim 0.1$ at $z =0$. If the Styrofoam-type model correctly\ncaptures evolutionary features of the real Universe then one should expect that\nin our Universe, the spatial curvature should build up (local growth of cosmic\nstructures) and its mean global average should deviate from zero\n(backreaction). As a result, this paper predicts that the low-redshift Universe\nshould not be spatially flat (i.e. $\\Omega_k \\ne 0$, even if in the early\nUniverse $\\Omega_k = 0$) and therefore when analysing low-$z$ cosmological data\none should keep $\\Omega_k$ as a free parameter and independent from the CMB\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 11:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 08:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 06:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

The second\nmodel, referred to as the coherent-population-oscillations (CPO) model,\nconsiders light beams whose intensity is slightly pulse modulated and\nattributes the time delay of the transmitted pulse to a reduction of the group\nvelocity.

Synchronization, on the other\nhand, is separated into three regimes: for both small and large coupling\nhierarchical products have poorly synchronization properties, but is optimized\nat an intermediate value. Moreover, the critical coupling value that optimizes\nsynchronization is shaped by the relative connectivities of the primary and\nsecondary subnetworks, compensating for significant differences between the two\nsubnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 12:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 18:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 12:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Here we present a\nstudy of a sample of stars in the Chamaeleon I star forming region carried out\nusing the VLT/X-Shooter spectrograph. The sample is nearly complete down to\nM~0.1Msun for the young stars still harboring a disk in this region. We derive\nthe stellar and accretion parameters using a self-consistent method to fit the\nbroad-band flux-calibrated medium resolution spectrum. The correlation between\nthe accretion luminosity to the stellar luminosity, and of the mass accretion\nrate to the stellar mass in the logarithmic plane yields slopes of 1.9 and 2.3,\nrespectively. These slopes and the accretion rates are consistent with previous\nresults in various star forming regions and with different theoretical\nframeworks. However, we find that a broken power-law fit, with a steeper slope\nfor stellar luminosity smaller than ~0.45 Lsun and for stellar masses smaller\nthan ~ 0.3 Msun, is slightly preferred according to different statistical\ntests, but the single power-law model is not excluded. The steeper relation for\nlower mass stars can be interpreted as a faster evolution in the past for\naccretion in disks around these objects, or as different accretion regimes in\ndifferent stellar mass ranges. Finally, we find two regions on the mass\naccretion versus stellar mass plane empty of objects. One at high mass\naccretion rates and low stellar masses, which is related to the steeper\ndependence of the two parameters we derived. The second one is just above the\nobservational limits imposed by chromospheric emission. This empty region is\nlocated at M~0.3-0.4Msun, typical masses where photoevaporation is known to be\neffective, and at mass accretion rates ~10^-10 Msun/yr, a value compatible with\nthe one expected for photoevaporation to rapidly dissipate the inner disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 13:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 10:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

One of the\nobjectives is to overcome the negative flux problem that arises when the system\nis very opaque and the angular neutron flux can become negative when it is\nextrapolated in spatial meshes --- as, for example, in diamond scheme adopted\nin many codes. Although there are recipes to overcome this problem, it can\ncompletely degrade the numerical solution if repeated many times.\n  The solution presented here can be easily coupled to radiation-hydrodynamics\nequations, but it is necessary an additional term to maintain neutron\nconservation in a moving system in lagrangian coordinates.

Sometimes, it is desirable for a human operator to\n\\textit{interrupt} an agent in order to prevent dangerous situations from\nhappening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these\ninterruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately\navoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context\nbecause agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also\nfrom those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined \\emph{safe\ninterruptibility} for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to\nmulti-agent systems. This paper introduces \\textit{dynamic safe\ninterruptibility}, an alternative definition more suited to decentralized\nlearning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks:\n\\textit{joint action learners} and \\textit{independent learners}. We give\nrealistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic\nsafe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these\nconditions are not sufficient for independent learners. We show however that if\nagents can detect interruptions, it is possible to prune the observations to\nensure dynamic safe interruptibility even for independent learners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

The UV-to-X-ray spectrum\nin the quiescent state can be well and self-consistently described by a thermal\nand a Comptonized emission from accretion disk, with blackbody dominating ~70%\nof the X-rays in the 0.2-2 keV.

Whereas\nplaying a type B arm leads it to state $1$ with probability $1$ and not playing\nit gets state that dependent on transition probabilities of arm. Further, play\nof an arm generates a unit reward with a probability that depends on the state\nof the arm. The belief about the state of the arm can be calculated using a\nBayesian update after every play. This RMAB has been designed for use in\nrecommendation systems where the user's preferences depend on the history of\nrecommendations.

The\nbounds as it is seen in the numerical results appear to be tight. Explicit\nexpressions for the average delay are obtained for the symmetrical model with\ncapture effect which is a subclass of MPR models. We also provide the optimal\ntransmission probability in closed form expression that minimizes the average\ndelay in the symmetric capture case. Finally, we evaluate numerically the\npresented theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 15:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

However, it is challenging to realize a\nsufficient link margin due to high path loss and blockages. To address this\ndifficulty, in this paper, we explore the potential gain of ultra-densification\nfor enhancing mmWave communications from a network-level perspective. By\ndeploying the mmWave base stations (BSs) in an extremely dense and amorphous\nfashion, the access distance is reduced and the choice of serving BSs is\nenriched for each user, which are intuitively effective for mitigating the\npropagation loss and blockages. Nevertheless, co-channel interference under\nthis model will become a performance-limiting factor. To solve this problem, we\npropose a large-scale channel state information (CSI) based interference\ncoordination approach. Note that the large-scale CSI is highly\nlocation-dependent, and can be obtained with a quite low cost. Thus, the\nscalability of the proposed coordination framework can be guaranteed.\nParticularly, using only the large-scale CSI of interference links, a\ncoordinated frequency resource block allocation problem is formulated for\nmaximizing the minimum achievable rate of the users, which is uncovered to be a\nNP-hard integer programming problem. To circumvent this difficulty, a greedy\nscheme with polynomial-time complexity is proposed by adopting the bisection\nmethod and linear integer programming tools. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed coordination scheme based on large-scale CSI only can still\noffer substantial gains over the existing methods. Moreover, although the\nproposed scheme is only guaranteed to converge to a local optimum, it performs\nwell in terms of both user fairness and system efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 15:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}
