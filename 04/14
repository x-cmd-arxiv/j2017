Deterministic negotiation diagrams, equivalent to the much studied\nand used free-choice workflow Petri nets, are surprisingly amenable to\nverification. Soundness (a property close to deadlock-freedom) can be decided\nin PTIME. Further, other fundamental questions like computing summaries or the\nexpected cost, can also be solved in PTIME for sound deterministic negotiation\ndiagrams, while they are PSPACE-complete in the general case.\n  In this paper we generalize and explain these results. We extend the\nclassical \"meet-over-all-paths\" (MOP) formulation of static analysis problems\nto our concurrent setting, and introduce Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis\nproblems, which encompass the questions above and new ones. We show that any\nMazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problem can be solved in PTIME for sound\ndeterministic negotiations whenever it is in PTIME for sequential\nflow-graphs---even though the flow-graph of a deterministic negotiation diagram\ncan be exponentially larger than the diagram itself. This gives a common\nexplanation to the low-complexity of all the analysis questions studied so far.\nFinally, we show that classical gen/kill analyses are also an instance of our\nframework, and obtain a PTIME algorithm for detecting anti-patterns in\nfree-choice workflow Petri nets.\n  Our result is based on a novel decomposition theorem, of independent\ninterest, showing that sound deterministic negotiation diagrams can be\nhierarchically decomposed into (possibly overlapping) smaller sound diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

The simplest\nform of matter is infinitely thin spherical shells of dust, of which I need at\nleast two in order to have a nontrivial dynamics. With a single shell the\nsystem is dynamically trivial, but it nevertheless admits a solution which\nrepresents a `frozen' shell at equilibrium in a globally de Sitter universe.\nSuch a solution is, to my knowledge, new.

The two TI\nstates, one lying in the valence band (TI-V) and other lying in the conduction\nband (TI-C) are formed out of bonding and antibonding states of the\nBi-$\\{$s,p$\\}$ - O-$\\{$p$\\}$ coordinated covalent interaction. Below a certain\ncritical thickness of the film, which varies with A, TI states of top and\nbottom surfaces couple to destroy the Dirac type linear dispersion and\nconsequently to open surface energy gaps. The origin of s-p band inversion,\nnecessary to form a TI state, classifies the family of ABiO$_3$ into two. For\nclass-I (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs and Mg) the band inversion, leading to TI-C state,\nis induced by spin-orbit coupling of the Bi-p states and for class-II (A = Ca,\nSr and Ba) the band inversion is induced through weak but sensitive second\nneighbor Bi-Bi interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 16:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

In this paper, a\nfitness-based Osmosis algorithm is proposed to provide support for osmotic\ncomputing by making more effective use of existing Fog server resources. The\nproposed approach is capable of efficiently distributing and allocating\nservices by following the principle of osmosis.

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency.

The\nsolution operator $E(t)$ for the initial value problem can be written as a\nDunford-Taylor integral involving the Mittag-Leffler function $e_{\\alpha,1}$\nand the resolvent of the underlying (non-fractional) spatial operator over an\nappropriate integration path in the complex plane.

For hierarchically hyperbolic\ngroups, this coincides with the maximal dimension of a quasiflat. Examples for\nwhich the rank coincides with familiar quantities include: the dimension of\nmaximal Dehn twist flats for mapping class groups, the maximal rank of a free\nabelian subgroup for right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, and, for the\nWeil--Petersson metric, the rank is the integer part of half the complex\ndimension of Teichm\\\"{u}ller space.\n  We prove that any quasiflat of dimension equal to the rank lies within finite\ndistance of a union of standard orthants (under a mild condition satisfied by\nall natural examples). This resolves outstanding conjectures when applied to\nvarious examples. For mapping class group, we verify a conjecture of Farb; for\nTeichm\\\"{u}ller space we answer a question of Brock; for CAT(0) cubical groups,\nwe handle special cases including right-angled Coxeter groups. An important\ningredient in the proof is that the hull of any finite set in an HHS is\nquasi-isometric to a CAT(0) cube complex of dimension bounded by the rank.\n  We deduce a number of applications. For instance, we show that any\nquasi-isometry between HHSs induces a quasi-isometry between certain simpler\nHHSs. This allows one, for example, to distinguish quasi-isometry classes of\nright-angled Artin/Coxeter groups. Another application is to quasi-isometric\nrigidity. Our tools in many cases allow one to reduce the problem of\nquasi-isometric rigidity for a given hierarchically hyperbolic group to a\ncombinatorial problem.

In this work we quantify the maximum beneficial bandwidth for mmWave\ntransmission in some typical deployment scenarios which use pilot-based channel\nestimation and assume a minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator at\nthe receiver. We find that for an I.I.D. block fading model with coherence time\n$T_c$ and coherence bandwidth $B_c$, for transmitters and receivers equipped\nwith a single antenna, the optimal (rate-maximizing) signal-to-noise-ratio is a\nconstant that only depends on the product $B_cT_c$, which measures the channel\ncoherence and equals the average number of orthogonal symbols per each\nindependent channel coefficient. That is, for fixed channel coherence, the\noptimal bandwidth scales linearly with the received signal power.

The second relates\ncertain averages under these measures to their half-space (or Pfaffian) Schur\nprocess analogs via a refined Littlewood identity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 17:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 16:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

For such a case, the combination of the sail's low mass and\nrelativistic velocity render previous treatments formally incorrect, including\nthat of Einstein himself in his seminal 1905 paper introducing special\nrelativity. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration,\nfirst in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble. We show\nhow the sail's motion in response to an ensemble of incident photons is\nequivalent to that of a single photon of energy equal to that of the ensemble.\nWe use this 'principle of ensemble equivalence' for both perfect and imperfect\nmirrors, enabling a simple analytic prediction of the sail's velocity curve.\nUsing our results and adopting putative parameters for Starshot, we estimate\nthat previous relativistic treatments underestimate the spacecraft's terminal\nvelocity by ~50m/s for the same incident energy, sufficient to miss a target by\nseveral Earth radii. Additionally, we use a simple model to predict the sail's\ntemperature and diffraction beam losses during the laser firing period,\nallowing us to estimate that for firing times of a few minutes and operating\ntemperatures below 300C (573K), Starshot will require a sail of which absorbs\nless than 1 in 260,000 photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 18:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 21:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

The test only relies on\ngeometric optics. It is independent of the energy contents of the universe and\nthe validity of the Einstein equation on cosmological scales. The study\ncomprises two levels: testing the FLRW metric through the Distance Sum Rule and\ndetermining/constraining cosmic curvature. We propose an effective and\nefficient (redshift) evolution model for performing the former test, which\nallows us to concretely specify the violation criterion for the FLRW Distance\nSum Rule. If the FLRW metric is consistent with the observations, then, on the\nsecond level, the cosmic curvature parameter will be constrained to $\\sim0.057$\nor $\\sim0.041$ ($1\\sigma$), depending on the availability of high-redshift\nsupernovae, much more stringent than current model-independent techniques.

After making some special choices for thermodynamical\nquantities, we find that the increase of electric charge $Q$ and normalization\nfactor $a$ can also promote heat engine efficiency which would infinitely\napproach the Carnot limit when $Q$ or $a$ goes to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 06:31:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 15:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

This\npaper presents codebook designs and performance analyses for limited feedback\nMIMO systems with finite-bit ADCs. A point-to-point single-user channel is\nfirstly considered. When the received signal is sliced by 1-bit ADCs, the\nabsolute phase at the receiver is important to align the phase of the received\nsignals. A new codebook design for beamforming, which separately quantizes the\nchannel direction and the residual phase, is therefore proposed. For the\nmulti-bit case where the optimal transmission method is unknown, suboptimal\nGaussian signaling and eigenvector beamforming is assumed to obtain a lower\nbound of the achievable rate. It is found that to limit the rate loss, more\nfeedback bits are needed in the medium SNR regime than the low and high SNR\nregimes, which is quite different from the conventional infinite-bit ADC case.\nSecond, a multi-user system where a multiple-antenna transmitter sends signals\nto multiple single-antenna receivers with finite-bit ADCs is considered. Based\non the derived performance loss due to finite-bit ADCs and finite-bit CSI\nfeedback, the number of bits per feedback should increase linearly with the ADC\nresolution in order to restrict the rate loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 06:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

Using multi-wavelength observations we investigate the nature of the\nmedium surrounding HLX-1, search for evidence of past mergers with ESO 243-49\nand constrain parameters of the galaxy. Methods. We reduce and analyse integral\nfield unit observations of ESO 243-49 that were taken with the MUSE instrument\non the VLT. Using complementary multi-wavelength data, including X-Shooter,\nHST, Swift, Chandra and ATCA data, we further examine the vicinity of HLX-1.

No evidence for\na recent minor-merger that could result in the presence of the IMBH is\ndiscerned, but the data are compatible with a scenario in which minor mergers\nmay have occurred in the history of ESO 243-49.

A\nCDN server caches and serves the content requested by users. Designing caching\nalgorithms that automatically adapt to the heterogeneity, burstiness, and\nnon-stationary nature of real-world content requests is a major challenge and\nis the focus of our work. While there is much work on caching algorithms for\nstationary request traffic, the work on non-stationary request traffic is very\nlimited. Consequently, most prior models are inaccurate for production CDN\ntraffic that is non-stationary.\n  We propose two TTL-based caching algorithms and provide provable guarantees\nfor content request traffic that is bursty and non-stationary. The first\nalgorithm called d-TTL dynamically adapts a TTL parameter using a stochastic\napproximation approach. Given a feasible target hit rate, we show that the hit\nrate of d-TTL converges to its target value for a general class of bursty\ntraffic that allows Markov dependence over time and non-stationary arrivals.\nThe second algorithm called f-TTL uses two caches, each with its own TTL. The\nfirst-level cache adaptively filters out non-stationary traffic, while the\nsecond-level cache stores frequently-accessed stationary traffic. Given\nfeasible targets for both the hit rate and the expected cache size, f-TTL\nasymptotically achieves both targets. We implement d-TTL and f-TTL and evaluate\nboth algorithms using an extensive nine-day trace consisting of 500 million\nrequests from a production CDN server. We show that both d-TTL and f-TTL\nconverge to their hit rate targets with an error of about 1.3%. But, f-TTL\nrequires a significantly smaller cache size than d-TTL to achieve the same hit\nrate, since it effectively filters out the non-stationary traffic for\nrarely-accessed objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:11:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 00:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Dealing with this cellular\nheterogeneity requires adequate understanding of its sources, which is\nextremely difficult, as phenotypes of tumour cells integrate hardwired\n(epi)mutational differences with the dynamic responses to microenvironmental\ncues. The later come in form of both direct physical interactions, as well as\ninputs from gradients of secreted signalling molecules. Furthermore, tumour\ncells can not only receive microenvironmental cues, but also produce them.\nDespite high biological and clinical importance of understanding spatial\naspects of paracrine signaling, adequate research tools are largely lacking.\nHere, a partial differential equation (PDE) based mathematical model is\ndeveloped that mimics the process of cell ablation. This model suggests how\neach cell might contribute to the microenvironment by either absorbing or\nsecreting diffusible factors, and quantifies the extent to which observed\nintensities can be explained via diffusion mediated signalling. The model\nallows for the separation of phenotypic responses to signalling gradients\nwithin tumour microenvironments from the combined influence of responses\nmediated by direct physical contact and hardwired (epi)genetic differences.

As a result, the phenomenological formulas for the yield of\nmuon-induced charged pions and neutrons can be obtained. These expressions both\nare associated with nuclear loss of the ultrarelativistic muons, which provides\nthe main contribution to the total neutron yield. The total yield can be\ndescribed by a universal formula, which is the best fit of experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

Thanks to the short wavelength of mmWave radio, massive antenna\narrays can be packed into the limited dimensions of mmWave transceivers.\nTherefore, with directional beamforming (BF), both mmWave transmitters (MTXs)\nand mmWave receivers (MRXs) are capable of supporting multiple beams in 5G\nnetworks. However, for the transmission between an MTX and an MRX, most works\nhave only considered a single beam, which means that they do not make full\npotential use of mmWave. Furthermore, the connectivity of single beam\ntransmission can easily be blocked. In this context, we propose a single-user\nmulti-beam concurrent transmission scheme for future mmWave networks with\nmultiple reflected paths. Based on spatial spectrum reuse, the scheme can be\ndescribed as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique in beamspace\n(i.e., in the beam-number domain). Moreover, this study investigates the\nchallenges and potential solutions for implementing this scheme, including\nmultibeam selection, cooperative beam tracking, multi-beam power allocation and\nsynchronization. The theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed\nbeamspace SU-MIMO can largely improve the achievable rate of the transmission\nbetween an MTX and an MRX and, meanwhile, can maintain the connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 07:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}
