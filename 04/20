In so going, we introduce a covariant 1+2 splitting of\nthe 3-dimensional space, parallel and orthogonal to the direction of the field\nlines. The convergence, or the divergence, of the latter is monitored by the\nassociated Raychaudhuri equation, which is obtained by propagating the spatial\ndivergence of a unitary spacelike vector along its own direction. Applied to a\nmagnetic vector, the resulting expression shows that, although the convergence\nof the magnetic forcelines is affected by the gravitational pull of all the\nother sources, it is unaffected by the field's own gravity, irrespective of how\nstrong the latter is. This rather counterintuitive result is entirely due to\nthe magnetic tension, namely to the negative pressure the field exerts parallel\nto its lines of force. In particular, the magnetic tension always cancels out\nthe field's energy-density input to the Raychaudhuri equation, leaving the\nlatter free of any direct magnetic-energy contribution.

While the outputs from\nrate-equation models are strictly limited to such population information, the\ninputs -- in the form of the averaged rates that control the time-evolution of\nchemical populations -- can be guided by the results from more exact simulation\nmethods. Here, we examine the effects of back-diffusion, wherein particles\ndiffusing on a surface revisit binding sites on the lattice, slowing the total\nreaction rate. While this effect has been studied for two-particle systems, its\ninfluence at greater surface coverage of reactants has not been explored.\nResults from two Monte Carlo kinetics models (one a 2-D periodic lattice, the\nother the surface of a three dimensionally-realized grain) were used to develop\na means to incorporate the grain-surface back-diffusion effect into\nrate-equation methods. The effects of grain size, grain morphology, and surface\ncoverage on the magnitude of the back-diffusion effect were studied for the\nsimple H+H reaction system. The results were fit with expressions that can be\neasily incorporated into astrochemical rate-equation models to reproduce\naccurately the effects of back-diffusion on grain-surface reaction rates.\nBack-diffusion reduces reaction rates by a maximum factor of around 5 for the\ncanonical grain of $\\sim$10$^6$ surface sites, but this falls to unity at close\nto full surface coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

A principal appeal of these\ntechniques is their ability to identify a partition of brain regions (or nodes)\ninto communities, where nodes within a community are densely interconnected. In\ntheir simplest application, community detection algorithms are agnostic to the\npresence of community hierarchies, but a common characteristic of many neural\nsystems is a nested hierarchy. To address this limitation, we exercise a\nmulti-scale extension of a community detection technique known as modularity\nmaximization, and we apply the tool to both synthetic graphs and graphs derived\nfrom human structural and functional imaging data. Our multi-scale community\ndetection algorithm links a graph to copies of itself across neighboring\ntopological scales, thereby becoming sensitive to conserved community\norganization across neighboring levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate that\nthis method allows for a better characterization of topological inhomogeneities\nof the graph's hierarchy by providing a local (node) measure of community\nstability and inter-scale reliability across topological scales. We compare the\nbrain's structural and functional network architectures and demonstrate that\nstructural graphs display a wider range of topological scales than functional\ngraphs.

It has recently been proposed that any low-energy local bulk\noperators in a CFT boundary region's entanglement wedge can be reconstructed on\nthat boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on\nalgebraic consequences of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary\nrelative entropies, namely the theory of operator algebra quantum error\ncorrection. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only\napproximately equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations\nit is known that predictions from exact entropic equalities can be\nqualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery channels provides\na robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture in\naddition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator\nacting in a given boundary region's entanglement wedge can be expressed as the\nresponse of the boundary region's modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the\nbulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This formula can be\ninterpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes' rule that attempts to undo\nthe noise induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an\nintegral representation in terms of modular flows. To reach these conclusions,\nwe extend the theory of universal recovery channels to finite-dimensional\noperator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately preserve\nthe multiplicative structure of the operator algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 18:26:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 20:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 04:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The small-scale dynamo appears to be a viable\nmechanism to explain observations of strong magnetic fields in present-day and\nhigh-redshift galaxies, considering the extreme weakness of seed fields\npredicted by battery mechanisms or primordial fields. Performing\nhigh-resolution adaptive mesh magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a small mass,\nisolated cooling halo with an initial magnetic seed field strength well below\nequipartition, we follow the small-scale dynamo amplification from\nsupernova-induced turbulence up to saturation of the field. We find that\nsaturation occurs when the average magnetic pressure reaches only 3 % to 5 % of\nthe turbulent pressure. The magnetic energy growth transitions from exponential\nto linear, and finally comes to halt. The saturation level increases slightly\nwith grid resolution. These results are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions for magnetic Prandtl numbers of order $\\mathrm{Pr_M} \\sim 1$ and\nturbulent Mach numbers of order $\\mathrm{M} \\sim 10$. When we suppress\nsupernova feedback after our simulation has reached saturation, we find that\nturbulence decays and that the gas falls back onto a thin disk with the\nmagnetic field in local equipartition.\n  We propose a scenario in which galactic magnetic fields are amplified from\nweak seed fields in the early stages of the Universe to sub-equipartition\nfields, owing to the turbulent environment of feedback-dominated galaxies at\nhigh redshift, and are evolved further in a later stage up to equipartition, as\ngalaxies transformed into more quiescent, large spiral disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

We thus predict that all\nBHs that form in situ in the central parsec of our Galaxy remain in the GC,\nbuilding up a cluster of dark remnants. In addition, the change of NS orbits\ninduced by SNe may partially account for the observed dearth of NSs in the GC.\nAbout 40 per cent of remnants stay bound to the stellar companion after the\nkick; we expect up to 70 per cent of them might become X-ray binaries through\nRoche-lobe filling.

We compare\nthe results with the predictions of the recently proposed sound shell model.\nFor the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$\nbehaviour, where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The\npower spectra from deflagrations show similar features, but exhibit a steeper\nhigh-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for in the model. There are\ntwo independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness of\nthe sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is\nthe sound shell thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power\nspectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour of the velocity power spectrum is\nconsistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound shell, where it\nis steeper.

A simple method\nof tracking back stars and finding the closest point to the SNR centre is shown\nto have several failings when ranking candidates.

Electronic structure\nmethods which solve the molecular response problem through the solution of\nspectrally shifted linear systems, such as the complex polarization propagator,\noffer an alternative approach which is agnostic to the underlying spectral\ndensity or domain location.

Such processes\nmay explain the fast radio bursts phenomenology, in particular their\nmillisecond durations, large luminosities ${\\sim}10^{43}$ erg/s, high rate of\noccurrence $\\gtrsim 1000/\\mbox{day}$, as well as high brightness temperatures,\npolarized emission and Faraday rotation. Longer than the dynamical timescale of\nthe Bondi-like accretion for light primordial black holes allows for the\nrepeating fast radio bursts.

Nearby galaxies (d<5 Mpc) are particularly\nrelevant in this context since they fill the gap between studies in the Local\nGroup, where individual stars can be resolved, and galaxies in the Local Volume\nand beyond. We intend to characterize the W-R star population in NGC625, a\nlow-metallicity dwarf galaxy suffering a currently declining burst of star\nformation. Optical IFS data have been obtained with the VIMOS-IFU covering the\nstarburst region. We estimate the number of W-R stars using a linear\ncombination of 3 W-R templates: 1 early-type nitrogen (WN) star, 1 late-type WN\nstar and 1 carbon-type (WC) star (or oxygen-type (WO) star). Fits using several\nensembles of templates were tested. Results were confronted with: i) high\nspatial resolution HST photometry; ii) numbers of W-R stars in nearby galaxies;\niii) model predictions. The W-R star population is spread over the main body of\nthe galaxy, not necessarily coincident with the overall stellar distribution.\nOur best estimation for the number of W-R stars yields a total of 28 W-R stars\nin the galaxy, out of which 17 are early- type WN, 6 are late-type WN and 5 are\nWC stars. The width of the stellar features nicely correlates with the dominant\nW-R type found in each aperture. The distribution of the different types of WR\nin the galaxy is roughly compatible with the way star formation has propagated\nin the galaxy, according to previous findings using HST images. Fits using\ntemplates at the metallicity of the LMC yield more reasonable number of W-R\nthan those using templates at the metallicity of the SMC. Given the metallicity\nof NGC 625, this suggests a non-linear relation between the metallicity and the\nluminosity of the W-R spectral features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 21:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Our systematic studies show that chiral\nsymmetry restoration plays a crucial role in the description of heavy-ion\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3-20 GeV, realizing an increase of the hadronic\nparticle production in the strangeness sector with respect to the non-strange\none.

SAR images are affected\nfrom a granular contamination, speckle, that can be described by a\nmultiplicative model. Many despeckling techniques have been proposed in the\nliterature, as well as measures of the quality of the results they provide.\nAssuming the multiplicative model, the observed image $Z$ is the product of two\nindependent fields: the backscatter $X$ and the speckle $Y$. The result of any\nspeckle filter is $\\widehat X$, an estimator of the backscatter $X$, based\nsolely on the observed data $Z$. An ideal estimator would be the one for which\nthe ratio of the observed image to the filtered one $I=Z/\\widehat X$ is only\nspeckle: a collection of independent identically distributed samples from Gamma\nvariates. We, then, assess the quality of a filter by the closeness of $I$ to\nthe hypothesis that it is adherent to the statistical properties of pure\nspeckle. We analyze filters through the ratio image they produce with regards\nto first- and second-order statistics: the former check marginal properties,\nwhile the latter verifies lack of structure. A new quantitative image-quality\nindex is then defined, and applied to state-of-the-art despeckling filters.\nThis new measure provides consistent results with commonly used quality\nmeasures (equivalent number of looks, PSNR, MSSIM, $\\beta$ edge correlation,\nand preservation of the mean), and ranks the filters results also in agreement\nwith their visual analysis. We conclude our study showing that the proposed\nmeasure can be successfully used to optimize the (often many) parameters that\ndefine a speckle filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 23:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

The coexistence of a massive number of IoT devices poses a\nchallenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall\nnetwork alongside reducing the multi-hop transmission delay in order to support\nmission critical applications.

Automatically\ndebunking rumors at their stage of diffusion is known as \\textit{early rumor\ndetection}, which refers to dealing with sequential posts regarding disputed\nfactual claims with certain variations and highly textual duplication over\ntime. Thus, identifying trending rumors demands an efficient yet flexible model\nthat is able to capture long-range dependencies among postings and produce\ndistinct representations for the accurate early detection. However, it is a\nchallenging task to apply conventional classification algorithms to rumor\ndetection in earliness since they rely on hand-crafted features which require\nintensive manual efforts in the case of large amount of posts. This paper\npresents a deep attention model on the basis of recurrent neural networks (RNN)\nto learn \\textit{selectively} temporal hidden representations of sequential\nposts for identifying rumors. The proposed model delves soft-attention into the\nrecurrence to simultaneously pool out distinct features with particular focus\nand produce hidden representations that capture contextual variations of\nrelevant posts over time. Extensive experiments on real datasets collected from\nsocial media websites demonstrate that (1) the deep attention based RNN model\noutperforms state-of-the-arts that rely on hand-crafted features; (2) the\nintroduction of soft attention mechanism can effectively distill relevant parts\nto rumors from original posts in advance; (3) the proposed method detects\nrumors more quickly and accurately than competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 01:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

This tells that the skyrmions may more conveniently be\nclassified by two integers $(m,n)$. This is because the rational map which\ndetermines the baryon number in the popular multi-skyrmion solutions actually\ndescribes the monopole topology $\\pi_2(S^2)$ which is different from the baryon\ntopology $\\pi_3(S^3)$.

We analyse microscopy in the\ncontexts of R\\'enyi-Ulam games and half-lies, developing a new family of\nheuristics. We show the cost of insisting on verification by positive result in\nsearch algorithms; for the zero-half-lie case bisectioning with verification\nincurs a 50% penalty in the average number of queries required. The optimal\npartitioning of search spaces directly following verification in the presence\nof random half-lies is determined.

A common problem is to predict what\na user might do next for the purposes of guidance, recommendation, or\nprefetching. First-order and higher-order Markov chains have been widely used\nmethods to study such sequences of data. First-order Markov chains are easy to\nestimate, but lack accuracy when history matters. Higher-order Markov chains,\nin contrast, have too many parameters and suffer from overfitting the training\ndata. Fitting these parameters with regularization and smoothing only offers\nmild improvements. In this paper we propose the retrospective higher-order\nMarkov process (RHOMP) as a low-parameter model for such sequences. This model\nis a special case of a higher-order Markov chain where the transitions depend\nretrospectively on a single history state instead of an arbitrary combination\nof history states. There are two immediate computational advantages: the number\nof parameters is linear in the order of the Markov chain and the model can be\nfit to large state spaces. Furthermore, by providing a specific structure to\nthe higher-order chain, RHOMPs improve the model accuracy by efficiently\nutilizing history states without risks of overfitting the data. We demonstrate\nhow to estimate a RHOMP from data and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on various real application datasets spanning geolocation data, review\nsequences, and business locations. The RHOMP model uniformly outperforms\nhigher-order Markov chains, Kneser-Ney regularization, and tensor\nfactorizations in terms of prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 02:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

The knee and\nfaint-end slope show no clear evidence of redshift evolution from those at z~2.\nThe flat slope implies that the UV luminosity density of the quasar population\nis dominated by the quasars around the knee, and does not support the steeper\nfaint-end slope at higher redshifts reported at z>5. If we convert the M1450\nluminosity function to the hard X-ray 2-10keV luminosity function using the\nrelation between UV and X-ray luminosity of quasars and its scatter, the number\ndensity of UV-selected quasars matches well with that of the X-ray-selected\nAGNs above the knee of the luminosity function. Below the knee, the UV-selected\nquasars show a deficiency compared to the hard X-ray luminosity function. The\ndeficiency can be explained by the lack of obscured AGNs among the UV-selected\nquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 03:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Preferential attachment and node fitness are two simple growth\nmechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly\nobserved in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications\nin modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating\nvarious parametric forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no\nsuch package implementing non-parametric estimation procedures. The\nnon-parametric approach to the estimation of the preferential attachment\nfunction allows for comparatively finer-grained investigations of the\n`rich-get-richer' phenomenon that could lead to novel insights in the search to\nexplain certain nonstandard structural properties observed in real-world\nnetworks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements\nnon-parametric procedures for estimating the preferential attachment function\nand node fitnesses in a growing network, as well as a number of functions for\ngenerating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational\npart of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to\nlarge-scale networks. We first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit\nthrough simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration\nnetwork between scientists in the field of complex networks. The results\nindicate the joint presence of `rich-get-richer' and `fit-get-richer' phenomena\nin the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is observed to\nbe near-linear, which we interpret as meaning that the chance an author gets a\nnew collaborator is proportional to their current number of collaborators.\nFurthermore, the estimated author fitnesses reveal a host of familiar faces\nfrom the complex networks community among the field's topmost fittest network\nscientists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 05:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 09:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 02:14:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 15:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 04:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

For this challenging problem, a large\nvariety of algorithms have been developed in the fully-supervised setting,\nrequiring access to a large amount of labeled training data. However, the main\nbottleneck for fully-supervised re-ID is the limited availability of labeled\ntraining samples. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a\nself-trained subspace learning paradigm for person re-ID which effectively\nutilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a discriminative subspace\nwhere person images across disjoint camera views can be easily matched. The\nproposed approach first constructs pseudo pairwise relationships among\nunlabeled persons using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Then, with the\npseudo pairwise relationships, the unlabeled samples can be easily combined\nwith the labeled samples to learn a discriminative projection by solving an\neigenvalue problem. In addition, we refine the pseudo pairwise relationships\niteratively, which further improves the learning performance. A multi-kernel\nembedding strategy is also incorporated into the proposed approach to cope with\nthe non-linearity in person's appearance and explore the complementation of\nmultiple kernels. In this way, the performance of person re-ID can be greatly\nenhanced when training data are insufficient.

We further show that the invisibility obtained is both\npolarization and direction selective, which can probably play a significant\nrole in various applications including non-invasive detection, sensing, and\nnon-disturbing medical diagnosis with high sensitivity and precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 08:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 07:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

On the other\nhand, the dynamics of a non-reacting substance, Coumarin 153, provide the\ncalibrating tool for the friction over the FES, which is assumed to be solute\nindependent. A simpler and computationally faster approach uses the Generalized\nSmoluchowski Equation (GSE), which can be derived from the GLE for pure\nharmonic potentials. Both approaches reproduce the measurements in most of the\nsolvents reasonably well. At long times, some differences arise from the errors\ninherited from the analysis of the stationary solvatochromism and at short\ntimes from the excess excitation energy. However, whenever the dynamics become\nslow the GSE shows larger deviations than the GLE, the results of which always\nagree qualitatively with the measured dynamics, regardless of the solvent\nviscosity or dielectric properties. The here applied method can be used to\npredict the dynamics of any other reacting system, given the FES parameters and\nsolvent dynamics are provided. Thus no fitting parameters enter the GLE\nsimulations, within the applicability limits found for the model in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 09:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

A challenge and still an open issue for most of the methods\nis to handle images in entirely different scales, i.e. different magnitudes of\ngradients that cannot be dealt with by a global scaling of the data. We propose\nthe use of generalized Bregman distances and infimal convolutions thereof with\nregard to the well-known total variation functional. The use of a total\nvariation subgradient respectively the involved vector field rather than an\nimage gradient naturally excludes the magnitudes of gradients, which in\nparticular solves the scaling behavior.

More specifically, we focus on the design of compact\nname-independent fault-tolerant routing schemes, where the designer of the\nscheme is not allowed to assign names to nodes, i.e., the name of a node is\njust its identifier. Given a set $F$ of faulty (or forbidden) edges, the goal\nis to route from a source node $s$ to a target $t$ avoiding the forbidden edges\nin $F$.\n  Given any name-dependent fault-tolerant routing scheme and any\nname-independent routing scheme, we show how to use them as a black box to\nconstruct a name-independent fault-tolerant routing scheme.

However, real-world\nnetworked dynamical systems operating synchronously are prone to random\nperturbations driving the system to arbitrary states within the corresponding\nbasin of attraction, thereby leading to epochs of desynchronized dynamics with\na priori unknown durations. Thus, it is highly relevant to have an estimate of\nthe duration of such transient phases before the system returns to synchrony,\nfollowing a random perturbation to the dynamical state of any particular node\nof the network. We address this issue here by proposing the framework of\n\\emph{single-node recovery time} (SNRT) which provides an estimate of the\nrelative time scales underlying the transient dynamics of the nodes of a\nnetwork during its restoration to synchrony. We utilize this in differentiating\nthe particularly \\emph{slow} nodes of the network from the relatively\n\\emph{fast} nodes, thus identifying the critical nodes which when perturbed\nlead to significantly enlarged recovery time of the system before resuming\nsynchronized operation. Further, we reveal explicit relationships between the\nSNRT values of a network, and its \\emph{global relaxation time} when starting\nall the nodes from random initial conditions. We employ the proposed concept\nfor deducing microscopic relationships between topological features of nodes\nand their respective SNRT values. The framework of SNRT is further extended to\na measure of resilience of the different nodes of a networked dynamical system.\nWe demonstrate the potential of SNRT in networks of R\\\"{o}ssler oscillators on\nparadigmatic topologies and a model of the power grid of the United Kingdom\nwith second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics illustrating the conceivable\npractical applicability of the proposed concept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 10:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

To open a door, the\nalgorithm knocks on it and it might open or not according to some probability\ndistribution. This distribution may depend on which other doors are currently\nopen, as well as on which other doors were open during each of the previous\nknocks on that door. The algorithm aims to minimize the expected time until all\ndoors open. Crucially, it must act at any time without knowing whether or which\nother doors have already opened. In this work, we focus on scenarios where\ndependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The\nfundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the\nbest of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show\nthat if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same\nfundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal\nrunning time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies\nbetween doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that\nare optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors\nshare the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler\nalgorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse\nthe price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard\nfundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic\nin $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for\nother distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds.\nEven for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an\nintriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading\nmemoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently\nwith probability $p\\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is\nopen, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability\n$p\\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that\nare optimal up to an additive term of 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 11:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

The\ndynamics of the local many-body states reveals two effects, thermal blocking\nand kinetic freezing, which manifest themselves when the Hund's coupling\nbecomes of the order of the temperature or the bandwidth, respectively. These\neffects, which are absent in the single-band Hubbard model, should be relevant\nfor the interpretation of experiments on correlated materials with multiple\nactive orbitals. In particular, the features revealed in the non-equilibrium\nenergy distribution of the photo-carriers are experimentally accessible, and\nprovide information on the role of the Hund's coupling in these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 12:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The system consists of two ferromagnetic layers alternating in space.\nWe have taken into consideration materials commonly used in magnonics: yttrium\niron garnet, CoFeB, permalloy, and cobalt. The coupled mode theory (CMT)\nformalism have been successfully implemented to describe magnetoelastic\ninteraction as a periodic perturbation in the magphonic crystal. The results of\nCMT calculations have been verified by more rigorous simulations by\nfrequency-domain plane wave method and time-domain finite element method. The\npresented resonant coupling in the magphonic crystal is an active in-space\nmechanism which spatially transfers energy between propagating spin and\nacoustic modes, thus creating propagating magnetoelastic wave. We have shown,\nthat CMT analysis of the magnetoelastic coupling is an useful tool to optimize\nand design a spin wave - acoustic wave transducer based on a magphonic\ncrystals. The effect of spin wave damping has been included to the model to\ndiscuss the efficiency of such a device. Our model shows that it is possible to\nobtain forward conversion of the acoustic wave to the spin wave in case of\nco-directional coupling and backward conversion in case of contra-directional\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 12:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

Until recently, it was widely accepted that\nsuperconductivity is spin-fluctuation driven and intimately related to their\nfermiology, specifically, hole and electron pockets separated by the same wave\nvector that characterizes the dominant spin fluctuations, and supporting order\nparameters (OP) of opposite signs. This picture was questioned after the\ndiscovery of a new family, based on the FeSe layers, either intercalated or in\nthe monolayer form. The critical temperatures there reach ~40 K, the same as in\noptimally doped bulk FeSe - despite the fact that intercalation removes the\nhole pockets from the Fermi level and, seemingly, undermines the basis for the\nspin-fluctuation theory and the idea of a sign-changing OP. In this paper,\nusing the recently proposed phase-sensitive quasiparticle interference\ntechnique, we show that in LiOH intercalated FeSe compound the OP does change\nsign, albeit within the electronic pockets, and not between the hole and\nelectron ones. This result unifies the pairing mechanism of iron based\nsuperconductors with or without the hole Fermi pockets and supports the\nconclusion that spin fluctuations play the key role in electron pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems have been designed in the\nlast years for other e+/e- colliders like PEP-II, KEKB, DAFNE, SuperB and\nSuperKEKB. In all these cases, similar approaches have been implemented, even\nif some design variations have been suitable or necessary for different\nreasons. Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems are based on the concept that the\nbarycenter of each bunch moves with harmonic motion around the equilibrium\npoint in three planes (L, H, V). The feedback copes with the forcing excitation\nby producing damping correction for each individual bunch.

This allows us to establish the emergence of macroscopic behaviour such\nas coherence of dynamics among hubs of the same connectivity layer (i.e. with\nthe same number of connections), and chaotic behaviour of the poorly connected\nnodes.

To illustrate how and to\nwhat extent the model dependence due to the treatment of the nuclear effects is\nunder control, we apply our approach to the extraction procedure of the neutron\nsingle spin asymmetries from those measured for $^3$He for values of the\nkinematical variables relevant both for forthcoming experiments at Jefferson\nLab and, with an exploratory purpose, for the future Electron Ion Collider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 15:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

From these high altitude atmospheric\nregions, resulting geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can lead to\nfluctuations in ground currents that affect the electric power grid and\npotentially overload transformers during extreme storms. The most extreme\ngeomagnetic storm on record, known as the 1859 Carrington event, was so intense\nthat ground-based magnetometers were saturated at high magnetic latitudes. The\nmost reliable, un-saturated observation is the hour-resolution data from the\nColaba Magnetic Observatory in India. However, higher frequency components --\nfluctuations at second through minute time cadence -- to the magnetic field can\nplay a significant role in GIC-related effects.

Using the\nmagnetic field model and ground conductivity models, we produce an electric\nfield model. This method can be applied to create similar magnetic and electric\nfield models for studies of GIC effects on power-grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}
