Depending on the\ntask complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to\ntrain a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even\nimpractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired\nby dual learning from natural language translation, we develop a novel dual-GAN\nmechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of\nunlabeled images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns\nto translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN\nlearns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks\nallows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence\na loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be\nused to train the translators. Experiments on multiple image translation tasks\nwith unlabeled data show considerable performance gain of DualGAN over a single\nGAN. For some tasks, DualGAN can even achieve comparable or slightly better\nresults than conditional GAN trained on fully labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 16:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 06:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 20:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

To eliminate such\nartifacts, when decompressing an image, it is required to recover the original\nimage from a disturbed version. To this end, we present a feed-forward fully\nconvolutional residual network model trained using a generative adversarial\nframework. To provide a baseline, we show that our model can be also trained\noptimizing the Structural Similarity (SSIM), which is a better loss with\nrespect to the simpler Mean Squared Error (MSE).

By modeling chemistry and\nradiative transfer in the dense core surrounding the protostars, we find that\nthe ortho-D2H+ and para-H2D+ absorption features mainly originate in the cool\n(T<18 K) outer envelope of the core. In contrast, the ortho-H2D+ emission from\nthe core is significantly absorbed by the ambient molecular cloud. Analyses of\nthe combined D2H+ and H2D+ data result in an age estimate of ~500 000 yr for\nthe core, with an uncertainty of ~200 000 yr. The core material has probably\nbeen pre-processed for another 500 000 years in conditions corresponding to\nthose in the ambient molecular cloud. The inferred time scale is more than ten\ntimes the age of the embedded protobinary. The D2H+ and H2D+ ions have large\nand nearly equal total (ortho+para) fractional abundances of ~$10^{-9}$ in the\nouter envelope. This confirms the central role of H3+ in the deuterium\nchemistry in cool, dense gas, and adds support to the prediction of chemistry\nmodels that also D3+ should be abundant in these conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 19:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Recent studies have shown that cells can extract multi-dimensional\ninformation from dynamical concentration patterns of signaling molecules. We\nherein study how biochemical systems can process multi-dimensional information\nembedded in dynamical patterns. We model the decoding networks by linear\nresponse functions, and optimize the functions with the calculus of variations\nto maximize the mutual information between patterns and output. We find that,\nwhen the noise intensity is lower, decoders with different linear response\nfunctions, i.e., distinct decoders, can extract much information. However, when\nthe noise intensity is higher, distinct decoders do not provide the maximum\namount of information. This indicates that, when transmitting information by\ndynamical patterns, embedding information in multiple patterns is not optimal\nwhen the noise intensity is very large. Furthermore, we explore the biochemical\nimplementations of these decoders using control theory and demonstrate that\nthese decoders can be implemented biochemically through the modification of\ncascade-type networks, which are prevalent in actual signaling pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2017 06:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 04:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Quantum turbulence is\ncurrently one of the most important problems in low temperature physics and is\nactively studied for superfluid helium and atomic Bose--Einstein condensates.

The dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluid helium are described\nby the vortex filament model, while the dynamics of condensates are described\nby the Gross--Pitaevskii model. Both of these models are nonlinear, and the\nquantum turbulent states of interest are far from equilibrium. Hence, numerical\nstudies have been indispensable for studying quantum turbulence. In fact,\nnumerical studies have contributed in revealing the various problems of quantum\nturbulence. This article reviews the recent developments in numerical studies\nof quantum turbulence.

However, one of the key issues of this scheme is that continuous-time\nfeedback and memory cannot be incorporated into the channel model. It turns out\nthat this issue can be circumvented by considering the Brownian motion\nformulation of a continuous-time white Gaussian channel. Nevertheless, as\nopposed to the white Gaussian noise formulation, a link that establishes the\ninformation-theoretic connection between a continuous-time channel under the\nBrownian motion formulation and its discrete-time counterparts has long been\nmissing. This paper is to fill this gap by establishing causality-preserving\nconnections between continuous-time Gaussian feedback/memory channels and their\nassociated discrete-time versions in the forms of sampling and approximation\ntheorems, which we believe will play important roles in the long run for\nfurther developing continuous-time information theory.\n  As an immediate application of the approximation theorem, we propose the\nso-called approximation approach to examine continuous-time white Gaussian\nchannels in the point-to-point or multi-user setting. It turns out that the\napproximation approach, complemented by relevant tools from stochastic\ncalculus, can enhance our understanding of continuous-time Gaussian channels in\nterms of giving alternative and strengthened interpretation to some long-held\nfolklore, recovering \"long known\" results from new perspectives, and rigorously\nestablishing new results predicted by the intuition that the approximation\napproach carries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2017 07:23:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2017 08:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 11:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

String theory gives rise to\nplausible dark matter candidates due to the breaking of the non--Abelian Grand\nUnified Theory (GUT) symmetries by Wilson lines. The physical spectrum then\ncontains states that do not satisfy the quantisation conditions of the unbroken\nGUT symmetry. Given that the Standard Model states are identified with broken\nGUT representations, and provided that any ensuing symmetry breaking is induced\nby components of GUT states, leaves a remnant discrete symmetry that forbid the\ndecay of the Wilsonian states. A class of such states are obtained in a\nheterotic-string derived $Z^\\prime$ model. The model exploits the spinor-vector\nduality symmetry, observed in the fermionic $Z_2\\times Z_2$ heterotic-string\norbifolds, to generate a $Z^\\prime\\in E_6$ symmetry that may remain unbroken\ndown to low energies. The $E_6$ symmetry is broken at the string level with\ndiscrete Wilson lines.

Traditional approaches based on handcrafted features are limited to\nrepresent the complexity of motion patterns. Recent methods that use Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNN) to handle raw skeletons only focus on the contextual\ndependency in the temporal domain and neglect the spatial configurations of\narticulated skeletons. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream RNN\narchitecture to model both temporal dynamics and spatial configurations for\nskeleton based action recognition. We explore two different structures for the\ntemporal stream: stacked RNN and hierarchical RNN. Hierarchical RNN is designed\naccording to human body kinematics.

At the same time, we report a correlation between the lag\nand the galactic stellar mass, central stellar velocity dispersion, and axial\nratio of the light distribution. These correlations suggest a possible higher\nratio of infalling-to-local gas in early-type disk galaxies or a connection\nbetween lags and the possible presence of hot gaseous halos, which may be more\nprevalent in more massive galaxies.

The concern\nincreases when the system admits two alternative steady states and the\ntransition is abrupt and irreversible (catastrophic shift).

Following these works we present here a numerical\nstudy of a one-dimensional stochastic desertification model, where the\ndeterministic predictions are confronted with the observed dynamics. Our\nresults suggest that a stochastic spatial system allows for a propagating front\nonly when its active phase invades the inactive (desert) one.

We study these bicoloured torus loop groups by demonstrating\nthat they have a theory analogous to that of ordinary torus loop groups. We\nnamely construct certain central extensions of them by the group $\\mathrm U(1)$\nand prove that they have many properties in common with specific, known,\ncentral extensions of ordinary loop groups.

Using flow visualization we characterize the subcritical transition to\nturbulence in Couette-Poiseuille flow and show the existence of turbulent spots\ngenerated by a permanent perturbation. Due to the zero mean advection velocity\nof the base profile, these turbulent structures are nearly stationary.

Additionally, the capacity of\na component that can be implemented feasibly is limited. Therefore, distributed\nquantum computation is required to scale up quantum computers.\n  This dissertation presents a new quantum computer architecture which takes\ninto account imperfections, aimed to realize distributed computation by\nconnecting quantum computers each of which consists of multiple quantum CPUs\nand memories. Quantum CPUs employ a quantum error correcting code which has\nfaster logical gates and quantum memories employ a code which is superior in\nspace resource requirements.\n  This dissertation focuses on quantum error correcting codes, giving a\npractical, concrete method for tolerating static losses such as faulty devices\nfor the surface code. Numerical simulation with practical assumptions showed\nthat a yield of functional qubits of 90% is marginally capable of building\nlarge-scale systems, by culling the poorer 50% of lattices during\npost-fabrication testing. Yield 80% is not usable even when culling 90% of\ngenerated lattices.\n  For internal connections in a quantum computer and for connections between\nquantum computers, this dissertation gives a fault-tolerant method that bridges\nheterogeneous quantum error correcting codes. Numerical simulation showed that\nthe scheme, which discards any quantum state in which any error is detected,\nalways achieves an adequate logical error rate regardless of physical error\nrates in exchange for increased resource consumption.\n  This dissertation gives a new extension of the surface code suitable for\nmemories. This code is shown to require fewer physical qubits to encode a\nlogical qubit than conventional codes. This code achieves the reduction of 50%\nphysical qubits per a logical qubit.\n  Collectively, the elements to propose the distributed quantum computer\narchitecture are brought together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2017 15:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

However, current\nalgorithms for learning sparse directed graphs are generally designed to handle\nonly one type of data (continuous-only or discrete-only), which limits their\napplicability to a large class of multi-modal biological datasets that include\nmixed type variables.
