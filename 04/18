Inspired by the\nsuccess of deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a DNN-based approach for\nEnd-to-End 3D FAce Reconstruction (UH-E2FAR) from a single 2D image. Different\nfrom recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3D face in an iterative\nmanner using both an RGB image and an initial 3D facial shape rendering, our\nDNN model is end-to-end, and thus the complicated 3D rendering process can be\navoided. Moreover, we integrate in the DNN architecture two components, namely\na multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nimprove facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function, 3D\nface reconstruction is divided into neutral 3D facial shape reconstruction and\nexpressive 3D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3D facial shape is\nclass-specific. Therefore, higher layer features are useful. In comparison, the\nexpressive 3D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With\nthe fusion-CNN, features from different intermediate layers are fused and\ntransformed for predicting the 3D expressive facial shape. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework in\nimproving the accuracy of 3D face reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 16:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

We introduce a\n$Z_2$-parity in the model, under which an odd-parity is assigned to one RHN,\nwhile all the other particles is assigned to be $Z_2$-even, and hence the\n$Z_2$-odd RHN serves as a DM candidate.

To compare the computational abilities of different theories within\nthis framework we show that any theory satisfying three natural physical\nprinciples possess a well-defined oracle model. Indeed, we prove a subroutine\ntheorem for oracles in such theories which is a necessary condition for the\noracle to be well-defined. The three principles are: causality (roughly, no\nsignalling from the future), purification (each mixed state arises as the\nmarginal of a pure state of a larger system), and strong symmetry existence of\nnon-trivial reversible transformations). Sorkin has defined a hierarchy of\nconceivable interference behaviours, where the order in the hierarchy\ncorresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible interaction in a\nmulti-slit experiment.

LOFAR, one of the Square Kilometre Array pathfinders, is already\nproducing data on a petabyte scale. The calibration of these data presents a\nhuge challenge for final users: a) extensive storage and computing resources\nare required; b) the installation and maintenance of the processing software is\nnot trivial; and c) the requirements of (experimental) calibration pipelines\nare quickly evolving. After encountering some limitations in classical\ninfrastructures, we investigated the viability of cloud infrastructures as a\nsolution. We found that the installation and operation of LOFAR data\ncalibration pipelines is not only possible, but can also be efficient in cloud\ninfrastructures. The main advantages were: (1) ease of software installation\nand maintenance, and the availability of standard APIs and tools, widely used\nin the industry; this reduces the requirement for significant manual\nintervention, which can have a highly negative impact; (2) flexibility to adapt\nthe infrastructure to the needs of the problem, especially as those demands\nchange over time; (3) on-demand consumption of (shared) resources. We found no\nsignificant impediments associated with the speed of data transfer, the use of\nexternal block storage, or the memory available. However, the availability of\nscratch storage areas of an appropriate size is critical. Finally, we\nconsidered the cost-effectiveness of a commercial cloud like Amazon Web\nServices. While it is more expensive than the operation of a large,\nfully-utilised cluster completely dedicated to LOFAR data reduction, its costs\nare competitive if the number of datasets to be analysed is not high, or if the\ncosts of maintaining the dedicated system become high.

Given the\ndensity of the intra-cluster medium and the galaxy's mass, projected position\nand velocity within the cluster, we estimate that JO201 must so far have lost\n~50% of its gas during infall via RPS. The MUSE data indeed reveal a smooth\nstellar disk, accompanied by large projected tails of ionised (Halpha) gas,\ncomposed of kinematically cold (velocity dispersion <40km/s) star-forming knots\nand very warm (>100km/s) diffuse emission which extend out to at least ~50 kpc\nfrom the galaxy centre. The ionised Halpha-emitting gas in the disk rotates\nwith the stars out to ~6 kpc but in the disk outskirts becomes increasingly\nredshifted with respect to the (undisturbed) stellar disk. The observed\ndisturbances are consistent with the presence of gas trailing behind the\nstellar component, resulting from intense face-on RPS happening along the line\nof sight. Our kinematic analysis is consistent with the estimated fraction of\nlost gas, and reveals that stripping of the disk happens outside-in, causing\nshock heating and gas compression in the stripped tails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 18:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Using these results, we find strong evidences\nof a double effect of ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium onto the\ngas of the galaxy.

Such nonthermal\nelectrons have been invoked to explain the infrared and X-ray spectra and\nstrong variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the black hole at the Galactic\nCenter. We present a method for self-consistent evolution of a nonthermal\nelectron population in the GRMHD code KORAL. The electron distribution is\ntracked across Lorentz factor space and is evolved in space and time, in\nparallel with thermal electrons, thermal ions, and radiation. In the present\nstudy, for simplicity, energy injection into the nonthermal distribution is\ntaken as a fixed fraction of the local electron viscous heating rate. Numerical\nresults are presented for a model with a low mass accretion rate similar to\nthat of Sgr A*. We find that the presence of a nonthermal population of\nelectrons has negligible effect on the overall dynamics of the system.

One series of Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayers with tCu\nranging from 0.5 nm to 6 nm was produced with the conventional two-pulse\nplating by using a galvanostatic/potentiostatic (G/P) pulse combination for the\nmagnetic/non-magnetic layer deposition, respectively, whereby the Cu layer\ndeposition was carried out at the electrochemically optimized potential.\nAnother Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayer series with the same tCu range was prepared\nwith the help of a G/P/G pulse combination. In this latter case, first a\nbilayer of Co(2 nm)/Cu(6 nm) was deposited in each cycle as in the G/P mode\nafter which a third G pulse was applied with a small anodic current to dissolve\npart of the 6 nm thick Cu layer in order to ensure the targeted tCu value. The\ncomparison of the two series revealed that the G/P/G pulse combination yields\nmultilayers for which GMR can be obtained even at such low nominal Cu layer\nthicknesses where G/P multilayers already exhibit bulk-like anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance only. Surface roughness measurements by atomic force\nmicroscopy revealed that the two kinds of pulse combination yield different\nsurface roughness values which correlate with the structural quality of the\nmultilayers as indicated by the absence or presence of multilayer satellite\nreflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns.

Sorkin has\nintroduced a hierarchy of mathematically conceivable higher-order interference\nbehaviours, where classical theory lies at the first level of this hierarchy\nand quantum theory theory at the second. Informally, the order in this\nhierarchy corresponds to the number of slits on which the interference pattern\nhas an irreducible dependence. Many authors have wondered why quantum\ninterference is limited to the second level of this hierarchy. Does the\nexistence of higher-order interference violate some natural physical principle\nthat we believe should be fundamental? In the current work we show that such\nprinciples can be found which limit interference behaviour to second-order, or\n\"quantum-like\", interference, but that do not restrict us to the entire quantum\nformalism.

In particular, the\norientation of Bennu needs to be recovered with good accuracy during orbital\noperations to contribute as small an error as possible to the landing error\nbudget. Although Bennu is well characterized from Earth-based radar\nobservations, its orientation dynamics are not sufficiently known to exclude\nthe presence of a small wobble.

Also\nemploying a computerised feature extraction approach applied at a single\nresolution scale might not suffice in accurately delineating the mixture of\nhistopathological patterns. In this work we propose a novel multiresolution\nfeature extraction approach for characterising the textural properties of the\ndifferent pathological patterns (i.e. mainly cell nuclei shape, orientation and\nspatial arrangement within the cytoplasm). The pattern textural properties are\ncharacterised at various scales and orientations for an improved separability\nbetween the different extracted features. The Gabor filter energy output of\neach magnitude response was combined with four other fixed-resolution texture\nsignatures (2 model-based and 2 statistical-based) with and without cell nuclei\nsegmentation. The highest classification accuracy of 95% was reported when\ncombining the Gabor filters energy and the meningioma subimage fractal\nsignature as a feature vector without performing any prior cell nuceli\nsegmentation.

Among candidate solid-state\nnonvolatile memory technologies that could potentially be used to construct\nSCM, flash memory is a well-established technology and have been widely used in\ncommercially available SCM incarnations. Flash-based SCM enables much better\ntradeoffs between performance, space and power than disk-based systems.\nHowever, write endurance is a significant challenge for a flash-based SCM (each\nact of writing a bit may slightly damage a cell, so one flash cell can be\nwritten 10^4--10^5 times, depending on the flash technology, before it becomes\nunusable). This is a well-documented problem and has received a lot of\nattention by manufactures that are using some combination of write reduction\nand wear-leveling techniques for achieving longer lifetime. In an effort to\nimprove flash lifetime, first, by quantifying data longevity in an SCM, we show\nthat a majority of the data stored in a solid-state SCM do not require long\nretention times provided by flash memory (i.e., up to 10 years in modern\ndevices); second, by exploiting retention time relaxation, we propose a novel\nmechanism, called Dense-SLC (D-SLC), which enables us perform multiple writes\ninto a cell during each erase cycle for lifetime extension; and finally, we\ndiscuss the required changes in the flash management software (FTL) in order to\nuse this characteristic for extending the lifetime of the solid-state part of\nan SCM. Using an extensive simulation-based analysis of a flash-based SCM, we\ndemonstrate that D-SLC is able to significantly improve device lifetime\n(between 5.1X and 8.6X) with no performance overhead and also very small\nchanges at the FTL software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 22:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Many believe an essential component of this process was the\nevolution of evolvability, whereby evolution speeds up its ability to innovate\nby generating a more adaptive pool of offspring. One hypothesized mechanism for\nevolvability is developmental canalization, wherein certain dimensions of\nvariation become more likely to be traversed and others are prevented from\nbeing explored (e.g. offspring tend to have similarly sized legs, and mutations\naffect the length of both legs, not each leg individually). While ubiquitous in\nnature, canalization almost never evolves in computational simulations of\nevolution. Not only does that deprive us of in silico models in which to study\nthe evolution of evolvability, but it also raises the question of which\nconditions give rise to this form of evolvability. Answering this question\nwould shed light on why such evolvability emerged naturally and could\naccelerate engineering efforts to harness evolution to solve important\nengineering challenges. In this paper we reveal a unique system in which\ncanalization did emerge in computational evolution. We document that genomes\nentrench certain dimensions of variation that were frequently explored during\ntheir evolutionary history. The genetic representation of these organisms also\nevolved to be highly modular and hierarchical, and we show that these\norganizational properties correlate with increased fitness. Interestingly, the\ntype of computational evolutionary experiment that produced this evolvability\nwas very different from traditional digital evolution in that there was no\nobjective, suggesting that open-ended, divergent evolutionary processes may be\nnecessary for the evolution of evolvability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 22:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 18:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

To combat the\neffect of stragglers, recent literature introduces redundancy in computations\nacross processors, e.g.,~using repetition-based strategies or erasure codes.\nThe fusion node can exploit this redundancy by completing the computation using\noutputs from only a subset of the processors, ignoring the stragglers. In this\npaper, we propose a novel technique -- that we call \"Short-Dot\" -- to introduce\nredundant computations in a coding theory inspired fashion, for computing\nlinear transforms of long vectors. Instead of computing long dot products as\nrequired in the original linear transform, we construct a larger number of\nredundant and short dot products that can be computed faster and more\nefficiently at individual processors. In reference to comparable schemes that\nintroduce redundancy to tackle stragglers, Short-Dot reduces the cost of\ncomputation, storage and communication since shorter portions are stored and\ncomputed at each processor, and also shorter portions of the input is\ncommunicated to each processor. We demonstrate through probabilistic analysis\nas well as experiments that Short-Dot offers significant speed-up compared to\nexisting techniques. We also derive trade-offs between the length of the\ndot-products and the resilience to stragglers (number of processors to wait\nfor), for any such strategy and compare it to that achieved by our strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 02:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

With ARQ, under the SINR\nmodel, the effective downlink rate of packet transmission is the reciprocal of\nthe expected delay (number of retransmissions needed till success), which we\nuse as our network capacity definition after scaling it with the BS density.\n  Exact characterization of this natural capacity metric for cellular wireless\nnetworks is derived. The capacity is shown to first increase polynomially with\nthe BS density in the low BS density regime and then scale inverse\nexponentially with the increasing BS density. Two distinct upper bounds are\nderived that are relevant for the low and the high BS density regimes. A single\npower control strategy is shown to achieve the upper bounds in both the\nregimes.

However, the impact of network topology design on\nthe convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we\nbegin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For\nedge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the\noptimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of\nnetwork resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge\nscheduling.

We\nintroduce the family of semi-martingale channels where the channel output is a\nsemi-martingale stochastic process, and the channel input modulates the\ncharacteristics of the semi-martingale. For these channels, which includes as a\nspecial case the continuous time Gaussian and Poisson models, we establish new\nrepresentations relating the mutual information between the channel input and\noutput to an optimal causal filtering loss, thereby unifying and considerably\nextending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. Extensions to the\nsetting of mismatched estimation are also presented where the relative entropy\nbetween the laws governing the output of the channel under two different input\ndistributions is equal to the cumulative difference between the estimation loss\nincurred by using the mismatched and optimal causal filters respectively.

Augmented with various Simultaneous\nLocalization and Mapping techniques (SLAM), loop closure detection allows for\nincremental pose correction and can bolster efficient and accurate map\ncreation. However, repeated and similar scenes (perceptual aliasing) and long\nterm appearance changes (e.g. weather variations) are major challenges for\ncurrent place recognition algorithms.

Here we present the current\nstatus of our ongoing high precision study of in-medium spectral properties of\nboth bottomonium and charmonium based on NRQCD on the lattice. This effective\nfield theory allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modeling\nassumptions in a thermal QCD medium.

Especially, in some applications, it is\noften needed to compute 2-D complex Gabor filter bank consisting of the 2-D\ncomplex Gabor filtering outputs at multiple orientations and frequencies.\nAlthough several approaches for fast 2-D complex Gabor filtering have been\nproposed, they primarily focus on reducing the runtime of performing the 2-D\ncomplex Gabor filtering once at specific orientation and frequency. To obtain\nthe 2-D complex Gabor filter bank output, existing methods are repeatedly\napplied with respect to multiple orientations and frequencies. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach that efficiently computes the 2-D complex Gabor\nfilter bank by reducing the computational redundancy that arises when\nperforming the Gabor filtering at multiple orientations and frequencies. The\nproposed method first decomposes the Gabor basis kernels to allow a fast\nconvolution with the Gaussian kernel in a separable manner. This enables\nreducing the runtime of the 2-D complex Gabor filter bank by reusing\nintermediate results of the 2-D complex Gabor filtering computed at a specific\norientation. Furthermore, we extend this idea into 2-D localized sliding\ndiscrete Fourier transform (SDFT) using the Gaussian kernel in the DFT\ncomputation, which lends a spatial localization ability as in the 2-D complex\nGabor filter. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs faster than\nstate-of-the-arts methods for fast 2-D complex Gabor filtering, while\nmaintaining similar filtering quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 08:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Emission line\nprofiles of AlO, AlOH and AlCl are detected and are used to derive a lower\nlimit of atomic aluminium incorporated in molecules. We show that the gas-phase\naluminium chemistry is completely different in both stars, with a remarkable\ndifference in the AlO and AlOH abundance stratification. The amount of\naluminium locked up in these 3 molecules is small, <=1.1e-7, for both stars,\ni.e. only <=2% of the total aluminium budget.

For this purpose, they use the\nso-called hot spot score, which is the result of a combination of multiple\nnetwork measurements and reflects the instantaneous overall performance of\nindividual sectors. While operators have a good understanding of the current\nperformance of a network and its overall trend, forecasting the performance of\neach sector over time is a challenging task, as it is affected by both regular\nand non-regular events, triggered by human behavior and hardware failures. In\nthis paper, we study the spatio-temporal patterns of the hot spot score and\nuncover its regularities. Based on our observations, we then explore the\npossibility to use recent measurements' history to predict future hot spots. To\nthis end, we consider tree-based machine learning models, and study their\nperformance as a function of time, amount of past data, and prediction horizon.\nOur results indicate that, compared to the best baseline, tree-based models can\ndeliver up to 14% better forecasts for regular hot spots and 153% better\nforecasts for non-regular hot spots. The latter brings strong evidence that,\nfor moderate horizons, forecasts can be made even for sectors exhibiting\nisolated, non-regular behavior. Overall, our work provides insight into the\ndynamics of cellular sectors and their predictability. It also paves the way\nfor more proactive network operations with greater forecasting horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 09:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

A significant\namount of materials (up to several tens of percent of the total mass of the\nprotoplanets) is ejected by giant impacts. We call these ejected fragments the\ngiant-impact fragments (GIFs). In some of the erosive hit-and-run and\nhigh-velocity collisions, metallic iron is also ejected, which comes from the\ncolliding protoplanets' cores. From ten numerical simulations for the giant\nimpact stage, we found that the mass fraction of metallic iron in GIFs ranges\nfrom ~ 1wt% to ~ 25wt%. We also discussed the effects of the GIFs on the\ndynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We\nfound that the GIFs have the potential to solve the following dynamical and\ngeochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is\nlikely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. The\nGIFs are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to\nits current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of\nhighly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what\nwas predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of the iron-bearing GIFs onto the\nEarth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, the estimated amount\nof iron-bearing GIFs provides significant reducing agent that could transform\nprimitive CO2-H2O atmosphere and ocean into more reducing H2-bearing\natmosphere. Thus, GIFs are important for the origin of Earth's life and its\nearly evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 09:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Here we present new detections of\nmolecular gas at low metallicities, and assess the physical conditions in the\ngas through various CO transitions for 8 galaxies. For one, NGC 1140 (Z/Zsun ~\n0.3), two detections of 13CO isotopologues and atomic carbon, [CI](1-0), and an\nupper limit for HCN(1-0) are also reported. After correcting to a common beam\nsize, we compared 12CO(2-1)/12CO(1-0) (R21) and 12CO(3-2)/12CO(1-0) (R31) line\nratios of our sample with galaxies from the literature and find that only NGC\n1140 shows extreme values (R21 ~ R31 ~ 2).

We\nevaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the\nMountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both\ncases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides\nwith a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour,\nmaximizing the mutual information between neurons and sensorimotor patterns.\nFinally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic approach to the\ncomprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive presence of\ncriticality in biological and cognitive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 09:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 08:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 10:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

Comm. 7:\n12518, 2016) reported recently that for the biflagellate microalga\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii contact with microparticles is controlled by events\nin which the object is entrained by the swimmer over large distances. However,\nneither the universality of this interaction mechanism nor its physical origins\nare currently understood. Here we show that particle entrainment is indeed a\ngeneric feature for microorganisms either pushed or pulled by flagella. By\ncombining experiments, simulations and analytical modelling we reveal that\nentrainment length, and therefore contact time, can be understood within the\nframework of Taylor dispersion as a competition between advection by the no\nslip surface of the cell body and microparticle diffusion. The existence of an\noptimal tracer size is predicted theoretically, and observed experimentally for\nC. reinhardtii. Spatial organisation of flagella, swimming speed, swimmer and\ntracer size influence entrainment features and provide different trade-offs\nthat may be tuned to optimise microbial interactions like predation and\ninfection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 10:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The magnetic susceptibility of these samples is field\nindependent in the temperature range 10 - 400 K and does not show irreversible\neffects at low temperatures. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility of\nsamples with iron excess shows substantial field dependence at high\ntemperatures and manifests a pronounced magnetic irreversibility at low\ntemperatures with a difference between ZFC and FC susceptibilities and a\nmaximum at 10 K reminiscent of a magnetic transition. Single crystal x-ray\ndiffraction of the stoichiometric samples revealed a single phase spinel\nstructure without site inversion.

It is common practice to assume that players\nquickly converge to an equilibrium, e.g. a Nash equilibrium. This can be\nstudied in terms of best reply dynamics, in which each player myopically uses\nthe best response to her opponent's last move. Existing research shows that\nconvergence can be problematic when there are best reply cycles. Here we\ncalculate how typical this is by studying the space of all possible two-player\nnormal form games and counting the frequency of best reply cycles. The two key\nparameters are the number of moves, which defines how complicated the game is,\nand the anti-correlation of the payoffs, which determines how competitive it\nis. We find that as games get more complicated and more competitive, best reply\ncycles become dominant. The existence of best reply cycles predicts\nnon-convergence of six different learning algorithms that have support from\nhuman experiments. Our results imply that for complicated and competitive games\nequilibrium is typically an unrealistic assumption. Alternatively, if for some\nreason \"real\" games are special and do not possess cycles, we raise the\ninteresting question of why this should be so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 16:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

It has been noticed for a long time that the\nphenomenon is \"scale-free\", indicating some type of criticality. In spite of\nattempts to invoke \"Self-Organized Criticality\", the physical origin of this\ncriticality, and also its universal nature, being quite insensitive to the\nnature of microscopic interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed that\nthe precise nature of this critical behavior is manifested by a spinodal point\nof a thermodynamic phase transition. Moreover, at the spinodal point there\nexists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the\nsystem-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to\nthe mechanical yield. Demonstrating this requires the introduction of an \"order\nparameter\" that is suitable for distinguishing between disordered amorphous\nsystems, and an associated correlation function, suitable for picking up the\ngrowing correlation length. The theory, the order parameter, and the\ncorrelation functions used are universal in nature and can be applied to any\namorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield. Critical exponents for the\ncorrelation length divergence and the system size dependence are estimated. The\nphenomenon is seen at its sharpest in athermal systems, as is explained below;\nin this paper we extend the discussion also to thermal systems, showing that at\nsufficiently high temperatures the spinodal phenomenon is destroyed by thermal\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

Recently, there has been progress\nin extending the reach of perturbation theory to larger k using ideas borrowed\nfrom effective field theory. We revisit the computation of the redshift-space\nmatter power spectrum within this framework, including for the first time the\nfull one-loop time dependence. We use a resummation scheme proposed by Vlah et\nal. to account for damping of baryonic acoustic oscillations due to large-scale\nrandom motions and show that this has a significant effect on the multipole\npower spectra. We renormalize by comparison to a suite of custom N-body\nsimulations matching the MultiDark MDR1 cosmology.

Then, the\nsearch of solutions can be reduced to the random embedding of a low dimensional\nspace into the original one, resulting in a more manageable optimization\nproblem. Specifically, in the case of time consuming black-box functions and\nwhen the budget of evaluations is severely limited, global optimization with\nrandom embeddings appears as a sound alternative to random search. Yet, in the\ncase of box constraints on the native variables, defining suitable bounds on a\nlow dimensional domain appears to be complex. Indeed, a small search domain\ndoes not guarantee to find a solution even under restrictive hypotheses about\nthe function, while a larger one may slow down convergence dramatically. Here\nwe tackle the issue of low-dimensional domain selection based on a detailed\nstudy of the properties of the random embedding, giving insight on the\naforementioned difficulties. In particular, we describe a minimal\nlow-dimensional set in correspondence with the embedded search space.

Estimates for the sensitivity of\nSKA-low phases 1 and 2 to UHE particles are given, along with the achievable\nscience goals with each stage. Prospects for near-future observations with\nother instruments are also described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 13:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

An\nimportant step in this direction is to infer the transcription factor-gene\nregulatory network (GRN). However gene regulatory networks are typically\nconstructed disregarding the fact that regulatory programs are conditioned on\ntissue type, developmental stage, sex, and other factors. Collecting multitude\nof features required for a reliable construction of GRNs such as physical\nfeatures and functional features for every context of interest is costly.\nTherefore we need methods that is able to use the knowledge of a\ncontext-agnostic network for construction of a context specific regulatory\nnetwork.\n  To address this challenge we developed a computational approach that uses\ncontext specific expression data and a GRN constructed in a different but\nrelated context to construct a context specific GRN. Our method, NetREX, is\ninspired by network component analysis that estimates TF activities and their\ninfluences on target genes given predetermined topology of a TF-gene network.\nTo predict a network under a different condition, NetREX removes the\nrestriction that the topology of the TF-gene network is fixed and allows for\nadding and removing edges to that network. To solve the corresponding\noptimization problem, we provide a general mathematical framework allowing use\nof the recently proposed PALM technique and develop a convergent algorithm.\n  We tested our NetREX on simulated data and subsequently applied it to gene\nexpression data in adult females from Drosophila deletion (DrosDel) panel.

We propose an iterative expectation-maximization based successive\ninterference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of\nresidual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA)\nof the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a\nlow complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog\ncircuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as\n1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect\nToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running\nthe EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated\nfor each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA\nresolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of\ntime-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate\nsuch as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small\nsearch window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the\nrefined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three\ncells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the\nposition of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical\nsimulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against\nimpairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual\nFO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional\nToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 18:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

(SODA 2013) that restricts beating a $1/2$\ncompetitive ratio for the monotone submodular welfare maximization problem, our\nresult can be seen as strong evidence that solving the weighted bipartite\nmatching problem is strictly easier than submodular welfare maximization in the\nonline setting. Our approach relies on a very controlled use of randomness,\nwhich allows our algorithm to safely make adaptive decisions based on its\nprevious assignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

By studying the methane desorption from layered CH4:CO ice,\nindirect desorption processes triggered by the excitation of the CO molecules\nis monitored and quantified. Methods. Tunable monochromatic VUV light from the\nDESIRS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron is used in the 7 - 13.6 eV (177 - 91\nnm) range to irradiate pure CH4 or layers of CH4 deposited on top of CO ice\nsamples.

CH4 photodesorbs for photon energies higher than ~9.1 eV\n(~136 nm). The photodesorption spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of CH4,\nwhich confirms a desorption mechanism mediated by electronic transitions in the\nice. When it is deposited on top of CO, CH4 desorbs between 8 and 9 eV with a\npattern characteristic of CO absorption, indicating desorption induced by\nenergy transfer from CO molecules. Conclusions. The photodesorption of CH4 from\nthe pure ice in various interstellar environments is around 2.0 x 10^-3\nmolecules per incident photon.

The intermediate-luminosity Swift\nGRB 161219B and its associated supernova SN 2016jca, which occurred at a\nredshift of z=0.1475, represents only the seventh GRB-SN to have been\ndiscovered within 1 Gpc, and hence provides an excellent opportunity to\ninvestigate the observational and physical properties of these very elusive and\nrare type of SN. As such, we present optical to near-infrared photometry and\noptical spectroscopy of GRB 161219B and SN 2016jca, spanning the first three\nmonths since its discovery. GRB 161219B exploded in the disk of an edge-on\nspiral galaxy at a projected distance of 3.4 kpc from the galactic centre.

The strong\ndriving force for polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling)\nis balanced by the light band effective-masses, leading to a\nstrongly-interacting large-polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility\nwould help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility\nneed to consider the polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong\ninteractions. In this material we expect that at room temperature polar-optical\nphonon mode scattering will dominate, and so limit mobility. We calculate the\ntemperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by\nvariationally solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature\nfree-energies of \\=Osaka. This model considers a simplified effective-mass\nband-structure interacting with a continuum dielectric of characteristic\nresponse frequency. We parametrise the model fully from electronic-structure\ncalculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300 K we predict electron and\nhole mobilities of 133 and 94 cm^2/V/s respectively. These are in acceptable\nagreement with single-crystal measurements, suggesting that the intrinsic limit\nof the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions for\nhot-electron photo-excited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model\nalso exposes the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to\ninterpret impedance measurements of the charge-carrier state. We provide the\nphonon-drag mass-renormalisation, and scattering time constants. These could be\nused as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure dependent\nmobility simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 16:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 16:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 15:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are\nincompletely defined. Although the technologies for autoantibody discovery have\nadvanced dramatically over the past decade, each of these techniques generates\nhundreds of possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to validate. We set\nout to establish a method to greatly simplify autoantibody discovery, using a\npre-filtering step to define subgroups with similar specificities based on\nmigration of radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl\nsulfate (SDS) gels and autoradiography [$\\textbf{G}$el\n$\\textbf{E}$lectrophoresis and band detection on $\\textbf{A}$utoradiograms\n(GEA)]. Human recognition of patterns is not optimal when the patterns are\ncomplex or scattered across many samples.

The\nBayesian model combines information from multiple gel sets and corrects spatial\nwarping for coherent estimation of autoantibody signatures defined by presence\nor absence of a grid of landmark proteins. We show the pre-processing creates\nmore clearly separated clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody\nsubset detection via hierarchical clustering.

Then measurements of relative humidity within the\nmaterial are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the\ncomputation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown\nparameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the\nexperimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions\nout of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification\nmethod and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were\nidentified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii)\nmultiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period\nfor each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor\nhas to be placed near the impermeable boundary. After the measurements, the\nparameter estimation problem is solved using an interior point algorithm to\nminimize the cost function.

In addition,\nthe OED sensitivity functions enable to capture an approximation of the\nprobability distribution function of the estimated parameters. The determined\nsorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the\nexperimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the model\ndoes not take into account the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity.\nTherefore, the model is improved proposing a second differential equation for\nthe sorption capacity to take into account the hysteresis between the main\nadsorption and desorption curves.

In this context, here we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of ion migration effects in perovskite solar cells.\nSpecifically, we show, for the first time, that (a) the effect of ionic charges\nis almost indistinguishable from that of dopant ions, (b) ion migration could\nlead to simultaneous improvement in Voc and degradation in Jsc - a unique\nobservation which is beyond the realm of mere parametric variation in carrier\nmobility and lifetime, (c) champion devices are more resilient towards the ill\neffects of ion migration, and finally (d) we propose unique characterization\nschemes to determine both magnitude and polarity of ionic species. Our results,\nsupported by detailed numerical simulations and direct comparison with\nexperimental data, are of broad interest and provide a much needed predictive\ncapability towards the research on performance degradation mechanisms in\nperovskite solar cells\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 21:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Monte Carlo methods\nform a particularly important class of numerical methods for solving problems\nin statistical physics. Although these methods are simple in principle, their\nproper use requires a good command of statistical mechanics, as well as\nconsiderable computational resources. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate\nhow the usage of widely accessible graphics cards on personal computers can\nelevate the computing power in Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude,\nthus allowing live classroom demonstration of phenomena that would otherwise be\nout of reach. As an example, we use the public goods game on a square lattice\nwhere two strategies compete for common resources in a social dilemma\nsituation. We show that the second-order phase transition to an absorbing phase\nin the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and we\ncompare the time needed to arrive at this result by means of the main processor\nand by means of a suitable graphics card. Parallel computing on graphics\nprocessing units has been developed actively during the last decade, to the\npoint where today the learning curve for entry is anything but steep for those\nfamiliar with programming. The subject is thus ripe for inclusion in graduate\nand advanced undergraduate curricula, and we hope that this paper will\nfacilitate this process in the realm of physics education. To that end, we\nprovide a documented source code for an easy reproduction of presented results\nand for further development of Monte Carlo simulations of similar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

For applications of outdoor\nrobotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for\nextracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the\nformulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information\nbeing incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features\nand motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic\nmotion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating\noptical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution\nnetwork.

In this work, we propose to compute the PV plant maximum power\nstarting from the indirectly-estimated irradiance. Three estimators are\ncompared in terms of i) ability to compute the PV plant maximum power, ii)\nbandwidth and iii) robustness against measurements noise. The approaches rely\non measurements of the DC voltage, current, and cell temperature and on a model\nof the PV array. We show that the considered methods can accurately reconstruct\nthe PV maximum generation even during curtailment periods, i.e. when the\nmeasured PV power is not representative of the maximum potential of the PV\narray. Performance evaluation is carried out by using a dedicated experimental\nsetup on a 14.3 kWp rooftop PV installation. Results also proved that the\nanalyzed methods can outperform pyranometer-based estimations, with a less\ncomplex sensing system. We show how the obtained PV maximum power values can be\napplied to train time series-based solar maximum power forecasting techniques.\nThis is beneficial when the measured power values, commonly used as training,\nare not representative of the maximum PV potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 09:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-12"}
