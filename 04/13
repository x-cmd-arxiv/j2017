This procedure can be applied to certain\nsuperconformal field theories, transforming all fields to holomorphic ones. It\nalso allows to describe certain superconformal field theories within the\nlanguage of super vertex operator algebras. We discuss reflection and its\nlimitations in general, and we argue that through reflection, the Conway\nMoonshine Module inherits from the K3 theory a richer structure than\nanticipated so far. The comparison between the Conway Moonshine Module and the\nK3 theory is considerably facilitated by exploiting the free fermion\ndescription as well as the lattice vertex operator algebra description of both\ntheories. We include an explicit construction of cocycles for the relevant\ncharge lattices, which are half integral.

This subclass consists of\nlong GRBs with a carbon-oxygen core and a neutron star (NS) binary companion as\nprogenitors. The hypercritical accretion of the supernova (SN) ejecta onto the\nNS can lead to the gravitational collapse of the NS into a black hole.\nConsequently, one can observe a GRB emission with isotropic energy\n$E_{iso}\\gtrsim10^{52}$~erg, as well as the associated GeV emission and the FPA\nphase.

Most of the studies idealize\nthe porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according\nto the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction\nfactor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's\nexperimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation\nin simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,\ntwo key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the\ntortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation\ncoefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that\nKlinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent\nand intrinsic permeabilities is $\\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen\nnumbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number.

We also discuss first submissions to the benchmark\nthat use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a work horse, which\nalready show remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art. CNNs\nhave become the de-facto standard for many tasks in computer vision and machine\nlearning like semantic segmentation or object detection in images, but have no\nyet led to a true breakthrough for 3D point cloud labelling tasks due to lack\nof training data. With the massive data set presented in this paper, we aim at\nclosing this data gap to help unleash the full potential of deep learning\nmethods for 3D labelling tasks. Our semantic3D.net data set consists of dense\npoint clouds acquired with static terrestrial laser scanners. It contains 8\nsemantic classes and covers a wide range of urban outdoor scenes: churches,\nstreets, railroad tracks, squares, villages, soccer fields and castles. We\ndescribe our labelling interface and show that our data set provides more dense\nand complete point clouds with much higher overall number of labelled points\ncompared to those already available to the research community. We further\nprovide baseline method descriptions and comparison between methods submitted\nto our online system. We hope semantic3D.net will pave the way for deep\nlearning methods in 3D point cloud labelling to learn richer, more general 3D\nrepresentations, and first submissions after only a few months indicate that\nthis might indeed be the case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 17:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

The adoption process from the initiation stage until the\nacquisition of innovation is considered as a decision made by organisation\nwhile the process of innovation assimilation is assumed as a result of the user\nacceptance of innovation within the organisation. In addition, the model\ndescribes the IS Security adoption process progressing in three sequential\nstages, i.e. pre-adoption, adoption- decision and post-adoption phases. The\nmodel also introduces several factors that influence the different stages of IS\nSecurity innovation adoption process. This study contributes to IS security\nliterature by proposing an overall model of IS security adoption that includes\norganisational adoption and user acceptance of innovation in a single\nillustration. Also, IS security adoption model proposed in this study provides\nimportant practical implications for research and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 17:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 06:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

In this letter, we analyse deep ALMA/870um and SCUBA-2/450um imaging\nof the claimed \"post-starburst\" galaxy ZF-20115 at z=3.717 that exhibits a\nstrong Balmer break and absorption lines. The far-infrared imaging reveals a\nluminous starburst located 0.4+/-0.1 arcsec (~3kpc in projection) from the\nposition of the rest-frame ultra-violet/optical emission, with an obscured\nstar-formation rate of 100 Mo/yr. This star-forming component is undetected in\nthe rest-frame ultraviolet but contributes significantly to the lower angular\nresolution photometry at restframe wavelengths >3500A, significantly\ncomplicating the determination of a reliable stellar mass. Importantly, in the\npresence of dust obscuration, strong Balmer features are not a unique signature\nof a post-starburst galaxy and are indeed frequently observed in\ninfrared-luminous galaxies. We conclude that the ZF20015 system does not pose a\nchallenge to current models of galaxy formation and that deep sub-/millimeter\nobservations are a prerequisite for any claims of quiescence. The\nmulti-wavelength observations of ZF20115 unveil a complex system with an\nintricate and spatially-varying star-formation history.

In this work, we\nfocus on nonlinear optical media whose response is modeled by a system of first\norder nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which include a single\nresonance linear Lorentz dispersion, and the nonlinearity comes from the\ninstantaneous electronic Kerr response and the residual Raman molecular\nvibrational response. To design efficient, accurate, and stable computational\nmethods, we apply high order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in space to\nthe hybrid PDE-ODE Maxwell system with several choices of numerical fluxes, and\nthe resulting semi-discrete methods are shown to be energy stable. Under some\nrestrictions on the strength of the nonlinearity, error estimates are also\nestablished. When we turn to fully discrete methods, the challenge to achieve\nprovable stability lies in the temporal discretizations of the nonlinear terms.\nTo overcome this, novel strategies are proposed to treat the nonlinearity in\nour model within the framework of the second-order leap-frog and implicit\ntrapezoidal time integrators. The performance of the overall algorithms are\ndemonstrated through numerical simulations of kink and antikink waves, and\nthird-harmonic generation in soliton propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 19:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

This technique has been established as a fundamental tool in\nextragalactic research. It has been extensively applied to large spectroscopic\ndata sets, notably the SDSS, leading to important insights into the galaxy\nassembly history. However, despite significant improvements over the past\ndecade, all current PSS codes suffer from two major deficiencies that inhibit\nus from gaining sharp insights into the star-formation history (SFH) of\ngalaxies and potentially introduce substantial biases in studies of their\nphysical properties (e.g., stellar mass, mass-weighted stellar age and specific\nstar formation rate). These are i) the neglect of nebular emission in spectral\nfits, consequently, ii) the lack of a mechanism that ensures consistency\nbetween the best-fitting SFH and the observed nebular emission characteristics\nof a star-forming (SF) galaxy. In this article, we present FADO (Fitting\nAnalysis using Differential evolution Optimization): a conceptually novel,\npublicly available PSS tool with the distinctive capability of permitting\nidentification of the SFH that reproduces the observed nebular characteristics\nof a SF galaxy. This so-far unique self-consistency concept allows us to\nsignificantly alleviate degeneracies in current spectral synthesis. The\ninnovative character of FADO is further augmented by its mathematical\nfoundation: FADO is the first PSS code employing genetic differential evolution\noptimization. This, in conjunction with other unique elements in its\nmathematical concept (e.g., optimization of the spectral library using\nartificial intelligence, convergence test, quasi-parallelization) results in\nkey improvements with respect to computational efficiency and uniqueness of the\nbest-fitting SFHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 20:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

However, mvMSE has three drawbacks: 1) mvMSE values are either\nundefined or unreliable for short signals; 2) mvMSE is not fast enough for\nreal-time applications; and 3) the computation of mvMSE for signals with a\nlarge number of channels requires the storage of a huge number of elements.\nMethods: To deal with these problems and improve the stability of mvMSE, we\nintroduce multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE - mvMDE) as an\nextension of our recently developed MDE, to quantify the complexity of\nmultivariate time series. Results: We assess mvMDE, in comparison with mvMSE\nand multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE), on correlated and\nuncorrelated multi-channel noise signals, bivariate autoregressive processes,\nand three biomedical datasets. The results show that mvMDE takes into account\ndependencies in patterns across both the time and spatial domains. The mvMDE,\nmvMSE, and mvMFE methods are consistent in that they lead to similar\nconclusions about the underlying physiological conditions. However, the\nproposed mvMDE discriminates various physiological states of the biomedical\nrecordings better than mvMSE and mvMFE. In addition, for both the short and\nlong time series, the mvMDE-based results are noticeably more stable than the\nmvMSE- and mvMFE-based ones. Conclusion: For short multivariate time series,\nmvMDE, unlike mvMSE, does not result in undefined values. Furthermore, mvMDE is\nnoticeably faster than mvMFE and mvMSE and also needs to store a considerably\nsmaller number of elements. Significance: Due to its ability to detect\ndifferent kinds of dynamics of multivariate signals, mvMDE has great potential\nto analyse various physiological signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 22:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been\nintroduced to address the training. Though BN accelerates the training in the\nbeginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and\nnegatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and\nnumerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the\nlack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these\nissues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN\ntraining that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality\nof the generated samples.

In this paper, we study a new kind of query-Reverse k Nearest\nNeighbor Search over Trajectories (RkNNT), which can be used for route planning\nand capacity estimation. Given a set of existing routes DR, a set of passenger\ntransitions DT, and a query route Q, a RkNNT query returns all transitions that\ntake Q as one of its k nearest travel routes. To solve the problem, we first\ndevelop an index to handle dynamic trajectory updates, so that the most\nup-to-date transition data are available for answering a RkNNT query. Then we\nintroduce a filter refinement framework for processing RkNNT queries using the\nproposed indexes. Next, we show how to use RkNNT to solve the optimal route\nplanning problem MaxRkNNT (MinRkNNT), which is to search for the optimal route\nfrom a start location to an end location that could attract the maximum (or\nminimum) number of passengers based on a pre-defined travel distance threshold.\nExperiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our\napproaches. To the best of our best knowledge, this is the first work to study\nthe RkNNT problem for route planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 03:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

In contrast to\nLyapunov-stability-based approaches---which ensure the poles of the reduced\nsystem remain in the open left-half plane---the proposed method preserves\nmarginal stability by reducing the subsystem with poles on the imaginary axis\nin a manner that ensures those poles remain purely imaginary. In particular,\nthe proposed method decomposes a marginally stable LTI system into (1) an\nasymptotically stable subsystem with eigenvalues in the open left-half plane\nand (2) a pure marginally stable subsystem with a purely imaginary spectrum. We\npropose a method based on inner-product projection and the Lyapunov inequality\nto reduce the first subsystem while preserving asymptotic stability. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the pure marginally stable subsystem is a\ngeneralized Hamiltonian system; we then propose a method based on symplectic\nprojection to reduce this subsystem while preserving pure marginal stability.\nIn addition, we propose both inner-product and symplectic balancing methods\nthat balance the operators associated with two quadratic energy functionals\nwhile preserving asymptotic and pure marginal stability, respectively.

Their relevance\nranges from them being an activity indicator of magnetic fields to being the\nplace where coronal mass ejections and flares erupt. They are therefore also an\nimportant ingredient of space weather. Their formation, however, is still an\nunresolved problem in solar physics. Observations utilize just 2D surface\ninformation near the spot, but it is debatable how to infer deep structures and\nproperties from local helioseismology. For a long time, it was believed that\nflux tubes rising from the bottom of the convection zone are the origin of the\nbipolar sunspot structure seen on the solar surface. However, this theory has\nbeen challenged, in particular recently by new surface observation,\nhelioseismic inversions, and numerical models of convective dynamos. In this\narticle we discuss another theoretical approach to the formation of sunspots:\nthe negative effective magnetic pressure instability. This is a large-scale\ninstability, in which the total (kinetic plus magnetic) turbulent pressure can\nbe suppressed in the presence of a weak large-scale magnetic field, leading to\na converging downflow, which eventually concentrates the magnetic field within\nit. Numerical simulations of forced stratified turbulence have been able to\nproduce strong super-equipartition flux concentrations, similar to sunspots at\nthe solar surface. In this framework, sunspots would only form close to the\nsurface due to the instability constraints on stratification and rotation.\nAdditionally, we present some ideas from local helioseismology, where we plan\nto use the Hankel analysis to study the pre-emergence phase of a sunspot and to\nconstrain its deep structure and formation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 10:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Unfortunately, in a conventional microscope with\ncircular illumination aperture, partial coherence tends to diminish the phase\ncontrast, exacerbating the inherent noise-to-resolution tradeoff in TIE\nimaging, resulting in strong low-frequency artifacts and compromised imaging\nresolution. Here, we demonstrate how these issues can be effectively addressed\nby replacing the conventional circular illumination aperture with an annular\none. The matched annular illumination not only strongly boosts the phase\ncontrast for low spatial frequencies, but significantly improves the practical\nimaging resolution to near the incoherent diffraction limit. By incorporating\nhigh-numerical aperture (NA) illumination as well as high-NA objective, it is\nshown, for the first time, that TIE phase imaging can achieve a transverse\nresolution up to 208 nm, corresponding to an effective NA of 2.66. Time-lapse\nimaging of in vitro Hela cells revealing cellular morphology and subcellular\ndynamics during cells mitosis and apoptosis is exemplified. Given its\ncapability for high-resolution QPI as well as the compatibility with widely\navailable brightfield microscopy hardware, the proposed approach is expected to\nbe adopted by the wider biology and medicine community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 12:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 16:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 02:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

In contrary, we report of a relatively unexplored property, namely,\nits superior optoelectronic property in reduced dimension. We demonstrate here\nthat nanostructured Nb thin films (NNFs), under optical illumination, behave as\nroom temperature photo-switches and exhibit bolometric features below its\nsuperconducting critical temperature. Both photo-switch and superconducting\nbolometric behavior are monitored by its resistance change with light in\nvisible and near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. Unlike the conventional\nphotodetectors, the NNF devices switch to higher resistive states with light\nand the corresponding resistivity change is studied with thickness and grain\nsize variations. At low temperature in its superconducting state, the light\nexposure shifts the superconducting transition towards lower temperature. The\nroom temperature photon sensing nature of the NNF is explained by the photon\nassisted electron-phonon scattering mechanism while the low temperature light\nresponse is mainly related to the heat generation which essentially changes the\neffective temperature for the device and the device is capable of sensing a\ntemperature difference of few tens of milli-kelvins. The observed\nphoto-response on the transport properties of NNFs can be very important for\nfuture superconducting photon detectors, bolometers and phase slip based device\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 12:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

Leveraging tools from large deviations theory, we\nprove that this meta-optimization problem admits a unique solution: The best\npredictor-prescriptor pair is obtained by solving a distributionally robust\noptimization problem over all distributions within a given relative entropy\ndistance from the empirical distribution of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 13:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 22:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 15:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

We assume\nthat the sum-over-state formula only comprises transitions involving electrons\nin the valence orbitals like $6s$, $5d$, $6p$ or $7s$, while transitions\ninvolving $4f$ core electrons are neglected. Applying this formalism to the\nground level of configuration $4f^q6s^2$, we restrict the sum to transitions\nimplying the $4f^q6s6p$ configuration, which yields polarizabilities depending\non two parameters: an effective transition energy and an effective transition\ndipole moment. Then, by introducing configuration-interaction mixing between\n$4f^q6s6p$ and other configurations, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of\nthe scalar, vector and tensor polarizabilities is very sensitive to\nconfiguration-interaction coefficients, whereas the real part is not.

However, for naive users,\nthe intuitive way to obtain a desired texture is to provide semantic\ndescriptions such as \"regular,\" \"lacelike,\" and \"repetitive\" and then a\nprocedural model with proper parameters will be automatically suggested to\ngenerate the corresponding textures. By contrast, it is less practical for\nusers to learn mathematical models and tune parameters based on multiple\nexaminations of large numbers of generated textures. In this study, we propose\na novel framework that generates procedural textures according to user-defined\nsemantic descriptions, and we establish a mapping between procedural models and\nsemantic texture descriptions. First, based on a vocabulary of semantic\nattributes collected from psychophysical experiments, a multi-label learning\nmethod is employed to annotate a large number of textures with semantic\nattributes to form a semantic procedural texture dataset. Then, we derive a low\ndimensional semantic space in which the semantic descriptions can be separated\nfrom one other. Finally, given a set of semantic descriptions, the diverse\nproperties of the samples in the semantic space can lead the framework to find\nan appropriate generation model that uses appropriate parameters to produce a\ndesired texture. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is\neffective and that the generated textures closely correlate with the input\nsemantic descriptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

We start\nby deriving the average status update age of an infinite incremental redundancy\n(IIR) system in which the transmission of a k-symbol update continuesuntil k\nsymbols are received. This system is then compared to a fixed redundancy (FR)\nsystem in which each update is transmitted as an n symbol packet and the packet\nis successfully received if and only if at least k symbols are received.

In CDI, salt ions are removed from the\nfeedwater and stored in electric double layers (EDLs) within micropores of\nelectrically charged porous carbon electrodes. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated that CDI electrodes exhibit selective ion removal based on ion\nsize, with the smaller ion being preferentially removed in the case of\nequal-valence ions. However, state-of-the-art CDI theory does not capture this\nobserved selectivity, as it assumes volume-less point ions in the micropore\nEDLs. We here present a theory which includes multiple couterionic species, and\nrelaxes the point ion assumption by incorporating ion volume exclusion\ninteractions into a description of the micropore EDLs. The developed model is a\ncoupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations which can be solved for micropore\nion concentrations and electrode Donnan potential at cell equilibrium. We\ndemonstrate that this model captures key features of the experimentally\nobserved size-based ion selectivity of CDI electrodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The accuracy of these models is assessed with respect\nto the measured impedances in PSCAD/EMTDC, and their effects on the stability\nassessment were analyzed as well.

However, little is known about\nalgorithms that break this runtime barrier.\n  Using tools from stochastic trace estimation, polynomial approximation, and\nfast system solvers, we show how to efficiently isolate different ranges of\n$A$'s spectrum and approximate the number of singular values in these ranges.\nWe thus effectively compute a histogram of the spectrum, which can stand in for\nthe true singular values in many applications.\n  We use this primitive to give the first algorithms for approximating a wide\nclass of symmetric matrix norms in faster than matrix multiplication time.

The study of\nattractors and the search for distinct types of attractor have been a central\ntask in nonlinear dynamics. In smooth dynamical systems, an attractor is often\nenclosed completely in its basin of attraction with a finite distance from the\nbasin boundary. Recent works have uncovered that, in neuronal networks,\nunstable attractors with a remote basin can arise, where almost every point on\nthe attractor is locally transversely repelling.

More importantly, we also\ndesign a repulsive force term, which maximizes the distances between each label\ndependent sub-domain to all others so as to drag different class dependent\nsub-domains far away from each other and thereby increase the discriminative\npower of the adapted domain. Moreover, given the fact that the underlying data\nmanifold could have complex geometric structure, we further propose the\nconstraints of label smoothness and geometric structure consistency for label\npropagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 36 cross-domain image\nclassification tasks over four public datasets. The comprehensive results show\nthat the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nwith significant margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 08:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

In\nfact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component\nof spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the\nhistory of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent\nwith common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural\ncircuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these\ncontinuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing\nprocesses might have. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for\nthese seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context\nof reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous\nprocesses, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the\ncapability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for\nspecific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes\nin the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer\nsimulations that stable computational performance is compatible with\ncontinuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good\ncomputational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network\narchitecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural\nactivity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of\nreinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of\nreward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 10:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 08:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 12:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Using\nour recent convergence results for asynchronous imitation dynamics on networks,\nwe consider how such networks can be efficiently driven to a desired\nequilibrium state by offering payoff incentives for using a certain strategy,\neither uniformly or targeted to individuals. In particular, if for each\navailable strategy, agents playing that strategy receive maximum payoff when\ntheir neighbors play that same strategy, we show that providing incentives to\nagents in a network that is at equilibrium will result in convergence to a\nunique new equilibrium. For the case when a uniform incentive can be offered to\nall agents, this result allows the computation of the optimal incentive using a\nbinary search algorithm. When incentives can be targeted to individual agents,\nwe propose an algorithm to select which agents should be chosen based on\niteratively maximizing a ratio of the number of agents who adopt the desired\nstrategy to the payoff incentive required to get those agents to do so.\nSimulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm computes near-optimal\ntargeted payoff incentives for a range of networks and payoff distributions in\ncoordination games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 18:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}
