We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities\nfor the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction\ncoefficients for the haze. We found the following major conclusions: 1) We\nconfirmed temperatures in Pluto's upper atmosphere that were colder than\nexpected before the New Horizons flyby, with upper atmospheric temperatures\nnear 65-68 K. The inferred enhanced Jeans escape rates were (3e22-7e22) N2/s\nand (4e25-8e25) CH4/s at the exobase (at a radius of ~2900 km, or an altitude\nof ~1710 km). 2) We measured CH4 abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the\nsurface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH4 and Alice and REX N2 measurements\nimplied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient,\nmost likely between 550 and 4000 cm2/s. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient\nplaced the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small\nplanetary boundary layer. The inferred CH4 surface mixing ratio was\n~0.28-0.35%. 3) The abundance profiles of the C2Hx hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4,\nC2H6) were not simply exponential with altitude. We detected local maxima in\nline-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C2H4, near 320 km for C2H2,\nand an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for\nC2H6.

In this work we propose a movie description\nmodel which learns to generate description and jointly ground (localize) the\nmentioned characters as well as do visual co-reference resolution between pairs\nof consecutive sentences/clips. We also propose to use weak localization\nsupervision through character mentions provided in movie descriptions to learn\nthe character grounding. At training time, we first learn how to localize\ncharacters by relating their visual appearance to mentions in the descriptions\nvia a semi-supervised approach. We then provide this (noisy) supervision into\nour description model which greatly improves its performance. Our proposed\ndescription model improves over prior work w.r.t. generated description quality\nand additionally provides grounding and local co-reference resolution. We\nevaluate it on the MPII Movie Description dataset using automatic and human\nevaluation measures and using our newly collected grounding and co-reference\ndata for characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 16:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

The outcome distributions of\nparticipants with missing and observed data are often different, which\nincreases the risk of bias. Causal inference methods may aid in reducing the\nbias and improving efficiency by incorporating baseline variables into the\nanalysis. In particular, doubly robust estimators incorporate estimates of two\nnuisance parameters: the outcome regression and the missingness mechanism, to\nadjust for differences in the observed and unobserved groups that can be\nexplained by observed covariates. Such nuisance parameters are traditionally\nestimated using parametric models, which generally preclude consistent\nestimation, particularly in moderate to high dimensions. Recent research on\nmissing data has focused on data-adaptive estimation of the nuisance parameters\nin order to achieve consistency, but the large sample properties of such\nestimators are poorly understood.

While cavity dynamics have been studied\nfor over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of\ndeformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface\nimpact, elastomeric sphere deform significantly, resulting in large-scale\nmaterial oscillations within the sphere, resulting in unique nested cavities.\nWe study these phenomena experimentally with high speed imaging and image\nprocessing techniques. The water entry behavior of deformable spheres differs\nfrom rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as\nwell as the subsequent material vibration.

Formal understanding on what makes these\nnetworks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are\nstill significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects\nprior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this\nwork, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum\nphysics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel\ntheoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each\nlayer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.\nSpecifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep\nconvolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave\nfunction, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This\nfacilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined\nquantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate\ncorrelation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a\ndeep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available.

Dark matter in the local galactic halo,\ngravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against\nand deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared\nblackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For\nlighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with\ndark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,\nit scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for\ncapture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could\ndetermine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron\nstars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur\nin relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like\npure Higgsinos can also be discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

In particular we discuss the properties of the Floquet spectrum, and\nshow the existence of doublets of Floquet states which are respectively even\nand odd superposition of symmetry broken states and have quasi-energies\ndiffering of half the driving frequencies, a key essence of Floquet time\ncrystals.

Heavy atoms of species B are confined in the array of\nvortices generated in species A, and they are described through a Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. In contrast to the optical-lattice setups, the vortex lattice has an\nintrinsic dynamics, given by its Tkachenko modes. Including these quantum\nfluctuations in the effective model for B atoms yields an extended Bose-Hubbard\nmodel, with an additional \"phonon\"-mediated long-range attraction. The\nground-state phase diagram of this model is computed through a variational\nansatz and the quantum Monte Carlo technique. When compared with the ordinary\nBose-Hubbard case, the long-range interatomic attraction causes a shift and\nresizing of the Mott-insulator regions. Finally, we discuss the experimental\nfeasibility of the proposed scheme, which relies on the proper choice of the\natomic species and on a large control of physical parameters, like the\nscattering lengths and the vorticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 19:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

In addition to the 41\ndamped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems presented in Rao et al. (2006), the current\nDLA sample includes 29 newly discovered DLAs.

At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face\nof non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that\ninvoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the\n(currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for\nmaximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system\nconstraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation\nusing $O(nr\\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size\nof the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively).\nWe then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy\nalgorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm,\ncalled Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to\n$k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system\nconstrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$\nfunction evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and\nshow that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller\nthan $ k + 1/2 - \\varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we\ncompare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in\na concrete application (movie recommendation).

We present several pattern inference models: i) Interest pattern\nmodel (IPM) captures population level interaction topics, ii) User interest\npattern model (UIPM) captures user specific interaction topics, and iii)\nCommunity interest pattern model (CIPM) captures both community structures and\nuser interests. We test our methods on Twitter data collected from Purdue\nUniversity community. From our model results, we observe the interaction topics\nand communities related to two big events within Purdue University community,\nnamely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue\nUniversity as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016. Constructing social\ninteraction networks based on user interactions accounts for the similarity of\nusers' interactions on various topics of interest and indicates their community\nbelonging further beyond connectivity. We observed that the\ndegree-distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of\nthe existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions,\nand many other nodes with less interactions. We also discuss the application of\nsuch networks as a useful tool to effectively disseminate specific information\nto the target audience towards planning any large-scale events and demonstrate\nhow to single out specific nodes in a given community by running network\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 04:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

In this\npaper, we study the crystallographic and electronic structures and the magnetic\nproperties of CoFe2O4(111) layers with various thicknesses (thickness d = 1.4,\n2.3, 4, and 11 nm) in the epitaxial CoFe2O4(111)/Al2O3(111)/Si(111) structures\nusing soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) combined with cluster-model calculation. The magnetization of\nCoFe2O4 measured by XMCD gradually decreases with decreasing thickness d and\nfinally a magnetically dead layer is clearly detected at d = 1.4 nm. The\nmagnetically dead layer has frustration of magnetic interactions which is\nrevealed from comparison between the magnetizations at 300 and 6 K. From\nanalysis using configuration-interaction cluster-model calculation, the\ndecrease of d leads to a decrease in the inverse-to-normal spinel structure\nratio and also a decrease in the average valence of Fe at the octahedral sites.\nThese results strongly indicate that the magnetically dead layer at the\nCoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface originates from various complex networks of\nsuperexchange interactions through the change in the crystallographic and\nelectronic structures. Furthermore, from comparison of the magnetic properties\nbetween d = 1.4 and 2.3 nm, it is found that ferrimagnetic order of the\nmagnetically dead layer at d = 1.4 nm is restored by the additional growth of\nthe 0.9-nm-thick CoFe2O4 layer on it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 05:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to a\nrelaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are\nlinear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by a\nsystem of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation has\nreceived considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where\nsuch constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systems\nthat have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator\nassignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

Therefore, this paper proposes the object-part attention\nmodel (OPAM) for weakly supervised fine-grained image classification, and the\nmain novelties are: (1) Object-part attention model integrates two level\nattentions: object-level attention localizes objects of images, and part-level\nattention selects discriminative parts of object.

Both are jointly employed to exploit the subtle and local\ndifferences for distinguishing the subcategories. Importantly, neither object\nnor part annotations are used in our proposed approach, which avoids the heavy\nlabor consumption of labeling.

Our work is\ninspired by the popular editing-by-applying-filters paradigm adopted in photo\nediting applications, like Instagram and Prisma. In this context, the problem\nof increasing image memorability maps to that of retrieving \"memorabilizing\"\nfilters or style \"seeds\".

Our approach leverages from recent advances in the field of image\nsynthesis and adopts a deep architecture for generating a memorable picture\nfrom a given input image and a style seed.

However, since such global proportionality is not\ngeneric to all systems under a condition of steady growth, a new conceptual\nframework is needed. We hypothesized that such proportionality is a result of\nevolution. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed a cell model with a huge\nnumber of components that reproduces itself via a catalytic reaction network,\nand confirmed that the common proportionality in the concentrations of all\ncomponents is shaped through evolutionary processes to maximize cell growth\n(and therefore fitness) under a given environmental condition.

Most of the\nexisting malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the\naforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority\nof attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified\nframework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing\ncomprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale\nis that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in\nevery view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.\n  MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information\nfrom apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view.\nSubsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted\ncombination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides\nmulti-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to\nlocate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g.,\nmethods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets\n(incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three\nstate-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while\nmaintaining comparable efficiency.

We conduct a preliminary study on neural\nquestion generation from text with the SQuAD dataset, and the experiment\nresults show that our method can produce fluent and diverse questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 11:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 03:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 07:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Unfortunately, the interaction between\nthe ions and the pulsed laser cannot be detected. In order to study the laser\ncooling process and find the optimized parameters for future laser cooling\nexperiment, a multi-particle tracking method was developed to simulate the\ndetailed longitudinal dynamics of laser-cooled ion beams at the CSRe.

The Schottky noise spectra of longitudinally\nmodulated and laser-cooled ion beams was simulated to fully explain and\nanticipate the experimental results. The combination of Schottky spectra from\nthe highly sensitive resonant Schottky pick-up and the simulation methods\ndeveloped in this paper will be helpful to investigate the longitudinal\ndynamics of RF-bunched and ultra-cold ion beams in the upcoming laser cooling\nexperiments at the CSRe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 12:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The electrodynamics problem can then be treated within a\n\"single inertial frame\" description. To evaluate radiation fields from moving\ncharged particles we need their velocities and positions as a function of the\nlab frame time t. The relativistic motion of a particle in the lab frame is\ndescribed by Newton's second law corrected for the relativistic dependence of\nthe particle momentum on the velocity. In all standard derivations the\ntrajectories in the source part of the usual Maxwell's equations are identified\nwith the trajectories $\\vec{x}(t)$ calculated by using the \"corrected\" Newton's\nsecond law.

This polarization\nsignal is either caused by the stellar occultation or by reflected starlight\nfrom the surface of the orbiting planet. When the CGP system is located in the\nGalactic bulge, its polarization signal becomes too weak to be measured\ndirectly. One method for detecting and characterizing these weak polarization\nsignatures due to distant CGP systems is gravitational microlensing. In this\nwork, we focus on potential polarimetric observations of highly-magnified\nmicrolensing events of CGP systems. When the lens is passing directly in front\nof the source star with its planetary companion, the polarimetric signature\ncaused by the transiting planet is magnified. As a result some distinct\nfeatures in the polarimetry and light curves are produced. In the same way\nmicrolensing amplifies the reflection-induced polarization signal. While the\nplanet-induced perturbations are magnified, whenever these polarimetric or\nphotometric deviations vanish for a moment the corresponding magnification\nfactor or the polarization component(s) is equal to the related one due to the\nplanet itself. In order to evaluate the observability of such systems through\npolarimetric or photometric observations of high-magnification microlensing\nevents, we simulate these events by considering confirmed CGP systems as their\nsource stars and conclude that the efficiency for detecting the planet-induced\nsignal with the state-of-the-art polarimetric instrument (FORS2/VLT) is less\nthan 0.1 %. Consequently, these planet-induced polarimetry perturbations can\nlikely be detected under favorable conditions by high-resolution and\nshort-cadence polarimeters of the next generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 13:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

For systems of this class, some parameters of the SDE might be unknown\nand the measured data often includes noise, so state and parameter estimators\nare needed to perform inference and further analysis using the system state\npath. The distributions of SDEs which are nonlinear or subject to non-Gaussian\nmeasurement noise do not admit tractable analytic expressions, so state and\nparameter estimators for these systems are often approximations based on\nheuristics, such as the extended and unscented Kalman smoothers, or the\nprediction error method using nonlinear Kalman filters. However, the Onsager\nMachlup functional can be used to obtain fictitious densities for the\nparameters and state-paths of SDEs with analytic expressions. In this thesis,\nwe provide a unified theoretical framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimation of general random variables, possibly infinite-dimensional, and show\nhow the Onsager--Machlup functional can be used to construct the joint MAP\nstate-path and parameter estimator for SDEs. We also prove that the minimum\nenergy estimator, which is often thought to be the MAP state-path estimator,\nactually gives the state paths associated to the MAP noise paths. Furthermore,\nwe prove that the discretized MAP state-path and parameter estimators, which\nhave emerged recently as powerful alternatives to nonlinear Kalman smoothers,\nconverge hypographically as the discretization step vanishes. Their\nhypographical limit, however, is the MAP estimator for SDEs when the\ntrapezoidal discretization is used and the minimum energy estimator when the\nEuler discretization is used, associating different interpretations to each\ndiscretized estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 13:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

We propose an architecture, called\nSemantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications\nin which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System\nand crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the\ndigital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people\nabout events they want to share with others typically participating in their\nsocial networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance\nof sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize\nsemantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a\ncrowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be\nmarked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept\nfrom a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps\nstart to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the\nmeaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of\nlinked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to\nperform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that\nconstitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the\nmap. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was\napplied in a crowd map authoring tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 14:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

Thus, electric ships require integration of\nenergy storage devices in coordination with the power generators to maintain\nthe power balance between distributed resources and load devices.

This aspect requires the vehicle\nroutes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new customer requests arrive in\nthe system and must be incorporated into an evolving schedule during the\nworking day. Besides the vehicle capacity constraint involved in the classical\nVRP, DVRPTW considers in addition time windows, which are able to better\ncapture real-world situations.

To this end, this\nstudy devises for the resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based\nalgorithm, which resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to\nconstruct in parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local\nsearch procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and\nwith an insertion heuristics, which tries to reduce the number of vehicles used\nto service the available customers.

The queries are of the kind \"do two given points belong to the same\noptimal cluster?\" There are many clustering contexts where such same-cluster\nqueries are feasible. Ashtiani et al. exhibited the power of such queries by\nshowing that any instance of the $k$-means clustering problem, with additional\nmargin assumption, can be solved efficiently if one is allowed $O(k^2 \\log{k} +\nk \\log{n})$ same-cluster queries. This is interesting since the $k$-means\nproblem, even with the margin assumption, is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard.\n  In this paper, we extend the work of Ashtiani et al. to the approximation\nsetting showing that a few of such same-cluster queries enables one to get a\npolynomial-time $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-means\nproblem without any margin assumption on the input dataset. Again, this is\ninteresting since the $k$-means problem is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to approximate\nwithin a factor $(1 + c)$ for a fixed constant $0 < c < 1$. The number of\nsame-cluster queries used is $\\textrm{poly}(k/\\varepsilon)$ which is\nindependent of the size $n$ of the dataset. Our algorithm is based on the\n$D^2$-sampling technique. We also give a conditional lower bound on the number\nof same-cluster queries showing that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)\nholds, then any such efficient query algorithm needs to make $\\Omega\n\\left(\\frac{k}{poly \\log k} \\right)$ same-cluster queries. Our algorithm can be\nextended for the case when the oracle is faulty. Another result we show with\nrespect to the $k$-means++ seeding algorithm is that a small modification to\nthe $k$-means++ seeding algorithm within the SSAC framework converts it to a\nconstant factor approximation algorithm instead of the well known\n$O(\\log{k})$-approximation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 14:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 07:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 13:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal\ndiscovery (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form\nexpression exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the\npresence of a third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the\nlatter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it\nis likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be\nat least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical\nsituation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as\ndetecting the weak edge invalidates the setting. We introduce an alternative\napproach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the\nexistence of many 'weak' (irrelevant) and 'strong' interactions. We obtain a\nposterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows\nthat, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the\napproach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the\nMultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to\nshow our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 14:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Although deeper layers can capture abstract concepts like\npose, it is difficult to capture the geometric relationships among the\nkeypoints in DCNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution-deconvolution\nnetwork for facial keypoint detection. Our model predicts the 2D locations of\nthe keypoints and their individual visibility along with 3D head pose, while\nexploiting the spatial relationships among different keypoints. Different from\nexisting approaches of modeling these relationships, we propose learnable\ntransform functions which captures the relationships between keypoints at\nfeature level. However, due to extensive variations in pose, not all of these\nrelationships act at once, and hence we propose, a pose-based routing function\nwhich implicitly models the active relationships. Both transform functions and\nthe routing function are implemented through convolutions in a multi-task\nframework. Our approach presents a single-shot keypoint detection method,\nmaking it different from many existing cascade regression-based methods. We\nalso show that learning these relationships significantly improve the accuracy\nof keypoint detections for in-the-wild face images from challenging datasets\nsuch as AFW and AFLW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 15:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

If there\nis a cusp on the support of the underlying potential function, then the\ninterior transmission eigenfunction vanishes near the cusp if its interior\nangle is less than $\\pi$, whereas the interior transmission eigenfunction\nlocalizes near the cusp if its interior angle is bigger than $\\pi$.\nFurthermore, we show that the vanishing and blowup orders are inversely\nproportional to the interior angle of the cusp: the sharper the angle, the\nhigher the convergence order. Our results are first of its type in the spectral\ntheory for transmission eigenvalue problems, and the existing studies in the\nliterature concentrate more on the intrinsic properties of the transmission\neigenvalues instead of the transmission eigenfunctions.

Previous work tackles this problem by\nassuming that users are not interested or not as much interested in the\nunconsumed items. Those assumptions are often severely violated since\nnon-consumption can be due to factors like unawareness or lack of resources.\nTherefore, non-consumption by a user does not always mean disinterest or\nirrelevance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Conformative\nFiltering (CoF) to address the issue. The motivating observation is that if\nthere is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them have\nconsumed an item before, then it is likely that the item is not of interest to\nthe group. We perform multidimensional clustering on implicit feedback data\nusing hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) to identify user `tastes' groups\nand make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups and\non the past behavior of the groups. Experiments on two real-world datasets from\ndifferent domains show that CoF has superior performance compared to several\ncommon baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 15:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 18:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

It is well known that outward\nmigration is possible in viscous-heated discs relatively close to the central\nstar because the entropy gradient can be sufficiently steep that the positive\ncorotation torque overcomes the negative Lindblad torque. Yet efficiently\ntrapping planets in this region remains elusive. Here we study disc conditions\nthat yield outward migration for low-mass planets under specific planet\nmigration prescriptions. Using a steady-state disc model with a constant\nalpha-viscosity, outward migration is only possible when the negative\ntemperature gradient exceeds ~0.87. We derive an implicit relation for the\nmaximum mass at which outward migration is possible as a function of viscosity\nand disc scale height. We apply these criteria, using a simple power-law disc\nmodel, to planets that have reached their pebble isolation mass after an\nepisode of rapid accretion. It is possible to trap planets with the pebble\nisolation mass farther than the inner edge of the disc provided that alpha_crit\n>~ 0.004 for discs older than 1 Myr. In very young discs the high temperature\ncauses the planets to grow to masses exceeding the maximum for outward\nmigration. As the disc evolves, these more massive planets often reach the\ncentral star, generally only towards the end of the disc's lifetime. Saving\nsuper-Earths is therefore a delicate interplay between disc viscosity, the\nopacity profile and the temperature gradient in the viscously heated inner\ndisc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 22:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

It\nis demonstrated that as the wave steepens further the inner layer exceeds the\ncritical layer and beneath the cat's-eye there is a strong reverse flow which\nwill then affect the surface drag, but at the surface the flow adjusts itself\nto the orbital velocity of the wave. We show that in the limit as c_r=U_* is\nvery small, namely slow moving waves the energy-transfer rate to the waves,\n\\beta, computed here using an eddy-viscosity model, agrees with the asymptotic\nsteady state analysis of Belcher and Hunt (1993) and the earlier model of\nTownsend (1980). Computations for the cases when the waves are traveling faster\nand growing significantly show a critical shear layer forms outside the inner\nsurface shear layer for steeper waves. We show that the critical layer produces\na significant but not the dominant effect; a weak lee-side jet is formed by the\ninertial dynamics in the critical layer, which adds to the drag produced by the\nsheltering effect. Over peaked waves, the inner layer flow on the lee-side\ntends to slow and separate, which over a growing fast wave defects the\nstreamlines and the critical layer upwards on the lee side. Hence, it is\nproposed, using an earlier study SHD14, that the mechanisms identified here for\nwave-induced motion contributes to a larger net growth of wind driven water\nwaves when the waves are non-linear compared with growth rates for\nmonochromatic waves.

It is well-known that speech\nsignals exhibit quasi-stationary behavior in and only in a short interval, and\nthe TCL method aims to exploit this temporal structure. More specifically, it\ntrains deep neural networks (DNNs) to discriminate temporal events obtained by\nuniformly segmenting speech signals, in contrast to existing DNN based BN\nfeature extraction methods that train DNNs using labeled data to discriminate\nspeakers or pass-phrases or phones or a combination of them. In the context of\nspeaker verification, speech data of fixed pass-phrases are used for TCL-BN\ntraining, while the pass-phrases used for TCL-BN training are excluded from\nbeing used for SV, so that the learned features can be considered generic. The\nmethod is evaluated on the RedDots Challenge 2016 database.
