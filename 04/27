A while ago, we suggested that a\nmulti-phase bias/clock could be provided by a local Josephson junction-based\ngenerator. The generator looks like a long annular Josephson junction, only\ncomposed of discreet elements - junctions and inductors, and closed into a ring\nvia a flux pump to inject any required number of vortices into the ring. A\nsteady motion of the vortices forced by a uniformly distributed dc bias current\napplied to the ring is accompanied by a nearly harmonic ac currents flowing via\nthe Josephson junctions (JJs) connected in series with small inductors. These\nac currents serve as multi-phase bias/clock for nSQUID-based circuitry. To\nverify this concept and compare the dissipated energy with kBTln2 threshold, we\ndeveloped a ring composed of 256 unshunted JJs with 20 {\\mu}A target critical\ncurrent, Ic. We investigated the behavior of the ring oscillator at each vortex\ncount from 0 to 256. The measured critical current of the ring with vortices\nwas about 0.1 {\\mu}A per one JJ, which can be explained by unavoidable\nnonuniformity of the ring components and the influence of fluxes frozen near\nthe ring. The corresponding energy dissipation, about 10kBT per passage of one\nvortex through one JJ, should be reduced further for prospective experiments\nwith reversible circuits. However, obtained I-V characteristics could be of\ninterest for scientists working with long Josephson junctions. Superiority of\nthe fabrication process used in this work is demonstrated by the obtained about\n200 times reduction of Ic of the ring with vortices with respect to a single\ncomprising JJ, much larger than in any previously described case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 16:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

Here we show that PMKS yield the most predictive algorithm among\nall standard missing data strategies.

Simulations and a re-analysis of the SUPPORT study confirms that\nPMKS generally outperforms zero-imputation, mean-imputation, complete-case\nanalysis, complete-case submodels, and even multiple imputation (MI).

For function approximation problems, however, similar\neffects of randomization have been unknown so far.\n  The thesis contains results on three more or less stand-alone topics. For an\nextended five page abstract, see the section \"Introduction and Results\".\n  Chapter 2 is concerned with lower bounds for the Monte Carlo error for\ngeneral linear problems via Bernstein numbers. This technique is applied to the\n$L_{\\infty}$-approximation of certain classes of $C^{\\infty}$-functions, where\nit turns out that randomization does not affect the tractability classification\nof the problem.\n  Chapter 3 studies the $L_{\\infty}$-approximation of functions from Hilbert\nspaces with methods that may use arbitrary linear functionals as information.\nFor certain classes of periodic functions from unweighted periodic tensor\nproduct spaces, in particular Korobov spaces, we observe the curse of\ndimensionality in the deterministic setting, while with randomized methods we\nachieve polynomial tractability.\n  Chapter 4 deals with the $L_1$-approximation of monotone functions via\nfunction values.

However, today's 360-degree video\nplayers always fetch the entire panoramic view regardless of users' head\nmovement, leading to significant bandwidth waste that can be potentially\navoided. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive streaming scheme for\n360-degree videos. The basic idea is to fetch the invisible portion of a video\nat the lowest quality based on users' head movement prediction and to\nadaptively decide the video playback quality for the visible portion based on\nbandwidth prediction. Doing both in a robust manner requires overcome a series\nof challenges, such as jointly considering the spatial and temporal domains,\ntolerating prediction errors, and achieving low complexity. To overcome these\nchallenges, we first define quality of experience (QoE) metrics for adaptive\n360-degree video streaming. We then formulate an optimization problem and solve\nit at a low complexity. The algorithm strategically leverages both future\nbandwidth and the distribution of users' head positions to determine the\nquality level of each tile (i.e., a sub-area of a raw frame). We further\nprovide theoretical proof showing that our algorithm achieves optimality under\npractical assumptions. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms\nsignificantly boost the user QoE by at least 20\\% compared to baseline\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

M17 is one of the\nbest studied HII regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young\nstellar population. With X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope we have\nobtained optical to near-infrared spectra of candidate mYSOs, identified by\nHanson et al. (1997), and a few OB stars in this region. The large wavelength\ncoverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of their photospheres and\ncircumstellar disks.

We want to quantitatively establish that the 60Fe\nenhancement is the result of several supernovae which are also responsible for\nthe formation of the Local Bubble, our Galactic habitat. We performed\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with\nresolutions down to subparsec scale) of the Local Bubble and the neighbouring\nLoop I superbubble in different homogeneous, self-gravitating environments. For\nsetting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time\nsequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,\nwhich were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain\nstellar moving groups. The release of 60Fe and its subsequent turbulent mixing\nprocess inside the superbubble cavities was followed via passive scalars, where\nthe yields of the decaying radioisotope were adjusted according to recent\nstellar evolution calculations. The models are able to reproduce both the\ntiming and the intensity of the 60Fe excess observed with rather high\nprecision, provided that the external density does not exceed 0.3 cm-3 on\naverage. Thus the two best-fit models presented here were obtained with\nbackground media mimicking the classical warm ionised and warm neutral medium.\nWe also found that 60Fe (which is condensed onto dust grains) can be delivered\nto Earth via two physical mechanisms: either through individual fast-paced\nsupernova blast waves, which cross the Earth's orbit sometimes even twice as a\nresult of reflection from the Local Bubble's outer shell, or, alternatively,\nthrough the supershell of the Local Bubble itself, injecting the 60Fe content\nof all previous supernovae at once, but over a longer time range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Recent gravitational\nwave observations by advanced LIGO have provided the first glimpses into this\nregime, allowing for the extraction of new inferences on different aspects of\ntheoretical physics. For example, these detections provide constraints on the\nmass of the graviton, Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector, the\nexistence of large extra dimensions, the temporal variability of Newton's\ngravitational constant, and modified dispersion relations of gravitational\nwaves. Many of these constraints, however, are not yet competitive with\nconstraints obtained, for example, through Solar System observations or binary\npulsar observations.

After selecting a set of continuum\nobjects relevant to large, cosmological-scale surveys with the first phase of\nthe SKA dish array (SKA1-MID), we simulate data corresponding to their HI line\nemission as observed by the same telescope.

A common mechanism is a\nneutrino driven outflow, but others have been proposed. Among those, a\nlong-standing idea is that jets play an important role in SN explosions.\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that accompany rare and powerful CCSNe, sometimes\ncalled \"hypernovae\", provide a clear evidence for a jet activity. The\nrelativistic GRB jet punches a hole in the stellar envelope and produces the\nobserved gamma-rays far outside the progenitor star. While SNe and jets coexist\nin long GRBs, the relation between the mechanisms driving the hypernova and the\njet is unknown. Also unclear is the relation between the rare hypernovae and\nthe more common CCSNe. Here we {present observational evidence that indicates}\nthat choked jets are active in CCSNe types that are not associated with GRBs. A\nchoked jet deposits all its energy in a cocoon. The cocoon eventually breaks\nout from the star releasing energetic material at very high, yet\nsub-relativistic, velocities. This fast moving material has a unique signature\nthat can be detected in early time SN spectra. We find a clear evidence for\nthis signature in several CCSNe, all involving progenitors that have lost all,\nor most, of their hydrogen envelope prior to the explosion. These include CCSNe\nthat don't harbor GRBs or any other relativistic outflows.

Analysis shows that for positive\nalpha's the scalar curvature does not drop to zero at the star surface (as in\nGeneral Relativity) but exponentially decreases with distance. Also the stellar\nmass bounded by star surface decreases when the value alpha increases.\nNonetheless distant observers would observe a gravitational mass due to\nappearance of a so-called gravitational sphere around the star. The non-zero\ncurvature contribution to the gravitational mass eventually is shown to\ncompensate the stellar mass decrease for growing alpha's.

Another interesting feature is\nthe increase of the star radius in comparison to General Relativity for stars\nwith masses close to maximal, whereas for intermediate masses around 1.4-1.6\nsolar masses, the radius of star depends upon alpha very weakly. Also the\ndecrease in the mass bounded by star surface may cause the surface redshift to\ndecrease in R^2-gravity when compared to Einsteinian predictions.

This facilitates stress adaptation and the mode of action involves\nactivation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor leading to the\nmodulation of target gene expression. However, this genomic effect is slow\nacting and, therefore, a role for glucocorticoid in the rapid response to\nstress is unclear. Here we show that stress levels of cortisol, the primary\nglucocorticoid in teleosts, rapidly fluidizes rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus\nmykiss) liver plasma membranes in vitro. This involved incorporation of the\nsteroid into the lipid domains, as cortisol coupled to a membrane impermeable\npeptide moiety, did not affect membrane order. Studies confirmed that cortisol,\nbut not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane fluidity. Atomic force\nmicroscopy revealed cortisol mediated changes to membrane surface topography\nand viscoelasticity confirming changes to membrane order. Treating trout\nhepatocytes with stress levels of cortisol led to the modulation of cell\nsignaling pathways, including the phosphorylation status of putative PKA, PKC\nand AKT substrate proteins within 10 minutes. The phosphorylation by protein\nkinases in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with benzyl\nalcohol, a known membrane fluidizer. Our results suggest that biophysical\nchanges to plasma membrane properties, triggered by stressor induced\nglucocorticoid elevation, act as a nonspecific stress response and may rapidly\nmodulate acute stress-signaling pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 19:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

In each case, we find shear banding to be an important part of the\nmaterial's flow response for a broad range of values of the frequency $\\omega$\nand amplitude of the imposed oscillation. Crucially, and highly\ncounterintuitively, in the glass phase this persists even to the lowest\nfrequencies accessible numerically (that seems consistent with it persisting\neven when $\\omega\\to 0$), although the soft glassy rheology model we use has an\nunderlying monotonic constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear\nrate, and is therefore unable to support shear banding as its steady state\nresponse at constant shear rate. We attribute this to the repeated competition,\nwithin each flow cycle, of glassy aging and flow rejuvenation. Besides\nreporting significant banding in the glass phase, where the flow curve has a\nyield stress, we also observe it at noise temperatures just above the glass\npoint, where the flow curve is of power law fluid form. Thus, our results\nsuggest a predisposition to shear banding in flows of even extremely slow\ntime-variation, for both aging yield stress fluids, and for power law fluids\nwith sluggish relaxation timescales. We show that shear banding can have a\npronounced effect on the shape of the Lissajous-Bowditch curves that are\ncommonly used to fingerprint complex fluids rheologically.

Additionally the design must accommodate a Linac consisting of two\nparallel cryogenic strings, supported by two independent CP utilizing CDS\ncomponents such as distribution boxes, transfer lines, feed caps and endcaps.\nThe paper describes the overall layout of the cryogenic distribution system and\nthe major thermodynamic factors which influence the CDS design including heat\nloads, pressure drops, temperature profiles, and pressure relieving\nrequirements. In addition the paper describes how the models are created to\nperform the analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 20:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting\nthe training seen class semantic representation (e.g.~attribute prediction) or\nclassification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains\ndifferent (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers\nfrom the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel\nsolution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the\nencoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector\ninto the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder\nexerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to\nreconstruct the original visual feature. We show that with this additional\nreconstruction constraint, the learned projection function from the seen\nclasses is able to generalise better to the new unseen classes. Importantly,\nthe encoder and decoder are linear and symmetric which enable us to develop an\nextremely efficient learning algorithm. Extensive experiments on six benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed SAE outperforms significantly the\nexisting ZSL models with the additional benefit of lower computational cost.\nFurthermore, when the SAE is applied to supervised clustering problem, it also\nbeats the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 20:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely\ndifferent languages, they will separate from each other. These simple\nobservations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe\nand analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been\nexplained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for\ndifferent sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language\ndiversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions\nare crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a\nmodel of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth\nof the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society.\nWe argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important\ncharacteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we\ncancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case.\nOur results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the\nrewiring mechanism in the process of language change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 21:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

Stimulating\nthe inhibitory neurons in the upper layer reproduces experimentally observed\nresonances at gamma frequency whose origin can be traced back to two anatomical\nsub-circuits. We develop this result systematically: Initially, we highlight\nthe effect of stimulus amplitude and filter properties of the neurons on their\nresponse to oscillatory stimuli. Subsequently, we analyze the amplification of\noscillatory stimuli by the effective network structure. We demonstrate that the\namplification of stimuli, as well as their visibility in different populations,\ncan be explained by specific network patterns.

This assumption, known as Schmid law, implies that the onset of\nplasticity is independent of the normal stress acting on the slip plane. We\nexamine the validity of this assumption in single crystal perfect lattices at\nzero temperature by subjecting them to a wide range of combined normal and\nshear stresses and identifying the onset of plasticity. We employ phonon\nstability analysis on four distinct single crystal metals and identify the\nonset of plasticity with the onset of an instability. Our results show\nsignificant dependence of yielding on the normal stress, thereby illustrating\nthe necessity of considering non-Schmid effects in crystal plasticity. Finally,\ncontrary to the common assumption that instabilities in single crystals are of\nlong wavelength type, we show that short wavelength instabilities are abundant\nin the nucleation of defects for a wide range of loading conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 23:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

We use an aggregated file similarity for ranking components.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this tool, we analyzed 75 cloned components in\nFirefox and Android source code. The tool took about two hours to report the\noriginal components from 10 million files in Debian GNU/Linux packages. Recall\nof the top-five components in the extracted lists is 0.907, while recall of a\nbaseline using SHA-1 file hash is 0.773, according to the ground truth recorded\nin the source code repositories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 01:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

Analytical solutions for the formed\nenergy density in the central spacetime-rapidity region are derived for several\ntime profiles. Compared to the Bjorken formula at low energies, the maximum\nenergy density reached is much lower, increases much faster with the collision\nenergy, and is much less sensitive to the uncertainty of the formation time,\nwhile the energy density time evolution is much longer. Comparisons with\nresults from a multi-phase transport confirm the key features of these\nsolutions. The effect of the finite longitudinal width of the initial energy\nproduction, which is neglected in the analytical results, is investigated with\nthe transport model and shown to be small.

In practice, we find\nthat context vectors for different target words are quite similar to one\nanother and therefore are insufficient in discriminatively predicting target\nwords. The reason for this might be that context vectors produced by the\nvanilla attention network are just a weighted sum of source representations\nthat are invariant to decoder states. In this paper, we propose a novel\nGRU-gated attention model (GAtt) for NMT which enhances the degree of\ndiscrimination of context vectors by enabling source representations to be\nsensitive to the partial translation generated by the decoder. GAtt uses a\ngated recurrent unit (GRU) to combine two types of information: treating a\nsource annotation vector originally produced by the bidirectional encoder as\nthe history state while the corresponding previous decoder state as the input\nto the GRU. The GRU-combined information forms a new source annotation vector.\nIn this way, we can obtain translation-sensitive source representations which\nare then feed into the attention network to generate discriminative context\nvectors. We further propose a variant that regards a source annotation vector\nas the current input while the previous decoder state as the history.\nExperiments on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that both GAtt-based\nmodels achieve significant improvements over the vanilla attentionbased NMT.\nFurther analyses on attention weights and context vectors demonstrate the\neffectiveness of GAtt in improving the discrimination power of representations\nand handling the challenging issue of over-translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 04:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

We examine the 2D stellar\nand ionised gas kinematics of dusty ETGs using IFS observations from the SAMI\ngalaxy survey, and integrated star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust\nmasses from the GAMA survey. Only 8% (4/49) of visually-classified ETGs are\nkinematically consistent with being dispersion-supported systems.

In this paper we explore the emergence of\ncounter-rotation (both stellar and gaseous) in S0 galaxies from\nsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations of 1/10 mass ratio minor mergers\nbetween a 10^10.8 solar mass disk galaxy with a bulge-to-total ration of 0.17\nand a gas rich companion (gas-to-stellar mass fraction of 5.0). These\nsimulations include a self-consistent treatment of gas dynamics, star\nformation, the production/destruction of H2 and dust, and the time evolution of\nthe interstellar radiation field. We explore the effect of retrograde versus\nprograde obits, gas and bulge mass fractions of the primary galaxy, and orbital\nparameters of the companion. The key requirement for producing counter rotation\nin stars or gas in a merger remnant is a retrograde primary, while the relative\nspin of the companion affects only the radial extent of the accreted gas. We\nalso find that including a significant amount of gas in the primary can prevent\nthe emergence of counter-rotating gas, although accreted stars retain\ncounter-rotation. Bulge mass and orbit have a secondary effect, generally\ninfluencing the final distribution of accreted stars and gas within the\nframework outlined above. In addition to our primary focus of counter-rotating\ncomponents in galaxies, we also make some predictions regarding the SFRs, H2\ndistributions, and dust in minor merger remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 05:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

[Phys. Rev. {\\bf A 94}, 043614\n(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave\nscattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The\nfunctional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases\ntogether with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at\nlow density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities\n$\\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang\nfunctional, valid for $\\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional\nretained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional\ncorresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all\norders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One\nconclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density\nregime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with\nrespect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce\ndensity--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare\ninteraction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some\nof the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas\nproperties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that\nthe scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the\nso-called Bertsch parameter $\\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also\npoint out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those\nempirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional.

By further restricting the\nclass of graphs to chordal dominating pair graphs (i.e.,~the chordal graphs in\nwhich every connected induced subgraph has a dominating pair) we are able to\nfind a polynomial time algorithm that determines the minimum size of a convex\ndominating set of such a graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 09:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several\ncomponents: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles\n(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the\nfield of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the\nspacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these\ncomponents is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental\nperformances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on\nthe background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle\nenvironment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models\nused in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the\nactivities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of\nprevious missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2\nenvironment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites\npresent in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and\ntheir occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the\nMonte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of\nreliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce\nthe particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the\nscientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA.

The reconstructed RI spectrograms are\ndirectly used to synthesize enhanced speech waveforms. In addition, since\nlog-power spectrogram (LPS) can be represented as a function of RI\nspectrograms, its reconstruction is also considered as another target. Thus a\nunified objective function, which combines these two targets (reconstruction of\nRI spectrograms and LPS), is equivalent to simultaneously optimizing two\ncommonly used objective metrics: segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and\nlogspectral distortion (LSD). Therefore, the learning process is called\nmulti-metrics learning (MML).

In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a\nnon-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\\{ Ax \\geq r \\}$ minimizing a\nnon-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All\ncoefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the\nperformance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss\nconditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed\nsolutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a\n\\emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this\nwork. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity\nconditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching\ngeneralization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we\ncarefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer\nfeasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to\nthe truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with\napproximation factor at most $2\\delta + 1$, or $2\\delta$ if $r$ is\nnon-negative. Here, $\\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix\n$A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up\nto constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\\delta +\n1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy\nsystems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems\nbut may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We\nconclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based\non primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of\nthe known results.

To reduce vibrations, rotors usually\nundergo a mass balancing process, where the machine is rotated at its full\nspeed range, during which the dynamic response near critical speeds can be\nmeasured. High sensitivity, which is required for a successful balancing\nprocess, is achieved near the critical speeds, where a single deflection mode\nshape becomes dominant, and is excited by the projection of the imbalance on\nit. The requirement to rotate the machine at high speeds is an obstacle in many\ncases, where it is impossible to perform measurements at high speeds, due to\nharsh conditions such as high temperatures and inaccessibility (e.g., jet\nengines). $\\\\$ This paper proposes a novel balancing method of flexible rotors,\nwhich does not require the machine to be rotated at high speeds. With this\nmethod, the rotor is spun at low speeds, while subjecting it to a set of\nexternally controlled forces. The external forces comprise a set of tuned,\nresponse dependent, parametric excitations, and nonlinear stiffness terms. The\nparametric excitation can isolate any desired mode, while keeping the response\ndirectly linked to the imbalance. A software controlled nonlinear stiffness\nterm limits the response, hence preventing the rotor to become unstable. These\nforces warrant sufficient sensitivity required to detect the projection of the\nimbalance on any desired mode without rotating the machine at high speeds.\nAnalytical, numerical and experimental results are shown to validate and\ndemonstrate the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 12:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

While early\napproaches focused on matrix and vector based methods to represent these\nhigher-order data, more recently it has been shown that tensor decomposition\nmethods are better equipped to capture couplings across their different modes.\nFor these reasons, tensor decomposition methods have found applications in many\ndifferent signal processing problems including dimensionality reduction, signal\nseparation, linear regression, feature extraction, and classification. However,\nmost of the existing tensor decomposition methods are based on the principle of\nfinding a low-rank approximation in a linear subspace structure, where the\ndefinition of the rank may change depending on the particular decomposition.\nSince many datasets are not necessarily low-rank in a linear subspace, this\noften results in high approximation errors or low compression rates. In this\npaper, we introduce a new adaptive, multi-scale tensor decomposition method for\nhigher order data inspired by hybrid linear modeling and subspace clustering\ntechniques. In particular, we develop a multi-scale higher-order singular value\ndecomposition (MS-HoSVD) approach where a given tensor is first permuted and\nthen partitioned into several sub-tensors each of which can be represented as a\nlow-rank tensor with increased representational efficiency.

For betweenness, several dynamic\nalgorithms have been proposed over the years, targeting different update types\n(incremental- and decremental-only, fully-dynamic). In this paper we introduce\na new dynamic algorithm for updating betweenness centrality after an edge\ninsertion or an edge weight decrease. Our method is a combination of two\nindependent contributions: a faster algorithm for updating pairwise distances\nas well as number of shortest paths, and a faster algorithm for updating\ndependencies.

The results of these studies have enabled the ability to do\nthe crowd-sourcing task from within the crowd, in order to answer questions,\nsuch as: what is the current density of the crowd, or how many people are\nattending the event? However, in those studies, the sensing devices are usually\ndistributed and configured in a certain manner. For example, the number of\ndevices is fixed, people register for the devices on a volunteering basis. In\nthis paper, we treat the above problem as an optimization problem and draw the\nconnection to the vertex cover problem in graph theory. Since finding the\noptimal solution for minimum vertex cover problem is NP-complete, approximation\nalgorithms have to be used. However, we will show that the well-known\napproximation algorithms do not perform well with the crowd-sensing task. In\nthis paper, we propose the notions of node observability and coverage utility\nscore and design a new context-aware approximation algorithm to find vertex\ncover that is tailored for crowd-sensing task.

The motivation is to assign the sensing task to a more\n\"socialized\" device to obtain better sensing coverage.

Moreover, a vertical bifacial panel reduces dust accumulation and\nprovides two output peaks during the day, with the second peak aligned to the\npeak electricity demand. Recent commercialization and anticipated growth of\nbifacial panel market have encouraged a closer scrutiny of the integrated\npower-output and economic viability of bifacial solar farms, where mutual\nshading will erode some of the anticipated energy gain associated with an\nisolated, single panel. Towards that goal, in this paper we focus on\ngeography-specific optimizations of ground mounted vertical bifacial solar\nfarms for the entire world. For local irradiance, we combine the measured\nmeteorological data with the clear-sky model. In addition, we consider the\ndetailed effects of direct, diffuse, and albedo light. We assume the panel is\nconfigured into sub-strings with bypass-diodes. Based on calculated light\ncollection and panel output, we analyze the optimum farm design for maximum\nyearly output at any given location in the world. Our results predict that,\nregardless of the geographical location, a vertical bifacial farm will yield\n10-20% more energy than a traditional monofacial farm for a practical\nrow-spacing of 2m (1.2m high panels). With the prospect of additional 5-20%\nenergy gain from reduced soiling and tilt optimization, bifacial solar farm do\noffer a viable technology option for large-scale solar energy generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 04:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-30"}

A\nlinear stability analysis of the basic flow is made and the conditions at which\nsolitons first begin to grow is determined. Then, following [10], the\nnon-linear stability of the flow is examined and the quintic non-linear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is derived for the amplitude of disturbances. The\ncoefficients of the non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation are calculated from the\neigenvalue problem which determines the stability of air-water interface. An\nasymptotic and a numerical stability analysis is carried out to determine the\nneutrally stable flow conditions for air-sea interface. Four different profiles\nare considered for the airflow blowing over the surface of the sea, namely,\nplane Couette flow (pCf), plane Poiseuille flow (pPf), laminar and turbulent\nboundary layer (L,TBL) profiles. For each of the above cases the shear flow\ncounterpart in the water is assumed to be a pPf. It is shown that the above\namplitude equation produces `snake' solitons [9] for pCf, pPf and LBL profiles,\nwith striking similarities. On the other hand, for TBL we observe a very\nviolent surface motion. For cases of pCf and LBL remarkable similarity is\nobserved with observations made at sea. We conclude that the effect of\nnonlinearity in the airflow over the sea surface is much larger than nonlinear\ninteractions in the water, and hence it is not possible to decouple the motion\nin the air and the water for finite amplitude wind-wave interactions,\nparticularly in the case of wind-generated solitons in shallow waters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 23:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

In turn, they enable urban designers to assess\nresilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced\ntoolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various\nneighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial,\nscaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form.

However, it appears that complete similarity is not possible for the\nwall-bounded turbulent boundary layer. Hence, the outer/inner ratio would seem\nto be of little use. However, recent revelations revive the need for\nidentifying likely experimental datasets that display outer region similarity.\nIt is our contention that likely datasets can be identified by finding datasets\nin which the inner-outer thickness ratio is almost constant. This inner-outer\nthickness ratio is usually associated with the Rotta scaling ratio.\nUnfortunately, the Rotta ratio proportional change condition has never been\nshown to be a similarity requirement.
