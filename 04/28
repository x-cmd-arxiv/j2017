Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is\nefficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal\nmagnetic fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 16:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

The numerical study of this conjecture in the\nsimpler setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein--scalar field system was\ninitiated by Bizon and Rostworowski, followed by a vast number of numerical and\nheuristic works by several authors.\n  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the AdS instability\nconjecture in the simplest possible setting, namely for the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein--massless Vlasov system, in the case when the Vlasov field\nis moreover supported only on radial geodesics.

Which of these fates occur and in what\nproportion has important implications for the electromagnetic transient\nassociated with the mergers and the expected gravitational wave signatures,\nwhich in turn depend on the high density equation of state (EOS). Here we\ncombine relativistic calculations of NS masses using realistic EOSs with Monte\nCarlo population synthesis based on the mass distribution of NS binaries in our\nGalaxy to predict the distribution of fates expected. For many EOSs, a\nsignificant fraction of the remnants are NSs or supra-massive NSs.

Although they have\nbecome a powerful tool and sufficiently reproduce the observed spectral\nappearance, they can hardly be used for more than measuring parameters. One\nmajor obstacle is their inconsistency between the calculated radiation field\nand the wind stratification due to the usage of prescribed mass-loss rates and\nwind-velocity fields. AIMS: We present the concepts for a new generation of\nhydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE)\nstellar atmosphere models that allow for detailed studies of radiation-driven\nstellar winds. As a first demonstration, this new kind of model is applied to a\nmassive O star. METHODS: Based on earlier works, the PoWR code has been\nextended with the option to consistently solve the hydrodynamic equation\ntogether with the statistical equations and the radiative transfer in order to\nobtain a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere stratification. In these\nmodels, the whole velocity field is iteratively updated together with an\nadjustment of the mass-loss rate. RESULTS: The concepts for obtaining\nhydrodynamically consistent models using a comoving-frame radiative transfer\nare outlined. To provide a useful benchmark, we present a demonstration model,\nwhich was motivated to describe the well-studied O4 supergiant Zeta Pup. The\nobtained stellar and wind parameters are within the current range of literature\nvalues. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the PoWR code has been used to obtain\na hydrodynamically consistent model for a massive O star. This has been\nachieved by a profound revision of earlier concepts used for Wolf-Rayet stars.\nThe velocity field is shaped by various elements contributing to the radiative\nacceleration, especially in the outer wind.

Neutron energy spectrometry is based on\nevent-by-event detection and reconstruction of neutron energy from the\nmeasurement of the recoil proton track projection length and the amount of\nlight produced in the track. In addition, the detector can provide fast-neutron\nimaging with position resolution of tens of microns. The detector principle of\noperation, simulations and experimental results obtained with a small detector\nprototype are described. Track-imaging of individual recoil protons from\nincident neutrons in the range of 2-14 MeV are demonstrated as well as\npreliminary results of detector spectroscopic capabilities.\n  Keywords: Fast neutron resonance radiography; Time-of-Flight; Fast neutron\nimaging; Energy-resolved imaging; Neutron spectrometry; Capillary array; Liquid\nscintillator\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

Given the\nsmall neutrino Yukawa couplings expected in a Type-I seesaw, direct detection\nand accelerator probes of dark matter in this scenario are challenging.\nHowever, dark matter can efficiently annihilate to right-handed neutrinos,\nwhich then decay via active-sterile mixing through the weak interactions,\nleading to a variety of indirect astronomical signatures. We derive the\nexisting constraints on this scenario from Planck cosmic microwave background\nmeasurements, Fermi dwarf spheroidal galaxies and Galactic Center gamma-rays\nobservations, and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 antiprotons observations,\nand also discuss the future prospects of Fermi and the Cherenkov Telescope\nArray.

Knowing the size and/or diameter is a prerequisite of many\ndistributed network algorithms. A radio network is a collection of nodes, with\nwireless transmission and receiving capabilities. It is modeled as a simple\nundirected graph whose nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round,\na node can either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and\nlisten. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in\na round $i$, if $v$ listens in round $i$, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that\ntransmits in round $i$. If $v$ listens in a round, and multiple neighbors of\n$v$ transmit in this round, a collision occurs at $v$. If $v$ transmits in a\nround, it does not hear anything. If listening nodes can distinguish collision\nfrom silence, we say that the network has collision detection capability,\notherwise there is no collision detection. We consider the tasks of size\ndiscovery and diameter discovery: finding the size (resp. the diameter) of an\nunknown radio network with collision detection. All nodes have to output the\nsize (resp. the diameter) of the network, using a deterministic algorithm.\nNodes have labels which are binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is\nthe largest length of a label. We concentrate on the following problems:\n  1. What is the shortest labeling scheme that permits size discovery in all\nradio networks of maximum degree $\\Delta$? 2. What is the shortest labeling\nscheme that permits diameter discovery in all radio networks?\n  We show that the minimum length of a labeling scheme that permits size\ndiscovery is $\\Theta(\\log\\log \\Delta)$. By contrast, we show that diameter\ndiscovery can be done using a labeling scheme of constant length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 17:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Additionally, since attributes are\nhuman describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction.\nIn this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve facial\nattribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many facial\nattributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an\nattribute to appear in a face image is far from being uniform in the spatial\ndomain. We build our facial attribute prediction model jointly with a deep\nsemantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by\nthe semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to\nthe regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this\napproach, in addition to recognition, we are able to localize the attributes,\ndespite merely having access to image level labels (weak supervision) during\ntraining. We evaluate our proposed method on CelebA and LFWA datasets and\nachieve superior results to the prior arts.

Discarding features from certain\nsteps of the algorithm is a powerful technique for increasing efficiency and\naddressing the Big Data challenge. In this paper, we propose a family of hybrid\nsafe-strong rules (HSSR) which incorporate safe screening rules into the\nsequential strong rule (SSR) to remove unnecessary computational burden. In\nparticular, we present two instances of HSSR, namely SSR-Dome and SSR-BEDPP,\nfor the standard lasso problem. We further extend SSR-BEDPP to the elastic net\nand group lasso problems to demonstrate the generalizability of the hybrid\nscreening idea. Extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real data\nsets are conducted for both the standard lasso and the group lasso problems.\nResults show that our proposed hybrid rules can substantially outperform\nexisting state-of-the-art rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 19:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 16:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

In this paper we apply the theory of\nthe radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of\nindividual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory\nthe circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need\nto introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the\ngeneration of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain\npulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from\nwhat we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation\ntheory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns\nfor different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different\nobserver viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and\npolarization profiles for pulsars with interpulses. Further, we explain the\ncharacteristic width of the position angle curves by introducing the concept of\na wide emitting region. Another important feature of radio polarization\nprofiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some\ncases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency.

Domain-specific\nmethods for deblurring targeted object categories, e.g. text or faces,\nfrequently outperform their generic counterparts, hence they are attracting an\nincreasing amount of attention. In this work, we develop such a domain-specific\nmethod to tackle deblurring of human faces, henceforth referred to as face\ndeblurring. Studying faces is of tremendous significance in computer vision,\nhowever face deblurring has yet to demonstrate some convincing results. This\ncan be partly attributed to the combination of i) poor texture and ii) highly\nstructure shape that yield the contour/gradient priors (that are typically\nused) sub-optimal. In our work instead of making assumptions over the prior, we\nadopt a learning approach by inserting weak supervision that exploits the\nwell-documented structure of the face. Namely, we utilise a deep network to\nperform the deblurring and employ a face alignment technique to pre-process\neach face.

However, a number of challenges arises in\nlearning large-scale DAG models including model identifiability and\ncomputational complexity since the space of directed graphs is huge. In this\npaper, we address these issues in a number of steps for a broad class of DAG\nmodels where the noise or variance is signal-dependent. Firstly we introduce a\nnew class of identifiable DAG models, where each node has a distribution where\nthe variance is a quadratic function of the mean (QVF DAG models). Our QVF DAG\nmodels include many interesting classes of distributions such as Poisson,\nBinomial, Geometric, Exponential, Gamma and many other distributions in which\nthe noise variance depends on the mean. We prove that this class of QVF DAG\nmodels is identifiable, and introduce a new algorithm, the OverDispersion\nScoring (ODS) algorithm, for learning large-scale QVF DAG models. Our algorithm\nis based on firstly learning the moralized or undirected graphical model\nrepresentation of the DAG to reduce the DAG search-space, and then exploiting\nthe quadratic variance property to learn the causal ordering. We show through\ntheoretical results and simulations that our algorithm is statistically\nconsistent in the high-dimensional p>n setting provided that the degree of the\nmoralized graph is bounded and performs well compared to state-of-the-art\nDAG-learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 01:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

Over the\npast decade progress has been made on the initiation of fast reconnection via\nthe plasmoid instability and what has been called \"ideal\" tearing, which sets\nin once current sheets thin to a critical inverse aspect ratio $(a/L)_c$: as\nshown by Pucci and Velli (2014), at $(a/L)_c \\sim S^{-1/3}$ the time scale for\nthe instability to develop becomes of the order of the Alfv\\'en time and\nindependent of the Lundquist number (here defined in terms of current sheet\nlength $L$). However, given the large values of $S$ in natural plasmas, this\ntransition might occur for thicknesses of the inner resistive singular layer\nwhich are comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. When this occurs, Hall\ncurrents produce a three-dimensional quadrupole structure of magnetic field,\nand the dispersive waves introduced by the Hall effect accelerate the\ninstability. Here we present a linear study showing how the \"ideal\" tearing\nmode critical aspect ratio is modified when Hall effects are taken into\naccount, including more general scaling laws of the growth rates in terms of\nsheet inverse aspect ratio: the critical inverse aspect ratio is amended to\n$a/L \\simeq (di/L)^ {0.29} (1/S)^{0.19}$, at which point the instability growth\nrate becomes Alfv\\'enic and does not depend on either of the (small) parameters\n$d_i/L, 1/S$.

Automatic lexicons of affect provide\nfine degrees of association, but they tend not to be accurate as human-created\nlexicons. Here, for the first time, we present a manually created affect\nintensity lexicon with real-valued scores of intensity for four basic emotions:\nanger, fear, joy, and sadness. (We will subsequently add entries for more\nemotions such as disgust, anticipation, trust, and surprise.) We refer to this\ndataset as the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon, or AIL for short. AIL has entries\nfor close to 6,000 English words. We used a technique called best-worst scaling\n(BWS) to create the lexicon. BWS improves annotation consistency and obtains\nreliable fine-grained scores (split-half reliability > 0.91).

The linear thermal\nexpansion coefficients (LTEC) of two-dimensional honeycomb structured pure\ngraphene and B/N doped graphene are analyzed using ab initio density functional\nperturbation theory (DFPT) employed in VASP software under quasiharmonic\napproximation. One of the essential ingredients required is the phonon\nfrequencies for a set of points in the Brillouin zone and their volume\ndependence. These were obtained from the dynamical matrix which was calculated\nusing VASP code in interface with phonopy code. In particular, the transverse\nacoustic modes (ZA) behave drastically differently as compared to planer modes\nand so also their volume dependence. Using this approach firstly thermal\nexpansion for pure graphene is calculated. The results agree with earlier\ncalculations using similar approach. Thereafter we have studied the effect of\nboron and nitrogen doping on LTEC. The LTEC of graphene is found to be negative\nin the entire range of temperature under study (0-1000K) and its value at room\ntemperature (RT) is around -3.26X10-6K-1. The value of LTEC at RT becomes more\nnegative with B/N doping in graphene. In order to get an insight into the cause\nof negative thermal expansion, we have computed the contribution of individual\nphonon modes of vibration.

Hence, in this paper, we\npropose to train a neural ranking model using weak supervision, where labels\nare obtained automatically without human annotators or any external resources\n(e.g., click data).

However, the individual encoding scheme used in various GAs\nwould either pose a bias on the solution or require a pre-specified number of\nfeatures, and hence may lead to less accurate results. In this paper, a tribe\ncompetition-based genetic algorithm (TCbGA) is proposed for feature selection\nin pattern classification. The population of individuals is divided into\nmultiple tribes, and the initialization and evolutionary operations are\nmodified to ensure that the number of selected features in each tribe follows a\nGaussian distribution. Thus each tribe focuses on exploring a specific part of\nthe solution space. Meanwhile, tribe competition is introduced to the evolution\nprocess, which allows the winning tribes, which produce better individuals, to\nenlarge their sizes, i.e. having more individuals to search their parts of the\nsolution space. This algorithm, therefore, avoids the bias on solutions and\nrequirement of a pre-specified number of features. We have evaluated our\nalgorithm against several state-of-the-art feature selection approaches on 20\nbenchmark datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed TCbGA algorithm can\nidentify the optimal feature subset more effectively and produce more accurate\npattern classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 06:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

Platooning is a promising\ntechnology that enables trucks to save significant amounts of fuel by driving\nclose together and thus reducing air drag. A setting is considered in which\neach truck in a fleet is provided with a start location, a destination, a\ndeparture time, and an arrival deadline from a higher planning level.\nFuel-efficient plans should be computed. The plans consist of routes and speed\nprofiles that allow trucks to arrive by their arrival deadlines. Hereby, trucks\ncan meet on common parts of their routes and form platoons, resulting in\ndecreased fuel consumption.\n  We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that combines plans\ninvolving only two vehicles. We show that this problem is hard to solve for\nlarge problem instances. Hence a heuristic algorithm is proposed. The resulting\nplans are further optimized using convex optimization techniques. The method is\nevaluated with Monte Carlo simulations in a realistic setting. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm can compute plans for thousands of trucks and that\nsignificant fuel savings can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 08:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

During an image acquisition, the\nsensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor\ndomain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of\nthe encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic\nknowledge of the inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the\npresence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction\napproach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc\nstages in a signal processing chain whose composition depends on the details of\neach acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to\noptimize reconstruction performance. We present here a unified framework for\nimage reconstruction, AUtomated TransfOrm by Manifold APproximation (AUTOMAP),\nwhich recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven, supervised learning task\nthat allows a mapping between sensor and image domain to emerge from an\nappropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural\nnetwork and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for a\nvariety of MRI acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and\nhyperparameters. We further demonstrate its efficiency in sparsely representing\ntransforms along low-dimensional manifolds, resulting in superior immunity to\nnoise and reconstruction artifacts compared with conventional handcrafted\nreconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance\nof existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate accelerating the discovery\nof new acquisition strategies across modalities as the burden of reconstruction\nbecomes lifted by AUTOMAP and learned-reconstruction approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 08:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The\ncrossing point of temperature dependent magnetization curves measured at\ndifferent magnetic fields, which appears in many systems of cuprate\nsuperconductors and is regarded as indication of strong critical fluctuation,\nis however absent. The magnetization data can be scaled based on the\nGinzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a quasi-two-dimensional system, but the\nscaling result cannot be described by the theoretical function of the\nfluctuation theory because of the limited fluctuation regions. The specific\nheat jump near $T_c$ is rather sharp without the trace of strong\nsuperconducting fluctuation.

Recent advances on distributed representation shed light on\nlearning low dimensional dense vectors to alleviate the data sparsity problem.\nCurrent studies on representation learning for POI recommendation embed both\nusers and POIs in a common latent space, and users' preference is inferred\nbased on the distance/similarity between a user and a POI. Such an approach is\nnot in accordance with the semantics of users and POIs as they are inherently\ndifferent objects. In this paper, we present a novel spatiotemporal aware (STA)\nrepresentation, which models the spatial and temporal information as \\emph{a\nrelationship connecting users and POIs}. Our model generalizes the recent\nadvances in knowledge graph embedding. The basic idea is that the embedding of\na $<$time, location$>$ pair corresponds to a translation from embeddings of\nusers to POIs. Since the POI embedding should be close to the user embedding\nplus the relationship vector, the recommendation can be performed by selecting\nthe top-\\emph{k} POIs similar to the translated POI, which are all of the same\ntype of objects. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets.\nThe results demonstrate that our STA model achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data\nsparsity and effectiveness in handling cold start problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 09:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

Assuming that the legitimate monitor can successfully overhear the\nsuspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than\nthat of the suspicious receiver, the key objective is to maximize the\neavesdropping non-outage probability by joint design of the jamming power,\nreceive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor.

This problem is known as {\\em gathering}. We study deterministic\ngathering algorithms under the assumption that agents are subject to {\\em crash\nfaults} which can occur at any time. Two fault scenarios are considered. A {\\em\nmotion fault} immobilizes the agent at a node or inside an edge but leaves\nintact its memory at the time when the fault occurred. A more severe {\\em total\nfault} immobilizes the agent as well, but also erases its entire memory. Of\ncourse, we cannot require faulty agents to gather. Thus the gathering problem\nfor fault prone agents calls for all fault-free agents to gather at a single\nnode, and terminate.\n  When agents move completely asynchronously, gathering with crash faults of\nany type is impossible. Hence we consider a restricted version of asynchrony,\nwhere each agent is assigned by the adversary a fixed speed, possibly different\nfor each agent. Agents have clocks ticking at the same rate. Each agent can\nwait for a time of its choice at any node, or decide to traverse an edge but\nthen it moves at constant speed assigned to it. Moreover, agents have different\nlabels. Each agent knows its label and speed but not those of other agents.\n  We construct a gathering algorithm working for any team of at least two\nagents in the scenario of motion faults, and a gathering algorithm working in\nthe presence of total faults, provided that at least two agents are fault free\nall the time. If only one agent is fault free, the task of gathering with total\nfaults is sometimes impossible.

We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between\nco-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes\nwill further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new\nrelations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a\ngeneral framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations\nof mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of\nthe BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun in which the relations between modules are\nenriched with mutual exclusivity while genes within each module are\nfunctionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo which combines mutual exclusivity\nbetween modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun\nwhich ensures co-occurrence between modules while the within module relations\ncombine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the\nBeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find\noptimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of\nBeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes,\nand pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent\nmodules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding\npreviously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to the importance\nof the interaction between NCOR and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an\napplication of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with\nrespect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us\nto uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergetic effects, including a\npotential synergy between mutations in TP53 and metastasis related DCC gene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 12:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Recently, Darais\nand Van Horn [2016] put forward a notion of constructive Galois connection for\nunordered sets (rather than posets), which allows to define abstract domains in\na so-called mechanized and calculational proof style and therefore enables the\nuse of proof assistants like Coq and Agda for automatically extracting verified\nalgorithms of static analysis. We show here that constructive GCs are\nisomorphic, in a precise and comprehensive meaning including sound abstract\nfunctions, to so-called partitioning GCs--an already known class of GCs which\nallows to cast standard set partitions as an abstract domain. Darais and Van\nHorn [2016] also provide a notion of constructive GC for posets, which we prove\nto be isomorphic to plain GCs and therefore lose their constructive attribute.\nDrawing on these findings, we put forward and advocate the use of purely\npartitioning GCs, a novel class of constructive abstract domains for a\nmechanized approach to abstract interpretation. We show that this class of\nabstract domains allows us to represent a set partition with more flexibility\nwhile retaining a constructive approach to Galois connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 12:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

The experimental study\nof this phenomenon, termed dynamic disorder, has become possible due to\nadvances in single-molecule enzymology measurement techniques, through which\nthe catalytic activity of individual enzyme molecules can be tracked in time.\nThe biological role and importance of these fluctuations in a system with a\nsmall number of enzymes such as a living cell have only recently started being\nexplored. In this work, we examine a simple stochastic reaction system\nconsisting of an inflowing substrate and an enzyme with a randomly fluctuating\ncatalytic reaction rate that converts the substrate into an outflowing product.\nTo describe analytically the effect of rate fluctuations on the average\nsubstrate abundance at steady-state, we derive an explicit formula that\nconnects the relative speed of enzymatic fluctuations with the mean substrate\nlevel. We demonstrate that the relative speed of rate fluctuations can have a\ndramatic effect on the mean substrate, and lead to large positive deviations\nfrom predictions based on the assumption of deterministic enzyme activity. Our\nresults also establish an interesting connection between the amplification\neffect and the mixing properties of the Markov process describing the enzymatic\nactivity fluctuations, which can be used to easily predict the fluctuation\nspeed above which such deviations become negligible. As the techniques of\nsingle-molecule enzymology continuously evolve, it may soon be possible to\nstudy the stochastic phenomena due to enzymatic activity fluctuations within\nliving cells.

In\ngiant planet interiors, it could lead to the creation of density staircases,\nwhich are convective layers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. We\nstudy the propagation of internal waves in a region of layered semi-convection,\nwith the aim to predict energy transport by internal waves incident upon a\ndensity staircase. The goal is then to understand the resulting tidal\ndissipation when these waves are excited by other bodies such as moons in giant\nplanets systems. We use a local Cartesian analytical model, taking into account\nthe complete Coriolis acceleration at any latitude, thus generalizing previous\nworks. We find transmission of incident internal waves to be strongly affected\nby the presence of a density staircase, even if these waves are initially pure\ninertial waves (which are restored by the Coriolis acceleration). In\nparticular, low-frequency waves of all wavelengths are perfectly transmitted\nnear the critical latitude. Otherwise, short-wavelength waves are only\nefficiently transmitted if they are resonant with a free mode (interfacial\ngravity wave or short-wavelength inertial mode) of the staircase. In all other\ncases, waves are primarily reflected unless their wavelengths are longer than\nthe vertical extent of the entire staircase (not just a single step). We expect\nincident internal waves to be strongly affected by the presence of a density\nstaircase in a frequency-, latitude- and wavelength-dependent manner. First,\nthis could lead to new criteria to probe the interior of giant planets by\nseismology; and second, this may have important consequences for tidal\ndissipation and our understanding of the evolution of giant planet systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 15:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-20"}

In particular,\nin [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc A. 2017] the authors propose two examples of\nspace-time geometries in which field patterns occur: they are two-phase\nmicrostructures in which rectangular space-time inclusions of one material are\nembedded in another material. After a sufficient large period of time, the\nfield patterns in both microstructures have local periodicity both in time and\nspace, due to the PT-symmetry of the chosen space-time geometries. This allows\none to focus only on solving the problem on a discrete network and to define a\nsuitable transfer matrix that, given the solution at a certain time, provides\nthe solution after one time period. Many of the eigenvalues of this transfer\nmatrix have unit norm and hence the corresponding eigenvectors correspond to\npropagating modes. However, there are also modes that blow up exponentially\nwith time coupled with modes that decrease exponentially with time. The\nquestion as to whether there are space-time microstructures such that the\ntransfer matrix only has eigenvalues on the unit circle finds answer in this\npaper where we see that certain space-time checkerboards have the property that\nall the modes are propagating modes, within a certain range of the material\nparameters. Interestingly, when there is no blow-up, the waves generated by an\ninstantaneous disturbance at a point look like shocks with a wake of\noscillatory waves. This sets an arrow of time in the sense that it would be\nextremely difficult to produce the initial conditions necessary to create the\ncorresponding time-reversed waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 21:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 14:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The reconstruction idea in the discrete domain\nrelies on solving a numerical system of linear equations which derives from the\napproximation of the line integrals along lines which trace the bounded domain.\nThis work presents an extensive description of a vector field recovery, the\nfundamental assumptions and the ill conditioning of this inverse problem.

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nand scalability of our approach by means of computing maximal resilience bounds\nfor a number of ANN benchmark sets ranging from typical image recognition\nscenarios to the autonomous maneuvering of robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 12:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 11:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

However, a significant reduction in the concentration of air\npollutants has been observed during the rainy season. Recently, a number of\nstudies have been performed to understand the mechanism of removal of air\npollutants due to the rain.

However, in order for\nthis technology to unfold its full potential it is necessary to develop a\nfundamental understanding of the distinctive features of air-to-ground (A2G)\nlinks. As a contribution in this direction, this paper proposes a generic\nframework for the analysis and optimization of the A2G systems. In contrast to\nthe existing literature, this framework incorporates both height-dependent path\nloss exponent and small-scale fading, and unifies a widely used\nground-to-ground channel model with that of A2G for analysis of large-scale\nwireless networks. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal UAV height\nthat minimizes the outage probability of a given A2G link. Moreover, our\nframework allows us to derive a height-dependent closed-form expression and a\ntight lower bound for the outage probability of an \\textit{A2G cooperative\ncommunication} network. Our results suggest that the optimal location of the\nUAVs with respect to the ground nodes does not change by the inclusion of\nground relays. This enables interesting insights in the deployment of future\nA2G networks, as the system reliability could be adjusted dynamically by adding\nrelaying nodes without requiring changes in the position of the corresponding\nUAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 10:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

In a video captured by a moving camera, both the\nbackground and foreground are changing in each frame of the image sequence. So\nfor these videos, modeling a single background with traditional background\nmodeling methods is infeasible and thus the detection of actual moving object\nin a variable background is a challenging task. To detect actual moving object\nin this work, spatio-temporal blobs have been generated in each frame by\nspatio-temporal analysis of the image sequence using a three-dimensional Gabor\nfilter. Then individual blobs, which are parts of one object are merged using\nMinimum Spanning Tree to form the moving object in the variable background. The\nheight, width and four-bin gray-value histogram of the object are calculated as\nits features and an object is tracked in each frame using these features to\ngenerate the trajectories of the object through the video sequence. In this\nwork, problem of data association during tracking is solved by Linear\nAssignment Problem and occlusion is handled by the application of kalman\nfilter. The major advantage of our method over most of the existing tracking\nalgorithms is that, the proposed method does not require initialization in the\nfirst frame or training on sample data to perform. Performance of the algorithm\nhas been tested on benchmark videos and very satisfactory result has been\nachieved. The performance of the algorithm is also comparable and superior with\nrespect to some benchmark algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 09:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

Many\nof these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the\nmodel. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of\noscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More\nrecently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical\nengineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be\nlocated by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations\nutilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for\nsolving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real\nsolutions give equilibria. In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate\nonly the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by\nseveral orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by\nchoosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic\ndecoupling of the system. The correctness of the algorithm (that it finds only\nand all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally, the algorithm can\nbe implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be\napproximated up to any given precision without significantly more computational\neffort. We also compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic\ngeometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove,\nasymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as\nthe number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally,\nwe conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number\nof oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of\nexplicitly provided natural frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 04:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 18:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}
