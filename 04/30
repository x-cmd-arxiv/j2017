We\nconducted observations of Aquila, Oph., and Orion B in HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0),\nand their isotopomers to calibrate the HCN and HCO$^+$ lines used as dense gas\ntracers in extragalactic studies and to test the possible universality of the\nstar formation efficiency in dense gas, SFE$_{dense}$.

This localized resonant\nstructure has been shown to result in negative effective stiffness and/or mass\nat frequency ranges close to these local resonances. As a result, these\nstructures present unusual wave propagation properties at wavelengths well\nbelow the regime corresponding to band-gap generation based on spatial\nperiodicity, (i.e. \"Bragg scattering\"). Therefore, acoustic/elastic\nmeta-materials can lead to applications, especially suitable in the\nlow-frequency range. However, low frequency range applications of such\nmeta-materials require very heavy internal moving masses, as well as additional\nconstraints at the amplitudes of the internally oscillating locally resonating\nstructures, which may prohibit their practical implementation. In order to\nresolve this disadvantage, the K-Damping concept will be analyzed. According to\nthis concept, the acoustic/elastic meta-materials are designed to include\nnegative stiffness elements instead or in addition to the internally resonating\nadded masses. This concept removes the need for the heavy locally added heavy\nmasses, while it simultaneously exploits the negative stiffness damping\nphenomenon. Application of both Bloch's theory and the classical modal analysis\nat the one-dimensional mass-in-mass lattice is analyzed and corresponding\ndispersion relations are derived.

Four\nsymmetric NACA airfoils of thickness-to-chord ratios of 9%, 12%, 15%, and 18%\nare studied. The 3-D Navier Stokes solver, FDL3DI is used with a sixth-order\ncompact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization, second-order\nimplicit time integration, and discriminating filters to remove unresolved\nwavenumbers. A constant-rate pitch-up maneuver is studied with the pitching\naxis located at the airfoil quarter chord point. Simulations are performed in\ntwo steps. In the first step, the airfoil is kept static at a prescribed angle\nof attack ($=4^\\circ$). In the second step, a ramp function is used to smoothly\nincrease the pitch rate from zero to the selected value and then the pitch rate\nis held constant until the angle of attack goes past the lift stall point.\nComparisons against XFOIL for the static simulations show good agreement in\npredicting the transition location. FDL3DI predicts two-stage transition for\nthin airfoils (9% and 12%), which is not observed in the XFOIL results. The\ndynamic simulations show that the onset of dynamic stall is marked by the\nbursting of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) in all cases. However, for the\nthickest airfoil tested, the reverse flow region spreads over most of the\nairfoil and reaches the LSB location immediately before the LSB bursts and\ndynamic stall begins, suggesting that stall could be triggered by the separated\nturbulent boundary layer. The results suggest that the boundary between\ndifferent classifications of dynamic stall, particularly leading edge stall\nversus trailing edge stall are blurred. The dynamic stall onset mechanism\nchanges gradually from one to the other with a gradual change in some\nparameters, in this case, airfoil thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 19:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 05:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

This task is especially\ndemanding in time-dependent or driven systems because therein the dividing\nsurface (DS) between these states often exhibits a nontrivial time-dependence.\nThe so-called transition state (TS) trajectory has been seen to define a DS\nwhich is free of recrossings in a large number of one-dimensional reactions\nacross time-dependent barriers, and, thus, allows one to determine exact\nreaction rates. A fundamental challenge to applying this method is the\nconstruction of the TS trajectory itself. The minimization of Lagrangian\ndescriptors (LDs) provides a general and powerful scheme to obtain that\ntrajectory even when perturbation theory fails. Both approaches encounter\npossible breakdowns when the overall potential is bounded, admitting the\npossibility of returns to the barrier long after trajectories have reached the\nproduct or reactant wells. Such global dynamics cannot be captured by\nperturbation theory. Meanwhile, in the LD-DS approach, it leads to the\nemergence of additional local minima which make it difficult to extract the\noptimal branch associated with the desired TS trajectory.

We\nintroduce a variety of optimization techniques that leverage high performance\nand non-volatility of NVM to enable high performance data persistence for data\nobjects in applications. With NVM we avoid data copying; we optimize cache\nflushing needed to ensure consistency between caches and NVM.

In particular, since the launch of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope it has become clear that planetary nebulae display a\nwide range of striking morphologies which cannot be understood in a single star\nscenario, instead pointing towards a binary evolution in a majority of systems.\nHere, we summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in\nthe formation and shaping of planetary nebulae, as well as the surprises that\nrecent observational studies have revealed with respect to our understanding of\nbinary evolution in general.

However, the classical\ncontinuum theories of elasticity and viscoelasticity cannot easily capture the\ncontinual remodelling and associated structural changes of biological tissues.\nFurthermore, models drawn from plasticity theory are difficult to apply and\ninterpret in this context, where there is no equivalent of a yield stress or\nflow rule. In this work, we describe a novel one-dimensional mathematical model\nof tissue remodelling based on the multiplicative decomposition of the\ndeformation gradient. We express the mechanical effects of remodelling as an\nevolution equation for the 'effective strain', a measure of the difference\nbetween the current state and a hypothetical mechanically-relaxed state of the\ntissue. This morphoelastic model combines the simplicity and interpretability\nof classical viscoelastic models with the versatility of plasticity theory. A\nnovel feature of our model is that while most models describe growth as a\ncontinuous quantity, here we begin with discrete cells and develop a continuum\nrepresentation of lattice remodelling based on an appropriate limit of the\nbehaviour of discrete cells. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we use\nthis framework to capture qualitative aspects of the continual remodelling\nobserved in fibroblast-populated collagen lattices, in particular its\ncontraction and its subsequent sudden re-expansion when remodelling is\ninterrupted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 11:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

We show that measure functions provide a sound\nand complete approach to prove worst-case bounds of non-deterministic recursive\nprograms. Our second contribution is the synthesis of measure functions in\nnonpolynomial forms. We show that non-polynomial measure functions with\nlogarithm and exponentiation can be synthesized through abstraction of\nlogarithmic or exponentiation terms, Farkas' Lemma, and Handelman's Theorem\nusing linear programming.

A data representation strategy is\nderived from optimizing a fundamental physical limit to information processing:\nminimizing the lower bound on dissipation leads to a data compression method\nthat maximally retains relevant, predictive, information. In that sense,\npredictive inference emerges as the strategy that least precludes energy\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 21:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 16:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 14:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

We compute both the dyadic set structure determined by an\norder on the binary features together with the canonical product coefficient\nparameters for the associated dyadic measure and a variant of a nerve\nsimplicial complex determined by the support of the dyadic measure together\nwith its betti numbers. The product coefficient parameters characterize the\nrelative skewness of the dyadic measure at dyadic scales and localities. The\nmore abstract betti number statistics summarize the simplicial geometry of the\nsupport of the measure and satisfy a differential privacy property. Both types\nof statistics can be computed algorithmically from the binary feature\nrepresentation of the data. This representation provides a new method for\npre-processing data into automatically generated features which explicitly\ncharacterize the dyadic statistics and geometry of the data. useful for\nstatistical fusion, decision-making, inference, multi-scale hypothesis testing\nand visualization.

If\nthe energy difference between the barrier and the particle is positive, and the\nbarrier width is large enough, there is proof that the tunneling may be\nsuperluminal. For first spinor components of particle and antiparticle states,\nthe tunneling is always superluminal regardless the barrier width. Conversely,\nthe second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states may be either\nsubluminal or superluminal depending on the barrier width. These results derive\nfrom studying the tunneling time in terms of phase time. For the first spinor\ncomponents of particle and antiparticle states, it is always negative while for\nthe second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always\npositive, whatever the height and width of the barrier. In total, the tunneling\ntime always remains positive for particle states while it becomes negative for\nantiparticle ones. Furthermore, the phase time tends to zero, increasing the\npotential barrier both for particle and antiparticle states. This agrees with\nthe interpretation of quantum tunneling that the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple provides. This study results are innovative with respect to those\navailable in the literature. Moreover, they show that the superluminal\nbehaviour of particles occurs in those processes with high-energy confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 15:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 19:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}
