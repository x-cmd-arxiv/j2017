Dynamics of the fading process are approximated by a\npiecewise-constant process (frequency non-selective isotropic block fading).\nThis work addresses the finite blocklength fundamental limits of this channel\nmodel. Specifically, we give a formula for the channel dispersion -- a quantity\ngoverning the delay required to achieve capacity. Multiplicative nature of the\nfading disturbance leads to a number of interesting technical difficulties that\nrequired us to enhance traditional methods for finding channel dispersion.\nAlas, one difficulty remains: the converse (impossibility) part of our result\nholds under an extra constraint on the growth of the peak-power with\nblocklength.\n  Our results demonstrate, for example, that while capacities of $n_t\\times\nn_r$ and $n_r \\times n_t$ antenna configurations coincide (under fixed received\npower), the coding delay can be quite sensitive to this switch.

The objective is to image the\ndiscontinuities of the acoustic velocity, a coefficient of the scalar wave\nequation from the discretely sampled time domain data measured at an array of\ntransducers that can act as both sources and receivers. We treat the wave\nequation along with transducer functionals as a dynamical system. A reduced\norder model (ROM) for the propagator of such system can be computed so that it\ninterpolates exactly the measured time domain data. The resulting ROM is an\northogonal projection of the propagator on the subspace of the snapshots of\nsolutions of the acoustic wave equation. While the wavefield snapshots are\nunknown, the projection ROM can be computed entirely from the measured data,\nthus we refer to such ROM as data-driven. The image is obtained by\nbackprojecting the ROM. Since the basis functions for the projection subspace\nare not known, we replace them with the ones computed for a known smooth\nkinematic velocity model. A crucial step of ROM construction is an implicit\northogonalization of solution snapshots. It is a nonlinear procedure that\ndifferentiates our approach from the conventional linear imaging methods\n(Kirchhoff migration and reverse time migration - RTM). It resolves all\ndynamical behavior captured by the data, so the error from the imperfect\nknowledge of the velocity model is purely kinematic.

A key question in population biology is to\nunderstand the conditions under which populations coexist or go extinct.\nTheoretical and empirical studies have shown that coexistence can be\nfacilitated or negated by both biotic interactions and environmental\nfluctuations. We study the dynamics of $n$ populations that live in a\nstochastic environment and which can interact nonlinearly (through competition\nfor resources, predator-prey behavior, etc.). Our models are described by\n$n$-dimensional Kolmogorov systems with white noise (stochastic differential\nequations - SDE). We give sharp conditions under which the populations converge\nexponentially fast to their unique stationary distribution as well as\nconditions under which some populations go extinct exponentially fast.\n  The analysis is done by a careful study of the properties of the invariant\nmeasures of the process that are supported on the boundary of the domain. To\nour knowledge this is one of the first general results describing the\nasymptotic behavior of stochastic Kolmogorov systems in non-compact domains.\n  We are able to fully describe the properties of many of the SDE that appear\nin the literature.

The inverse transform sampling (ITS) method is one of the most\npopular direct sampling methods. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a\ndirect sampling algorithm that supersedes the binary-search ITS method (which\nis an improvement of the ITS method with binary search). The proposed algorithm\nis based on binarizing the support set of the target distribution. Thus, the\nproposed algorithm is referred to as binary sampling (BS). The BS algorithm\nconsists of two procedures: backward binary sampling (BBS) and forward binary\nsampling (FBS). The BBS procedure draws a single sample (the first sample) from\nthe target distribution while constructing a one-way random walk on a binary\ntree for the FBS procedure. By running the random walk, the FBS procedure\ngenerates the second and subsequent samples. The BBS and FBS procedures have\n$O(N)$ and $O(\\ln N)$ time complexities, respectively, and they also have\n$O(N)$ space complexity, where $N+1$ is the cardinality of the support set of\nthe target distribution. Therefore, the time and space complexities of the BS\nalgorithm are equivalent to those of the standard (possibly best) binary-search\nITS algorithm. However, the BS algorithm has two advantages over the standard\nbinary-search ITS algorithm. First, the BBS procedure is parallelizable and\nthus the total running time of the BS algorithm can be reduced. Second, the BS\nalgorithm is more accurate in terms of relative rounding error that influences\ngenerated samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 01:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 07:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 May 2017 03:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2017 00:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

For example, information flow is\ninitiated by binding of extracellular ligands to receptors, which is\ntransmitted through a {cascade involving} kinase-phosphatase stochastic\nchemical reactions. For a class of such networks, we develop a general\nfield-theoretic approach in order to calculate the error in signal transmission\nas a function of an appropriate control variable. Application of the theory to\na simple push-pull network, a module in the kinase-phosphatase cascade,\nrecovers the exact results for error in signal transmission previously obtained\nusing umbral calculus (Phys. Rev. X., {\\bf 4}, 041017 (2014)). We illustrate\nthe generality of the theory by studying the minimal errors in noise reduction\nin a reaction cascade with two connected push-pull modules. Such a cascade\nbehaves as an effective {three-species} network with a pseudo intermediate. In\nthis case, optimal information transfer, resulting in the smallest square of\nthe error between the input and output, occurs with a time delay, which is\ngiven by the inverse of the decay rate of the pseudo intermediate. There are\nsubstantial deviations between simulations and predictions of the linear theory\nin error in signal propagation in an enzymatic push-pull network for a certain\nrange of parameters. Inclusion of second order perturbative corrections shows\nthat differences between simulations and theoretical predictions are minimized.\nOur study establishes that {a} field theoretic formulation {of} stochastic\nbiological {signaling offers} a systematic way to understand error propagation\nin networks of arbitrary complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 01:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

Raman\nspectroscopy measurements have been performed under strains along different\nprinciple axes. Pronounced strain response along c-axis is observed due to the\nstrong intra-chain covalent bonds, while no strain response is obtained along\na-axis due to the weak inter-chain van der Waals interaction. Magneto-transport\nresults further verify its anisotropic property, resulting in dramatically\ndistinct magneto-resistance behaviors in terms of three different magnetic\nfield directions. Specifically, phase coherence length extracted from weak\nantilocalization effect, L$_{\\Phi}$ ~ T$^{-0.5}$, claims its 2D transport\ncharacteristics when an applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the thin\nfilm. In contrast, L$_{\\Phi}$ ~ T$^{-0.33}$ is obtained from universal\nconductance fluctuations once the magnetic field is along c-axis of Te,\nindicating its nature of 1D transport along the helical atomic chains.

The objective of this paper is to explore k-FFNN, namely a\nFFNN architecture that can incorporate the a priori knowledge of the temporal\nrelationships within the data sequence during training and compare k-FFNN\nperformance with RNN in a low resource scenario. We evaluate the performance of\nk-FFNN and RNN by extensive experimentation on MediaEval 2016 audio data\n(\"Emotional Impact of Movies\" task). Experimental results show that the\nperformance of k-FFNN is comparable to RNN, and in some scenarios k-FFNN\nperforms better than RNN when temporal knowledge is injected into FFNN\narchitecture. The main contributions of this paper are (a) fusing a priori\nknowledge into FFNN architecture to construct a k-FFNN and (b) analyzing the\nperformance of k-FFNN with respect to RNN for different size of training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 06:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

Unfortunately, we cannot support any of the\nconcerns they raise. We first show that almost always there is simple\nproportionality between the group counts by different observers and that taking\nthe small, occasional, non-linearities into account makes very little\ndifference. Among other examples: we verify that the RGO group count was\ndrifting the first twenty years of observations. We then show that our group\ncount matches the diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field with high\nfidelity, and that the heliospheric magnetic field derived from geomagnetic\ndata is consistent with our group number series. We evaluate the 'correction\nmatrix' approach [Usoskin et al. 2016] and show that it fails to reproduce the\nobservational data. We clarify the notion of daisy-chaining and point out that\nour group number series has no daisy-chaining for the period 1794-1996 and\ntherefore no accumulation of errors over that span. We compare with the cosmic\nray record for the last 400+ years and find good agreement. We note that the\nActive Day Fraction method (of Usoskin et al.) has the fundamental problem that\nat sunspot maximum, every day is an 'active day' so ADF is nearly always unity\nand thus does not carry information about the statistics of high solar\nactivity. This 'information shadow' occurs for even moderate group numbers and\nthus need to be extrapolated to higher activity. The ADF method also fails for\n'equivalent observers' who should register the same group counts, but do not.\nWe conclude that the criticism of Svalgaard & Schatten [2016] is invalid and\ndetrimental to progress in the important field of long-term variation of solar\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 07:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 21:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this\nrobustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it\nfrom existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the\nnetwork.\n  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable\nflows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for\nrerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an\ns-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.\nIt turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found\nusing a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum\nreroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}. However,\nthe tightening can be used to get a 2-approximation for reroutable flows. This\nratio is tight in general networks, but we show that in the case of unit\ncapacities, every reroutable flow can be transformed into a strictly reroutable\nflow of same value. While it is NP-hard to compute a maximal integral flow even\nfor unit capacities, we devise a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm\nthat finds a half-integral strictly reroutable flow of value 1, or certifies\nthat no such solutions exits.

For that reason, a\nmulti-layer graph structure-based algorithm has been proposed recently.

However, since\nthe simple prior of low level features are insufficient to describe different\nsemantic contents in the image, this type of regularizer will be incapable of\ndistinguishing between the target of interest and unconcerned background\nclutters. As a consequence, the features belonging to the target and clutters\nare simultaneously affected in the generated image without concerning their\nunderlying semantic labels. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nsemantic information guided framework for target oriented SAR image formation,\nwhich aims at enhancing the interested target scatters while suppressing the\nbackground clutters.

Such a GW signal is typically tiny, and can be detected by\ncross-correlating the data from two spatially separated detectors if the\ndetector noise is uncorrelated. It has been advocated, however, that the global\nmagnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity produce the environmental\ndisturbances at low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances, which\npotentially couple with GW detectors. In this paper, we present a simple\nanalytical model to estimate its impact on the detection of stochastic GWs. The\nmodel crucially depends on the geometry of the detector pair through the\ndirectional coupling, and we investigate the basic properties of the correlated\nmagnetic noise based on the analytic expressions. The model reproduces the\nmajor trend of the recently measured global correlation between the GW\ndetectors via magnetometer. The estimated values of the impact of correlated\nnoise also match those obtained from the measurement. Finally, we give an\nimplication to the detection of stochastic GWs including upcoming detectors,\nKAGRA and LIGO India.

First, we derive steady-state solutions of\nslowly rotating dust surrounding the wormhole by solving relativistic Euler\nequations. Solving null geodesic equations and radiation transfer equations, we\ninvestigate the images of the wormhole surrounded by dust for the above\nsteady-state solutions. Because the Ellis wormhole spacetime possesses unstable\ncircular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in the image, just as in\nSchwarzschild spacetime. The bright ring looks distorted due to rotation. Aside\nfrom the bright ring, there appear weakly luminous complex patterns by the\nemission from the other side of the throat. These structure could be detected\nby high-resolution very-long-baseline-interferometry observations in the near\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

In this paper, we investigate a two-stage\nspectrum leasing framework, where an MVNO acquires radio spectrum through both\nadvance reservation and on-demand request. To maximize its surplus, the MVNO\njointly optimizes the amount of spectrum to lease in the two stages by taking\ninto account the traffic distribution, random user locations, wireless channel\nstatistics, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and the prices differences.\nMeanwhile, the acquired spectrum resources are dynamically allocated to the\nMVNO's mobile subscribers (users) according to fast channel fadings in order to\nmaximize the utilization of the resources. The MVNO's surplus maximization\nproblem is naturally formulated as a tri-level nested optimization problem that\nconsists of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), on-demand request, and advance\nreservation subproblems. To solve the problem efficiently, we rigorously\nanalyze the structure of the optimal solution in the DRA problem, and the\noptimal value is used to find the optimal leasing decisions in the two stages.\nIn particular, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal advance\nreservation and on-demand requests when the proportional fair utility function\nis adopted.

A subset of 33 systems with $v$sin$i$$\\leq$ 80\nkm/s have been analysed using a TLUSTY grid of model atmospheres to estimate\nstellar parameters and surface abundances for the primaries. The effects of a\npotential flux contribution from an unseen secondary have also been considered.\nFor 20 targets it was possible to reliably estimate their effective\ntemperatures (T$_{eff}$) but for the other 13 objects it was only possible to\nprovide a constraint of 20,000$\\leq$T$_{eff}$$\\leq$26,000 K -- the other\nparameters estimated for these targets will be consequently less reliable.

When\nstatistical knowledge of direction angle measurement errors is unavailable, a\nnovel robust beamforming scheme of combining main-lobe-integration (MLI) and\nleakage is proposed to simultaneously transmit multiple different independent\nparallel confidential message streams to the associated multiple distinct\ndesired users. The proposed scheme includes two steps: designing the\nbeamforming vectors of the useful confidential messages and constructing\nartificial noise (AN) projection matrix. Here, in its first step, the\nbeamforming vectors for the useful confidential messages of desired user k are\ngiven by minimizing the useful signal power leakage from main-lobe of desired\nuser k to the sum of main-lobes of the remaining desired directions plus\nmain-lobes of all eavesdropper directions. In its second step, the AN\nprojection matrix is constructed by simultaneously maximizing the AN power\nleakage to all eavesdropper directions such that all eavesdroppers are\ndisrupted seriously, where AN is viewed by the transmitter as a useful signal\nfor eavedroppers. Due to independent beamforming vectors for different desired\nusers, a more secure transmission is achieved.

Here we come to the notion of weak\nequivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an\nisomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a\ngraded component. The following question arises naturally: when a group grading\non a finite dimensional algebra is weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite\ngroup? It turns out that this question can be reformulated purely group\ntheoretically in terms of the universal group of the grading. Namely, a grading\nis weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite group if and only if the\nuniversal group of the grading is residually finite with respect to a special\nsubset of the grading group.

What's\nmore, the network energy efficiency of fractal smallcell networks adopting the\nSBS cooperation strategy with the received signal power constraint is analyzed.\nThe network energy efficiency decreases with the increase of the intensity of\nSBSs which indicates a challenge on the deployment design for fractal\nsmall-cell networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 12:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 04:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light\non protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but\nDCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses\ninformation only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep\ntransfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction\nby learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from\nthousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,\nour deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact\nprediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)\nand much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11\nwinner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further\nimproved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts\nin transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range\naccuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by\nnon-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV\n(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure\nrelationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP\ncontact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better\ncontact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our\ndeep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore>0.6 when\ntrained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while\nCCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively.

Typically, the security analysis of these proposals has\nlargely been informal. However, formal analysis can be used to expose flaws and\nultimately provide a higher level of assurance in the protocols.\n  This paper focusses on the formal analysis of a particular element of\nsecurity mechanisms for V2X found in many proposals: the revocation of\nmalicious or misbehaving vehicles from the V2X system by invalidating their\ncredentials. This revocation needs to be performed in an unlinkable way for\nvehicle privacy even in the context of vehicles regularly changing their\npseudonyms. The REWIRE scheme by Forster et al. and its subschemes BASIC and\nRTOKEN aim to solve this challenge by means of cryptographic solutions and\ntrusted hardware.\n  Formal analysis using the TAMARIN prover identifies two flaws with some of\nthe functional correctness and authentication properties in these schemes. We\nthen propose Obscure Token (OTOKEN), an extension of REWIRE to enable\nrevocation in a privacy preserving manner. Our approach addresses the\nfunctional and authentication properties by introducing an additional key-pair,\nwhich offers a stronger and verifiable guarantee of successful revocation of\nvehicles without resolving the long-term identity.

The CME is a system of ordinary differential\nequations that describes the evolution of probability density for each\npopulation vector in the state-space of the stochastic reaction dynamics. For\nmany examples of interest, this state-space is infinite, making it difficult to\nobtain exact solutions of the CME. To deal with this problem, the Finite State\nProjection (FSP) algorithm was developed by Munsky and Khammash (Jour. Chem.\nPhys. 2006), to provide approximate solutions to the CME by truncating the\nstate-space. The FSP works well for finite time-periods but it cannot be used\nfor estimating the stationary solutions of CMEs, which are often of interest in\nsystems biology. The aim of this paper is to develop a version of FSP which we\nrefer to as the stationary FSP (sFSP) that allows one to obtain accurate\napproximations of the stationary solutions of a CME by solving a finite\nlinear-algebraic system that yields the stationary distribution of a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain over the truncated state-space. We derive bounds\nfor the approximation error incurred by sFSP and we establish that under\ncertain stability conditions, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by\nappropriately expanding the truncated state-space. We provide several examples\nto illustrate our sFSP method and demonstrate its efficiency in estimating the\nstationary distributions. In particular, we show that using a quantised tensor\ntrain (QTT) implementation of our sFSP method, problems admitting more than 100\nmillion states can be efficiently solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

These rings extend to radial\ndistances of a few active-particle radii from the surface of inclusions, giving\nthe hard-core inclusions relatively thick, soft, repulsive 'shoulders', whose\nmultiple overlaps then enable significant (non-pairwise) three-body forces in\nboth non-chiral and chiral active baths. The resulting three-body forces can\neven exceed the two-body forces in magnitude and display distinct repulsive and\nattractive regimes at intermediate to large self-propulsion strengths. In a\nchiral active bath, we show that, while active particles still tend to\naccumulate at the immediate vicinity of the inclusions, they exhibit strong\ndepletion from the intervening region between the inclusions, and partial\ndepletion from relatively thick, circular, zones further away from the\ninclusions.

We compared simultaneous UV and X-ray measurements of AGN\nobtained by the XMM-Newton satellite. The non-thermal flux was constrained from\nthe 2-12 keV X-ray luminosity, while the thermal disc component was estimated\nfrom the UV flux at 2900A. The hardness (ratio between the X-ray and UV plus\nX-ray luminosity) and the total luminosity were used to construct the AGN state\ndiagrams. For sources with reliable mass measurements, the Eddington ratio was\nused instead of the total luminosity. The state diagrams show that the\nradio-loud sources have on average higher hardness, due to the lack of the\nthermal disc emission in the UV band, and have flatter intrinsic X-ray spectra.\nIn contrast, the sources with high luminosity and low hardness are radio-quiet\nAGN. The hardness-Eddington ratio diagram reveals that the average\nradio-loudness is stronger for low-accreting sources, while it decreases when\nthe accretion rate is close to the Eddington limit. Our results indicate that\nthe general properties of AGN accretion states are similar to those of X-ray\nbinaries. This suggests that the AGN radio dichotomy of radio-loud and\nradio-quiet sources can be explained by the evolution of the accretion states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

More precisely, it was shown that if\nthe difference between the larger and the smaller partial indices is larger\nthan unity then, in any neighborhood of the original matrix function, there\nexists another matrix function possessing a different set of partial indices.\nAs a result, the factorization of matrix functions, being an extremely\ndifficult process itself even in the case of the canonical factorization,\nremains unresolvable or even questionable in the case of a non-stable set of\npartial indices. Such a situation, in turn, has became an unavoidable obstacle\nto the application of the factorization technique. This paper sets out to\nanswer a less ambitious question than that of effective factorizing matrix\nfunctions with non-stable sets of partial indices, and instead focuses on\ndetermining the conditions which, when imposed on the original matrix function,\nallow to construct another matrix function that exhibits the same partial\nindices and is close to the original matrix function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 15:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The focus of this thesis is a class of\ngames called extended nonlocal games, of which nonlocal games are a subset. In\nan extended nonlocal game, the players initially share a tripartite state with\nthe referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend\non outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared\nquantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to the questions sent by\nthe referee. We build up the framework for extended nonlocal games and study\ntheir properties and how they relate to nonlocal games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 15:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Given that\nservice-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services,\nwith each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of\nanomalies is non-trivial.\n  Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection,\nexisting techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data,\nowing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data.\n  To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically\ndetecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques\nemploy statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system\nmetrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal\ncomponents of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical\nmetrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect\nanomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different\nperspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning.\nIn particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision,\nRecall, and F-measure in each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 06:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

How Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to\ncurrent AI is explained. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian\nscientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify\ntheories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper\ndescribes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the\nmethod to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior.\nIt is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial\nexplosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against\nthe assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's\nphilosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal\nsentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural\nnetworks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is\ndiscussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess\nprograms. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program\nusing Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath.
