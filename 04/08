Variational (deep) auto-encoders (VAE) have shown\ngreat results in unsupervised extraction of hierarchical latent representations\nfrom large amounts of image data, while being robust to noise and other\nundesired artifacts. Potentially, this makes VAEs a suitable approach for\nlearning facial features for AU intensity estimation. Yet, most existing\nVAE-based methods apply classifiers learned separately from the encoded\nfeatures. By contrast, the non-parametric (probabilistic) approaches, such as\nGaussian Processes (GPs), typically outperform their parametric counterparts,\nbut cannot deal easily with large amounts of data. To this end, we propose a\nnovel VAE semi-parametric modeling framework, named DeepCoder, which combines\nthe modeling power of parametric (convolutional) and nonparametric (ordinal\nGPs) VAEs, for joint learning of (1) latent representations at multiple levels\nin a task hierarchy1, and (2) classification of multiple ordinal outputs. We\nshow on benchmark datasets for AU intensity estimation that the proposed\nDeepCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, and related VAEs and\ndeep learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 16:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 04:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Caching popular content at the network edge\nhas emerged to be a solution for low-latency content delivery. Compared with\nthe traditional wireless communication, content delivery has a key\ncharacteristic that many signals coexisting in the air carry identical popular\ncontent. They, however, can interfere with each other at a receiver if their\nmodulation-and-coding (MAC) schemes are adapted to individual channels\nfollowing the classic approach. To address this issue, we present a novel idea\nof content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) where adapting MAC schemes to content ensures\nthat all signals carry identical content are encoded using an identical MAC\nscheme, achieving spatial MAC alignment. Consequently, interference can be\nharnessed as signals, to improve the reliability of wireless delivery. In the\nremaining part of the paper, we focus on quantifying the gain CAMAC can bring\nto a content-delivery network using a stochastic-geometry model. Specifically,\ncontent helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process, each of which\ntransmits a file from a content database based on a given popularity\ndistribution. It is discovered that the successful content-delivery probability\nis closely related to the distribution of the ratio of two independent shot\nnoise processes, named a shot-noise ratio. The distribution itself is an open\nmathematical problem that we tackle in this work. Using stable-distribution\ntheory and tools from stochastic geometry, the distribution function is derived\nin closed form. Extending the result in the context of content-delivery\nnetworks with CAMAC yields the content-delivery probability in different closed\nforms. In addition, the gain in the probability due to CAMAC is shown to grow\nwith the level of skewness in the content popularity distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 16:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 10:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 13:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

On these curves time loops back onto\nitself, which has exotic consequences. However, in order to make time travel\nstories consistent constraints have to be satisfied, which prevents seemingly\nordinary and plausible processes from occurring. This, and several other\n\"unphysical\" features, have motivated many authors to exclude solutions with\nCTCs from consideration, e.g. by conjecturing a chronology protection law. In\nthis contribution we shall investigate the nature of one particular class of\nexotic consequences of CTCs, namely those involving unexpected cases of\nindeterminism or determinism. Indeterminism arises even against the backdrop of\nthe usual deterministic physical theories when CTCs do not cross spacelike\nhypersurfaces outside of a limited CTC-region (such hypersurfaces fail to be\nCauchy surfaces). By contrast, a certain kind of determinism appears to arise\nwhen an indeterministic theory is applied on a CTC: things cannot be different\nfrom what they already were. We shall argue that on further consideration both\nthis indeterminism and determinism on CTCs turn out to possess analogues in\nother, familiar areas of physics. CTC-indeterminism is close to the\nepistemological indeterminism we know from statistical physics, while the\n\"fixedness\" typical of CTC-determinism is pervasive in physics. CTC-determinism\nand CTC-indeterminism therefore do not provide incontrovertible grounds for\nrejecting CTCs as conceptually inadmissible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 17:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Our study was considered reasonably complete for periods from 2 to 30\ndays.\n  The general rotational scenario seen in other young regions is confirmed by\nCygnus OB2 period distributions, with disked stars rotating on average slower\nthan non-disked stars. A mass-rotation dependence was also verified, but as in\nNGC 6530, lower mass stars are rotating on average slower than higher mass\nstars, with an excess of slow rotators among the lower mass population. The\neffect of the environment on the rotational properties of the association was\ninvestigated by re-analysing the results while taking into account the incident\nUV radiation arising from O stars in the association.

Therefore, the MF of\nlarge scale structure is potentially a powerful probe of gravity, and its\napplication to real data deserves active explorations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 13:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

It is assumed that liver is a mixture of two phases:\nhealthy liver and lesions, represented by different image intensities polluted\nby noise. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is used to remove the noise and separate\nthe mixture into two distinct phases with well-defined interfaces. This\nsimplifies the lesion detection and segmentation task drastically and enables\nto segment liver lesions by thresholding the Cahn-Hilliard solution.

We\nshow that any hereditary property of such graphs is strongly testable, i.e.,\ntestable with a constant number of queries. We also explain how the proof can\nbe adapted to show that any hereditary property of $2$-dimensional matrices\nover a finite alphabet (where row and column order is not ignored) is strongly\ntestable. The first result generalizes the result of Alon and Shapira [FOCS'05,\nSICOMP'08], who showed that any hereditary graph property (without vertex\norder) is strongly testable. The second result answers and generalizes a\nconjecture of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] concerning testing of matrix\nproperties.\n  The testability is proved by establishing a removal lemma for vertex-ordered\ngraphs. It states that for any finite or infinite family $\\mathcal{F}$ of\nforbidden vertex-ordered graphs, and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist $\\delta >\n0$ and $k$ so that any vertex-ordered graph which is $\\epsilon$-far from being\n$\\mathcal{F}$-free contains at least $\\delta n^{|F|}$ copies of some\n$F\\in\\mathcal{F}$ (with the correct vertex order) where $|F|\\leq k$. The proof\nbridges the gap between techniques related to the regularity lemma, used in the\nlong chain of papers investigating graph testing, and string testing\ntechniques. Along the way we develop a Ramsey-type lemma for $k$-partite graphs\nwith \"undesirable\" edges, stating that one can find a Ramsey-type structure in\nsuch a graph, in which the density of the undesirable edges is not much higher\nthan the density of those edges in the graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 20:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

The\nheuristic that the number of points is very nearly the area of the circle is\nsurprisingly accurate. In this work, we describe two variants of the Gauss\nCircle problem that exhibit similar characteristics.\n  The first variant concerns sums of Fourier coefficients of $\\text{GL}(2)$\ncusp forms. These sums behave very similarly to the error term in the Gauss\nCircle problem. We introduce new Dirichlet series with coefficients that are\nsquares of partial sums of Fourier coefficients of cusp forms. We study the\nmeromorphic properties of these Dirichlet series and use these series to give\nnew perspectives on the mean square of the size of sums of these Fourier\ncoefficients.\n  The second variant concerns the number of lattice points of bounded size on\none-sheeted hyperboloids. This problem is very similar to counting the number\nof lattice points within a spheres of various dimensions, except with the\nadditional constraint of lying on a hyperboloid. It turns out that this problem\nis equivalent to estimating sums of the shape $\\sum r_d(n^2 + h)$, where\n$r_d(m)$ is the number of representations of $m$ as a sum of $d$ squares.

Most\napproaches adapt object detectors to produce segments instead of boxes. In\ncontrast, our method is based on an initial semantic segmentation module, which\nfeeds into an instance subnetwork. This subnetwork uses the initial\ncategory-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object\ndetector, within an end-to-end CRF to predict instances. This part of our model\nis dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per\nimage. Our end-to-end approach requires no post-processing and considers the\nimage holistically, instead of processing independent proposals. Therefore,\nunlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to multiple instances.\nFurthermore, far more precise segmentations are achieved, as shown by our\nstate-of-the-art results (particularly at high IoU thresholds) on the Pascal\nVOC and Cityscapes datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 22:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

In the case of communication networks, such attacks can leave\nusers vulnerable to censorship and surveillance, even when cryptography is\nused. Much of the existing work on network fault-tolerance focuses on random\nfaults and does not apply to adversarial faults (attacks). Centralized networks\nhave single points of failure by definition, leading to a growing popularity in\ndecentralized architectures and protocols for greater fault-tolerance. However,\ncentralized network structure can arise even when protocols are decentralized.\nDespite their decentralized protocols, the Internet and World-Wide Web have\nbeen shown both theoretically and historically to be highly susceptible to\nattack, in part due to emergent structural centralization. When single points\nof failure exist, they are potentially vulnerable to non-technological (i.e.,\ncoercive) attacks, suggesting the importance of a structural approach to\nattack-tolerance. We show how the assumption of partial trust transitivity,\nwhile more realistic than the assumption underlying webs of trust, can be used\nto quantify the effective redundancy of a network as a function of trust\ntransitivity. We also prove that the effective redundancy of the wrap-around\nbutterfly topology increases exponentially with trust transitivity and describe\na novel concurrent multipath routing algorithm for constructing paths to\nutilize that redundancy. When portions of network structure can be dictated our\nresults can be used to create scalable, attack-tolerant infrastructures. More\ngenerally, our results provide a theoretical formalism for evaluating the\neffects of network structure on adversarial fault-tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 02:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

The\nwell-known background flow method of Doering and Constantin is equivalent to\nthe auxiliary functional method with a quadratic auxiliary functional. The\nknown implementations of the direct method apparently also correspond to\nquadratic auxiliary functionals. The findings are illustrated by the analysis\nof the plane Couette flow. Three routes of further progress using non-quadratic\nauxiliary functionals and at the same time allowing to utilise the experience\naccumulated with the background flow method are proposed: making the balance\nparameter dependent on the energy, making the background flow time-dependent in\na specific way, and adding helicity to the auxiliary functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 10:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 22:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 19:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

In\nthis work we investigate whether the dependence of the turbulent accretion disc\nstress ($\\alpha$) on the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) is sufficiently sensitive\nto induce thermal-viscous instability using 3D MHD simulations. We first\ninvestigate whether the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence, found by many previous authors,\nhas a physical or numerical origin by conducting a suite of local shearing-box\nsimulations. We find that a definite $\\alpha$-Pm dependence persists when\nsimultaneously increasing numerical resolution and decreasing the absolute\nvalues of both the viscous and resistive dissipation coefficients. This points\nto a physical origin of the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence. Using a further set of\nsimulations which include realistic turbulent heating and radiative cooling,\nand by giving Pm a realistic physical dependence on the plasma temperature and\ndensity, we demonstrate that the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence is sufficiently strong\nto lead to a local instability. We confirm that the instability manifests\nitself as an unstable limit cycle by mapping the local thermal-equilibrium\ncurve of the disc. This is the first self-consistent MHD simulation\ndemonstrating the Pm instability from first principles. This result is\nimportant because a physical Pm instability would lead to the global\npropagation of heating and cooling fronts and a transition between disc states\non timescales compatible with the observed hard/soft state transitions in black\nhole binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 12:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

Limiting ourselves to one-planet systems as a first step of\nthe development, we simulate Gaia data for exoplanet systems over a grid of\nS/N, orbital period, and eccentricity. The simulations are then fit using\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods. We investigate the detection rate according\nto three information criteria and the delta chi^2. For the delta chi^2, the\neffective number of degrees of freedom depends on the mission length. We find\nthat the choice of the Markov chain starting point can affect the quality of\nthe results; we therefore consider two limit possibilities: an ideal case, and\na very simple method that finds the starting point assuming circular orbits.\nUsing Jeffreys' scale of evidence, the fraction of false positives passing a\nstrong evidence criterion is < ~0.2% (0.6%) when considering a 5 yr (10 yr)\nmission and using the Akaike information criterion or the Watanabe-Akaike\ninformation criterion, and <0.02% (<0.06%) when using the Bayesian information\ncriterion. We find that there is a 50% chance of detecting a planet with a\nminimum S/N=2.3 (1.7).

Here, ${\\sf T}$ denotes the\ntrace of energy-momentum tensor ({\\sf EMT}) of matter fluids. The usual method\n(as discussed in the literature) is to choose an $h({\\sf T})$ function and then\nsolve for the resulted Friedman equations. Nevertheless, our aim here is,\nwithout loss of generality, to reformulate a particular class of $f({\\sf\nR},{\\sf T})$ gravity models in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is promoted by\nan arbitrary function of the trace of {\\sf EMT}. The strategy is the\nredefinition of the equation of motion in terms of the components of an\neffective fluid. We show that in this case the {\\sf EMT} is automatically\nconserved. As we shall see, adopting such a point of view (at least) in $f({\\sf\nR},{\\sf T})$ gravity is accompanied by two significant points. On one hand,\n$h({\\sf T})$ function is chosen based upon a physical concept and on the other,\nwe clearly understand the overall or effective behavior of matter in terms of a\nconserved effective fluid. To illustrate the idea, we study some models in\nwhich different physical properties for the effective fluid is attributed to\neach model. Particularly, we discuss models with constant effective density,\nconstant effective pressure and constant effective equation of state ({\\sf\nEoS}) parameter. Moreover, two models with a relation between the effective\ndensity and the effective pressure will be considered. An elegant result is\nthat in $f({\\sf R},{\\sf T})$ gravity, there is a possibility that a perfect\nfluid could effectively behave as a modified Chaplygin gas with four free\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2017 14:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 19:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

Despite the fact that various NARX models have been\ndeveloped, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies\nappropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In\nthis paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network\n(DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an input\nattention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a.,\ninput features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hidden\nstate.

That is, in a graphical model as employed by Ahn et\nal., a chain represents a path that joints the two ingredients, the shortest\npath represents the strongest pairwise chain of affinities between the two\ningredients.\n  Food-pairing and Food-bridging are different hypotheses that may describe\npossible mechanisms behind the recipes of traditional cuisines. Food-pairing\nintensifies flavour by mixing ingredients in a recipe with similar chemical\ncompounds, and food-bridging smoothes contrast between ingredients. Both\nfood-pairing and food-bridging are observed in traditional cuisines, as shown\nin this work.\n  We observed four classes of cuisines according to food-pairing and\nfood-bridging: (1) East Asian cuisines, at one extreme, tend to avoid\nfood-pairing as well as food-bridging; and (4) Latin American cuisines, at the\nother extreme, follow both principles.

The search for possible\norigins of such \"anomalous\" scaling and approaches to quantify them are the\nmotivations for the work reported here. In processes with stationary\nincrements, where the stochastic process is time-independent, auto-correlations\nbetween increments and infinite variance of increments can cause anomalous\nscaling. These sources have been referred to as the $\\it{Joseph}$ $\\it{effect}$\nthe $\\it{Noah}$ $\\it{effect}$, respectively.
