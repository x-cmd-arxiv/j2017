We provide several applications of our\nconstruction. In particular, we prove that the uniform measure on the boundary\ncan be obtained as the limit of the suitably normalized volume measure on a\nsmall tubular neighborhood of the boundary. We also prove that connected\ncomponents of the complement of the Brownian net are Brownian disks, as it was\nsuggested in the recent work of Miller and Sheffield.

For most simulation runs, the rate\nof gas inflow to the nuclear region is equilibrated to ~0.02 M_sun/yr. The\nnuclear ring is off-centered, relative to the Galactic center, by the lopsided\ncentral mass distribution of the Galaxy model, and thus an asymmetric mass\ndistribution of the nuclear ring arises accordingly. The vertical asymmetry of\nthe the Galaxy model also causes the nuclear ring to be tilted along the\nGalactic plane. During the first ~100 Myr, the vertical frequency of the gas\nmotion is twice that of the orbital frequency, thus the projected nuclear ring\nshows a twisted, infinity-like shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Recent experiments\nhave shown that certain malignant cancer cells form clusters in a\nchemoattractant gradient, which display three different phases of motion:\ntranslational, rotational, and random. Intriguingly, all three phases are\nobserved simultaneously, with clusters spontaneously switching between these\nmodes of motion. The origin of this behavior is not understood at present,\nespecially the robust appearance of cluster rotations. Guided by experiments on\nthe motion of two-dimensional clusters in-vitro, we developed an agent based\nmodel in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and\nalignment interactions but with potentially different behaviors based on their\nlocal environment. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile,\nall three phases of motion coexist, in excellent agreement with the\nobservations. Using the model we can identify that the transitions between\ndifferent phases are driven by a competition between an ordered rim and a\ndisordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological\ndefects in the velocity field. The model makes definite predictions regarding\nthe dependence of the motility phase of the cluster on its size and external\nchemical gradient, which agree with our experimental data. Our results suggest\nthat heterogeneous behavior of individuals, based on local environment, can\nlead to novel, experimentally observed phases of collective motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 18:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

In order to boost\nthe performance of the studied repeaters we introduce two methods.

Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation. We test a number of simple, evolutionary models to\naccount for the observed populations of Class 0 and I sources, both single and\nbinary. In the model that best explains the observations, all stars form\ninitially as wide binaries. These binaries either break up into separate stars\nor else shrink into tighter orbits. Under the assumption that both stars remain\nembedded following binary breakup, we find a total star formation rate of 168\nMyr^-1. Alternatively, one star may be ejected from the dense core due to\nbinary breakup. This latter assumption results in a star formation rate of 247\nMyr^-1. Both production rates are in satisfactory agreement with current\nestimates from other studies of Perseus. Future observations should be able to\ndistinguish between these two possibilities.

In particular, we investigate the\ncurvature of the phase boundary at small chemical potential, the critical value\nof the chemical potential above which no spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs,\nand the possible interpretation of the underlying dynamics in terms of\ndifermion-type degrees of freedom. We find that the inclusion of four-fermion\nchannels other than the conventional scalar-pseudoscalar channel is not only\nimportant at large chemical potential but also leaves a significant imprint on\nthe dynamics at small chemical potential as measured by the curvature of the\nfinite-temperature phase boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 21:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 18:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 09:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

After 165 years, during June of 2015, it\nerupted again showing characteristics of the Z And-type outburst. The primary\nobjective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the\n2015 outburst of AG Peg. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy\ndistribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330-750 nm), medium-resolution\nspectroscopy (420-720 nm; R=11000), and $UBVR_{\\rm C}I_{\\rm C}$ photometry\ncovering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were\ncomplemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding\nquiescence. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the\nrange of 2-11$\\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s. To generate the maximum\nluminosity the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to\nblowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a\nfew $\\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. At the high temperature of the\nionising source, $1.5-2.3\\times 10^5$ K, the wind converted a fraction of the\nWD's photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the\noptical. A one order of magnitude increase of the emission measure, from a few\n$\\times 10^{59}(d/0.8 {\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during quiescence, to a few\n$\\times 10^{60}(d/0.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during the outburst, caused a 2\nmag brightening in the LC, which is classified as the Z And-type of the\noutburst. The very high nebular emission and the presence of a disk-like HI\nregion encompassing the WD, as indicated by a significant broadening and high\nflux of the Raman-scattered OVI 6825 \\AA\\ line during the outburst, is\nconsistent with the ionisation structure of hot components in symbiotic stars\nduring active phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 21:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Finding such\nvariables can naturally lead to successful reduced dynamic models for the\nnetworks.

In the case of short sidechains and\nlarge pores the ions mostly occupy the pore wall area, where their distribution\nis strongly disturbed by their host sulfonates. In the case of short sidechains\nand narrow pores, the mobility of ions is strongly affected by the structuring\nand polarization effects of the water molecules. In the case of long\nsidechains, and when the sidechain sulfonates reach the pore center, a radial\ncharge separation occurs in the pore. Such charge separation suppresses the ion\ndiffusion along the pore axis.\n  An enhanced ion diffusion was found in the pores grafted with medium-size\nsidechains provided that the ions do not enter the central pore area, and the\nwater is less structured around the ions and sulfonates. In this case, the 3D\ndensity of the ions has a hollow-cylinder type shape with a smooth and\nuninterrupted surface. We found that the maximal ion diffusion has a linear\ndependence on the number of sidechain monomers. It is suggested that the\nmaximal ion diffusion along the pore axis is attained if the effective length\nof the sidechain extension into the pore center (measured as twice the gyration\nradius of the sidechain with the Flory exponent 1/4) is about 1/3 of the pore\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 05:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

The spin ices Ho2Ti2O7 and\nDy2Ti2O7 exemplify this phenomenon, displaying a classical spin liquid state,\nwith fractionalized magnetic--monopole excitations. Recently there has been\ngreat interest in closely-related \"quantum spin ice\" materials, following the\nrealization that anisotropic exchange interactions could convert spin ice into\na massively-entangled, quantum, spin liquid, where magnetic monopoles become\nthe charges of an emergent quantum electrodynamics. Here we show that even the\nsimplest model of a quantum spin ice, the XXZ model on the pyrochlore lattice,\ncan realise a still-richer scenario. Using a combination of classical Monte\nCarlo simulation, semi--classical molecular--dynamics simulation, and analytic\nfield theory, we explore the properties of this model for frustrated transverse\nexchange.

Therefore, they are not only difficult to compute for large-scale\nsystems but also hard to utilize in the model reduction framework. In this\npaper, we propose algebraic Gramians for QB systems based on the underlying\nVolterra series representation of QB systems and their Hilbert adjoint systems.\nWe then show their relations with a certain type of generalized quadratic\nLyapunov equation.

A spinless-fermion model in a one-dimensional chain\ncoupled with local phonons is analyzed numerically. The infinite time-evolving\nblock decimation algorithm is adopted as a reliable numerical method for\none-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Numerical results for the\nphotoinduced CO melting dynamics without phonons are well interpreted by the\nsoliton picture for the CO domains. This interpretation is confirmed by the\nnumerical simulation for an artificial local excitation and the classical\nsoliton model. In the case of the large phonon frequency corresponding to the\nantiadiabatic condition, the CO melting is induced by propagations of the\npolaronic solitons with the renormalized soliton velocity. On the other hand,\nin the case of the small phonon frequency corresponding to the adiabatic\ncondition, the first stage of the CO melting dynamics occurs due to the energy\ntransfer from the fermionic to phononic systems, and the second stage is\nbrought about by the soliton motions around the bottom of the soliton band.\nPresent analyses provide a standard reference for the photoinduced CO melting\ndynamics in low-dimensional many-body quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 13:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We explain how these findings form a solid foundation for\ndeveloping curiosity-increasing learning technologies or even assisting a human\ncoach to induce curiosity among learners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 15:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 21:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

A comparison of these with\nhigh resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that\nprevious discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully\nresolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of\nthe discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising\nfrom lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory.\nFor a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature $T_{\\rm e} = 9000$ K and\nelectron density $\\rm N_{e}=10^4 \\, cm^{-3}$, cascading of electrons from the\nlevels $\\rm ^3G_5$, $\\rm ^3G_4$ and $\\rm ^3G_3$ plays an important role in\ndetermining the populations of lower levels, such as $\\rm ^3F_4$, which provide\nthe density diagnostic emission lines of Fe III, such as $\\rm ^5D_4$ - $\\rm\n^3F_4$ at 4658 \\AA. Hence further work on the A-values for these transitions is\nrecommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe III\nratios do provide reliable $N_{\\rm e}$-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe\nIII cooling function calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data\nis found to be significantly greater at $T_e$ $\\simeq$ 30000 K than predicted\nwith the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional\nemission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000--4000 \\AA\\\nwavelength region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 15:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The traditional methods of cognition, based on\nthe identification of the objects of the surrounding world, take into account\nnot all influences, because are limited by the nature, understood as the\nontology of the subject of cognition. The ontology is determined on the level\nof basic notions and definitions, so even if objects from the representation\nsystems different by ontology are identified, they look undetermined, uncertain\nand paradoxical, exactly as, for example, the quantum mechanical objects or\ncosmological dark matter and energy. The representation systems with different\nontology are incompatible with each other on the level of basic notions and\ncannot be unified on frames of one consistent system or theory. The concept of\nincompatible representations unifies on the level exceeded the ontological\nframes the different by ontology representation systems and incompatible\napproaches, such as relativistic and quantum ones. The concept gives a\npossibility to eliminate the principal contradictions of the system approach in\nscientific cognition, so solves the problem of understanding in science. The\ngeneralized methods of cognition are by definition on the foundations of\ndifferent representation systems: scientific, philosophical, religious and\nsocial ones, what gives a possibility of general analysis and revision of their\nfoundations.
