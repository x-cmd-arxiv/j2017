The\nchiral-chain van der Waals structure of tellurene gives rise to strong in-plane\nanisotropic properties and large thickness dependent shifts in Raman\nvibrational modes, which is not observed in other 2D layered materials.

Such is the case in\nseasonal storage valuation of a set of cascaded reservoir chains in hydro\nmanagement. A popular method is Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP),\nespecially when the dimensionality of the problem is large and Dynamic\nprogramming no longer an option. The usual assumption of SDDP is that\nuncertainty is stage-wise independent, which is highly restrictive from a\npractical viewpoint. When possible, the usual remedy is to increase the\nstate-space to account for some degree of dependency. In applications this may\nnot be possible or it may increase the state space by too much. In this paper\nwe present an alternative based on keeping a functional dependency in the SDDP\n- cuts related to the conditional expectations in the dynamic programming\nequations.

The realization of networks with a small number\nof quantum links is now actively pursued, which calls for an assessment of\ndifferent state transfer methods to guide future design decisions. Here, we\ntheoretically investigate quantum state transfer between two distant qubits,\neach in a cavity, connected by a waveguide, e.g., an optical fiber. We evaluate\nthe achievable success probabilities of state transfer for two different\nprotocols: standard wave packet shaping and adiabatic passage. The main loss\nsources are transmission losses in the waveguide and absorption losses in the\ncavities. While special cases studied in the literature indicate that adiabatic\npassages may be beneficial in this context, it remained an open question under\nwhich conditions this is the case and whether their use will be advantageous in\npractice. We answer these questions by providing a full analysis, showing that\nstate transfer by adiabatic passage -- in contrast to wave packet shaping --\ncan mitigate the effects of undesired cavity losses, far beyond the regime of\ncoupling to a single waveguide mode and the regime of lossless waveguides, as\nwas proposed so far. Furthermore, we show that the photon arrival probability\nis in fact bounded in a trade-off between losses due to non-adiabaticity and\ndue to coupling to off-resonant waveguide modes. We clarify that neither\nprotocol can avoid transmission losses and discuss how the cavity parameters\nshould be chosen to achieve an optimal state transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 17:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 17:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-18"}

Extracting $G^n_E$ with different\ntargets and techniques provides an important test of our handling of these\neffects. $[Purpose]$ The goal of the measurement was to use an inclusive\nasymmetry measurement technique to extract the neutron charge form factor at a\nfour-momentum transfer of $1~(\\rm{GeV/c})^2$. This technique has very different\nsystematic uncertainties than traditional exclusive measurements and thus\nserves as an independent check of whether nuclear effects have been taken into\naccount correctly. $[Method]$ The inclusive quasi-elastic reaction\n$^3\\overrightarrow{\\rm{He}}(\\overrightarrow{e},e')$ was measured at Jefferson\nLab.

This is mostly due to the need to parametrize and\napproximate aspects of hydrodynamics in hydrostatic codes. In particular, the\neffect of hydrodynamic instabilities in rotating stars, for example, dynamical\nshear instability, evades consistent description. We intend to study the\naccuracy of the diffusion approximation to dynamical shear in hydrostatic\nstellar evolution models by comparing 1D models to a first-principle\nhydrodynamics simulation starting from the same initial conditions. We chose an\ninitial model calculated with the stellar evolution code GENEC that is just at\nthe onset of a dynamical shear instability but does not show any other\ninstabilities (e.g., convection). This was mapped to the hydrodynamics code SLH\nto perform a 2D simulation in the equatorial plane. We compare the resulting\nprofiles in the two codes and compute an effective diffusion coefficient for\nthe hydro simulation. Shear instabilities develop in the 2D simulation in the\nregions predicted by linear theory to become unstable in the 1D model. Angular\nvelocity and chemical composition is redistributed in the unstable region,\nthereby creating new unstable regions. Eventually the 2D simulation settles in\na symmetric, steady state, which is Richardson stable everywhere, whereas the\ninstability remains for longer in the 1D model due to current limitations in\nthe 1D code.

The new asymmetric drift formula, fitted to our\npreviously described St\\\"ackel potential, fairly well reproduces the velocity\ndistribution in a wide solar neighborhood. The U and W components of the solar\nmotion determined with this method agree well with previous studies. However,\nwe find a smaller V component than previously thought, essentially because we\ninclude the variation of the asymmetric drift with distance to the plane. The\nthick disk is represented by a long period of formation (at least 2 Gyr),\nduring which, as we show, the mean velocity increases with time while the scale\nheight and scale length decrease, very consistently with a collapse phase with\nconservation of angular momentum. This new Galactic dynamical model is able to\nreproduce the observed velocities in a wide solar neighborhood at the quality\nlevel of the TGAS-RAVE sample, allowing us to constrain the thin and thick disk\ndynamical evolution, as well as determining the solar motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

For non-interacting models, this question is rather well\nunderstood. However, the best known bounds for general quantum systems are\nvastly crude, scaling unfavorable with the system size. Nevertheless, empirical\nand numerical evidence suggests that for generic interacting many-body systems,\ngeneric local observables, and sufficiently well-behaved states, the\nequilibration time does not depend strongly on the system size, but only the\nprecision with which this occurs does. In this discussion paper, we aim at\ngiving very simple and plausible arguments for why this happens. While our\ndiscussion does not yield rigorous results about equilibration time scales, we\nbelieve that it helps to clarify the essential underlying mechanisms, the\nintuition and important figure of merits behind equilibration.

The extent to which a time\nhierarchy-type theorem holds in the distributed LOCAL model has been open for\nmany years. It is consistent with previous results that all natural problems in\nthe LOCAL model can be classified according to a small constant number of\ncomplexities, such as $O(1),O(\\log^* n), O(\\log n), 2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$, etc.\n  In this paper we establish the first time hierarchy theorem for the LOCAL\nmodel and prove that several gaps exist in the LOCAL time hierarchy.\n  1. We define an infinite set of simple coloring problems called Hierarchical\n$2\\frac{1}{2}$-Coloring}. A correctly colored graph can be confirmed by simply\nchecking the neighborhood of each vertex, so this problem fits into the class\nof locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems.

Together with a previous result, this establishes that on\ntrees, there are no natural deterministic complexities in the ranges\n$\\omega(\\log^* n)$---$o(\\log n)$ or $\\omega(\\log n)$---$n^{o(1)}$.\n  3. We expose a gap in the randomized time hierarchy on general graphs.

Here, we present a\nfar-off-resonance Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (FORD) protocol and demonstrate the\nbroadband quantum memory in room-temperature atoms. We observe a low\nunconditional noise level of $10^{-4}$ and a cross-correlation up to 28. A\nstrong violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality indicates high-fidelity\ngeneration and preservation of non-classical correlation. Furthermore, the\nachieved cross-correlation in room-temperature atoms exceeds the key boundary\nof 6 above which quantum correlation is able to violate Bell's inequality. Our\nresults open up the door to an entirely new realm of memory-enabled quantum\napplications at ambient conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 19:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The types of the features that\nare employed in these family of trackers significantly affect the performance\nof visual tracking. The ultimate goal is to utilize robust features invariant\nto any kind of appearance change of the object, while predicting the object\nlocation as properly as in the case of no appearance change. As the deep\nlearning based methods have emerged, the study of learning features for\nspecific tasks has accelerated. For instance, discriminative visual tracking\nmethods based on deep architectures have been studied with promising\nperformance. Nevertheless, correlation filter based (CFB) trackers confine\nthemselves to use the pre-trained networks which are trained for object\nclassification problem. To this end, in this manuscript the problem of learning\ndeep fully convolutional features for the CFB visual tracking is formulated. In\norder to learn the proposed model, a novel and efficient backpropagation\nalgorithm is presented based on the loss function of the network. The proposed\nlearning framework enables the network model to be flexible for a custom\ndesign. Moreover, it alleviates the dependency on the network trained for\nclassification. Extensive performance analysis shows the efficacy of the\nproposed custom design in the CFB tracking framework. By fine-tuning the\nconvolutional parts of a state-of-the-art network and integrating this model to\na CFB tracker, which is the top performing one of VOT2016, 18% increase is\nachieved in terms of expected average overlap, and tracking failures are\ndecreased by 25%, while maintaining the superiority over the state-of-the-art\nmethods in OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 tracking datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 20:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 12:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

In this paper, we propose a new\nclustering model, called DEeP Embedded RegularIzed ClusTering (DEPICT), which\nefficiently maps data into a discriminative embedding subspace and precisely\npredicts cluster assignments. DEPICT generally consists of a multinomial\nlogistic regression function stacked on top of a multi-layer convolutional\nautoencoder. We define a clustering objective function using relative entropy\n(KL divergence) minimization, regularized by a prior for the frequency of\ncluster assignments. An alternating strategy is then derived to optimize the\nobjective by updating parameters and estimating cluster assignments.\nFurthermore, we employ the reconstruction loss functions in our autoencoder, as\na data-dependent regularization term, to prevent the deep embedding function\nfrom overfitting. In order to benefit from end-to-end optimization and\neliminate the necessity for layer-wise pretraining, we introduce a joint\nlearning framework to minimize the unified clustering and reconstruction loss\nfunctions together and train all network layers simultaneously.

The dissipation arises\nfrom an oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip\noscillation, which is caused by applying the ac voltage between the tip and\nsample. The magnitude of the externally induced dissipation is found to be\nproportional to the effective dc bias voltage, which is the difference between\nthe applied dc voltage and the contact potential difference. Two different\nimplementations of D-KPFM are presented. In the first implementation, the\nfrequency of the applied ac voltage, $f_\\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be the same\nas the tip oscillation ($f_\\mathrm{el} = f_\\mathrm{m}$: $1\\omega$D-KPFM). In\nthe second one, the ac voltage frequency, $f_\\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be\ntwice the tip oscillation frequency ($f_\\mathrm{el}= 2 f_\\mathrm{m}$:\n$2\\omega$D-KPFM). In $1\\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional to the\nelectrostatic force, which enables the use of a small ac voltage amplitude even\ndown to $\\approx 10$\\,mV. In $2\\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional\nto the electrostatic force gradient, which results in the same potential\ncontrast as that obtained by FM-KPFM.

Two\npropagation packages, GALPROP and HelMod, are combined to provide a single\nframework that is run to reproduce direct measurements of cosmic ray (CR)\nspecies at different modulation levels and at both polarities of the solar\nmagnetic field. To do so in a self-consistent way, an iterative procedure was\ndeveloped, where the GALPROP LIS output is fed into HelMod that provides\nmodulated spectra for specific time periods of selected experiments to compare\nwith the data; the HelMod parameters optimization is performed at this stage\nand looped back to adjust the LIS using the new GALPROP run. The parameters\nwere tuned with the maximum likelihood procedure using an extensive data set of\nproton spectra from 1997-2015. The proposed LIS accommodate both the low energy\ninterstellar CR spectra measured by Voyager 1 and the high energy observations\nby BESS, Pamela, AMS-01, and AMS-02 made from the balloons and near-Earth\npayloads; it also accounts for Ulysses counting rate features measured out of\nthe ecliptic plane.

This thesis concentrates on the\nunderstanding of the LMR enhancement regarding its $M_{ee}$, $p_{T}$ and energy\ndependence. It studies dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at beam\nenergies of 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV with sufficient statistics. In\nconjunction with the published STAR results at top RHIC energy, this thesis\npresents results on the first comprehensive energy-dependent study of\ndielectron production.\n  The comparison of $M_{ee}$- and $p_{T}$-spectra with cocktail simulations of\nhadronic sources reveals a sizeable and steadily increasing excess yield in the\nLMR at all beam energies. The scenario of broadened in-medium $\\rho$ spectral\nfunctions proves to not only serve well as dominating underlying source but\nalso to be universal in nature since it quantitatively and qualitatively\nexplains the LMR enhancements from SPS to top RHIC energies. It shows that most\nof the enhancement is governed by interactions of the $\\rho$ meson with thermal\nresonance excitations in the late(r)-stage hot and dense hadronic phase. This\nconclusion is supported by the energy-dependent measurement of integrated LMR\nexcess yields and enhancement factors. The former do not exhibit a strong\ndependence on beam energy as expected from the approximately constant total\nbaryon density above 20 GeV, and the latter show agreement with the CERES\nmeasurement at SPS energy. The consistency in excess yields and agreement with\nmodel calculations over the wide RHIC energy regime makes a strong case for LMR\nenhancements on the order of a factor 2-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 21:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

The Feynman period is a\nsimplified version of the Feynman integral, and is of special interest, as it\nmaintains much of the important number theoretic information from the Feynman\nintegral. It is also of structural interest, as it is known to be preserved by\na number of graph theoretic operations. In particular, the vertex deleted in\nconstructing the 4-point graph does not affect the Feynman period, and it is\ninvariant under planar duality and the Schnetz twist, an operation that\nredirects edges incident to a 4-vertex cut. Further, a 4-regular graph may be\nproduced by a 3-sum operation on triangles in two 4-regular graphs.

The maximum amount of quantum information per\nunit surface and the consequent space constraints on qubit operations are key\nparameters towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing (QIP) with Si\nqubits. Such maximum density of quantum information is expressed for the\ncompact exchange-only Si double quantum dot qubit architecture as a function of\nthe CMOS technology node. The size scale optimizing both physical qubit\noperation time and quantum error correction (QEC) requirements is assessed by\nreviewing the physical and technological constraints. We determine the workable\noperation frequency range of a Si-CMOS quantum processor to be within 1 and 100\nGHz, which limits its feasibility only to the most advanced nodes.

Second, we added a reporting phase\nthat provides increased scalability to our device. Third, we designed input and\nfuel extracting hairpins that when added, initiate a renewing process. This\nresults in a renewed functional gate, in its original configuration, which is\nable to make a new logical computation with new inputs. Finally, we introduced\na renewable two-input Boolean logic OR gate. After calculating the output of a\ncertain input set, the circuit is restored and a new set of inputs is\nintroduced to compute the new output. We provide experimental fluorescent data\non three repeated rounds of executions of our hairpin gate motif and its\nrestoration, indicating gradual loss of response. Finally, we calculated rate\nconstants of our experimental data by fitting it to a second order reaction\nmodel using maximum likelihood estimation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 00:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The skeletons are a one pixel wide representation of the filamentary\nstructure in the original input image. However, these output skeletons may not\nnecessarily be a good representation of that structure. Furthermore, a given\nskeleton may not be as good a representation as another. Previously there has\nbeen no mathematical `goodness-of-fit' measure to compare output skeletons to\nthe input image. Thus far this has been assessed visually, introducing visual\nbias. We propose the application of the mean structural similarity index\n(MSSIM) as a mathematical goodness-of-fit measure. We describe the use of the\nMSSIM to find the output skeletons most mathematically similar to the original\ninput image (the optimum, or `best', skeletons) for a given algorithm, and\nindependently of the algorithm. This measure makes possible systematic\nparameter studies, aimed at finding the subset of input parameter values\nreturning optimum skeletons. It can also be applied to the output of\nnon-skeleton based filament identification algorithms, such as the Hessian\nmatrix method. The MSSIM removes the need to visually examine thousands of\noutput skeletons, and eliminates the visual bias, subjectivity, and limited\nreproducibility inherent in that process, representing a major improvement on\nexisting techniques. Importantly, it also allows further automation in the\npost-processing of output skeletons, which is crucial in this era of `big\ndata'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 02:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

However, the measures of performance for tracking\nand classification are different. Data sets that are suitable for evaluating\ntracking systems may not be appropriate for classification. Tracking video data\nsets typically only have ground truth track IDs, while classification video\ndata sets only have ground truth class-label IDs. The former identifies the\nsame object over multiple frames, while the latter identifies the type of\nobject in individual frames. This paper describes an advancement of the ground\ntruth meta-data for the DARPA Neovision2 Tower data set to allow both the\nevaluation of tracking and classification.

The unique IDs are\nmaintained during occlusions between multiple objects or when objects re-enter\nthe field of view. This will provide: a solid foundation for evaluating the\nperformance of multi-object tracking of different types of objects, a\nstraightforward comparison of tracking system performance using the standard\nMulti Object Tracking (MOT) framework, and classification performance using the\nNeovision2 metrics.

Past interfaces have used a\nuniform dwell time across all objects. Here, we propose a gaze-based browser\nusing a two-step selection policy with variable dwell time. In the first step,\na command, e.g. \"back\" or \"select\", is chosen from a menu using a dwell time\nthat is constant across the different commands. In the second step, if the\n\"select\" command is chosen, the user selects a hyperlink using a dwell time\nthat varies between different hyperlinks. We assign shorter dwell times to more\nlikely hyperlinks and longer dwell times to less likely hyperlinks. In order to\ninfer the likelihood each hyperlink will be selected, we have developed a\nprobabilistic model of natural gaze behavior while surfing the web. We have\nevaluated a number of heuristic and probabilistic methods for varying the dwell\ntimes using both simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that\nvarying dwell time improves the user experience in comparison with fixed dwell\ntime, resulting in fewer errors and increased speed. While all of the methods\nfor varying dwell time resulted in improved performance, the probabilistic\nmodels yielded much greater gains than the simple heuristics. The best\nperforming model reduces error rate by 50% compared to 100ms uniform dwell time\nwhile maintaining a similar response time.

Our experiments show that the addition of the {\\em apriori}\nneighborhood graph results in significant improvements in classification\nperformance compared to a model which does not take into account the brain\nregion interactions or one which uses a fully connected prior graph. In\naddition, we describe a method, using our model, to detect the regions that\ncontribute the most to the overall abnormality of the DTI profile of a\nsubject's brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 06:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

While Hubbard and t-J models\nwere given a lot of attention, a number of recent experiments appear to give\ndecisive support to the model of real-space inter-site pairing and percolative\nsuperconductivity in cuprates. Systematic measurements of the doping dependence\nof the superfluid density show a linear dependence on superfluid density -\nrather than doping - over the entire phase diagram, in accordance with the\nmodel's predictions. The doping-dependence of the anomalous lattice dynamics of\nin-plane Cu-O mode vibrations observed by inelastic neutron scattering, gives\nremarkable reciprocal space signature of the inter-site pairing interaction\nwhose doping dependence closely follows the predicted pair density.\nSymmetry-specific time-domain spectroscopy shows carrier localization, polaron\nformation, pairing and superconductivity to be distinct processes occurring on\ndistinct timescales throughout the entire superconducting phase diagram.

In contrast\nwith the usual approach of injecting into such stochastic agent models either\nspecific, idiosyncratic internal nonlinear interaction patterns, or macroscopic\ndisruptive features, we propose a dynamic inequality model where the attainment\nof a sizable fraction of the total wealth by very few agents induces a crisis\nregime with strong intermittency, the explicit coupling between the richest and\nthe rest being a mere normalization mechanism, hence with minimal extrinsic\nassumptions. The model thus harnesses the recognized lack of ergodicity of\ngeometric Brownian motions.

The arrival process is Poisson, service times at each queue have\nexponential distributions with the same parameter, and both queues have equal\ncapacity. Using standard generating function arguments, a simple expression for\nthe blocking probability is derived, which as far as we know is original. Using\ncoupling arguments and explicit formulas, comparisons with related loss systems\nare then provided. Bounds are similarly obtained for the average total number\nof customers, with the stationary distribution explicitly determined on $\\{K,\n\\dots, 2K \\}$, and elsewhere upper bounded. Furthermore, from the balance\nequations, all stationary probabilities are obtained as explicit combinations\nof their values at states $(0,k)$ for $0 \\le k \\le K$. These expressions extend\nto the infinite capacity and asymmetric cases, i.e., when the queues have\ndifferent service rates. For the initial symmetric finite capacity model, the\nstationary probabilities of states $(0,k)$ can be obtained recursively from the\nblocking probability. In the other cases, they are implicitly determined\nthrough a functional equation that characterizes their generating function. The\nwhole approach shows that the stationary distribution of the infinite capacity\nsymmetric process is the limit of the corresponding finite capacity\ndistributions.

The\ndifferent biological effects of radiation should be divided into several\nphases: physical (interaction between charged particles and tissue atoms),\nchemical (the period during which the damaged atoms and molecules react with\nother cellular components in rapid chemical reactions), and biological (impact\nof the generated lesions on the biological tissue [4]). The following section\ndescribes the models most often used in radiotherapy. These are simplistic\nmodels that actual treatments are based, and that are validated and approved\n[9-12].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

We find that, depending on the\nflare index and proximity to the central star, the average value of the period\nratio, $P_2/P_1$, between both planets may show a significant deviation with\nrespect to the nominal value. For planets trapped in the 2:1 commensurability,\noffsets may reach values on the order of $0.1$ for orbital periods on the order\nof $1$ day, while systems in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance (MMR) show much\nsmaller offsets for all values of the semimajor axis. These properties are in\ngood agreement with the observed distribution of near-resonant exoplanets,\nindependent of their detection method. We show that 2:1-resonant systems far\nfrom the star, such as HD82943 and HR8799, are characterized by very small\nresonant offsets, while higher values are typical of systems discovered by\nKepler with orbital periods approximately a few days.

In conclusion, our results indicate that\nthe distribution of Kepler planetary systems around the 2:1 and 3:2 MMR are\nconsistent with resonant configurations obtained as a consequence of a smooth\nmigration in a laminar flared disk, and no external forces are required to\ninduce the observed offset or its dependence with the commensurability or\norbital distance from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

From\nfits of the observed CFHT spectrum with synthetic line profiles based on 1D and\n3D model atmospheres, we seek to estimate the abundance of the 6Li isotope and\nto place constraints on its origin. We derive A(Li) and the 6Li/7Li isotopic\nratio by fitting different synthetic spectra to the Li-line region of a\nhigh-resolution CFHT spectrum (R=120 000, S/R=400). The synthetic spectra are\ncomputed with four different line lists, using in parallel 3D hydrodynamical\nCO5BOLD and 1D LHD model atmospheres and treating the line formation of the\nlithium components in non-LTE (NLTE). We find A(Li)=1.69+/-0.11 dex and\n6Li/7Li=8.0+/-4.4 % in 3D-NLTE, using the line list of Mel\\'endez et al.\n(2012), updated with new atomic data for V I, which results in the best fit of\nthe lithium line profile of HD123351.

Here we explore in some detail the\nrelation between visibility graphs and symbolic dynamics. To do that, we\nconsider the degree sequence of horizontal visibility graphs generated by the\none-parameter logistic map, for a range of values of the parameter for which\nthe map shows chaotic behaviour. Numerically, we observe that in the chaotic\nregion the block entropies of these sequences systematically converge to the\nLyapunov exponent of the system. Via Pesin identity, this in turn suggests that\nthese block entropies are converging to the Kolmogorov- Sinai entropy of the\nmap, which ultimately suggests that the algorithm is implicitly and adaptively\nconstructing phase space partitions which might have the generating property.\nTo give analytical insight, we explore the relation k(x), x \\in[0,1] that, for\na given datum with value x, assigns in graph space a node with degree k. In the\ncase of the out-degree sequence, such relation is indeed a piece-wise constant\nfunction. By making use of explicit methods and tools from symbolic dynamics we\nare able to analytically show that the algorithm indeed performs an effective\npartition of the phase space and that such partition is naturally expressed as\na countable union of subintervals, where the endpoints of each subinterval are\nrelated to the fixed point structure of the iterates of the map and the\nsubinterval enumeration is associated with particular ordering structures that\nwe called motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 10:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

To advance our understanding\nof possible future development pathways and identify management options for\nnavigating to safe operating spaces while avoiding undesirable domains,\ncomputer models of the Earth system are developed and applied. These models\nhardly represent dynamical properties of technological processes despite their\ngreat planetary-scale influence on the biogeophysical components of the Earth\nsystem and the associated risks for human societies posed, e.g., by climatic\nchange or novel entities. In this contribution, we reflect on the technosphere\nfrom the perspective of Earth system analysis with a threefold focus on agency,\nnetworks and complex coevolutionary dynamics. First, we argue that Haff's\nconception of the technosphere takes an extreme position in implying a strongly\nconstrained human agency in the Earth system. Assuming that the technosphere\ndevelops according to dynamics largely independently of human intentions,\nHaff's perspective appears incompatible with a humanistic view that underlies\nthe sustainability discourse at large and, more specifically, current\nframeworks such as UN sustainable development goals and the safe and just\noperating space for humanity. Second, as an alternative to Haff's static\nthree-stratum picture, we propose complex adaptive networks as a concept for\ndescribing the interplay of social agents and technospheric entities and their\nemergent dynamics for Earth system analysis. Third, we argue that following a\ncoevolutionary approach in conceptualising and modelling technospheric\ndynamics, also including the socio-cultural and biophysical spheres of the\nEarth system, could resolve the apparent conflict between the discourses on\nsustainability and the technosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 10:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Predicting such changes within graphs can be expected\nto yield important insight with respect to the underlying dynamics, e.g. with\nrespect to user behaviour. However, predictive techniques in the past have\nalmost exclusively focused on single edges or nodes. In this contribution, we\nattempt to predict the future state of a graph as a whole. We propose to phrase\ntime series prediction as a regression problem and apply dissimilarity- or\nkernel-based regression techniques, such as 1-nearest neighbor, kernel\nregression and Gaussian process regression, which can be applied to graphs via\ngraph kernels. The output of the regression is a point embedded in a\npseudo-Euclidean space, which can be analyzed using subsequent dissimilarity-\nor kernel-based processing methods. We discuss strategies to speed up Gaussian\nProcesses regression from cubic to linear time and evaluate our approach on two\nwell-established theoretical models of graph evolution as well as two real data\nsets from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems.

First, multiple applications of the\nentangling gate to a single pair of qubits produces non-trivial entanglement,\nand hence multiple parallel edges between nodes play an important role in these\ngeneralised graph states. Second, such a state can be used to realise\ndeterministic, approximately universal computation using only Pauli $Z$ and $X$\nmeasurements and feed-forward.

I introduce the\nMetric-Affine formalism as a framework in which study extensions of GR. I\nreview its features and motivate it through its application in Bravais\ncrystals, where ideal crystals can be described through Riemannian formalism,\nbut a crystal with defects have to be described with in terms of an independent\nconnection. The simplest way to construct solutions different from GR in this\nformalism is to take a quadratic gravity lagrangian with an electrovacuum\nstress-energy tensor. This way, charged black hole solutions are obtained.\n  The geometry of these new charged black hole solutions is analysed. Far from\nthe sources, the geometry of these new solutions is equal to the GR one up to\n$1/r^4$ corrections. However, instead of a central singularity, they have a\nwormhole structure, which can be completely regular or where the curvature\nscalars diverge, depending on the mass and charge of the black hole. I study\nthe geodesics around the wormhole throat and conclude that the geodesics are\nalways complete even in the case of a curvature divergence. To analyse in more\ndetail the geometry, I also study the evolution of a scalar wave sent towards\nthe wormhole. The evolution is shown to be regular and I calculate the\ntransmission coefficients and transmission cross section for a naked wormhole.\n  Finally, I study the same case for a Born-Infeld lagrangian in an arbitrary\nnumber of dimension ($d>4$). In this setting, the wormhole structure is also\npresent and the geodesics are still complete, therefore showing that the\nmetric-affine formalism can resolve singularities for a variety of models, and\nis not a particular feature of the quadratic Lagrangian for $d=4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 13:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 09:44:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 11:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

To tackle these issues we propose\na 3D fully (convolutional neural network (CNN) driven random walk (RW) approach\nto automatically segment the esophagus on CT.

The\nradiative transfer problem in 3D is solved using Monte Carlo or Ray Tracing\ntechniques as no full analytic solution exists for the true 3D structures. We\nprovide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark composed of a slab of\ndust with uniform density externally illuminated by a star. This simple 3D\nbenchmark is explicitly formulated to provide tests of the different components\nof the radiative transfer problem including dust absorption, scattering, and\nemission. This benchmark includes models with a range of dust optical depths\nfully probing cases that are optically thin at all wavelengths to optically\nthick at most wavelengths. This benchmark includes solutions for the full dust\nemission including single photon (stochastic) heating as well as two\nsimplifying approximations: One where all grains are considered in equilibrium\nwith the radiation field and one where the emission is from a single effective\ngrain with size-distribution-averaged properties. A total of six Monte Carlo\ncodes and one Ray Tracing code provide solutions to this benchmark. Comparison\nof the results revealed that the global SEDs are consistent on average to a few\npercent for all but the scattered stellar flux at very high optical depths. The\nimage results are consistent within 10%, again except for the stellar scattered\nflux at very high optical depths. The lack of agreement between different codes\nof the scattered flux at high optical depths is quantified for the first time.\nWe provide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark and validate the\naccuracy of this benchmark through comparisons between multiple independent\ncodes and detailed convergence tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 15:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

These\nsolutions have their counterparts for the second-order porous-medium equation\n$h_t - (h^m)_{yy} = 0$, where $m > 1$ is a free parameter. Both porous-medium\nand thin-film equation degenerate as $h \\searrow 0$, but the porous-medium\nequation additionally fulfills a comparison principle while the thin-film\nequation does not.\n  In this note, we consider traveling waves $h = \\frac V 6 x^3 + \\nu x^2$ for\n$x \\ge 0$, where $x = y-V t$ and $V, \\nu \\ge 0$ are free parameters.

To estimate the viewpoint (or pose) of an object,\npeople have mostly looked at object intrinsic features, such as shape or\nappearance. Surprisingly, informative features provided by other, extrinsic\nelements in the scene, have so far mostly been ignored. At the same time,\ncontextual cues have been proven to be of great benefit for related tasks such\nas object detection or action recognition. In this paper, we explore how\ninformation from other objects in the scene can be exploited for viewpoint\nestimation. In particular, we look at object configurations by following a\nrelational neighbor-based approach for reasoning about object relations. We\nshow that, starting from noisy object detections and viewpoint estimates,\nexploiting the estimated viewpoint and location of other objects in the scene\ncan lead to improved object viewpoint predictions. Experiments on the KITTI\ndataset demonstrate that object configurations can indeed be used as a\ncomplementary cue to appearance-based viewpoint estimation. Our analysis\nreveals that the proposed context-based method can improve object viewpoint\nestimation by reducing specific types of viewpoint estimation errors commonly\nmade by methods that only consider local information. Moreover, considering\ncontextual information produces superior performance in scenes where a high\nnumber of object instances occur. Finally, our results suggest that, following\na cautious relational neighbor formulation brings improvements over its\naggressive counterpart for the task of object viewpoint estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 15:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Extensive deformation of the\nCu50Mo50 composite via two-step high-pressure torsion produced equiaxed\nnanoscale grains of Mo and Cu with a grain size of 10-15 nm. Identical\ntreatment of Cu30Mo70 produced a ultrafine, lamellar structure, comprised of Cu\nand Mo layers with thicknesses of ~5 nm and ~10-20 nm, respectively and an\ninterlamellar spacing of 9 nm. This microstructure differs substantially from\nthat of HPT-deformed Cu-Cr and Cu-W composites, in which the lamellar\nmicrostructure breaks down at high strains. The ultrafine-grained structure and\nabsence of porosity resulted in composites with Vickers hardness values of 600\nfor Cu30Mo70 and 475 for Cu50Mo50. The ability to produce Cu30Mo70\nnanocomposites with a combination of high strength, and a fine, oriented\nmicrostructure should be of interest for thermoelectric applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}
