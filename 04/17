In particular, we\npropose two network channel virtualization schemes that allow for representing\nthe set of intended receivers in a multicast group to be virtualized as one\nreceiver. Such approach allows for a transmission scheme not only adapted to\nper-receiver channel variation over time, but to the network-virtualized\nchannel representing all receivers in the multicast group. The first scheme\ncapitalizes on a maximum erasure criterion introduced via the creation of a\nvirtual worst per receiver per slot reference channel of the network. The\nsecond scheme capitalizes on a maximum completion time criterion by the use of\nthe worst performing receiver channel as a virtual reference to the network. We\napply such schemes to a GEO satellite scenario. We demonstrate the benefits of\nthe proposed schemes comparing them to a per-receiver point-to-point adaptive\nstrategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 16:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

The boundaries that separate these regions are\nreferred to as power flow solution space boundaries. Knowledge of these\nboundaries is important as they provide a measure for voltage stability.\nTraditionally, continuation based methods have been employed to compute these\nboundaries on the basis of initial guesses for the solution. However, with\nrapid growth of renewable energy sources these boundaries will be increasingly\naffected by variable parameters such as penetration levels, locations of the\nrenewable sources, and voltage set-points, making it difficult to generate an\ninitial guess that can guarantee all feasible solutions for the power flow\nproblem.

We\ninvestigate a new influence measure, termed outward influence (OI), defined as\nthe (expected) number of nodes that a subset of nodes $S$ will activate,\nexcluding the nodes in S. Thus, OI equals, the de facto standard measure,\ninfluence spread of S minus |S|. OI is not only more informative for nodes with\nsmall influence, but also, critical in designing new effective sampling and\nstatistical estimation methods.\n  Based on OI, we propose SIEA/SOIEA, novel methods to estimate influence\nspread/outward influence at scale and with rigorous theoretical guarantees. The\nproposed methods are built on two novel components 1) IICP an important\nsampling method for outward influence, and 2) RSA, a robust mean estimation\nmethod that minimize the number of samples through analyzing variance and range\nof random variables.

Most current lighting control systems use\ninfrared human detection sensors, but the poor detection probability,\nespecially for a static user, makes it difficult to realize comfortable and\neffective lighting control.

In particular, a novel framework for optimizing\nthe performance of such UAV-based wireless systems in terms of the average\nnumber of bits (data service) transmitted to users as well as UAVs' hover\nduration (i.e. flight time) is proposed. In the considered model, UAVs hover\nover a given geographical area to serve ground users that are distributed\nwithin the area based on an arbitrary spatial distribution function. In this\ncase, two practical scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, based on\nthe maximum possible hover times of UAVs, the average data service delivered to\nthe users under a fair resource allocation scheme is maximized by finding the\noptimal cell partitions associated to the UAVs. Using the mathematical\nframework of optimal transport theory, a gradient-based algorithm is proposed\nfor optimally partitioning the geographical area based on the users'\ndistribution, hover times, and locations of the UAVs. In the second scenario,\ngiven the load requirements of ground users, the minimum average hover time\nthat the UAVs need for completely servicing their ground users is derived. To\nthis end, first, an optimal bandwidth allocation scheme for serving the users\nis proposed. Then, given this optimal bandwidth allocation, the optimal cell\npartitions associated with the UAVs are derived by exploiting the optimal\ntransport theory.

What makes the quantum approach a promising candidate for a\ntheory of humor is that it can be useful for representing states of ambiguity,\nand it defines states and variables with reference to a context. Contextuality\nand ambiguity both play a key role in humor, which often hangs on an ambiguous\nword, phrase, or situation that might not make sense, or even be socially\nacceptable outside the specific context of the joke. The quantum approach does\nnot attempt to explain all aspects of humor, such as the contagious quality of\nlaughter, or why children tease each other, or why people might find it funny\nwhen someone is hit in the face with a pie (and laugh even if they know it will\nhappen in advance); what it aims to do is to mathematically represent the\nunderlying cognitive process of \"getting\" a joke.

In such settings several data features are commonly present: (i) the\nrelated samples often share some, if not all, of the mixture components but\nwith differing weights, (ii) only some, not all, of the mixture components vary\nacross the samples, and (iii) often the shared mixture components across\nsamples are not aligned perfectly in terms of their location and spread, but\nrather display small misalignments either due to systematic cross-sample\ndifference or more often due to uncontrolled, extraneous causes. Properly\nincorporating these features in mixture modeling will enhance the efficiency of\ninference, whereas ignoring them not only reduces efficiency but can jeopardize\nthe validity of the inference due to issues such as confounding. We introduce\ntwo techniques for incorporating these features in modeling related data\nsamples using kernel mixtures. The first technique, called $\\psi$-stick\nbreaking, is a joint generative process for the mixing weights through the\nbreaking of both a stick shared by all the samples for the components that do\nnot vary in size across samples and an idiosyncratic stick for each sample for\nthose components that do vary in size.

These hyper-parameters\nallow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application\nbased on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on\nresource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other\npopular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the\neffectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases\nincluding object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large\nscale geo-localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 03:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

As the\ndensity dependences of the four-quark condensates are not known well, we\nexamine two hypotheses. One is based on the factorization hypothesis (F-type)\nand the other is derived from the perturbative chiral quark model (QM-type).\nThe F-type strongly depends on density, while the QM-type gives a weaker\ndependence. It is found that, for the F-type dependence, the energy of\n$\\Lambda_c$ increases as the density of nuclear matter grows, that is,\n$\\Lambda_c$ feels repulsion.

An extensive series of papers, across\ndifferent communities, has examined the computability and complexity\ncharacteristics of this model. Majority, or consensus, is a central task, in\nwhich agents need to collectively reach a decision as to which one of two\nstates $A$ or $B$ had a higher initial count. Two complexity metrics are\nimportant: the time that a protocol requires to stabilize to an output\ndecision, and the state space size that each agent requires.\n  It is known that majority requires $\\Omega(\\log \\log n)$ states per agent to\nallow for poly-logarithmic time stabilization, and that $O(\\log^2 n)$ states\nare sufficient. Thus, there is an exponential gap between the upper and lower\nbounds.\n  We address this question. We provide a new lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$\nstates for any protocol which stabilizes in $O( n^{1-c} )$ time, for any $c >\n0$ constant. This result is conditional on basic monotonicity and output\nassumptions, satisfied by all known protocols. Technically, it represents a\nsignificant departure from previous lower bounds. Instead of relying on dense\nconfigurations, we introduce a new surgery technique to construct executions\nwhich contradict the correctness of algorithms that stabilize too fast.\nSubsequently, our lower bound applies to general initial configurations.\n  We give an algorithm for majority which uses $O(\\log n)$ states, and\nstabilizes in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time. Central to the algorithm is a new leaderless\nphase clock, which allows nodes to synchronize in phases of $\\Theta(n \\log{n})$\nconsecutive interactions using $O(\\log n)$ states per node.

Different from the choices of the\nsnapshot point and starting point in SVRG and its proximal variant, Prox-SVRG,\nthe two vectors of each epoch in VR-SGD are set to the average and last iterate\nof the previous epoch, respectively. This setting allows us to use much larger\nlearning rates or step sizes than SVRG, e.g., 3/(7L) for VR-SGD vs 1/(10L) for\nSVRG, and also makes our convergence analysis more challenging. In fact, a\nlarger learning rate enjoyed by VR-SGD means that the variance of its\nstochastic gradient estimator asymptotically approaches zero more rapidly.\nUnlike common stochastic methods such as SVRG and proximal stochastic methods\nsuch as Prox-SVRG, we design two different update rules for smooth and\nnon-smooth objective functions, respectively. In other words, VR-SGD can tackle\nnon-smooth and/or non-strongly convex problems directly without using any\nreduction techniques such as quadratic regularizers. Moreover, we analyze the\nconvergence properties of VR-SGD for strongly convex problems, which show that\nVR-SGD attains a linear convergence rate. We also provide the convergence\nguarantees of VR-SGD for non-strongly convex problems.

CUP uses a hybrid metadata scheme that supports all\nprogram data including globals, heap, or stack and maintains the ABI. Compared\nto existing approaches with the NIST Juliet test suite, CUP reduces false\nnegatives by 10x (0.1%) compared to the state of the art LLVM sanitizers, and\nproduces no false positives. CUP instruments all user-space code, including\nlibc and other system libraries, removing them from the trusted code base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 15:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

It has been\nformulated also a holographic super-string model for the anti de Sitter space,\nwhich allows for implementation of quantum gravity in the volume by only\nquantum boundary---hologram. The locally planar topology of the boundary of 3D\nspace leads, however, to more reach possibilities of quantization of many\nparticle systems according to representations of related braid groups (i.e.,\nfirst homotopy groups of the configuration space for multiparticle systems).\nThis level of freedom would be helpful in symmetry-term considerations of\nhypothetical locally 2D hologram properties corresponding to anyons. Specific\nproperties of anyons on a sphere are compared with fractional charge of quarks.\nThe confinement of quarks in hadrons is conjectured to be linked with the\ncollective behavior of anyons precluding their individual separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 12:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 22:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

In this paper, we discuss the\ninformation transmission process on the hybrid networks with both fixed and\nmobile nodes. The fixed nodes (base stations) are connected as a spatial\nlattice on the plane forming the information-carrying backbone, while the\nmobile nodes (users), which are the sources and destinations of information\npackets, connect to their current nearest fixed nodes respectively to deliver\nand receive information packets. We observe the phase transition of traffic\nload in the hybrid network when the packet generation rate goes from below and\nthen above a critical value, which measures the network capacity of packets\ndelivery. We obtain the optimal speed of moving nodes leading to the maximum\nnetwork capacity. We further improve the network capacity by rewiring the fixed\nnodes and by considering the current load of fixed nodes during packets\ntransmission. Our purpose is to optimize the network capacity of hybrid\nnetworks from the perspective of network science, and provide some insights for\nthe construction of future communication infrastructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 12:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

If the market is information efficient, the proposed strategy\nwill mimic the market; otherwise, the strategy will outperform the market. The\nstrategy depends on the selection of a portfolio via Bayesian multiple testing\nmethodologies. We present the \"discrete-mixture prior\" model and the\n\"hierarchical Bayes model with horseshoe prior.\" We define the Oracle set and\nprove that asymptotically the Bayes rule attains the risk of Bayes Oracle up to\n$O(1)$. Our proposed Bayes Oracle test guarantees statistical power by\nproviding the upper bound of the type-II error. Simulation study indicates that\nthe proposed Bayes oracle test is suitable for the efficient market with few\nstocks inefficiently priced. However, as the model becomes dense, i.e., the\nmarket is highly inefficient, one should not use the Bayes oracle test. The\nstatistical power of the Bayes Oracle portfolio is uniformly better for the\n$k$-factor model ($k>1$) than the one factor CAPM.

This article\nprovides a general transition and stability theory for the two-layer\nquasi-geostrophic model originally derived by Pedlosky \\cite{ped1970}. We show\nthat the instability and dynamic transition of the basic shear flow occur only\nwhen the Froude number $F>(\\gamma^2+1)/2$, where $\\gamma$ is the weave number\nof lowest zonal harmonic. In this case, we derive a precise critical shear\nvelocity $U_c$ and a dynamic transition number $b$, and we show that the\ndynamic transition and associated flo0w patterns are dictated by the sign of\nthis transition number. In particular, we show that for $b>0$, the system\nundergoes a continuous transition, leading to spatiotemporal flow oscillatory\npatterns as the shear velocity $U$ crosses $U_c$; for $b<0$, the system\nundergoes a jump transition, leading to drastic change and more complex\ntransition patterns in the far field, and to unstable period solutions for\n$U<U_c$. Furthermore, we show that when the wavenumber of the zonal harmonic\n$\\gamma=1$, the transition number $b$ is always positive and the system always\nundergoes a continuous dynamic transition leading spatiotemporal oscillations.\nThis suggests that a continuous transition to spatiotemporal patterns is\npreferable for the shear flow associated with baroclinic instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}
