In such states the\ngenuine entanglement is noticeable solely in correlations between subsets of\nparticles. A straightforward way to obtain such states for odd $N$ is to design\nan `anti-state' in which all correlations between an odd number of observers\nare exactly opposite. Evenly mixing a state with its anti-state then produces a\nmixed state with no $N$-partite correlations, with many of them genuinely\nmultiparty entangled. Intriguingly, all known examples of `entanglement without\ncorrelations' involve an \\emph{odd} number of particles. Here we further\ndevelop the idea of anti-states, thereby shedding light on the different\nproperties of even and odd particle systems. We conjecture that there is no\nanti-state to any pure even-$N$-party entangled state making the simple\nconstruction scheme unfeasable. However, as we prove by construction,\nhigher-rank examples of `entanglement without correlations' for arbitrary even\n$N$ indeed exist. These classes of states exhibit genuine entanglement and even\nviolate an $N$-partite Bell inequality, clearly demonstrating the non-classical\nfeatures of these states as well as showing their applicability for quantum\ncommunication complexity tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

However, their application to very large spatial datasets\npresents numerous challenges such as high-dimensionality data, heterogeneity,\nand high complexity of some algorithms. For instance, some algorithms may have\nlinear complexity but they require the domain knowledge in order to determine\ntheir input parameters. Distributed clustering techniques constitute a very\ngood alternative to the big data challenges (e.g.,Volume, Variety, Veracity,\nand Velocity). Usually these techniques consist of two phases. The first phase\ngenerates local models or patterns and the second one tends to aggregate the\nlocal results to obtain global models. While the first phase can be executed in\nparallel on each site and, therefore, efficient, the aggregation phase is\ncomplex, time consuming and may produce incorrect and ambiguous global clusters\nand therefore incorrect models. In this paper we propose a new distributed\nclustering approach to deal efficiently with both phases, generation of local\nresults and generation of global models by aggregation. For the first phase,\nour approach is capable of analysing the datasets located in each site using\ndifferent clustering techniques. The aggregation phase is designed in such a\nway that the final clusters are compact and accurate while the overall process\nis efficient in time and memory allocation. For the evaluation, we use two\nwell-known clustering algorithms, K-Means and DBSCAN.

The results verify the\nexperimentally observed negative response along the scan in the interstrip gap.\nWhen the laser spot is positioned on the strip p$^+$ implant the negative\nresponse vanishes and the collected charge at the active strip proportionally\nincreases.\n  The simulation results offer a further insight and understanding of the\ninfluence of the oxide charge density in the signal formation. The observed\neffects and details of the detector response for different charge injection\npositions are discussed in the context of Ramo's theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 17:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 03:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

Higgsplosion, the\nfirst mechanism, occurs at some critical energy in the 25 to 10^3 TeV range,\nand leads to an exponentially growing decay rate of highly energetic particles\ninto multiple Higgs bosons. We argue that this a well-controlled\nnon-perturbative phenomenon in the Higgs-sector which involves the final state\nHiggs multiplicities n in the regime n \\lambda >> 1 where \\lambda is the Higgs\nself-coupling. If this mechanism is realised in nature, the cross-sections for\nproducing ultra-high multiplicities of Higgs bosons are likely to become\nobservable and even dominant in this energy range. At the same time, however,\nthe apparent exponential growth of these cross-sections at even higher energies\nwill be tamed and automatically cut-off by a related Higgspersion mechanism. As\na result, and in contrast to previous studies, multi-Higgs production does not\nviolate perturbative unitarity. Building on this approach, we then argue that\nthe effects of Higgsplosion alter quantum corrections from very heavy states to\nthe Higgs boson mass. Above a certain energy, which is much smaller than their\nmasses, these states would rapidly decay into multiple Higgs bosons. The heavy\nstates become unrealised as they decay much faster than they are formed. The\nloop integrals contributing to the Higgs mass will be cut off not by the masses\nof the heavy states, but by the characteristic loop momenta where their decay\nwidths become comparable to their masses. Hence, the cut-off scale would be\nmany orders of magnitude lower than the heavy mass scales themselves, thus\nsuppressing their quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 17:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-17"}

Secondary star\nformation occurs in $\\sim3-5$ Myr, before supernovae, producing uniform iron\nabundances in both populations.

Results are given in $d$ spacetime dimensions. One can distinguish among\ndifferent regimes depending on the relative size between $1/R$ and the typical\natomic bound state energy $m\\alpha^2$. Each regime is characterized by a\nspecific hierarchy of scales and a corresponding tower of EFTs. The short\ndistance regime is characterized by $1/R \\gg m\\alpha^2$ and the LO van der\nWaals potential is the London potential. We compute also NNNLO corrections. In\nthe long distance regime we have $1/R\\ll m\\alpha^2$. In this regime, the van\nder Waals potential contains contact terms, which are parametrically larger\nthan the Casimir-Polder potential that describes the potential at large\ndistances. In the EFT the Casimir-Polder potential counts as a NNNLO effect. In\nthe intermediate distance regime, $1/R\\sim m\\alpha^2$, a significantly more\ncomplex potential is obtained which we compare with the two previous limiting\ncases. We conclude commenting on the hadronic van der Waals case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 09:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

This approximation is a crucial step in the method proposed by\nBackus (1962), which is widely used in studying wave propagation in layered\nHookean solids. According to this approximation, the average of the product of\na rapidly varying function and a slowly varying function is approximately equal\nto the product of the averages of those two functions.\n  Considering that the rapidly varying function represents the mechanical\nproperties of layers, we express it as a step function. The slowly varying\nfunction is continuous, since it represents the components of the stress or\nstrain tensors. In this paper, beyond the upper bound of the error for that\napproximation, which is formulated by Bos et al. (2017), we provide a\nstatistical analysis of the approximation by allowing the function values to be\nsampled from general distributions.\n  Even though, according to the upper bound, Backus (1962) averaging might not\nappear as a viable approach, we show that$-$for cases representative of\nphysical scenarios modelled by such an averaging$-$the approximation is\ntypically quite good. We identify the cases for which there can be a\ndeterioration in its efficacy.\n  In particular, we examine a special case for which the approximation results\nin spurious values. However, such a case$-$though physically realizable$-$is\nnot likely to appear in seismology, where Backus (1962) averaging is commonly\nused. Yet, such values might occur in material sciences, in general, for which\nBackus (1962) averaging is also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 14:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

Recent\napproaches have applied the concept of 'guilty by association' to investigate\nthe association between a disease phenotype and its causative genes, which\nmeans that candidate genes with similar characteristics as known disease genes\nare more likely to be associated with diseases. However, due to the imbalance\nissues (few genes are experimentally confirmed as disease related genes within\nhuman genome) in disease gene identification, semi-supervised approaches, like\nlabel propagation approaches and positive-unlabeled learning, are used to\nidentify candidate disease genes via making use of unknown genes for training -\ntypically in the scenario of a small amount of confirmed disease genes (labeled\ndata) with a large amount of unknown genome (unlabeled data).

An exact simulation\nalgorithm has output according to an input distribution $\\pi$. Perfect\nsimulations are a subclass of exact simulations where recursion is used either\nexplicitly or implicitly. The FTPS gives two simple criteria that, when\nsatisfied, give a correct perfect simulation algorithm. First the algorithm\nmust terminate in finite time with probability 1. Second, the algorithm must be\nlocally correct in the sense that the algorithm can be proved correct given the\nassumption that any recursive call used returns an output from the correct\ndistribution. This simple idea is surprisingly powerful. Like other general\ntechniques such as Metropolis-Hastings for approximate simulation, the FTPS\nallows for the flexible construction of existing and new perfect simulation\nprotocols. This theorem can be used to verify the correctness of many perfect\nsimulation protocols, including Acceptance Rejection, Coupling From the Past,\nand Recursive Bernoulli factories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 22:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

However, this approach\nposes privacy concerns. Especially with popular cloud services, the control\nover the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not\nshared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not\nnecessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers,\nand cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end\nthe relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a\nspecial kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any\nthird party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance.\nAlthough this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over\n30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\nscheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data,\nwas introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major\nachievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs\nto be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. First, we\npresent the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially\nHomomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which\nare important pillars of achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have\nbecome the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes are presented. Furthermore,\nthe implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also\nsurveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is\nintended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and\npractitioners interested in knowing, applying, as well as extending the state\nof the art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 00:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 03:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

Prior theory indicates that such differing rates\nshould influence the relative speed of diffusion of the products embodying the\ndifferent technologies since improvement in performance during the diffusion\nprocess increases the desirability of the product diffusing. However, there has\nnot been a broad empirical attempt to examine this effect and to clarify the\nunderlying cause. Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical basis and\nfocuses upon empirical tests of this effect across multiple products and their\nunderlying technologies. The results for 18 different diffusing products show\nthe expected relationship-faster diffusion for products based on more rapidly\nimproving technological domains- between technological improvement and\ndiffusion with strong statistical significance. The empirical examination also\ndemonstrates that technological improvement does not slow down in the latter\nparts of diffusion when penetration does slow down. This finding indicates that\ndiffusion slow down in the latter stages is due to market saturation effects\nand is not due to slowdown of performance improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 02:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 16:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 04:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

Considering the\nstrictly limited resources on satellites, to improve hardware efficiency of\nlarge-scale spaceborne antenna arrays, in this work inspired by the idea of\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) we design a series of non-orthogonal\nsignature codes for different antenna elements by Cyclically Shifting an\nm-Sequence (CSmS) with different offsets named as CSmS-NOMA signaling.

Hence it is much more efficient than the existing fully\northogonal schemes. In order to evaluate the achievable calibration accuracy, a\nunified theoretical framework is developed based on which the relationship\nbetween calibration accuracy and signal to noise ratio (SNR) has been clearly\nrevealed. Furthermore, a hardware experiment platform is also built to assess\nthe theoretical work.

In particular, implementing\nmassive MIMO in the digital domain requires hundreds of RF chains matching the\nnumber of antennas. Furthermore, designing these components to operate at the\nmmWave frequencies is challenging and costly. These motivated the recent\ndevelopment of hybrid-beamforming where MIMO processing is divided for separate\nimplementation in the analog and digital domains, called the analog and digital\nbeamforming, respectively. Analog beamforming using a phase array introduces\nuni-modulus constraints on the beamforming coefficients, rendering the\nconventional MIMO techniques unsuitable and call for new designs. In this\npaper, we present a systematic design framework for hybrid beamforming for\nmulti-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems over mmWave channels characterized by\nsparse propagation paths. The framework relies on the decomposition of analog\nbeamforming vectors and path observation vectors into Kronecker products of\nfactors being uni-modulus vectors. Exploiting properties of Kronecker mixed\nproducts, different factors of the analog beamformer are designed for either\nnulling interference paths or coherently combining data paths. Furthermore, a\nchannel estimation scheme is designed for enabling the proposed hybrid\nbeamforming. The scheme estimates the AoA of data and interference paths by\nanalog beam scanning and data-path gains by analog beam steering. The\nperformance of the channel estimation scheme is analyzed. In particular, the\nAoA spectrum resulting from beam scanning, which displays the magnitude\ndistribution of paths over the AoA range, is derived in closed-form. It is\nshown that the inter-cell interference level diminishes inversely with the\narray size, the square root of pilot sequence length and the spatial separation\nbetween paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 03:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

Niobium-doped strontium\ntitanate (SrTi1-xNbxO3) is one of the most promising thermoelectric material\ncandidates, particularly as it poses a much lesser environmental risk in\ncomparison to materials based on heavy metal elements. Two-dimensional electron\nconfinement, e.g. through the formation of superlattices or two-dimensional\nelectron gases, is recognized as an effective strategy to improve the\nthermoelectric performance of SrTi1-xNbxO3. Although electron confinement is\nclosely related to the electronic structure, the fundamental electronic phase\nbehavior of the SrTi1-xNbxO3 solid solution system has yet to be\ncomprehensively investigated. Here, we present a thermoelectric phase diagram\nfor the SrTi1-xNbxO3 (0.05 =< x =< 1) solid solution system, which we derived\nfrom the characterization of epitaxial films. We observed two thermoelectric\nphase boundaries in the system, which originate from the step-like decrease in\ncarrier effective mass at x ~ 0.3, and from a local minimum in carrier\nrelaxation time at x ~ 0.5. The origins of these phase boundaries are\nconsidered to be related to isovalent/heterovalent B-site substitution:\nparabolic Ti 3d orbitals dominate electron conduction for compositions with x <\n0.3, whereas the Nb 4d orbital dominates when x > 0.3. At x ~ 0.5, a tetragonal\ndistortion of the lattice, in which the B-site is composed of Ti4+ and Nb4+\nions, leads to the formation of tail-like impurity bands, which maximizes the\nelectron scattering. These results provide a foundation for further research\ninto improving the thermoelectric performance of SrTi1-xNbxO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 04:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

The proposed framework enables the small base stations (SBSs)\nto jointly decide on forming the multi-hop, mmW links over backhaul\ninfrastructure that belongs to multiple, independent MNOs, while properly\nallocating resources across those links. In this regard, the problem is\naddressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to\ntwo, highly inter-related stages: a multi-hop network formation stage and a\nresource management stage. One unique feature of this framework is that it\njointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors\nduring both network formation and resource management. The multi-hop network\nformation stage is formulated as a one-to-many matching game which is solved\nusing a novel algorithm, that builds on the so-called deferred acceptance\nalgorithm and is shown to yield a stable and Pareto optimal multi-hop mmW\nbackhaul network. Then, a one-to-many matching game is formulated to enable\nproper resource allocation across the formed multi-hop network. This game is\nthen shown to exhibit peer effects and, as such, a novel algorithm is developed\nto find a stable and optimal resource management solution that can properly\ncope with these peer effects. Simulation results show that the proposed\nframework yields substantial gains, in terms of the average sum rate, reaching\nup to 27% and 54%, respectively, compared to a non-cooperative scheme in which\ninter-operator sharing is not allowed and a random allocation approach. The\nresults also show that our framework provides insights on how to manage pricing\nand the cost of the cooperative mmW backhaul network for the MNOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 05:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 22:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

Such large depths pose formidable computational challenges in\ntraining and operating the network. It is therefore important to understand how\nfast the energy contained in the propagated signals (a.k.a. feature maps)\ndecays across layers. In addition, it is desirable that the feature extractor\ngenerated by the network be informative in the sense of the only signal mapping\nto the all-zeros feature vector being the zero input signal. This \"trivial\nnull-set\" property can be accomplished by asking for \"energy conservation\" in\nthe sense of the energy in the feature vector being proportional to that of the\ncorresponding input signal. This paper establishes conditions for energy\nconservation (and thus for a trivial null-set) for a wide class of deep\nconvolutional neural network-based feature extractors and characterizes\ncorresponding feature map energy decay rates.

Meanwhile, with the rapid\ngrowth of traffic, network congestion could seriously degrade user experiences\nand influence providers' utility. To optimize profit and social welfare, APs\nand regulators need to design appropriate pricing strategies and regulatory\npolicies that take the effects of network congestion into consideration. In\nthis paper, we model two-sided networks under which users' traffic demands are\ninfluenced by exogenous pricing and endogenous congestion parameters and derive\nthe system congestion under an equilibrium. We characterize the structures and\nsensitivities of profit- and welfare-optimal two-sided pricing schemes and\nreveal that 1) the elasticity of system throughput plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the structures of optimal pricing, 2) the changes of optimal\npricing under varying AP's capacity and users' congestion sensitivity are\nlargely driven by the type of data traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) APs and\nregulators will be incentivized to shift from one-sided to two-sided pricing\nwhen APs' capacities and user demand for video traffic grow.

We calculate the scaling dimensions of the two and\nthree point functions in the noncommutative CQM which are shown to be deformed.\nThe $AdS_2/CFT_1$ duality for the CQM suggests that the corresponding\ncorrelation functions in the holographic duals are modified. In addition, the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman bound also picks up a noncommutative correction. The\nstrongly attractive regime of a canonical model of the CQM exhibit quantum\ninstability. We show that the noncommutativity softens this singular behaviour\nand its implications for the corresponding holographic duals are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 09:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 10:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 05:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

There has been a dispute about the character and the\ncompactness of the object: interpreting it as either a gas cloud or a\ndust-enshrouded star. A recent analysis of polarimetry data in $K_{\\rm s}$-band\n($2.2\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$) allows us to put further constraints on the geometry of\nthe DSO. The purpose of this paper is to constrain the nature and the geometry\nof the DSO. We compare 3D radiative transfer models of the DSO with the NIR\ncontinuum data including polarimetry. In the analysis, we use basic dust\ncontinuum radiative transfer theory implemented in the 3D Monte Carlo code\nHyperion. Moreover, we implement analytical results of the two-body problem\nmechanics and the theory of non-thermal processes. We present a composite model\nof the DSO -- a dust-enshrouded star that consists of a stellar source, dusty,\noptically thick envelope, bipolar cavities, and a bow shock. This scheme can\nmatch the NIR total as well as polarized properties of the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED). The SED may be also explained in theory by a young\npulsar wind nebula that typically exhibits a large linear polarization degree\ndue to magnetospheric synchrotron emission. The analysis of NIR polarimetry\ndata combined with the radiative transfer modelling shows that the DSO is a\npeculiar source of compact nature in the S cluster $(r \\lesssim 0.04\\,{\\rm\npc})$. It is most probably a young stellar object embedded in a non-spherical\ndusty envelope, whose components include optically thick dusty envelope,\nbipolar cavities, and a bow shock.

The nodal ring here is distinct from the previously studied ones\nin that its formation requires four entangled bands, not just two as in\nprevious cases, hence it is termed as a four-band nodal ring (FNR). Remarkably,\nwe show that FNR features Dirac-cone-like surface states, in contrast to the\nusual drumhead surface states for two-band nodal rings. Due to the presence of\ninversion symmetry, the TNP here is also different from those discussed\npreviously in inversion-asymmetric systems. Especially, when spin-orbit\ncoupling is included, the TNP here transforms into a novel Dirac point that is\nclose to the borderline between the type-I and type-II Dirac point categories.\nWe discuss their respective symmetry protections, and construct effective\nmodels for their characterization. The large linear energy range (> 2 eV) in\nthese materials should facilitate the experimental detection of the signatures\nof these nontrivial band crossings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 11:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

In the Big Data setting, analysts are faced with very large\nnumbers of observations as well as data that arrive as a stream, both of which\nare phenomena that many traditional statistical techniques are unable to\ncontend with. Unfortunately, many of these traditional techniques are useful\nand cannot be discarded. One such technique is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test\nfor goodness-of-fit (GoF). A Big Data and stream-appropriate KS-type test is\nderived via the chunked-and-averaged (CA) estimator paradigm. The new test is\ntermed the CAKS GoF test. The CAKS test statistic is proved to be\nasymptotically normal, allowing for the large sample testing of GoF.\nFurthermore, theoretical results demonstrate that the CAKS test is consistent\nagainst both fixed alternatives, where the null and the true data generating\ndistribution are a fixed distance apart, and alternatives that approach the\nnull at a slow enough rate. Numerical results demonstrate that the CAKS test is\neffective in identifying deviation in the distribution with respect to changes\nin mean, variance, and shape. Furthermore, it is found that the CAKS test is\nfaster than the KS test, for large numbers of observation, and can be applied\nto sample sizes of 10^{9} and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 12:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

In this work, both the\ngeneration and absorption of these optically excited spin currents are\ninvestigated. This is done using non-collinear magnetic bilayers, i.e. two FM\nlayers separated by a conductive spacer. Spin currents are generated in a Co/Ni\nmultilayer with out-of-plane (OOP) anisotropy, and absorbed by a Co layer with\nan in-plane (IP) anisotropy.

Second, this work proceeds one step further than recent part-based\nmodels (PBM), focusing on how to learn parts without using any labeled data.\nInstead of learning a set of parts per class, as generally done in the PBM\nliterature, the proposed approach both constructs a partition of a given set of\nimages into visually similar groups, and subsequently learn a set of\ndiscriminative parts per group in a fully unsupervised fashion.

Methods: We made use of the European VLBI\nNetwork (EVN) to image the 6.7GHz CH3OH maser emission towards Cepheus A HW2\nwith 4.5 milli-arcsecond resolution (3au). We observed at three epochs spaced\nby one year between 2013 and 2015. During the last epoch, on mid-march 2015, we\nbenefited from the new deployed Sardinia Radio Telescope. Results: We show that\nthe CH3OH velocity vectors lie on a preferential plane for the gas motion with\nonly small deviations of 12+/-9 degrees away from the plane. This plane is\noriented at a position angle of 134 degrees east of north, and inclined by 26\ndegrees with the line-of-sight, closely matching the orientation of the\ndisk-like structure previously reported by Patel et al.(2005). Knowing the\norientation of the equatorial plane, we can reconstruct a face-on view of the\nCH3OH gas kinematics onto the plane. CH3OH maser emission is detected within a\nradius of 900au from HW2, and down to a radius of about 300au, the latter\ncoincident with the extent of the dust emission at 0.9mm. The velocity field is\ndominated by an infall component of about 2km/s down to a radius of 300au,\nwhere a rotational component of 4km/s becomes dominant.

For a given PSD, model surfaces\nwith the same roughness as the actual surface are constructed by preserving the\nPSD amplitudes and assigning a random phase to each spectral component. Rays\nrepresenting the incident wave are reflected from the model surface and\nprojected onto a flat plane, which is the first order approximation of the\nmodel surface, as outgoing rays and corrected for phase delays. The projected\noutgoing rays are then corrected for wave densities and redistributed onto an\nuniform grid where the model surface is constructed.

However, video face recognition (VFR) is still an ongoing task due to\nvarious illumination, low-resolution, pose variations and motion blur. Most\nexisting CNN-based VFR methods only obtain a feature vector from a single image\nand simply aggregate the features in a video, which less consider the\ncorrelations of face images in one video. In this paper, we propose a novel\nAttention-Set based Metric Learning (ASML) method to measure the statistical\ncharacteristics of image sets. It is a promising and generalized extension of\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy with memory attention weighting. First, we define an\neffective distance metric on image sets, which explicitly minimizes the\nintra-set distance and maximizes the inter-set distance simultaneously. Second,\ninspired by Neural Turing Machine, a Memory Attention Weighting is proposed to\nadapt set-aware global contents. Then ASML is naturally integrated into CNNs,\nresulting in an end-to-end learning scheme.

The present design is suitable to do measurement on\nrectangular bar sample by using conventional four-probe dc method. A small\nheater is made on the sample mounting copper block to achieve the desired\ntemperature. Heat loss from sample holder is minimize by using very low thermal\nconductive insulator block. This unique design of heater and minimized heat\nloss from sample platform provide uniform sample temperature and also have very\ngood thermal stability during the measurement. The electrical contacts of\ncurrent leads and potential probes on the sample are done by using very thin\n(42 SWG) copper wires and high temperature silver paste. The use of limited\ncomponents and small heater design make present instrument very simple, light\nweight, easy to sample mount, small in size, and low cost. To calibrate the\ninstrument pure nickel sample was used, and two other materials\nLa$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) and LaCoO$_{3}$ (LCO) were also\ncharacterized to demonstrate the accuracy of this set-up. $\\rho$(T) behavior on\nthese samples were found to be in good agreement with the reported data. The\nmetal-insulator transition for LSMO (T$_{MI}$ = $\\sim$358 K) and the\ninsulator-metal transition for LCO (T$_{IM}$ = $\\sim$540 K) were clearly\nobserved and these transitions temperature were also consistent with those\nreported in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 09:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

First, we review network order\nparameters previously introduced and reveal several shortcomings: none of the\nintroduced order parameters capture all transitions from incoherence over phase\nlocking to full synchrony for arbitrary, finite networks. We then introduce an\nalternative, universal order parameter that accurately tracks the degree of\npartial phase locking and synchronization, adapting the traditional definition\nto account for the network topology and its influence on the phase coherence of\nthe oscillators. We rigorously proof that this order parameter is strictly\nmonotonously increasing with the coupling strength in the phase locked state,\ndirectly reflecting the dynamic stability of the network. Furthermore, it\nindicates the onset of full phase locking by a diverging slope at the critical\ncoupling strength. The order parameter may find applications across systems\nwhere different types of synchrony are possible, including biological networks\nand power grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 15:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

A simple stage\npure CO 2 cycle is used as reference, with fixed external conditions.

The composite is assumed to occupy a\nfinite, symmetric domain which is discretized into a double array of subcells.\nThe governing equations, with the interfacial and boundary conditions, are\nsatisfied in the integral sense.
