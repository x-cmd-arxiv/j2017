First the ideal beampattern is derived via Parseval\nIdentity, based on which a beamforming design problem is formulated to minimize\nthe gap with the idea beampattern. The problem is transformable to a\nmulticonvex one and an iterative optimization algorithm is used to obtain the\nfull-digital beamformer. In addition, with the help of same beampattern\ntheorem, the power amplifier (PA) efficiency of the beamformer is improved with\nunchanged beampattern.

This phenomenon persists through numerous simplifications of the\nequation, including a quasilinear approximation as well as a four-mode\ntruncation. It is shown that the use of an appropriate adiabatic electron\nresponse, for which the electrons are not affected by the flux-averaged\npotential, results in an $\\boldsymbol{E}\\boldsymbol{\\times}\\boldsymbol{B}$\nnonlinearity that can efficiently transfer energy nonlocally to length scales\non the order of the sound radius. The size of the shift for the nonlinear\nsystem is heuristically calculated and found to be in excellent agreement with\nnumerical solutions. The existence of the Dimits shift for this system is then\nunderstood as an ability of the unstable primary modes to efficiently couple to\nstable modes at smaller scales, and the shift ends when these stable modes\neventually destabilize as the density gradient is increased. This nonlocal\nmechanism of energy transfer is argued to be generically important even for\nmore physically complete systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 16:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 12:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 04:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-15"}

It is well known that a\nlower bound of the sectional curvature of $(M,g)$ is again a bound for the\ncurvature of the quotient space, which is an Alexandrov space of curvature\nbounded below. Moreover, the analogous stability property holds for metric\nfoliations and submersions.\n  The goal of the paper is to prove the corresponding stability properties for\nsynthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds. Specifically, we show that such\nstability holds for quotients of $\\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-spaces, under\nisomorphic compact group actions and more generally under metric-measure\nfoliations and submetries. An $\\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-space is a metric measure\nspace with an upper dimension bound $N$ and weighted Ricci curvature bounded\nbelow by $K$ in a generalized sense. In particular, this shows that if $(M,g)$\nhas Ricci curvature bounded below by $K\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and dimension $N$, then\nthe quotient space is an $\\mathsf{RCD}^{*}(K,N)$-space.

The degree-bounded Steiner tree problem { which asks for a subgraph\nwith minimum degree that connects a given set of vertices { is perhaps one of\nthe most representative problems in this class. This paper deals with its\nwell-studied generalization called the degree-bounded Steiner forest problem\nwhere the connectivity demands are represented by vertex pairs that need to be\nindividually connected. In the classical online model, the input graph is given\nonline but the demand pairs arrive sequentially in online steps. The selected\nsubgraph starts off as the empty subgraph, but has to be augmented to satisfy\nthe new connectivity constraint in each online step. The goal is to be\ncompetitive against an adversary that knows the input in advance. We design a\nsimple greedy-like algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of O(log n)\nwhere n is the number of vertices. We show that no (randomized) algorithm can\nachieve a (multiplicative) competitive ratio o(log n); thus our result is\nasymptotically tight. We further show strong hardness results for the group\nSteiner tree and the edge-weighted variants of degree-bounded connectivity\nproblems. Fourer and Raghavachari resolved the online variant of degree-bounded\nSteiner forest in their paper in SODA'92. Since then, the natural family of\ndegree-bounded network design problems has been extensively studied in the\nliterature resulting in the development of many interesting tools and numerous\npapers on the topic.

The final step, referred to as fine phasing, calls for a high\nsensitivity wavefront sensing and control system in a diffraction-limited\nregime to achieve segment alignment with nanometric accuracy. In this context,\nZernike wavefront sensors represent promising options for such a calibration. A\nconcept called the Zernike unit for segment phasing (ZEUS) was previously\ndeveloped for ground-based applications to operate under seeing-limited images.\nSuch a concept is, however, not suitable for fine cophasing with\ndiffraction-limited images. We revisit ZELDA, a Zernike sensor that was\ndeveloped for the measurement of residual aberrations in exoplanet direct\nimagers, to measure segment piston, tip, and tilt in the diffraction-limited\nregime. We introduce a novel analysis scheme of the sensor signal that relies\non piston, tip, and tilt estimators for each segment, and provide probabilistic\ninsights to predict the success of a closed-loop correction as a function of\nthe initial wavefront error. The sensor unambiguously and simultaneously\nretrieves segment piston and tip-tilt misalignment. Our scheme allows for\ncorrection of these errors in closed-loop operation down to nearly zero\nresiduals in a few iterations. This sensor also shows low sensitivity to\nmisalignment of its parts and high ability for operation with a relatively\nbright natural guide star.

The Urbach tail observed in InGaN alloy quantum wells\nof solar cells and LEDs by biased photocurrent spectroscopy is shown to be\ncharacteristic of the ternary alloy disorder. The broadening of the absorption\nedge observed for quantum wells emitting from violet to green (indium content\nranging from 0 to 28\\%) corresponds to a typical Urbach energy of 20~meV. A 3D\nabsorption model is developed based on a recent theory of disorder-induced\nlocalization which provides the effective potential seen by the localized\ncarriers without having to resort to the solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nin a disordered potential. This model incorporating compositional disorder\naccounts well for the experimental broadening of the Urbach tail of the\nabsorption edge. For energies below the Urbach tail of the InGaN quantum wells,\ntype-II well-to-barrier transitions are observed and modeled. This contribution\nto the below bandgap absorption is particularly efficient in near-UV emitting\nquantum wells. When reverse biasing the device, the well-to-barrier below\nbandgap absorption exhibits a red shift, while the Urbach tail corresponding to\nthe absorption within the quantum wells is blue shifted, due to the partial\ncompensation of the internal piezoelectric fields by the external bias. The\ngood agreement between the measured Urbach tail and its modeling by the new\nlocalization theory demonstrates the applicability of the latter to\ncompositional disorder effects in nitride semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

Recently, it has been proposed that Hungaria asteroids are a\nsecularly declining population that may be related to the Late Heavy\nBombardment (LHB) impactors (\\'Cuk et al. 2012, Bottke et al. 2012). While\n\\'Cuk et al. (2012) and Bottke et al.

Here we find that the stability of Hungarias\nis strongly dependent on the evolution of the eccentricity of Mars, which is\nchaotic and unpredictable on Gyr timescales. We find that the high Martian\neccentricity chiefly affects Hungarias through close approaches with Mars,\nrather than planetary secular modes. However, current minimum perihelia of\nHungarias (over Myr timescales) are not diagnostic of their long-term stability\ndue to a number of secular and mean motion resonances affecting the Hungaria\nregion (Milani et al. 2010). We conclude that planetary chaos makes it\nimpossible to determine the effective lifetimes of observed Hungarias.\nFurthermore, long-term changes of Martian eccentricity could lead to variable\nHungaria loss over time. We speculate that some of the most stable Hungarias\nmay have been placed in their present orbit when the eccentricity of Mars was\nsignificantly higher than today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 22:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Novelty search has shown promise in overcoming deception by collecting\ndiverse stepping stones, and several algorithms have been proposed that combine\nnovelty with a more traditional fitness measure to refocus search and help\nnovelty search scale to more complex domains. However, combinations of novelty\nand fitness do not necessarily preserve the stepping stone discovery that\nnovelty search affords. In several existing methods, competition between\nsolutions can lead to an unintended loss of diversity. Behavior domination\ndefines a class of algorithms that avoid this problem, while inheriting\ntheoretical guarantees from multiobjective optimization. Several existing\nalgorithms are shown to be in this class, and a new algorithm is introduced\nbased on fast non-dominated sorting. Experimental results show that this\nalgorithm outperforms existing approaches in domains that contain useful\nstepping stones, and its advantage is sustained with scale.

These\nalgorithms demonstrate optimal/efficient performance and have lower complexity\ncompared to the state-of-the-art.

While this model is simplistic, and most likely does not accurately\nrepresent reality, the mathematical modeling of cyclic behavior is attractive\nto economists. Cycles are at the heart of many macroeconomic theories and a\nmathematical model allows for future predictions to be made. Thus, over the\nyears, it has been updated and extended. Ishiyama (2001) takes one such\napproach at updating the Goodwin model. He considers two countries engaged in\nhorizontal trade. Through the lens of sheaf theory, this paper describes\nIshiyama's complex model through various dependency diagrams. Sheaves allow us\nto encode all information reflected in the equations of the model into a\ndependency diagram, yielding a visual representation of the variable\nrelationship structure. These dependency diagrams are powerful, and much of the\nanalysis typically done on equations can be done on the diagrams themselves.\nFurther, these dependency diagrams allow for a new way to consider complex\nmodels, such as Ishiyama's model. More specifically, it also allows us to\nanalyze his system in a way not previously done. New questions regarding local\nsections of this sheaf and their possible extensions to global sections are\nconsidered. These questions lend themselves to unique analysis about the\nsystem. They also provide a practical way to check the accuracy of Ishiyama's\nmodel, which has many obvious benefits. It is meaningful to conduct this\napproach to a system of equations given its novelty, its applicability, and its\nimportance for modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 02:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

This study\nprovides a solid theoretical deduction regarding the isotope fractionation\ntaking place during fragmentation in EI-MS. Both intermolecular and\nintramolecular isotope fractionations present in dehalogenation processes,\ninfluencing the isotope ratios of detected ions. In general, intermolecular\nisotope fractionation positively affects the isotope ratios of precursor ions\nbut inversely impacts those of the corresponding product ions. Molecular ions\nare normally affected by one type of intermolecular isotope fractionation only\nduring the dehalogenation from parent ions to their product ions. While product\nions can be impacted by two types of intermolecular isotope fractionations,\nnamely, the inverse intermolecular isotope fractionation from parent ions to\ntheir product ions and the normal intermolecular isotope fractionation from the\nproduct ions to their further dehalogenated product ions. For a compound having\nposition-distinct isotope ratios, if dehalogenation reacts on only one\nposition, the intermolecular isotope fractionation taking palace in this\nreaction is normal for the detected precursor ion, but ineffective to the\nproduct ion isotope ratio in comparison with that of the total precursor ions.\nOn the other hand, intramolecular isotope fractionation positively affects the\nisotope ratios of product ions only.

RSBT treatment planning has more degrees\nof freedom than conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the\naddition of emission direction, and this necessitates a fast optimization\ntechnique to enable clinical usage. // Methods: The multi-helix RSBT (H-RSBT)\ndelivery technique was considered with five representative cervical cancer\npatients. Treatment plans were generated for all patients using the POGS method\nand the previously considered commercial solver IBM CPLEX. The rectum, bladder,\nsigmoid, high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), and HR-CTV boundary were\nthe structures considered in our optimization problem, called the asymmetric\ndose-volume optimization with smoothness control. Dose calculation resolution\nwas 1x1x3 mm^3 for all cases. The H-RSBT applicator has 6 helices, with 33.3 mm\nof translation along the applicator per helical rotation and 1.7 mm spacing\nbetween dwell positions, yielding 17.5 degree emission angle spacing per 5 mm\nalong the applicator.// Results: For each patient, HR-CTV D90, HR-CTV D100,\nrectum D2cc, sigmoid D2cc, and bladder D2cc matched within 1% for CPLEX and\nPOGS.

Over all patients, total optimization times\nwere 32.1-65.4 seconds for CPLEX and 2.1-3.9 seconds for POGS. // Conclusions:\nPOGS substantially reduced treatment plan optimization time around 18 times for\nRSBT with similar HR-CTV D90, OAR D2cc values, and EQD2 figure relative to\nCPLEX, which is significant progress toward clinical translation of RSBT.

Fontana succeeded in drawing the most accurate maps of\nthe Moon's surface of his time, which were to become popular through a number\nof publications spread all over Europe but without acknowledging the author. At\nthe end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to\ndefend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observational campaign,\nwhose results he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque\nrerum Observationis (1646), the only book he left to posterity. Fontana\nobserved the Moon's main craters, as the crater Tycho which he named Fons\nMajor, their radial patterns and the change in their positions due to the\nMoon's motions. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together\nwith the Jesuit G.B. Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana\nobserved the two - and occasionally three - major bands of Jupiter, and\ninferred the rotation movement of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,\narguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close\nto revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of\nadditional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that\nlasted more than a hundred years. In several places of his book Fontana\nrepeatedly claimed to have conceived the first positive eyepiece in 1608,\nproviding a declaration by Zupus to have used his telescope since 1614. This\ndeclaration is still the oldest record mentioning such a device.

DG Tau is a low-mass pre-main sequence star, whose strongly\naccreting protoplanetary disk exhibits a so-far enigmatic behavior: its\nmid-infrared thermal emission is strongly time-variable, even turning the 10\n$\\mu$m silicate feature from emission to absorption temporarily. Aims. We look\nfor the reason for the spectral variability at high spatial resolution and at\nmultiple epochs. Methods. We study the temporal variability of the mid-infrared\ninterferometric signal, observed with the VLTI/MIDI instrument at six epochs\nbetween 2011 and 2014. We fit a geometric disk model to the observed\ninterferometric signal to obtain spatial information about the disk. We also\nmodel the mid-infrared spectra by template fitting to characterize the profile\nand time dependence of the silicate emission. We use physically motivated\nradiative transfer modeling to interpret the mid-infrared interferometric\nspectra. Results. The inner disk (r<1-3 au) spectra exhibit a 10 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature related to amorphous silicate grains. The outer disk (r>1-3\nau) spectra show a crystalline silicate feature in emission, similar to the\nspectra of comet Hale-Bopp. The striking difference between the inner and outer\ndisk spectral feature is highly unusual among T Tauri stars. The mid-infrared\nvariability is dominated by the outer disk. The strength of the silicate\nfeature changed by more than a factor of two. Between 2011 and 2014 the\nhalf-light radius of the mid-infrared-emitting region decreased from 1.15 to\n0.7 au. Conclusions. For the origin of the absorption we discuss four possible\nexplanations: a cold obscuring envelope, an accretion heated inner disk, a\ntemperature inversion on the disk surface and a misaligned inner geometry. The\nsilicate emission in the outer disk can be explained by dusty material high\nabove the disk plane, whose mass can change with time, possibly due to\nturbulence in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 10:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

The existence of such a maximum observable length scale implies a\nmodification of the quantum uncertainty principle. Thus due to non-locality of\nquantum mechanics, the global properties of the Universe could produce a\nsignature on the behaviour of local quantum systems. A Generalized Uncertainty\nPrinciple (GUP) that is consistent with the existence of such a maximum\nobservable length scale $l_{max}$ is $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\;\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha \\Delta x^2}$ where $\\alpha =\nl_{max}^{-2}\\simeq (H_0/c)^2$ ($H_0$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the\nspeed of light).

The feature set includes stationary\nfeatures that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of\ninter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in\nmAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also\nincludes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.\n  Conclusions: NEURAL provides a common platform for quantitative analysis of\nneonatal EEG.

One of the fundamental challenges in implementing\nC-RAN is the huge data rate required for fronthauling. To address this issue,\nwe employ hybrid radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) systems for the\nfronthaul links as they benefit from both the large data rates of FSO links and\nthe reliability of RF links. To efficiently exploit the fronthaul capacity, the\nRUs employ vector quantization to jointly compress the signals received at\ntheir antennas. Moreover, due to the limited available RF spectrum, we assume\nthat the RF multiple-access and fronthaul links employ the same RF resources.\nThereby, we propose an adaptive protocol which allocates transmission time to\nthe RF multiple-access and fronthaul links in a time division duplex (TDD)\nmanner and optimizes the quantization noise covariance matrix at each RU such\nthat the sum rate is maximized. Our simulation results reveal that a\nconsiderable gain in terms of sum rate can be achieved by the proposed protocol\nin comparison with benchmark schemes from the literature, especially when the\nFSO links experience unfavorable atmospheric conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 12:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

This paper presents a new variant of the\nwell-known VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) embedding technique\nwhich accounts, at a certain degree, for the location of features. The driving\nmotivation comes from the observation that, usually, the most interesting part\nof an image (e.g., the landmark to be recognized) is almost at the center of\nthe image, while the features at the borders are irrelevant features which do\nno depend on the landmark. The proposed variant, called locVLAD (location-aware\nVLAD), computes the mean of the two global descriptors: the VLAD executed on\nthe entire original image, and the one computed on a cropped image which\nremoves a certain percentage of the image borders. This simple variant shows an\naccuracy greater than the existing state-of-the-art approach.

In particular, we can use and construct\nobjects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types.\nIn this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in\nhomotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The\nclassical definition of RP(n), as the quotient space identifying antipodal\npoints of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory.\nInstead, we define RP(n) by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological\nbundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP(-1) to be the empty\ntype. In the inductive step, we take RP(n+1) to be the mapping cone of the\nprojection map of the tautological bundle of RP(n), and we use its universal\nproperty and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RP(n+1).\n  By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RP(n) is the\nn-sphere, we retrieve the classical description of RP(n+1) as RP(n) with an\n(n+1)-cell attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space,\ndefined as the sequential colimit of the RP(n) with the canonical inclusion\nmaps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z,1), which here arises\nas the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the\ninfinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which\none can think of as synthetic line bundles.\n  These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of\nhomotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy\ntheoretic ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

This\nleads to peculiar gravitational-wave signatures and distribution in the\nspin-mass plane, which in turn can impose stringent constraints on ultralight\nfields. Here, we demonstrate that there is an analogous spindown effect for\nconducting stars. We show that rotating stars amplify low frequency\nelectromagnetic waves, and that this effect is largest when the time scale for\nconduction within the star is of the order of a light crossing time. This has\ninteresting consequences for dark photons, as massive dark photons would cause\nstars to spin down due to superradiant instabilities. The time scale of the\nspindown depends on the mass of the dark photon, and on the rotation rate,\ncompactness, and conductivity of the star. Existing measurements of the\nspindown rate of pulsars place direct constraints on models of dark sectors.\nOur analysis suggests that dark photons of mass $m_V \\sim 10^{-12}$ eV are\nexcluded by pulsar-timing observations. These constraints also exclude\nsuperradiant instabilities triggered by dark photons as an explanation for the\nspin limit of observed pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

With the entire capture of the amplitude and phase of the\nsignals using coherent optical detection, the powerful compensation and\neffective mitigation of the transmission impairments can be implemented using\nthe digital signal processing in electrical domain. This becomes one of the\nmost promising techniques for next-generation optical communication networks to\nachieve a performance close to the Shannon capacity limit. This chapter will\nfocus on the introduction and investigation of digital signal processing\nemployed for channel impairments compensation based on the coherent detection\nof optical signals, to provide a roadmap for the design and implementation of\nrealtime optical fiber communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}
