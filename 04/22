Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult\nto reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input\ncomplexity. In order to address these issues, we propose augmenting neural\narchitectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we\nimplement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four\ntasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We\ndemonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts\nof training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and\ndrastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it\ntractable to prove guarantees about the overall system's behavior. Our\nexperience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn\nprogram semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Although many\ndecision-making problems like developing urban areas require such perception\nand reasoning, existing methods in this field usually neglect the deep\nknowledge mined from geographic databases and are based on pure statistical\nmethods. Due to the large volume of data gathered in spatial databases, and the\nuncertainty of spatial objects, mining association rules for high-level\nknowledge representation is a challenging task. Few algorithms manage\ngeographical and non-geographical data using topological relations. In this\npaper, a novel approach for spatial data mining based on the MOSES evolutionary\nframework is presented which improves the classic genetic programming approach.\nA hybrid architecture called GGeo is proposed to apply the MOSES mining rules\nconsidering fuzzy topological relations from spatial data. The uncertainty and\nfuzziness aspects are addressed using an enriched model of topological\nrelations by fuzzy region connection calculus. Moreover, to overcome the\nproblem of time-consuming fuzzy topological relationships calculations, this a\nnovel data pre-processing method is offered. GGeo analyses and learns from\ngeographical and non-geographical data and uses topological and distance\nparameters, and returns a series of arithmetic-spatial formulas as\nclassification rules. The proposed approach is resistant to noisy data, and all\nits stages run in parallel to increase speed. This approach may be used in\ndifferent spatial data classification problems as well as representing an\nappropriate method of data analysis and economic policy making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Exotic nuclei play a critical role in\nboth informing theoretical models as well as in our understanding of the origin\nof the heavy elements. Our purpose is to refine existing mass models through\nthe training of an artificial neural network that will mitigate the large model\ndiscrepancies far away from stability. The basic paradigm of our two-pronged\napproach is an existing mass model that captures as much as possible of the\nunderlying physics followed by the implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network\n(BNN) refinement to account for the missing physics. Bayesian inference is\nemployed to determine the parameters of the neural network so that model\npredictions may be accompanied by theoretical uncertainties. Despite the\nundeniable quality of the mass models adopted in this work, we observe a\nsignificant improvement (of about 40%) after the BNN refinement is implemented.\nIndeed, in the specific case of the Duflo-Zuker mass formula, we find that the\nrms deviation relative to experiment is reduced from rms =0.503MeV to rms=0.286\nMeV. These newly refined mass tables are used to map the neutron drip lines (or\nrather \"drip bands\") and to study a few critical r-process nuclei. The BNN\napproach is highly successful in refining the predictions of existing mass\nmodels. In particular, the large discrepancy displayed by the original \"bare\"\nmodels in regions where experimental data is unavailable is considerably\nquenched after the BNN refinement. This lends credence to our approach and has\nmotivated us to publish refined mass tables that we trust will be helpful for\nfuture astrophysical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In our algorithm, objects are first moved\nback iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively\nreduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear\ninitial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative\ndisplacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should\nundo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order\ninfrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in\nreal space.

The other mode of the posterior, dubbed the \"interacting\nneutrino mode\", corresponds to neutrino decoupling occurring within a narrow\nredshift window centered around $z_{\\nu,{\\rm dec}}\\sim8300$. This mode is\ncharacterized by a high value of the effective neutrino coupling constant,\ntogether with a lower value of the scalar spectral index and amplitude of\nfluctuations, and a higher value of the Hubble parameter.

The object's light\ndistribution is flat, as characterized by a low Sersic index ($n\\sim0.3$). It\nhas a low central $g$-band surface brightness of ${\\sim}26.4$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, large effective radius of ${\\sim}13^{\\prime\\prime}$ (${\\sim}11$\nkpc at $z=0.0431$ and ${\\sim}1.5$ kpc at $z=0.0055$), and an elongated\nmorphology ($b/a\\sim0.4$). Its red color ($g-i\\sim1$) is consistent with a\npassively evolving stellar population and similar to the nearby post-merger\ngalaxy, and we may see tidal material connecting Sumo Puff with this galaxy. We\noffer two possible interpretations for the nature of this object: (1) it is an\nextreme, galaxy-size tidal feature associated with a recent merger event, or\n(2) it is a foreground dwarf galaxy with properties consistent with a quenched,\ndisturbed ultra-diffuse galaxy. We present a qualitative comparison with\nsimulations that demonstrates the feasibility of forming a structure similar to\nthis object in a merger event. Follow-up spectroscopy and/or deeper imaging to\nconfirm the presence of the bridge of tidal material will be necessary to\nreveal the true nature of this object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 18:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

The computational studies of\nmembrane proteins are usually much more complicated than those of globular\nproteins. Here we propose a new continuum model for Poisson-Boltzmann\ncalculations of membrane channel proteins. Major improvements over the existing\ncontinuum slab model are as follows: 1) The location and thickness of the slab\nmodel are fine-tuned based on explicit-solvent MD simulations. 2) The highly\ndifferent accessibility in the membrane and water regions are addressed with a\ntwo-step, two-probe grid labeling procedure, and 3) The water pores/channels\nare automatically identified. The new continuum membrane model is optimized (by\nadjusting the membrane probe, as well as the slab thickness and center) to best\nreproduce the distributions of buried water molecules in the membrane region as\nsampled in explicit water simulations. Our optimization also shows that the\nwidely adopted water probe of 1.4 {\\AA} for globular proteins is a very\nreasonable default value for membrane protein simulations. It gives an overall\nminimum number of inconsistencies between the continuum and explicit\nrepresentations of water distributions in membrane channel proteins, at least\nin the water accessible pore/channel regions that we focus on. Finally, we\nvalidate the new membrane model by carrying out binding affinity calculations\nfor a potassium channel, and we observe a good agreement with experiment\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

CMEs tend to occur together with flares,\nradio storms, and bursts of energetic particles. On the Sun, CME-related mass\nloss is roughly an order of magnitude less intense than that of the background\nsolar wind. However, on other types of stars, CMEs have been proposed to carry\naway much more mass and energy than the time-steady wind. Earlier papers have\nused observed correlations between solar CMEs and flare energies, in\ncombination with stellar flare observations, to estimate stellar CME rates.\nThis paper sidesteps flares and attempts to calibrate a more fundamental\ncorrelation between surface-averaged magnetic fluxes and CME properties. For\nthe Sun, there exists a power-law relationship between the magnetic filling\nfactor and the CME kinetic energy flux, and it is generalized for use on other\nstars. An example prediction of the time evolution of wind/CME mass-loss rates\nfor a solar-mass star is given. A key result is that for ages younger than\nabout 1 Gyr (i.e., activity levels only slightly higher than the present-day\nSun), the CME mass loss exceeds that of the time-steady wind. At younger ages,\nCMEs carry 10 to 100 times more mass than the wind, and such high rates may be\npowerful enough to dispel circumstellar disks and affect the habitability of\nnearby planets. The cumulative CME mass lost by the young Sun may have been as\nmuch as 1% of a solar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

These fundamental and applied aspects of quantum information rely on\na crucial issue: the ability to characterize a quantum state from measurements,\nthrough a process called Quantum State Tomography (QST). However, QST requires\na large number of measurements, each derived from a different physical\nobservable corresponding to a different experimental setup. Unfortunately,\nchanging the setup results in unwanted changes to the data, prolongs the\nmeasurement and impairs the assumptions that are always made about the\nstationarity of the noise. Here, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by\nperforming QST with a single observable. A single observable can often be\nrealized by a single setup, thus considerably reducing the experimental effort.\nIn general, measurements of a single observable do not hold enough information\nto recover the quantum state. We overcome this lack of information by relying\non concepts inspired by Compressed Sensing (CS), exploiting the fact that the\nsought state - in many applications of quantum information - is close to a pure\nstate (and thus has low rank). Additionally, we increase the system dimension\nby adding an ancilla that couples to information evolving in the system,\nthereby providing more measurements, enabling the recovery of the original\nquantum state from a single-observable measurements. We demonstrate our\napproach on multi-photon states by recovering structured quantum states from a\nsingle observable, in a single experimental setup.

To interpret these findings, we\nneed to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population\ngenetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural selection and genetic drift.\nBecause many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and\ngenetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model\nthe genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing\nselection in a multi-dimensional trait space. We solve the model for the\nphenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust,\nclosed form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our\nresults provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it\nvaries among traits. They also predict that the distribution of variances\ncontributed by loci identified in GWAS is well approximated by a simple\nfunctional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution\nto genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test\nthis prediction against the results of GWAS for height and BMI and find that it\nfits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of\npleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to\nexplain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than\nsimilarly-sized GWAS for BMI, and to predict the increase in explained\nheritability with study sample size.

Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate\nchoice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to solution very close to\nthe minimum bandwidth consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 22:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

This puzzling behavior results from\nthe slight misalignment between the principal axes for the inertia and those\nfor the curvature; the misalignment couples the spinning with the pitching and\nthe rolling oscillations. It has been shown that under the no-slip condition\nand without dissipation the spin can reverse in both directions, and Garcia and\nHubbard obtained the formula for the time required for the spin reversal $t_r$\n[Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 418, 165-197 (1988) ]. In this work, we reformulate the\nrattleback dynamics in a physically transparent way and reduce it to a\nthree-variable dynamics for spinning, pitching, and rolling. We obtain an\nexpression of the Garcia-Hubbard formula for $t_r$ by a simple product of four\nfactors: (1) the misalignment angle, (2) the difference in the inverses of\ninertia moment for the two oscillations, (3) that in the radii for the two\nprincipal curvatures, and (4) the squared frequency of the oscillation. We\nperform extensive numerical simulations to examine validity and limitation of\nthe formula, and find that (1) the Garcia-Hubbard formula is good for both\nspinning directions in the small spin and small oscillation regime, but (2) in\nthe fast spin regime especially for the steady direction, the rattleback may\nnot reverse and shows a rich variety of dynamics including steady spinning,\nspin wobbling, and chaotic behavior reminiscent of chaos in a dissipative\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 22:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 00:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

To solve this problem, we propose a new\nCMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamically-partitioned cluster management\nmechanism and an utilization-fairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the\ncontainer-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one\napplication per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at\napplication runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application\ndirectly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for\nresources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead. Extensive\nperformance evaluations showed that Dorm could simultaneously increase the\nresource utilization by a factor of up to 2.32, reduce the fairness loss by a\nfactor of up to 1.52, and speed up popular distributed ML applications by a\nfactor of up to 2.72, compared to existing approaches.

Here, we report the discovery of quasiperiodic ordering in a thick\nlayer of elemental Sn grown on icosahedral ($i$)-Al-Pd-Mn. The STM images and\nthe LEED patterns of the Sn layer show specific structural signatures that\nportray quasiperiodicity but are distinct from the substrate. Photoemission\nspectroscopy reveals the existence of the pseudogap around the Fermi energy up\nto the maximal Sn thickness. The structure of the Sn layer is modeled as a\nnovel form of quasicrystalline clathrate on the basis of the following:\nFirstly, from ab-initio theory, the energy of bulk Sn clathrate quasicrystal is\nlower than the high temperature metallic $\\beta$-Sn phase, but higher than the\nlow temperature $\\alpha$-Sn phase. A comparative study of the free slab\nenergetics shows that surface energy favors clathrate over $\\alpha$-Sn up to\nabout 4 nm layer thickness, and matches $\\beta$-Sn for narrow window of slab\nthickness of 2-3 nm. Secondly, the bulk clathrate exhibits gap opening near\nFermi energy, while the free slab form exhibits a pronouced pseudogap, which\nexplains the pseudogap observed in photoemission. Thirdly, the STM images\nexhibit good agreement with clathrate model. We establish the adlayer-substrate\ncompatibility based on very similar (within 1%) the cage-cage separation in the\nSn clathrate and the pseudo-Mackay cluster-cluster separation on the\n$i$-Al-Pd-Mn surface. Furthermore, the nucleation centers of the Sn adlayer on\nthe substrate are identified and these are shown to be a valid part of the Sn\nclathrate structure. Thus, based on both experiment and theory, we propose that\n4 nm thick Sn adlayer deposited on 5-fold surface of $i$-Al-Pd-Mn substrate is\nin fact a metastable realization of elemental, clathrate family quasicrystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 11:38:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 13:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Meanwhile, also for the $s=1$\nHeisenberg KAFM evidence for the absence of magnetic long-range order (LRO) was\nfound. Magnetic LRO in Heisenberg KAFMs can emerge by increasing the spin\nquantum number $s$ to $s>1$ and for $s=1$ by an easy-plane anisotropy. In the\npresent paper we discuss the route to magnetic order in $s=1/2$ KAFMs by\nincluding an isotropic interlayer coupling (ILC) $J_\\perp$ as well as an\neasy-plane anisotropy in the kagome layers by using the coupled-cluster method\nto high orders of approximation. We consider ferro- as well as\nantiferromagnetic $J_\\perp$. To discuss the general question for the crossover\nfrom a purely two-dimensional (2D) to a quasi-2D and finally to a\nthree-dimensional system we consider the simplest model of stacked (unshifted)\nkagome layers. Although the ILC of real kagome compounds is often more\nsophisticated, such a geometry of the ILC can be relevant for barlowite. We\nfind that the spin-liquid ground state present for the strictly 2D $s=1/2$\n$XXZ$ KAFM survives a finite ILC, where the spin-liquid region shrinks\nmonotonously with increasing anisotropy. If the ILC becomes large enough (about\n15\\% of intralayer coupling for the isotropic Heisenberg case and about 4\\% for\nthe $XY$ limit) magnetic LRO can be established, where the $q=0$ symmetry is\nfavorable if $J_\\perp$ is of moderate strength.

In this thesis, a description is given of the development and\napplication of a new Numerical Relativity code, GRChombo. GRChombo uses the\nstandard BSSN formalism, incorporating full adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and\nmassive parallelism via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The AMR capability\npermits the study of physics which has previously been computationally\ninfeasible in a full 3+1 setting. The functionality of the code is described,\nits performance characteristics are demonstrated, and it is shown that it can\nstably and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as black hole mergers. We\nuse GRChombo to study the effects of inhomogeneous initial conditions on the\nrobustness of small and large field inflationary models. and investigate the\ncritical behaviour which occurs in the collapse of both spherically symmetric\nand asymmetric scalar field bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

That is, the planetary hot-spot is offset\nfrom the point of maximal heating (the substellar point) and may lead or lag\nthe forcing; the extent and sign of the offset is a function of both the\nrotation rate and orbital period of the planet. We also find that the system\nreaches a steady-state in the reference frame of the moving forcing. The model\nis an extension of the well studied Matsuno-Gill model into a full spherical\ngeometry and with a planetary-scale translating forcing representing the\ninsolation received on an exoplanet from a host star.\n  The speed of the gravity waves in the model is shown to be a key metric in\nevaluating the phase curve offset. If the velocity of the substellar point\n(relative to the planet's surface) exceeds that of the gravity waves then the\nhotspot will lag the substellar point, as might be expected by consideration of\nforced gravity wave dynamics. However, when the substellar point is moving\nslower than the internal wavespeed of the system the hottest point can lead the\npassage of the forcing. We provide an interpretation of this result by\nconsideration of the Rossby and Kelvin wave dynamics as well as, in the very\nslowly rotating case, a one-dimensional model that yields an analytic solution.\nFinally, we consider the inverse problem of constraining planetary rotation\nrate from an observed phase curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

We directly probe the twist directionality of\nliquid crystal director structures through experimental three-dimensional\nimaging and numerical minimization of the elastic free energy and show that\nspatially localized regions of handedness opposite to that of the chiral liquid\ncrystal ground state can arise in the proximity of twisted-soliton-bound\ntopological point defects.

We also describe a new spatially localized structure, dubbed a\n\"twistion\", in which a twisted solitonic three-dimensional director\nconfiguration is accompanied by four point defects.
