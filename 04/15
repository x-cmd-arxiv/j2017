To curb the high variance issue in off-policy TD learning, we propose a\nnew scheme of setting the $\\lambda$-parameters of TD, based on generalized\nBellman equations. Our scheme is to set $\\lambda$ according to the eligibility\ntrace iterates calculated in TD, thereby easily keeping these traces in a\ndesired bounded range. Compared with prior work, this scheme is more direct and\nflexible, and allows much larger $\\lambda$ values for off-policy TD learning\nwith bounded traces. As to its soundness, using Markov chain theory, we prove\nthe ergodicity of the joint state-trace process under nonrestrictive\nconditions, and we show that associated with our scheme is a generalized\nBellman equation (for the policy to be evaluated) that depends on both the\nevolution of $\\lambda$ and the unique invariant probability measure of the\nstate-trace process. These results not only lead immediately to a\ncharacterization of the convergence behavior of least-squares based\nimplementation of our scheme, but also prepare the ground for further analysis\nof gradient-based implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 16:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 20:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

Such problems make appearances in\nsociology and economics and, in this paper, we present a novel model to capture\nsuch decision-making processes and appeal to the classical multi-armed bandit\nframework to analyze it. Each individual, in addition to her own actions, can\nobserve the actions and rewards obtained by her neighbors, and can use all of\nthis information in order to minimize her own regret. We provide algorithms for\nthis setting, both for stochastic and adversarial bandits, and show that their\nregret smoothly interpolates between the regret in the classical bandit setting\nand that of the full-information setting as a function of the neighbors'\nexploration. In the stochastic setting the additional information must simply\nbe incorporated into the usual estimation of the rewards, while in the\nadversarial setting this is attained by constructing a new unbiased estimator\nfor the rewards and appropriately bounding the amount of additional information\nprovided by the neighbors. These algorithms are optimal up to log factors;\ndespite the fact that the agents act independently and selfishly, this implies\nthat it is an approximate Nash equilibria for all agents to use our algorithms.\nFurther, we show via empirical simulations that our algorithms, often\nsignificantly, outperform existing algorithms that one could apply to this\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 16:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

To do this, many fundamental concepts for\nmultivariate random variables (e.g., marginal variables, Gibbs distribution,\nMarkov properties) must be extended to other mathematical objects; it turns out\nthat this extension is possible, as we will discuss, if we have a consistent,\ncomplete system of projections on a given object. Each projection defines a\nmarginal random variable, allowing one to specify independence assumptions\nbetween them. Furthermore, these independencies can be specified in terms of a\nsmall subset of these marginal variables (which we call the atomic variables),\nallowing the compact representation of independencies by a directed graph.\nProjections also define factors, functions on the projected object space, and\nhence a projection family defines a set of possible factorizations for a\ndistribution; these can be compactly represented by an undirected graph.\n  The invariances used in graphical models are essential for learning\ndistributions, not just on multivariate random variables, but also on other\nobjects.

The local dark matter velocities\ncan therefore be inferred from observations of the stellar halo made by the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey within 4 kpc of the Sun. This empirical distribution\ndiffers from the Standard Halo Model in important ways and suggests that the\nbounds on the spin-independent scattering cross section may be weakened for\ndark matter masses below $\\sim$10 GeV.

The detection\nbox M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a\nsignificant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with M are suppressed. This\nprocess is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the\nalgorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads\nto a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays the\ndetection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap\nwith M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtains\nconsistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets like\nPASCAL VOC 2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% for\nR-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without any\nadditional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improves\nstate-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model.\nFurther, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditional\nNMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented.

To alleviate this severe limitation, we\npropose new designs of ultrathin nonlinear metasurfaces composed of patterned\ngraphene micro-ribbons to significantly enhance third harmonic generation (THG)\nat far-infrared and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The incident wave is tightly\nconfined and significantly boosted along the surface of graphene in these\nconfigurations due to the excitation of highly localized plasmons. The\nbandwidth of the resonant response becomes narrower due to the introduction of\na metallic substrate below the graphene micro-ribbons, which leads to zero\ntransmission and standing waves inside the intermediate dielectric spacer\nlayer. The enhancement of the incident field, combined with the large nonlinear\nconductivity of graphene, can dramatically increase the THG conversion\nefficiency by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the resonant frequency\nof the metasurface can be adjusted by dynamically tuning the Fermi energy of\ngraphene via electrical or chemical doping. As a result, the third harmonic\ngenerated wave can be optimized and tuned to be emitted at different\nfrequencies without the need to change the nonlinear metasurface geometry. The\nproposed nonlinear metasurfaces provide a new way to realize compact and\nefficient nonlinear sources at the far-infrared and THz frequency ranges, as\nwell as new frequency generation and wave mixing devices which are expected to\nbe useful for nonlinear THz spectroscopy and noninvasive THz imaging\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 18:04:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 13:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-24"}

For backwards analysis, we think of\nthe permutation as generated backwards, implying that the $i$th point in the\npermutation is picked uniformly at random from the $i$ points not picked yet in\nthe backwards direction. Backwards analysis has also been applied elegantly by\nChan to the randomized linear time minimum spanning tree algorithm of Karger,\nKlein, and Tarjan.\n  The question considered in this paper is how much randomness we need in order\nto trust the expected bounds obtained using backwards analysis, exactly and\napproximately. For the exact case, it turns out that a random permutation works\nif and only if it is minwise, that is, for any given subset, each element has\nthe same chance of being first.

As in previous slow growth approaches, the\nformulation assumes scale separation between the fast scales of turbulence and\nthe slow evolution of statistics such as the mean flow. This separation enables\nthe development of approaches where the fast scales of turbulence are directly\nsimulated while the forcing provided by the slow evolution is modeled. The\nresulting model admits periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise\ndirection, which avoids the need for extremely long domains and complex inflow\nconditions that typically accompany spatially developing simulations. Further,\nit enables the use of efficient Fourier numerics. Unlike previous approaches,\nthe present approach is based on a temporally evolving boundary layer and is\nspecifically tailored to give results for calibration and validation of RANS\nturbulence models. The use of a temporal homogenization simplifies the\nmodeling, enabling straightforward extension to flows with complicating\nfeatures, including cold and blowing walls. To generate data useful for\ncalibration and validation of RANS models, special care is taken to ensure that\nthe mean slow growth forcing is closed in terms of the mean and other\nquantities that appear in standard RANS models, ensuring that there is no\nconfounding between typical RANS closures and additional closures required for\nthe slow growth problem. The performance of the method is demonstrated on two\nproblems: an essentially incompressible, zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer\nand a transonic boundary layer over a cooled wall with wall transpiration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 18:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

This system can be shear banding\nand highly elastic, non-shear banding and moderately elastic, or nearly\nNewtonian as the temperature is varied over a narrow range. The effect of\nelasticity on transitions and instabilities is probed by changing the\ntemperature over a wide range of elasticity (El<< 1, El ~1, and El>>1).\nElasticity is defined as the ratio of the Weissenberg number to the Reynolds\nnumber. For shear banding wormlike micelle solutions where El>> 1, a primary\ntransition from the base Couette flow to stationary vortices that are evenly\nspaced in the axial direction of the shear cell and are characterized by an\nasymptotic wave-length is observed. The dimensionless wave- length at the onset\nof this shear banding transition for CTAB/NaSal system turns out to be much\nlarger than those reported for other shear banding wormlike micelle systems.\nFor the same fluid at a temperature where it shear-thins but does not display\nshear banding, El~1, and for slow ramp speeds, the primary transition is to\ndistinct structures that are not stationary but rather travel in the axial\ndirection. At low elasticity (El<< 1), where the fluid behaves as a nearly\nNewtonian fluid, several transitions from purely azimuthal Couette flow to\nmodified Taylor vortex flows and finally chaotic regimes are documented.

Kigami has laid the foundations of what is now known as analysis on\nfractals, by allowing the construction of an operator of the same nature of the\nLaplacian, defined locally, on graphs having a fractal character. The\nSierpinski gasket stands out of the best known example. It has, since then,\nbeen taken up, developed and popularized by R. S. Strichartz.\n  The Laplacian is obtained through a weak formulation, obtained by means of\nDirichlet forms, built by induction on a sequence of graphs that converges\ntowards the considered domain. It is these Dirichlet forms that enable one to\nobtain energy forms on this domain.\n  Yet, things are not that simple. If, for domains like the Sierpinski gasket,\nthe Laplacian is obtained in a quite natural way, one must bear in mind that\nDirichlet forms solely depend on the topology of the domain, and not of its\ngeometry. Which means that, if one aims at building a Laplacian on a fractal\ndomain, the topology of which is the same as, for instance, a line segment, one\nhas to find a way of taking account a very specific geometry. We came across\nthat problem in our work on the graph of the Weierstrass function The solution\nwas thus to consider energy forms more sophisticated than classical ones, by\nmeans of normalization constants that could, not only bear the topology, but,\nalso, the very specific geometry of, from now on, we will call W-curves.\n  We presently aim at investigating the links between energy forms and\ngeometry. We have chosen to consider fractal curves, specifically, the\nSierpi\\'nski arrowhead curve, the limit of which is the Sierpi\\'nski gasket.\nDoes one obtain the same Laplacian as for the triangle ?

While\npollution is a concern for all urban dwellers, cyclists are one of the most\nexposed groups due to their proximity to vehicle tailpipes. Consequently, new\nsolutions are required to help protect citizens, especially cyclists, from the\nharmful effects of exhaust-gas emissions. In this context, hybrid vehicles\n(HVs) offer new actuation possibilities that can be exploited in this\ndirection. More specifically, such vehicles when working together as a group,\nhave the ability to dynamically lower the emissions in a given area, thus\nbenefiting citizens, whilst still giving the vehicle owner the flexibility of\nusing an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). This paper aims to develop an\nalgorithm, that can be deployed in such vehicles, whereby geofences (virtual\ngeographic boundaries) are used to specify areas of low pollution around\ncyclists. The emissions level inside the geofence is controlled via a coin\ntossing algorithm to switch the HV motor into, and out of, electric mode, in a\nmanner that is in some sense optimal. The optimality criterion is based on how\npolluting vehicles inside the geofence are, and the expected density of\ncyclists near each vehicle. The algorithm is triggered once a vehicle detects a\ncyclist.

An EH receiver must harvest enough energy for\ndemodulating and decoding. The energy required depends upon factors, like code\nrate and signal-to-noise ratio, which can be adjusted dynamically. We consider\na receiver which harvests energy from ambient sources and the transmitter,\nmeaning the received signal is used for both EH and information decoding.\nAssuming a generalized function for energy consumption, we maximize the total\nnumber of information bits decoded, under both average and peak power\nconstraints at the transmitter, by carefully optimizing the power used for EH,\npower used for information transmission, fraction of time for EH, and code\nrate. For transmission over a single block, we find there exist problem\nparameters for which either maximizing power for information transmission or\nmaximizing power for EH is optimal. In the general case, the optimal solution\nis a tradeoff of the two. For transmission over multiple blocks, we give an\nupper bound on performance and give sufficient and necessary conditions to\nachieve this bound. Finally, we give some numerical results to illustrate our\nresults and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 05:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

The\nvision can be realized by peer-to-peer cooperative computing between edge\ndevices, referred to as co-computing. This paper considers a co-computing\nsystem where a user offloads computation of input-data to a helper. The helper\ncontrols the offloading process for the objective of minimizing the user's\nenergy consumption based on a predicted helper's CPU-idling profile that\nspecifies the amount of available computation resource for co-computing.\nConsider the scenario that the user has one-shot input-data arrival and the\nhelper buffers offloaded bits. The problem for energy-efficient co-computing is\nformulated as two sub-problems: the slave problem corresponding to adaptive\noffloading and the master one to data partitioning. Given a fixed offloaded\ndata size, the adaptive offloading aims at minimizing the energy consumption\nfor offloading by controlling the offloading rate under the deadline and buffer\nconstraints. By deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the\noptimal solution, we characterize the structure of the optimal policies and\npropose algorithms for computing the policies.

For genomic data, a well-known family of compressed\nfull-text index, called FM-indexes, presents unmatched performance in practice.\nOne major drawback of FM-indexes is that their locating operations, which\nreport all occurrence positions of patterns in a given text, are particularly\nslow, especially for the patterns with many occurrences.\n  Results: In this paper, we introduce a novel locating algorithm, FMtree, to\nfast retrieve all occurrence positions of any pattern via FM-indexes.

HSM models can be applied to collections of K\ndifferent contingency tables obtained from a set of p variables that are\nmeasured under different contexts. A context is defined by the measurement of a\nsubset of the p variables that are used to form a table. HSM models provide a\nrepresentation of the collection of K tables in a low dimensional vector space,\neven when no single joint probability distribution across the p variables\nexists. HSM models produce parameter estimates that provide a simple and\ninformative interpretation of the complex collection of tables. Comparisons of\nHSM model fits with Bayes net model fits are reported for a new large\nexperiment, demonstrating the viability of this new model. We conclude that the\nmodel is broadly applicable to social and behavioral science data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 11:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

The human brain is the elemental\nparadigm of an efficient robust modular system interconnected as a network of\nnetworks (NoN). Understanding the emergence of robustness in such modular\narchitectures from the interconnections of its parts is a long-standing\nchallenge that has concerned many scientists. Current models of dependencies in\nNoN inspired by the power grid express interactions among modules with fragile\ncouplings that amplify even small shocks, thus preventing functionality.\nTherefore, we introduce a model of NoN to shape the pattern of brain\nactivations to form a modular environment that is robust. The model predicts\nthe map of neural collective influencers (NCIs) in the brain, through the\noptimization of the influence of the minimal set of essential nodes responsible\nfor broadcasting information to the whole-brain NoN. Our results suggest new\nintervention protocols to control brain activity by targeting influential\nneural nodes predicted by network theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 11:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

This paper reports on an all-sky search for gravitational\nwaves (GWs) from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHBs).

No GWs from IMBHBs were detected, therefore, we\nconstrain the rate of several classes of IMBHB mergers.

This new derivative satisfies some\nproperties of integer-order calculus, e.g.\\ linearity, product rule, quotient\nrule, function composition and the chain rule. Besides as in the case of the\nCaputo derivative, the derivative of a constant is zero. Because Mittag-Leffler\nfunction is a natural generalization of the exponential function, we can extend\nsome of the classical results of integer-order calculus, namely: Rolle's\ntheorem, the mean value theorem and its extension. Further, when the order of\nthe derivative is $\\alpha=1$ and the parameter of the Mittag-Leffler function\nis also unitary, our definition is equivalent to the definition of the ordinary\nderivative of order one. Finally, we present the corresponding fractional\nintegral from which, as a natural consequence, new results emerge which can be\ninterpreted as applications. Specifically, we generalize the inversion property\nof the fundamental theorem of calculus and prove a theorem associated with the\nclassical integration by parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 20:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 01:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 19:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

If this\nspeed is chosen at each instant of a flight plan $h(x)$ giving altitude $h$ as\na function of distance $x$, a variational problem for finding an optimal $h(x)$\ncan be formulated and solved. It yields flight plans with maximal range, and\nthese turn out to consist of mainly three phases using the optimal speed:\nstarting with a climb at maximal continuous admissible thrust, ending with a\ncontinuous descent at idle thrust, and in between with a transition based on a\nsolution of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the variational problem. A similar\nvariational problem is derived and solved for speed-restricted flights, e.g. at\n250 KIAS below 10000 ft. In contrast to the literature, the approach of this\npaper does not need more than standard ordinary differential equations solving\nvariational problems to derive range-optimal trajectories.
