If the sensitivity between the two phases is close enough, their\nphase-difference is not-wrapped. The non-wrapped phase-difference as\nextended-range profilometry is well known and has been widely used.

Spatial unwrapping of the phase-sum is precluded for separate or\nhighly discontinuous objects.

Due to the non-linear nature of the\nextended 2-steps temporal-unwrapper, the harmonics and noise errors in the\nphase-difference do not propagate towards the unwrapping phase-sum.

This\nobservation is strengthened by the Higgs boson mass measurement at $\\sim 125$\nGeV which within supersymmetric models implies a large loop correction and a\nweak supersymmetry scale lying in the several TeV region. In addition if\nneutralino is the dark matter, its relic density puts further constraints on\nmodels often requiring coannihilation to reduce the neutralino relic density to\nbe consistent with experimental observation. The coannihilation in turn implies\nthat the mass gap between the LSP and the NLSP will be small leading to softer\nfinal states and making the observation of supersymmetry challenging. In this\nwork we investigate stau coannihilation models within supergravity grand\nunified models and the potential of discovery of such models at the LHC in the\npost Higgs boson discovery era. We utilize a variety of signal regions to\noptimize the discovery of supersymmetry in the stau coannihilation region. In\nthe analysis presented we impose the relic density constraint as well as the\nconstraint of the Higgs boson mass. The range of sparticle masses discoverable\nup to the optimal integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC is investigated. It is\nfound that the mass difference between the stau and the neutralino does not\nexceed $\\sim 20$ GeV over the entire mass range of the models explored. Thus\nthe discovery of a supersymmetric signal arising from the stau coannihilation\nregion will also provide a measurement of the neutralino mass. The direct\ndetection of neutralino dark matter is analyzed within the class of stau\ncoannihilation models investigated.

The contextual information of the sentence, as well\nas visual cues from the video, are important to infer the missing word\naccurately. Since the source sentence is broken into two fragments: the\nsentence's left fragment (before the blank) and the sentence's right fragment\n(after the blank), traditional Recurrent Neural Networks cannot encode this\nstructure accurately because of many possible variations of the missing word in\nterms of the location and type of the word in the source sentence. For example,\na missing word can be the first word or be in the middle of the sentence and it\ncan be a verb or an adjective. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle\nthe textual encoding: Two separate LSTMs (the LR and RL LSTMs) are employed to\nencode the left and right sentence fragments and a novel structure is\nintroduced to combine each fragment with an \"external memory\" corresponding the\nopposite fragments. For the visual encoding, end-to-end spatial and temporal\nattention models are employed to select discriminative visual representations\nto find the missing word.

The RG-flow for such a walk on a dual\nSierpinski gasket and a Migdal-Kadanoff hierarchical network is obtained\nexplicitly from elementary algebraic manipulations, after transforming the\nunitary evolution equation into Laplace space.

In\nparticular, we calculate the probability of the walk to overlap with its\nstarting position, which oscillates with a period that scales as\n$N^{d_{w}^{Q}/d_{f}}$ with system size $N$. While the largest Jacobian\neigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ of the RG-flow merely reproduces the fractal\ndimension, $d_{f}=\\log_{2}\\lambda_{1}$, the asymptotic analysis shows that the\nsecond Jacobian eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}$ becomes essential to determine the\ndimension of the quantum walk via\n$d_{w}^{Q}=\\log_{2}\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}}$.

A joint effort utilizing simulations from the Composite\nNon-hydrostatic Quasi-Geostrophic model (CNH-QGM) and direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of the incompressible fluid equations has mapped a wide range\nof the Rayleigh number $Ra$ - Ekman number $E$ parameter space within the\ngeostrophic regime of rotating convection. Corroboration of the $Nu$-$Ra$\nrelation at $E = 10^{-7}$ from both methods along with higher $E$ covered by\nDNS and lower $E$ by the asymptotic model allows for this range of the heat\ntransfer results. For stress-free boundaries, the relation $Nu-1 \\propto (Ra\nE^{4/3} )^{\\alpha} $ has the dissipation-free scaling of $\\alpha = 3/2$ for all\n$E \\leq 10^{-7}$. This is directly related to a geostrophic turbulent interior\nthat throttles the heat transport supplied to the thermal boundary layers.

Reducibility\ncan be abstracted away from the Feynman integral to just being a condition on\ntwo polynomials, the first and second Symanzik polynomials. These polynomials\ncan be defined from graphs, and thus reducibility is a property of graphs. We\nprove that for a fixed number of external momenta and no masses, reducibility\nis graph minor closed, correcting the previously claimed proofs of this fact.

Channel estimation for\none-bit massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the severe distortion caused\nby the coarse quantization. It was shown in previous studies that an extremely\nlong training sequence is required to attain an acceptable performance. In this\npaper, we study the problem of optimal one-bit quantization design for channel\nestimation in one-bit massive MIMO systems. Our analysis reveals that, if the\nquantization thresholds are optimally devised, using one-bit ADCs can achieve\nan estimation error close to (with an increase by a factor of $\\pi/2$) that of\nan ideal estimator which has access to the unquantized data. The optimal\nquantization thresholds, however, are dependent on the unknown channel\nparameters. To cope with this difficulty, we propose an adaptive quantization\n(AQ) approach in which the thresholds are adaptively adjusted in a way such\nthat the thresholds converge to the optimal thresholds, and a random\nquantization (RQ) scheme which randomly generate a set of nonidentical\nthresholds based on some statistical prior knowledge of the channel. Simulation\nresults show that, our proposed AQ and RQ schemes, owing to their wisely\ndevised thresholds, present a significant performance improvement over the\nconventional fixed quantization scheme that uses a fixed (typically zero)\nthreshold, and meanwhile achieve a substantial training overhead reduction for\nchannel estimation. In particular, even with a moderate number of pilot symbols\n(about 5 times the number of users), the AQ scheme can provide an achievable\nrate close to that of the perfect channel state information (CSI) case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 01:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

Taking practical constraints into\nconsideration, we propose a novel approach to distributed flocking control of\nnonholonomic mobile robots by bounded feedback. The flocking control objectives\nconsist of velocity consensus, collision avoidance, and cohesion maintenance\namong mobile robots. A flocking control protocol which is based on the\ninformation of neighbor mobile robots is constructed.

The transmitted signal passes through a beamforming network with\nhigh-spatial resolution to produce multiple parallel branches. Each branch\ntransmits signal towards one direction thus it is affected by one dominant DFO\nwhen passing over the time-varying channel. Therefore, we can compensate the\nDFO for each branch at the transmitter previously. Theoretical analysis for the\nDoppler spread of the equivalent uplink channel is also conducted. It is found\nthat when the number of transmit antennas is sufficiently large, the\ntime-variation of channel can be efficiently suppressed.

A particularly\npopular metric that has been proposed is to measure the relatedness of two sets\nby treating the elements as vertices of a bipartite graph and calculating the\nscore of the maximum matching pairing between elements. Compared to other\nmetrics which require exact matchings between elements, this metric uses a\nsimilarity function to compare elements between the two sets, making it robust\nto small dissimilarities in elements and more useful for real-world, dirty\ndata. Unfortunately, the metric suffers from expensive computational cost,\ntaking O(n^3) time, where n is the number of elements in sets, for each\nset-to-set comparison. Thus for applications which try to search for all\npairings of related sets in a brute-force manner, the runtime becomes\nunacceptably large.\n  To address this challenge, we developed SilkMoth, a system capable of rapidly\ndiscovering related set pairs in collections of sets. Internally, SilkMoth\ncreates a signature for each set, with the property that any other set which is\nrelated must match the signature. SilkMoth then uses these signatures to prune\nthe search space, so only sets which match the signatures are left as\ncandidates. Finally, SilkMoth applies the maximum matching metric on remaining\ncandidates to verify which of these candidates are truly related sets. Thus, a\ncontribution of this paper is the characterization of the space of signatures\nwhich enable this property. We show that selecting the optimal signature in\nthis space is NP-complete, and based on insights from the characterization of\nthe space, we propose two novel filters which help to prune the candidates\nfurther before verification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 09:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 18:10:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 02:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

Uncalibrated\nvariations of the basic angle may produce systematic errors in the computed\nparallaxes. We examine the coupling between a global parallax shift and\nspecific variations of the basic angle, namely those related to the satellite\nattitude with respect to the Sun. The changes in observables produced by small\nperturbations of the basic angle, attitude, and parallaxes are calculated\nanalytically. We then look for a combination of perturbations that has no net\neffect on the observables. In the approximation of infinitely small fields of\nview, it is shown that certain perturbations of the basic angle are\nobservationally indistinguishable from a global shift of the parallaxes. If\nsuch perturbations exist, they cannot be calibrated from the astrometric\nobservations but will produce a global parallax bias. Numerical simulations of\nthe astrometric solution, using both direct and iterative methods, confirm this\ntheoretical result. For a given amplitude of the basic angle perturbation, the\nparallax bias is smaller for a larger basic angle and a larger solar aspect\nangle. In both these respects Gaia has a more favourable geometry than\nHipparcos. In the case of Gaia, internal metrology is used to monitor basic\nangle variations. Additionally, Gaia has the advantage of detecting numerous\nquasars, which can be used to verify the parallax zero point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 15:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}
