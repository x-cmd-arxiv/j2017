The goal is\nto locate n points (e.g., facilities or persons) in a k-dimensional polytope,\nso that they are far away from each other and from the boundary of the\npolytope. In many real-world scenarios however, the points arrive and depart at\ndifferent times, and decisions must be made without knowing future events.\nTherefore we study, for the first time in the literature, the online dispersion\nproblem in Euclidean space.\n  There are two natural objectives when time is involved: the all-time\nworst-case (ATWC) problem tries to maximize the minimum distance that ever\nappears at any time; and the cumulative distance (CD) problem tries to maximize\nthe integral of the minimum distance throughout the whole time interval.\nInterestingly, the online problems are highly non-trivial even on a segment.\nFor cumulative distance, this remains the case even when the problem is\ntime-dependent but offline, with all the arriving and departure times given in\nadvance.\n  For the online ATWC problem on a segment, we construct a deterministic\npolynomial-time algorithm which is (2ln2+epsilon)-competitive, where epsilon>0\ncan be arbitrarily small and the algorithm's running time is polynomial in\n1/epsilon. We show this algorithm is actually optimal.

In order to address such issues, we\nstudy the following variant of the traditional ranking problem when, in\naddition, there are fairness or diversity constraints. Given a collection of\nitems along with 1) the value of placing an item in a particular position in\nthe ranking, 2) the collection of sensitive attributes (such as gender, race,\npolitical opinion) of each item and 3) a collection of constraints that, for\neach k, bound the number of items with each attribute that are allowed to\nappear in the top k positions of the ranking, the goal is to output a ranking\nthat maximizes the value with respect to the original rank quality metric while\nrespecting the constraints.

This is true for chaos in the sense of Devaney [1], Li-Yorke [2] and\nthe one obtained through period-doubling cascade [3]. Countable number of\nperiodic orbits exist in any neighborhood of a structurally stable Poincar\\'{e}\nhomoclinic orbit, which can be considered as a criterion for the presence of\ncomplex dynamics [4]-[6]. It was certified by Shilnikov [7] and Seifert [8]\nthat it is possible to replace periodic solutions by Poisson stable or almost\nperiodic motions in a chaotic attractor. Despite the fact that the idea of\nreplacing periodic solutions by other types of regular motions is attractive,\nvery few results have been obtained on the subject. The present study\ncontributes to the chaos theory in that direction.\n  In this paper, we take into account chaos both through a cascade of almost\nperiodic solutions and in the sense of Li-Yorke such that the original Li-Yorke\ndefinition is modified by replacing infinitely many periodic motions with\nalmost periodic ones, which are separated from the motions of the scrambled\nset. The theoretical results are valid for systems with arbitrary high\ndimensions. Formation of the chaos is exemplified by means of unidirectionally\ncoupled Duffing oscillators. The controllability of the extended chaos is\ndemonstrated numerically by means of the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke [9] control\ntechnique.

With SC, requesters outsource their spatiotemporal tasks to a set\nof workers, who will perform the tasks by physically traveling to the tasks'\nlocations. This chapter identifies privacy threats toward both workers and\nrequesters during the two main phases of spatial crowdsourcing, tasking and\nreporting. Tasking is the process of identifying which tasks should be assigned\nto which workers. This process is handled by a spatial crowdsourcing server\n(SC-server). The latter phase is reporting, in which workers travel to the\ntasks' locations, complete the tasks and upload their reports to the SC-server.\nThe challenge is to enable effective and efficient tasking as well as reporting\nin SC without disclosing the actual locations of workers (at least until they\nagree to perform a task) and the tasks themselves (at least to workers who are\nnot assigned to those tasks). This chapter aims to provide an overview of the\nstate-of-the-art in protecting users' location privacy in spatial\ncrowdsourcing. We provide a comparative study of a diverse set of solutions in\nterms of task publishing modes (push vs. pull), problem focuses (tasking and\nreporting), threats (server, requester and worker), and underlying technical\napproaches (from pseudonymity, cloaking, and perturbation to exchange-based and\nencryption-based techniques).

Boundary first\nflattening (BFF) is a linear method for conformal parameterization which is\nfaster than traditional linear methods, yet provides control and quality\ncomparable to sophisticated nonlinear schemes. The key insight is that the\nboundary data for many conformal mapping problems can be efficiently\nconstructed via the Cherrier formula together with a pair of Poincare-Steklov\noperators; once the boundary is known, the map can be easily extended over the\nrest of the domain. Since computation demands only a single factorization of\nthe real Laplace matrix, the amortized cost is about 50x less than any\npreviously published technique for boundary-controlled conformal flattening.

The principle we suggested for maximizing the former is the\ndesign risk minimization principle, while the neural transfer function, the\ncost function, as well as pretreatment of samples, are endowed with the role\nfor maximizing the latter. The role of the neuron bias is explained from a\ndifferent angle. We develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to establish the\ninput-output responses, and we control the input-output sensitivity of a\nlearning machine by controlling that of individual neurons. Applications of\nfunction approaching and smoothing, pattern recognition and classification, are\nprovided to illustrate how to train general learning machines based on our\ntheory and algorithm. Our method may in addition induce new applications, such\nas the transductive inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2017 05:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

Imitation of human behavior requires a\nviewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between\nend-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes,\nand body pose. We train our representations using a metric learning loss, where\nmultiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the\nembedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often\nvisually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model\nsimultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking\nimages, and what is different between similar-looking images. This signal\ncauses our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint,\nbut do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as\nocclusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this\nrepresentation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an\nexplicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a\nreinforcement learning algorithm. While representations are learned from an\nunlabeled collection of task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring\nare learned by watching a single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward\nfunctions obtained by following the human demonstrations under the learned\nrepresentation enable efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for\nreal-world robotic systems.

Also, the impact of different factors on the expected\noverall profit of a WOM marketing campaign is uncovered experimentally. On this\nbasis, some promotion strategies are suggested. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time a WOM marketing campaign is treated this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2017 13:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

A program named Smart City Mission has been started for this\npurpose. With an extremely diverse population, that is only second to China in\nthe world in terms of size, the Indian government has engaged in serious\nthinking for a better city planning and providing numerous opportunities for\nthe citizenry.
